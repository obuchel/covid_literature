13606,RNA and the PIEZO force sensor,2020-09-03,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and management of recurrent periocular sebaceous gland carcinoma at a tertiary ocular oncology service in the United Kingdom. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 62 patients with sebaceous gland carcinoma treated between 2004 and 2017. A total of 10 eyes were treated for local recurrence. The following variables were recorded: age and sex of patient; tumour location, histological subtype; recurrence type; treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 62 cases with eyelid SGC, 10 (16%) had recurrences during the study period and satisfied inclusion criteria. There were six (60%) females and four males in the recurrent group. The mean time interval between initial excision and tumour recurrence was 37 months (median 23 months; range 4 to 84 months). Four patients received cryotherapy to the lids and conjunctiva to control recurrent disease and two patients were treated with topical or intralesional chemotherapy. Four patients (40%) underwent orbital exenteration during the study period. Metastasis occurred in 20% over a mean follow-up of 113 months (median 106; range 47–184 months). CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors for local recurrence of SGC after wide excision with paraffin section control were reported, and an approach to these recurrent lesions was proposed. The results of this study will help guide surgeons dealing with the medical and surgical conundrum of recurrent disease. The risk of recurrence is highest in the first 2 years after initial excision.","McGrath, Lindsay A.; Currie, Zanna I.; Mudhar, Hardeep Singh; Tan, Jennifer H.

22046,SARS-COV-2 related myocardial injury might explain the predisposition to preeclampsia with maternal SARS-COV-2 infection,2021-10-05,"The Libri Picturati includes a collection of plant illustrations from seventeenth century Dutch Brazil that is kept in the Jagiellonian library in Krakow since World War II. While many studies focused on the artistic details and history of these images, we identified the flora depicted. We used contemporary textual sources (e.g., Historia Naturalis Brasiliae), monographs and taxonomist’ assessments. We checked origin, life form, domestication and conservation status and the plant parts that are represented. We identified 198 taxa, consisting mostly of wild, native rainforest trees and 35 introduced species. Fertile branches are the most represented, although some loose dry fruits and sterile material were also painted, which sheds light into the collection methods by naturalists in Dutch Brazil. Several species are no longer abundant or have become invasive due to anthropogenic influences since colonialism. Through this botanical iconography, we traced the first records of the sunflower and the Ethiopian pepper in Brazil, as well as the dispersion and assimilation of the flora encountered in the colony by Indigenous, African and European peoples. We emphasized the relevance of combining visual and textual sources when studying natural history collections and we highlighted how digitalization makes these artistic and scientific collections more accessible.","Alcàntara-Rodríguez, Mireia; Françozo, Mariana; Van Andel, Tinde",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8492696/,721

Bei der Diagnosestellung spielen Ultraschall und CT die Hauptrolle, bei Bedarf ergänzt durch ERCP/MRCP. Die Diagnostik von Grund- und Begleiterkrankungen ist für Prognose und kuratives Vorgehen oft entscheidend. Antibiotische Therapie und perkutane Drainage bilden die Hauptsäulen der Behandlung, ein chirurgisches Vorgehen ist besonders im Rahmen der Sanierung von Grunderkrankungen und bei therapierefraktären Fällen notwendig. Die Leberblutung ist eine klassische Komplikation des Leberzelladenoms, tritt aber auch bei anderen Lebertumoren (z. B. hepatozelluläres oder cholangiozelluläres Karzinom) auf. Oft wird die Diagnose bei einer Ultraschalluntersuchung im Schockraum gestellt; wenn genügend Zeit vorhanden ist, kommt eine CT zur weiteren Diagnostik infrage.

32438,Has India met this enemy before? From an eternal optimist’s perspective: SARS-CoV-2,2020-04-30,"Personalized recommendation has yield immense success in predicting user preference with heterogeneous implicit feedback (HIF), i.e., various user behaviors. However, existing studies consider less about the temporal dynamics and repeated patterns of HIF. They simply suppose: (1) a hard rule among user behaviors (e.g., add-to-cart must come before purchase and after view); (2) merge repeated behaviors into one (e.g., view several times is considered as view once only), thus failing to unveil user preferences from their real behaviors. To ease these issues, we, therefore, propose a novel end-to-end neural framework – TDRB, which automatically models the Temporal Dynamics and Repeated Behaviors to assist in capturing user preference, thus achieving more accurate recommendations. Empirical studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TDRB against other state-of-the-arts.","Zhou, Xin; Sun, Zhu; Guo, Guibing; Liu, Yuan",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206290/,721

51530,The initial infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of the disease: possible impact on the incubation period,2021-04-14,"The merger of wireless sensor technologies, pervasive computing, and biomedical engineering has resulted in the emergence of wireless body sensor network (WBSN). WBSNs assist human beings in various monitoring applications such as health-care, entertainment, rehabilitation systems, and sports. Life-critical health-care applications of WBSNs consider both reliability and delay as major Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In addition to the common limitations and challenges of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), WBSNs pose distinct constraints due to the behavior and chemistry of the human body. The biomedical sensor nodes (BMSNs) adopt multihop communication while reporting the heterogeneous natured physiological parameters to the nearby base station also called local coordinator. Routing in WBSNs becomes a challenging job due to the necessary QoS considerations, overheated in-body BMSNs, and high and dynamic path loss. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing routing protocols integrate the aforementioned issues in their designs. In this research work, a multiconstraint-aware routing mechanism (modular-based) is proposed which considers the QoS parameters, dynamic and high path loss, and the overheated nodes issue. Two types of network frameworks, with and without relay/forwarder nodes, are being used. The data packets containing physiological parameters of the human body are categorized into delay-constrained, reliability-constrained, critical (both delay- and reliability-constrained), and nonconstrained data packets. NS-2 is being used to carry out the simulations of the proposed mechanism. The simulation results reveal that the proposed mechanism has improved the QoS-aware routing for WBSNs by adopting the proposed multiconstraint-aware strategy.","Bangash, Javed Iqbal; Khan, Abdul Waheed; Khan, Asfandyar; Khan, Atif; Uddin, M.

52333,A Case of Hypocalcemia Secondary to Infection With SARS-CoV-2 Virus,2021-05-03,"Objective: Porphyromonas gulae, a major periodontal pathogen in animals, possesses fimbriae that have been classified into three genotypes (A, B, C) based on the diversity of fimA genes encoding fimbrillin protein (FimA). P. gulae strains with type C fimbriae were previously shown to be more virulent than other types. In this study, we further examined the host toxicity mediated by P. gulae fimbriae by constructing recombinant FimA (rFimA) expression vectors for each genotype and raised antibodies to the purified proteins. Methods and Results: All larvae died within 204 h following infection with P. gulae type C at the low-dose infection, whereas type A and B did not. Among fimA types, the survival rates of the larvae injected with rFimA type C were remarkably decreased, while the survival rates of the larvae injected with rFimA type A and type B were greater than 50%. Clindamycin treatment inhibited the growth of type C strains in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an increased rate of silkworm survival. Finally, type C rFimA-speciﬁc antiserum prolonged the survival of silkworm larvae stimulated by infection with P. gulae type C strain or injection of rFimA type C protein. Conclusion: These results suggested that type C fimbriae have high potential for enhancement of bacterial pathogenesis, and that both clindamycin and anti-type C rFimA-specific antibodies are potent inhibitors of type C fimbriae-induced toxicity. This is the first report to establish a silkworm infection model using P. gulae for toxicity assessment.","Yoshida, Sho; Inaba, Hiroaki; Nomura, Ryota; Murakami, Masaru; Yasuda, Hidemi; Nakano, Kazuhiko; Matsumoto-Nakano, Michiyo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079003/,721
52334,Early Follow-up of Atypical Thyroiditis Induced by SARS-CoV-2,2021-05-03,"Background: Coronavirus (CoV) is an emerging human pathogen causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) around the world. Earlier identification of biomarkers for SARS can facilitate detection and reduce the mortality rate of the disease. Thus, by integrated network analysis and structural modeling approach, we aimed to explore the potential drug targets and the candidate drugs for coronavirus medicated SARS. Methods: Differentially expression (DE) analysis of CoV infected host genes (HGs) expression profiles was conducted by using the Limma. Highly integrated DE-CoV-HGs were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: Using the Walktrap algorithm highly interconnected modules include module 1 (202 nodes); module 2 (126 nodes) and module 3 (121 nodes) modules were retrieved from the PPI network. MYC, HDAC9, NCOA3, CEBPB, VEGFA, BCL3, SMAD3, SMURF1, KLHL12, CBL, ERBB4, and CRKL were identified as potential drug targets (PDTs), which are highly expressed in the human respiratory system after CoV infection. Functional terms growth factor receptor binding, c-type lectin receptor signaling, interleukin-1 mediated signaling, TAP dependent antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, stimulatory T cell receptor signaling, and innate immune response signaling pathways, signal transduction and cytokine immune signaling pathways were enriched in the modules. Protein-protein docking results demonstrated the strong binding affinity (-314.57 kcal/mol) of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex which was selected as a drug target. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated the structural stability and flexibility of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex. Further, Wortmannin was proposed as a candidate drug to ERBB4 to control SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis through inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent macropinocytosis, MAPK signaling, and NF-kb singling pathways that regulate host cell entry, replication, and modulation of the host immune system. Conclusion: We conclude that CoV drug target “ERBB4” and candidate drug “Wortmannin” provide insights on the possible personalized therapeutics for emerging COVID-19.","Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Kaliamurthi, Satyavani; Peslherbe, Gilles H.; Wei, Dong-Qing",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8080978/,721
55937,When success means focusing on the oxygen delivery. A case of conventional management of severe hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Presently, persons with diabetes are classified as having type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on clinical diagnosis. However, adult patients exhibit diverse clinical representations and this makes treatment approaches challenging to personalize. A recent Scandinavian study proposed a novel classification of adult diabetes into five clusters based on disease pathophysiology and risk of vascular complications. The current study aimed to characterize new subgroups of adult diabetes using this strategy in a defined population from northern Ukraine. METHODS: We analyzed 2,140 patients with established diabetes from the DOLCE study (n = 887 with new-onset diabetes and n = 1,253 with long duration). We used the k-means approach to perform clustering analyses using BMI, age at onset of diabetes, HbA(1c), insulin secretion (HOMA2-B), and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) indices and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) levels. Risks of macro- (myocardial infarction or stroke) and microvascular [retinopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and neuropathy] complications and associations of genetic variants with specific clusters were studied using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration. RESULTS: Severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID, 11 and 6%) and severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD, 25 and 14%) clusters were twice as prevalent in patients with long-term as compared to those with new-onset diabetes. Patients with long duration in both SAID and SIDD clusters had highest risks of proliferative retinopathy, and elevated risks of CKD. Long-term insulin-resistant obese diabetes 1 (IROD1) subgroup had elevated risks of CKD, while insulin-resistant obese diabetes 2 (IROD2) cluster exhibited the highest HOMA2-B, lowest HbA(1c), and lower prevalence of all microvascular complications as compared to all other clusters. Genetic analyses of IROD2 subgroup identified reduced frequency of the risk alleles in the TCF7L2 gene as compared to all other clusters, cumulatively and individually (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The novel reclassification algorithm of patients with adult diabetes was reproducible in this population from northern Ukraine. It may be beneficial for the patients in the SIDD subgroup to initiate earlier insulin treatment or other anti-diabetic modalities to preserve β-cell function. Long-term diabetes cases with preserved β-cell function and lower risk for microvascular complications represent an interesting subgroup of patients for further investigations of protective mechanisms.","Fedotkina, Olena; Sulaieva, Oksana; Ozgumus, Turkuler; Cherviakova, Liubov; Khalimon, Nadiya; Svietleisha, Tetiana; Buldenko, Tetiana; Ahlqvist, Emma; Asplund, Olof; Groop, Leif; Nilsson, Peter M.; Lyssenko, Valeriya",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283002/,721

59313,MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis after the Pfizer/BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,2021-09-28,"Operational processes in the care sector are becoming increasingly digitalized due to rising workload. Insufficient involvement of caregivers in this digitalization process results in poorly integrated technological developments along with a lack of technology acceptance. Therefore, in order to lay a firm foundation for successful technology development, it is utmost essential to understand the intention of professionals to use technology in outpatient care. This paper develops a model that outlines the factors influencing the intention of caregivers to use digital technologies in outpatient care, based on a case study examining the introduction of a textile sensor mat. In the developed model, the care situation is investigated for the first time as a factor influencing the intention to use digital technologies, in addition to technology acceptance. Apart from deriving the factors of the model and inspecting the strength of their influences, the practical relevance for technology developers in other care contexts is also determined. Practical Relevance: Demographic change in the German population is leading to major challenges in various sectors. Specifically, in the outpatient care sector, which is already severely affected by a shortage of skilled workers, this change is particularly noticeable with an increase in patients and a high workload for caregivers. Therefore, digital technologies are increasingly being used to make the daily work of caregivers easier in terms of physical and psychological factors. The model developed in this study describes—based on a case study on the introduction of a textile sensor mat—conducive and obstructive factors for the introduction of technology in outpatient care and thus contributes to successful digitalization in this field.","Güsken, Sarah Ranjana; Frings, Katrin; Zafar, Faizan; Saltan, Timur; Fuchs-Frohnhofen, Paul; Bitter-Krahe, Jan",Z Arbeitswiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513561/,721
60371,"The association of B blood group with SARS-CoV-2-induced death in Babol, north of Iran.",2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND Schools, depending on their access to and quality of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and the implementation of healthy behaviours, can be critical for the control and spread of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Schools provide opportunities for pupils to learn about the importance of hygiene and WASH-related practice, and build healthy habits and skills, with beneficial medium- and long-term consequences particularly in low- and middle-income countries: reducing pupils' absenteeism due to diseases, promoting physical, mental and social health, and improving learning outcomes. WASH services alone are often not sufficient and need to be combined with educational programmes. As pupils disseminate their acquired health-promoting knowledge to their (extended) families, improved WASH provisions and education in schools have beneficial effects also on the community. International organisations frequently roll out interventions in schools to improve WASH services and, in some cases, train pupils and teachers on safe WASH behaviours. How such interventions relate to local school education on WASH, health promotion and disease prevention knowledge, whether and how such knowledge and school books are integrated into WASH education interventions in schools, are knowledge gaps we fill. METHODS We analyzed how Kenyan primary school science text book content supports WASH and health education by a book review including books used from class 1 through class 8, covering the age range from 6 to 13 years. We then conducted a rapid literature review of combined WASH interventions that included a behaviour change or educational component, and a rapid review of international policy guidance documents to contextualise the results and understand the relevance of books and school education for WASH interventions implemented by international organisations. We conducted a content analysis based on five identified thematic categories, including drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, environmental hygiene & health promotion and disease risks, and mapped over time the knowledge about WASH and disease prevention. RESULTS The books comprehensively address drinking water issues, including sources, quality, treatment, safe storage and water conservation; risks and transmission pathways of various waterborne (Cholera, Typhoid fever), water-based (Bilharzia), vector-related (Malaria) and other communicable diseases (Tuberculosis); and the importance of environmental hygiene and health promotion. The content is broadly in line with internationally recommended WASH topics and learning objectives. Gaps remain on personal hygiene and handwashing, including menstrual hygiene, sanitation education, and related health risks and disease exposures. The depth of content varies greatly over time and across the different classes. Such locally available education materials already used in schools were considered by none of the WASH education interventions in the considered intervention studies. CONCLUSIONS The thematic gaps/under-representations in books that we identified, namely sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene education, are all high on the international WASH agenda, and need to be filled especially now, in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnects exist between school book knowledge and WASH education interventions, between policy and implementation, and between theory and practice, revealing missed opportunities for effective and sustainable behaviour change, and underlining the need for better integration. Considering existing local educational materials and knowledge may facilitate the buy-in and involvement of teachers and school managers in strengthening education and implementing improvements. We suggest opportunities for future research, behaviour change interventions and decision-making to improve WASH in schools.","Anthonj, Carmen; Githinji, Sophie; Höser, Christoph; Stein, Alfred; Blanford, Justine; Grossi, Valentina",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004452/,721

METHOD A total of 578 Greek-Cypriots aged 60-91 years were recruited from the Neurocognitive Study on Aging. Of those, 395 healthy participants (171 males and 224 females) who met all study criteria were retained. They completed measures of executive functioning, working memory, receptive vocabulary and confrontational naming in addition to the WHOQOL-BREF (brief version of the WHO QoL questionnaire). RESULTS There were modest but significant relationships between executive functioning, working memory, vocabulary measures and the WHOQOL-BREF (p < 0.01). MANOVA yielded significant gender and education effects on QoL. Sequential stepwise regression confirmed that gender, depression scores and years of education made significant contributions to predicting the total score on WHOQOL-BREF and accounted for 31% of the variance (R² = 0.310). CONCLUSION Self-reports of QoL remain stable in older adulthood. Demographic variables such as gender and years of education affected several domains of QoL, and, along with depression symptomatology, accounted for a significant part of the WHOQOL-BREF variance. Cognitive-linguistic measures correlated on the physical and psychological health domains of the WHOQOL-BREF in healthy older adults.","Constantinidou, Fofi; Prokopiou, Juliana; Nikou, Maria; Papacostas, Savvas",Folia phoniatrica et logopaedica : official organ of the International Association of Logopedics and Phoniatrics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000440835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26789266/,721

Complications may have serious consequences. There is a need for a more reliable, precise, and less traumatic procedure that overcomes the known complications from existing techniques. We analyzed a new epiphysiodesis technique using radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in a porcine model. METHODS Six 35-kg and two 25-kg immature pigs were used. 1 hind leg of each animal was randomly selected and the proximal tibia growth plate was ablated laterally and medially. The contralateral leg was used as a control. MR images were obtained immediately after the ablation and 12 weeks later for 6 animals, and 24 weeks later for the other 2 animals. CT was done for the 2 animals that were followed for 24 weeks for proof of bone bridges. RESULTS Both tibias were equal in length initially. At the 12-week follow-up, there was an average leg length discrepancy of 3.9 mm (95% CI: 3.0-4.8), and at 24 weeks the difference was 8.4 mm and 7.5 mm. No damage to the adjacent tissue was found. Bone bridges and physeal closure were found after 24 weeks. The pigs showed no discomfort after the intervention. INTERPRETATION We found RFA to be feasible for epiphysiodesis in a pig model. The method is minimally invasive and recovery may be quick compared to conventional methods. We recommend that the method should be tested in larger-scale safety studies before clinical application.","Shiguetomi-Medina, Juan M; Rahbek, Ole; Abood, Ahmed Abdul-Hussein; Stødkilde-Jørgensen, Hans; Møller-Madsen, Bjarne",Acta orthopaedica,https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2014.939014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036720/,721

To obtain precise data regarding the safety and efficacy of this treatment with high-quality methodology, the prospective French Observatory study was conducted. Analysis of these data is presented, including 1-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with bifurcation aneurysms for which WEB treatment was indicated were included in this prospective, multicenter Good Clinical Practice study. Clinical data, including adverse events and clinical status at 1 month and 1 year, were collected and independently analyzed by a medical monitor. An independent core laboratory evaluated the anatomic results at 1 year following the procedure. RESULTS Ten French neurointerventional centers included 62 patients (39 women), 33-74 years of age (mean, 56.6 ± 9.80 years) with 63 aneurysms. Aneurysm locations were the middle cerebral artery in 32 aneurysms (50.8%), anterior communicating artery in 16 (25.4%), basilar artery in 9 (14.3%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 6 (9.5%). Morbidity and mortality at 1 month were, respectively, 3.2% (2/62 patients) and 0.0% (0/62). Morbidity and mortality (unrelated to the treatment) at 1 year were, respectively, 0.0% (0/59) and 3.4% (2/59 patients). At 1 year, complete occlusion was observed in 30/58 aneurysms (51.7%); neck remnant, in 16/58 aneurysms (27.6%); and aneurysm remnant, in 12/58 aneurysms (20.7%).

Liposuction-assisted medial thighplasty has recently been introduced as a technical advancement to improve outcomes. To date, no study is available directly comparing the traditional approach and this new technique. Here, the authors evaluate outcomes and complications of both techniques in a retrospective cohort study. METHODS Outcomes of 59 patients undergoing vertical medial thighplasty at the authors' institution between 2008 and 2014 were assessed retrospectively. Evaluated parameters include age, sex, body mass indices, method of weight loss, comorbidities, and complications (e.g., seroma, infection, wound dehiscence, hematoma, and surgical revision). Appropriate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS There were 29 patients in the excision-only group and 30 patients in the liposuction-assisted group (all women; average age, 41.5 years). The overall complication rate was significantly reduced in the liposuction-assisted group (13 percent versus 59 percent; p < 0.001). The incidence of individual complications such as seroma formation (zero patients versus 10 patients; p < 0.001) and wound infection (one patient versus eight patients; p = 0.01) was significantly less in the liposuction-assisted group. In addition, we observed a significantly shorter hospital stay (6.0 days versus 7.8 days), reduced number of follow-up visits (2.0 versus 4.4), and reduced time to drain removal (1.8 days versus 4.1 days; p < 0.001) in the liposuction-assisted group. CONCLUSIONS Liposuction-assisted medial thighplasty led to a significant reduction of complications and faster recovery in the massive weight loss patient population. As a consequence, the excision-only vertical thigh lift has been completely abandoned in the authors' clinical practice.

65460,The unequal scramble for coronavirus vaccines - by the numbers.,2020-08-24,"Liver cancer ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. To date, neither current ablation therapy nor chemotherapy are considered ideal in improving the outcome of liver cancer. Therefore, more effective therapies for treating this devastating disease are urgently required. Interventional therapy has been used for numerous years in the treatment of different types of cancer, and is characterized by the direct delivery of anticancer drugs into the tumor. It has been reported that antimalarial chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) exerts effective anticancer activity against several types of cancer. However, its effect on liver cancer remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, 2D monolayer cell culture and 3D spheroid in vitro models, and a rat model, were utilized to investigate the effect of CQ on liver cancer. CQ demonstrated an effective anticancer effect on HepG2 cells and 3D liver spheroids. Furthermore, the drug significantly inhibited cell growth and viability in the 2D and 3D in vitro models. The CQ-based intervention treatment effectively attenuated tumor size and weight, increased food intake and consumption of drinking water, and improved body weight and survival rate of rats in the in vivo model. In addition, treatment with CQ potently increased the expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes. Taken together, the findings of the present study may provide a novel insight into the development of safe and effective treatments for liver cancer.","Hao, Xiaoguang; Li, Weijing",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2021.12494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613722/,721

In the face of the increasing number of daily confirmed infected cases, it has become a common concern and worthy of pondering when the infection will appear the turning points, what is the final size and when the infection would be ultimately controlled. Based on the current control measures, we proposed a dynamical transmission model with contact trace and quarantine and predicted the peak time and final size for daily confirmed infected cases by employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We estimate the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is 5.78 (95%CI: 5.71-5.89). Under the current intervention before 31 January, the number of daily confirmed infected cases is expected to peak on around 11 February 2020 with the size of 4066 (95%CI: 3898-4472). The infection of COVID-19 might be controlled approximately after 18 May 2020.

In mutant Haloferax strains with enhanced self-targeting, cell fitness decreases and microhomology-mediated end joining becomes active, generating deletions in the targeted gene. Here we use self-targeting to investigate adaptation in H. volcanii CRISPR-Cas type I-B. We show that self-targeting and genome breakage events that are induced by self-targeting, such as those catalysed by active transposases, can generate DNA fragments that are used by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery for integration into the CRISPR loci. Low cellular concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in acquisition of large numbers of spacers originating from the entire genomic DNA. In contrast, high concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in lower acquisition that was mostly centred around the targeting site. Furthermore, we observed naïve spacer acquisition at a low level in wild type Haloferax cells and with higher efficiency upon overexpression of the Cas proteins Cas1, Cas2 and Cas4. Taken together these findings indicate that naïve adaptation is a regulated process in H. volcanii that operates at low basal levels and is induced by DNA breaks.","Stachler, Aris-Edda; Wörtz, Julia; Alkhnbashi, Omer S; Turgeman-Grott, Israela; Smith, Rachel; Allers, Thorsten; Backofen, Rolf; Gophna, Uri; Marchfelder, Anita",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723866/,721
69536,SARS-CoV-2 and Eosinophilia.,2020-05-01,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Accuracy and speed are essential for the intraprocedural nonrigid magnetic resonance (MR) to computed tomography (CT) image registration in the assessment of tumor margins during CT-guided liver tumor ablations. Although both accuracy and speed can be improved by limiting the registration to a region of interest (ROI), manual contouring of the ROI prolongs the registration process substantially. To achieve accurate and fast registration without the use of an ROI, we combined a nonrigid registration technique on the basis of volume subdivision with hardware acceleration using a graphics processing unit (GPU). We compared the registration accuracy and processing time of GPU-accelerated volume subdivision-based nonrigid registration technique to the conventional nonrigid B-spline registration technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen image data sets of preprocedural MR and intraprocedural CT images for percutaneous CT-guided liver tumor ablations were obtained. Each set of images was registered using the GPU-accelerated volume subdivision technique and the B-spline technique. Manual contouring of ROI was used only for the B-spline technique. Registration accuracies (Dice similarity coefficient [DSC] and 95% Hausdorff distance [HD]) and total processing time including contouring of ROIs and computation were compared using a paired Student t test. RESULTS Accuracies of the GPU-accelerated registrations and B-spline registrations, respectively, were 88.3 ± 3.7% versus 89.3 ± 4.9% (P = .41) for DSC and 13.1 ± 5.2 versus 11.4 ± 6.3 mm (P = .15) for HD. Total processing time of the GPU-accelerated registration and B-spline registration techniques was 88 ± 14 versus 557 ± 116 seconds (P < .000000002), respectively; there was no significant difference in computation time despite the difference in the complexity of the algorithms (P = .71). CONCLUSIONS The GPU-accelerated volume subdivision technique was as accurate as the B-spline technique and required significantly less processing time. The GPU-accelerated volume subdivision technique may enable the implementation of nonrigid registration into routine clinical practice.","Tokuda, Junichi; Plishker, William; Torabi, Meysam; Olubiyi, Olutayo I; Zaki, George; Tatli, Servet; Silverman, Stuart G; Shekher, Raj; Hata, Nobuhiko",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2015.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25784325/,721

METHODS An online questionnaire (22 multiple choice questions) via Microsoft Forms was administered on 30 May 2020 to RT residents. RESULTS Nineteen Lombardy RT residents responded to the survey. Nineteen percent of residents underwent a nasal swab and 11% were quarantined. Seventeen residents (89%) reported an increase in workload. Twelve residents (63%) did not find any difference in terms of work distress; worsening was highlighted in 5 cases (26%). The majority has never considered the possibility of stopping work due to excessive stress (89%). Almost all the residents experienced self- or relative-referred apprehension (95%). Ninety-five percent reported having missed extra-work social relationships. Most of the sample noted worsening sleep quality and difficulty concentrating (69%). No residents requested psychological support, even if provided by the hospital.

Research often focuses on barriers to participation. This study, however, takes a different approach, by exploring features of community locations considered welcoming by individuals with serious mental illnesses. This is important because welcoming environments are more likely to promote community participation. Using a survey approach, 75 participants were asked to identify and describe locations where they felt welcomed as a person with a mental illness. Our findings suggest that there are a number of places within the general community individuals with serious mental illnesses perceive as welcoming. Participants described religious communities, restaurants/cafés shops, parks, libraries, and cultural centers. Welcoming places were often perceived as architecturally open, featuring natural light and plants. Places provided opportunities for individuals to engage in a number of activities (e.g., socializing, entertainment, improving health, among others); data suggest welcoming places facilitated reciprocal relationships. We link these findings to a number of key recovery principles and make recommendation for multilevel interventions. This study may facilitate conversations with mainstream community organizations about inclusion and strategies to create welcoming environments and with mental health providers to consider strategies to encourage participation in welcoming places.

The resulting insights into the mechanism's underlying biological processes have played an essential role and shaped biomedical sciences during the last 30 years, considered the ""golden age"" of structural biology. In this review, we analyze selected aspects of the impact of synchrotron radiation on structural biology. Synchrotron beamlines have been used to determine over 70% of all macromolecular structures deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These structures were deposited by over 13,000 different research groups. Interestingly, despite the impressive advances in synchrotron technologies, the median resolution of macromolecular structures determined using synchrotrons has remained constant throughout the last 30 years, at about 2 Å. Similarly, the median times from the data collection to the deposition and release have not changed significantly. We describe challenges to reproducibility related to recording all relevant data and metadata during the synchrotron experiments, including diffraction images. Finally, we discuss some of the recent opinions suggesting a diminishing importance of X-ray crystallography due to impressive advances in Cryo-EM and theoretical modeling. We believe that synchrotrons of the future will increasingly evolve towards a life science center model, where X-ray crystallography, Cryo-EM, and other experimental and computational resources and knowledge are encompassed within a versatile research facility. The recent response of crystallographers to the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that X-ray crystallography conducted at synchrotron beamlines will continue to play an essential role in structural biology and drug discovery for years to come.","Grabowski, Marek; Cooper, David R; Brzezinski, Dariusz; Macnar, Joanna M; Shabalin, Ivan G; Cymborowski, Marcin; Otwinowski, Zbyszek; Minor, Wladek","Nuclear instruments & methods in physics research.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) release assays, such as the QuantiFERON-TB® Gold Plus test (QFT-Plus), are now widely implemented for the in vitro diagnosis of LTBI. To date, the detection and quantification of IFN-γ has been mostly performed with semi-automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), but several limitations currently exist. The study aims to evaluate the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer LIAISON® XL in comparison to ELISA for the performance of the QFT-Plus test. Between February and April 2020, 333 heparin blood samples from 323 adult patients were collected at a tertiary teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Overall, the CLIA analyzer LIAISON® XL performed well for the detection of IFN-γ compared to the ELISA method, demonstrating substantial agreement (κ, 0.872) and great correlation between assays (r, >0.950). CLIA produced significantly higher values of IFN-γ IU/mL than the ELISA (p=0.004 for TB1 tube, and p=0.010 for TB2 tube). Many discrepant cases (8/15, 53.3%) corresponded to indeterminate results with ELISA (NIL-corrected mitogen value <0.5 IU/mL), which analyzed with the CLIA analyzer LIAISON® XL reverted to interpretable results. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that CLIA may potentially present a greater sensitivity for the identification of LTBI, especially among immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, the analytical variability reported between both ELISA and CLIA methods, especially around the standardized 0.35 IU/mL positivity threshold, suggests the need to refine the interpretative algorithm.","Fernández-Huerta, Miguel; Moreto, Clara; Vila-Olmo, Neus; García de Cara, Erika-Inés; Basaez, María-Celeste; Santín, Miguel; Alcaide, Fernando",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00603-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076474/,721

However, this approach of routinely using imaging biomarkers to inform treatment decisions has yet to be translated into successful randomized trials. The aim of this study was to systematically review the use of imaging biomarkers in randomized controlled trials in patients with acute ischemic stroke, exploring the purposes for which the imaging biomarkers were used. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic review of imaging biomarkers used in randomized controlled trials of acute ischemic stroke, in which a therapeutic intervention was trialed within 48 hours of symptom onset. Data bases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, strokecenter.org, and the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (1995-2014). RESULTS Eighty-four studies met the criteria, of which 49 used imaging to select patients; 31, for subgroup analysis; and 49, as an outcome measure. Imaging biomarkers were broadly used for 8 purposes. There was marked heterogeneity in the definitions and uses of imaging biomarkers and significant publication bias among post hoc analyses. CONCLUSIONS Imaging biomarkers offer the opportunity to refine the trial cohort by minimizing participant variation, to decrease sample size, and to personalize treatment approaches for those who stand to benefit most. However, within imaging modalities, there has been little consistency between stroke trials. Greater effort to prospectively use consistent imaging biomarkers should help improve the development of novel treatment strategies in acute stroke and improve comparison between studies.","Harston, G W J; Rane, N; Shaya, G; Thandeswaran, S; Cellerini, M; Sheerin, F; Kennedy, J",AJNR.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Electronic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, OpenGrey, LILACS, and Medline, and search of scientific meeting abstracts and trial registers to April 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer. DATA EXTRACTION At least two reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of eligible studies. A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selection of outcomes important to patients. We used a random effects model to obtain pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) and, when feasible, conducted subgroup analyses (defined a priori) based on age, frequency of screening, family history, ethnicity, and socioeconomic level, as well as a sensitivity analysis based on the risk of bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the GRADE approach. RESULTS Five randomised controlled trials, enrolling 721 718 men, were included. Studies varied with respect to screening frequency and intervals, PSA thresholds for biopsy, and risk of bias. When considering the whole body of evidence, screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; moderate certainty) and may have no effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.96, 0.85 to 1.08; low certainty). Sensitivity analysis of studies at lower risk of bias (n=1) also demonstrates that screening seems to have no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0, 0.98 to 1.02; moderate certainty) but may have a small effect on prostate-specific mortality (IRR 0.79, 0.69 to 0.91; moderate certainty). This corresponds to one less death from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened over 10 years. Direct comparative data on biopsy and treatment related complications from the included trials were limited. Using modelling, we estimated that for every 1000 men screened, approximately 1, 3, and 25 more men would be hospitalised for sepsis, require pads for urinary incontinence, and report erectile dysfunction, respectively. CONCLUSIONS At best, screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in disease-specific mortality over 10 years but has does not affect overall mortality. Clinicians and patients considering PSA based screening need to weigh these benefits against the potential short and long term harms of screening, including complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

86831,"Erratum for Markmann et al., ""Sex Disparities and Neutralizing-Antibody Durability to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Convalescent Individuals"".",2021-09-08,"INTRODUCTION Conventional methods for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are fraught with complications such as allergic reactions, skin tattooing, radiation, and limitations on infrastructure. A novel technique has been developed for lymphatic mapping utilizing fluorescence imaging. This meta-analysis aims to compare the gold standard blue dye and radioisotope (BD-RI) technique with fluorescence-guided SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG). METHODS This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019129224). The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MESH) terms 'Surgery' AND 'Lymph node' AND 'Near infrared fluorescence' AND 'Indocyanine green'. Studies containing raw data on the sentinel node identification rate in breast cancer surgery were included. A heterogeneity test (using Cochran's Q) determined the use of fixed- or random-effects models for pooled odds ratios (OR). RESULTS Overall, 1748 studies were screened, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. ICG was equivalent to radioisotope (RI) at sentinel node identification (OR 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-19.08, p < 0.05) but superior to blue dye (BD) (OR 9.07, 95% CI 6.73-12.23, p < 0.05). Furthermore, ICG was superior to the gold standard BD-RI technique (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.17-8.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Fluorescence imaging for axillary sentinel node identification with ICG is equivalent to the single technique using RI, and superior to the dual technique (RI-BD) and single technique with BD. Hospitals using RI and/or BD could consider changing their practice to ICG given the comparable efficacy and improved safety profile, as well as the lesser burden on hospital infrastructure.","Kedrzycki, Martha S; Leiloglou, Maria; Ashrafian, Hutan; Jiwa, Natasha; Thiruchelvam, Paul T R; Elson, Daniel S; Leff, Daniel R",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-09288-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156466/,721

Gelation yield, specific surface area, macro-porosity and swelling degree of the microcryogels were examined in order to characterize their physical properties. MTT method was utilized to measure cell viability of the gelatin microcryogels with a period of 24, 48 and 72 h and no significant decrease was observed at 72 h. Apoptotic staining assay also showed high viability at 24, 48, 72 hours in parallel with the control group. The antibacterial performances of the gelatin microcryogels against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were examined. The results showed that the incorporation of lysozyme into gelatin microcryogels exhibited the antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, and E. coli, that may provide great potential for various applications in the biomedical industry.","Çetin, Kemal; Aslıyüce, Sevgi; Idil, Neslihan; Denizli, Adil",Journal of biomaterials science.

Colonic wake response is a relative increase in colonic motility upon awakening. Colonic manometry studies have demonstrated attenuated wake response in STC. We sought to evaluate wake response among healthy (H), NTC, and STC patients using wireless motility capsule (WMC). METHODS A retrospective study of WMC data from a multicenter clinical trial and a tertiary gastroenterology clinic was performed. WMC motility parameters of contraction frequency (Ct) and area under the contraction curve (AUC) were analyzed in 20-min windows 1-h before and after awakening. T-tests compared parameters between H, NTC, and STC. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine if outlet obstruction confounded data. A receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated optimal Ct cut-offs to define blunted wake response. RESULTS A total of 62 H, 53 NTC and 75 STC subjects were analyzed. At 20, 40, and 60 min after awakening, STC subjects had significantly lower mean Ct when compared to H (p < 0.001) and NTC (p < 0.01). Linear regression demonstrated that outlet obstruction was not associated with a decreased wake response (β = 3.94, (CI -3.12-1.00), P = 0.27). Defined at the Ct threshold of 64 at 20-min post-wake, blunted wake response sensitivity was 84% and specificity was 32% for chronic constipation. CONCLUSION Findings of an impaired wake response in subjects with STC and not NTC adds further evidence to neuronal dysfunction as an etiology of STC, and identifies a possible temporal target for pharmacologic intervention.","Surjanhata, Brian; Barshop, Kenneth; Staller, Kyle; Semler, Jack; Guay, Laurence; Kuo, Braden",Clinical and translational gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41424-018-0012-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29691377/,721

Malnutrition is associated with poor prognosis and early detection of malnutrition and timely nutritional interventions can improve the outcome for cervical cancer patients. The study was aimed to assess the association between the nutritional status and survival of cervical cancer patients. METHODS A prospective cohort study design was used. Overall 175 cervical cancer patients were followed over one year period with (median 8.5 mo, range (3.6-12). RESULTS The prevalence of malnutrition determined by means of the PG-SGA was 17.7% at admission and 47.1% at the end of follow-up. According to the SGA, one in three (29.7%) patients required nutritional intervention at the end of follow-up. Patients who were malnourished (PG-SGA-B and C) had an increased risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.23 - 7.86) as compared to those who were well nourished (PG-SGA-A). Patients from rural areas had an increased risk of mortality (HR: 6.99, 95% CI: 2.07 - 23.58) compared to patients from urban areas.

We evaluate the efficacy of soaking mesh in antibiotics to prevent prosthetic infection in an animal model of clean-contaminated ventral hernia repair (VHR). MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats underwent an acute VHR with one of four synthetic meshes (composite multifilament polyester (Parietex PCO), multifilament polyester (Parietex TET), composite monofilament polypropylene (Ventralight), or monofilament polypropylene (SoftMesh)). Prior to implantation, mesh was soaked in saline or 10 mg/ml of vancomycin for 15 min. Following implantation, meshes were contaminated with 10(4) CFU of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria. Thirty days after implantation, mesh samples were cultured and evaluated under scanning electron microscope for biofilm formation. RESULTS Presoaking meshes significantly improves bacterial clearance in composite meshes and multifilament polyester mesh. MRSA clearance was as follows for all meshes (saline-soaked vs. vanco-soaked): Parietex PCO (0 vs. 56 %, p = 0.006), Parietex TET (0 vs. 50 %, p = 0.01), Ventralight (20 vs. 78 %, p = 0.012), and SoftMesh (70 vs. 80 %, p = 0.6). MRSA biofilm formation was consistent with bacterial growth. CONCLUSION Presoaking multifilament and composite mesh in vancomycin solution reduces MRSA bacterial growth. Its implementation may reduce the risk of mesh infection in clean-contaminated cases, although further investigation with human trials should be performed.","Sadava, Emmanuel E; Krpata, David M; Gao, Yue; Novitsky, Yuri W; Rosen, Michael J",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-2099-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23212529/,721

This includes professional health program (PHP) monitoring of healthcare workers in recovery from substance use disorders. Here we present the case of a physician whose positive alcohol biomarker test result was complicated by a traumatic stress response to frontline work during COVID-19. METHODS An anesthesiologist under PHP monitoring for substance use disorder and depression was interviewed extensively, urine and blood biomarkers were obtained, and longitudinal structured and semi-structured interviews related to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and cravings were used to monitor responses to the unanticipated death of a patient who succumbed to COVID-19. RESULTS After an initial positive ethylglucuronide (EtG) and ethylsulfate (EtS) toxicology test result, all subsequent testing was negative. Standardized assessments and clinical interviews provided documentation of a post-traumatic stress reaction. The physician described compulsive sanitizing of hands/arms and mask with highly concentrated ethanol-based products. CONCLUSIONS Inhalation of ethanol vapors is a possible explanation for the initial positive EtG/EtS results. To our knowledge, this case represents the highest reported levels of EtG/EtS likely due to workplace exposure. The importance of rapid intervention to thoroughly assess positive toxicology testing and its source(s) cannot be overstated, particularly as it relates to frontline healthcare workers during the pandemic. The PHP monitoring process provides an opportunity to promptly detect healthcare workers in distress, allowing for efficient connection to supportive resources and/or treatment when indicated, and possibly preventing escalation of symptoms or disease recurrence.","Polles, Alexis G; Jacobs, William S; Brazle, Chad; Merlo, Lisa J",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941756/,721

During the 2013 influenza season we performed a multiplex assay for 16 different viruses in 665 swabs from patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) to display the variety of different pathogens causing ARI and to test the diagnostic value of both the commonly used case definitions [ARI, and influenza like illness (ILI)] as well as the clinical judgement of physicians, respectively, to achieve a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis. Fourteen different viruses were identified as causing ARI/ILI. Influenza diagnosis based on clinical signs overestimated the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and misclassified cases. Furthermore, ILI case definition and physicians agreed in only 287/651 (44%) cases with laboratory confirmation.

OBJECTIVE This retrospective observational study was conducted among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Hankou Hospital between January, 5 and March 8, 2020. We evaluated the association of AKI with the demographic and biochemical parameters and clinical outcomes of the patients using univariate regression analysis. OBJECTIVE Atotal of 287 COVID-19 patients, including 55 with AKI and 232 without AKI, were included in the analysis. Compared with the patients without AKI, the patients with AKI were older, predominantly male, and were more likely to have hypoxia and pre-existing hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases. The patients with AKI also had higher levels of white blood cells, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, a higher prevalence of hyperkalemia, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher chest computed tomographic scores. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 14.3% and that of stage 2 or 3 AKI was 4.9%. The patients with AKI had much higher mortality rate than those without AKI. OBJECTIVE AKI is an important complication of COVID-19. An older age, a male gender, multiple pre- existing comorbidities, lymphopenia, increased infection indicators, elevated D-dimer, and impaired heart and liver functions are all potential risk factors ofAKI. COVID- 19 patients with AKI that progresses into stages 2 or 3 AKI have a high mortality rate.

The present prospective study extends this research by examining both specific emotion regulation strategies and global emotion regulation difficulties in the context of acute stress following onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in 119 young adults. As part of a larger study, emotion regulation was assessed prior to pandemic onset (January 2019 - February 2020) using two standard measures (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, ERQ, Gross & John, 2003; Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004). A self-report assessment of acute stress was conducted 2-3½ weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Results demonstrated cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (i.e., ERQ) were not individually predictive of acute stress; however, there was a significant interaction of suppression by reappraisal. Simple effects indicated suppression was negatively associated with acute stress only when reappraisal levels were high. Greater global emotion regulation difficulties (i.e., DERS), particularly nonacceptance of emotions and limited access to emotion regulation strategies, significantly predicted greater acute stress. These results provide further evidence of the temporal relationship between emotion dysregulation and stress reactions, and also suggest the expected effects of emotion regulation strategies may differ across contexts.","Tyra, Alexandra T; Griffin, Siobhán M; Fergus, Thomas A; Ginty, Annie T",Journal of anxiety disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962141/,721

COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. METHODS We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. RESULTS We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD (not at all 56.6%) and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic (not at all 48.5%). The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.","Siniscalchi, Monica; Zingone, Fabiana; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo; D'Odorico, Anna; Ciacci, Carolina",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32553705/,721

Besides, morphological and functional alterations in their testis and epididymis may remain after withdrawal of arsenic insult, causing potential impairment in male fertility during adulthood. In this study, we aimed at analyzing the effect of prepubertal arsenic exposure on the fecundity of epididymal sperm from sexually mature Wistar rats, assessing fertility indexes, sperm parameters, and sperm phosphoproteins content. Male pups on postnatal day (PND) 21 received filtered water (controls, n = 10) and 10 mg L-1 arsenite (n = 10) daily for 30 days. From PND52 to PND81, rats from both groups received filtered water. During this period, the males mated with non-exposed females between PND72 and PND75. Our results showed that sexually mature rats presented low sperm production, epididymal sperm count, motility, and quality after prepubertal arsenic exposure. These findings possibly contributed to the low fertility potential and high preimplantation loss. Epididymal sperm proteome detected 268 proteins, which 170 were found in animals from both control and arsenic groups, 27 proteins were detected only in control animals and 71 proteins only in arsenic-exposed rats. In these animals, SPATA 18 and other five proteins were upregulated, whereas keratin type II cytoskeletal 1 was downregulated (q < 0.1). The results of KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated an enrichment of pathways related to dopaminergic response, adrenergic signaling, protein degradation, and oocyte meiosis in arsenic-exposed animals. Moreover, 26 proteins were identified by phosphoproteomic with different phosphorylation pattern in animals from both groups, but SPATA18 was phosphorylated only in arsenic-exposed animals. We concluded that prepubertal exposure to arsenic is deleterious to sperm quality and male fertility, altering the sperm phosphoproteins profile.","Couto-Santos, Felipe; de Azevedo Viana, Arabela Guedes; Souza, Ana Cláudia Ferreira; de Assis Dutra, Alexandre Augusto; de Oliveira Mendes, Tiago Antônio; da Silva Ferreira, André Teixeira; Aguilar, Jonas Enrique Perales; Oliveira, Leandro Licursi; Machado-Neves, Mariana",Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.152886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352348/,721

Patients before April 30, 2010, were selected based on computed tomography/computed tomography angiography (prehyperacute protocol), whereas patients on or after April 30, 2010, were selected based on computed tomography/computed tomography angiography and MRI (hyperacute MRI protocol). Demographic, clinical features, and outcomes were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS We identified 267 patients: 88 patients in prehyperacute MRI period and 179 in hyperacute MRI period. Fewer patients evaluated in the hyperacute MRI period received EST (85 of 88, 96.6% versus 92 of 179, 51.7%; P<0.05). The hyperacute-MRI group had a more favorable outcome of a modified Rankin scale 0 to 2 at 30 days as a group (6 of 66, 9.1% versus 33 of 140, 23.6%; P=0.01), and when taken for EST (6 of 63, 9.5% versus 17 of 71, 23.9%; P=0.03). On adjusted multivariate analysis, the EST in the hyperacute MRI period was associated with a more favorable outcome (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-10.6; P=0.03) and reduced mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.37; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Implementation of hyperacute MRI protocol decreases the number of endovascular stroke interventions by half. Further investigation of MRI use for patient selection is warranted.","Wisco, Dolora; Uchino, Ken; Saqqur, Maher; Gebel, James M; Aoki, Junya; Alam, Shazia; George, Pravin; Newey, Christopher R; Man, Shumei; Tateishi, Yohei; McNeil, Julie; Winfield, Michelle; Cheng-Ching, Esteban; Hui, Ferdinand K; Toth, Gabor; Bain, Mark; Rasmussen, Peter A; Masaryk, Thomas; Ruggieri, Paul; Hussain, Muhammad Shazam",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.003880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24407952/,721

109659,Effect of ambient temperature on respiratory tract cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 viral mimicking nanospheres-An experimental study.,2021-01-28,"In recent years, academics and policymakers have increasingly recognized that the full societal value of vaccination encompasses broad health, economic, and social benefits beyond avoided morbidity and mortality due to infection by the targeted pathogen and limited health care costs. Nevertheless, standard economic evaluations of vaccines continue to focus on a relatively narrow set of health-centric benefits, with consequences for vaccination policies and public investments.The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates in stark terms the multiplicity and magnitude of harms that infectious diseases may inflict on society. COVID-19 has overtaxed health systems, disrupted routine immunization programs, forced school and workplace closures, impeded the operation of international supply chains, suppressed aggregate demand, and exacerbated existing social inequities.The obvious nature of the pandemic's broad effects could conceivably convince more policymakers to identify and account for the full societal impacts of infectious disease when evaluating the potential benefits of vaccination. Such a shift could make a big difference in how we allocate societal resources in the service of population health and in how much we stand to gain from that spending. (Am J Public Health.

110613,Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion, the prognosis has improved tremendously since the implementation of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). The effect of EVT on the incidence of malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions (MMI) has not been studied before. METHODS ESTIMATE, a multicenter retrospective study, evaluates data of ischemic stroke patients with occlusion in the anterior circulation in the years of 2007-2015 comparing three treatment options (no therapy; IV-TPA; IV-TPA plus EVT or EVT only). Primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of MMI on follow-up imaging and mortality rates. Secondary endpoints were functional outcome, further clinical and imaging data. Logistic and Cox-regression models with a propensity score weighting approach were applied to evaluate differences between treatment groups. RESULTS In 2161 patients over 9 years, EVT reduced the MMI rates significantly: patients without acute stroke treatment had increased odds for MMI of 1.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49-1.65]. In contrast, after treatment with IV-TPA, only we observed an OR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83-0.94, p < 0.001), and after EVT an OR of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.85, p < 0.001). This was more pronounced in larger pretreatment infarctions (ASPECTS < 5, p < 0.01). IV-TPA also lowers the MMI rates but not to the same extent. EVT-treated patients had increased survival rates (p < 0.05) and the best functional outcome at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study illustrate that occurrence of MMI and mortality rates was significantly reduced in patients treated with EVT.","Fuhrer, Hannah; Schönenberger, Silvia; Niesen, Wolf-Dirk; Seide, Svenja; Meyne, Johannes; Gerner, Stefan T; Vollmuth, Christoph; Beck, Christopher; Meckel, Stephan; Schocke, Michael; Wodarg, Fritz; Huttner, Hagen B; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Kieser, Meinhard; Ringleb, Peter; Neugebauer, Hermann",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-018-9127-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470996/,721

MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched major electronic databases and grey literature sources for randomized controlled trials comparing semaglutide with placebo or other antidiabetic agents. Primary outcome was change from baseline in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in body weight, blood pressure, heart rate and incidence of hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal adverse effects, pancreatitis and diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS A total of 6 placebo-controlled and 7 active-controlled studies with subcutaneous semaglutide were included. We identified only 1 trial with oral semaglutide. Compared with placebo, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg reduced HbA1c by 1.01% (95% CI, 0.56-1.47) and 1.38% (1.05-1.70), respectively. Both doses demonstrated superior glycaemic efficacy compared to other antidiabetic agents, including sitagliptin, exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide and insulin glargine. Semaglutide also had a beneficial effect on body weight (mean difference vs placebo -4.11 kg, 95% CI -4.85 to -3.37 for semaglutide 1 mg) and systolic blood pressure. We did not observe increased hypoglycaemia rates with semaglutide; nevertheless, we noted an increased incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Cases of pancreatitis were infrequent and the odds ratio for diabetic retinopathy compared with placebo was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.98-1.77). CONCLUSIONS Semaglutide is a potent once-weekly GLP-1 RA, significantly reducing HbA1c, body weight and systolic blood pressure. However, it is associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Results for pancreatitis and retinopathy require further assessment in post-approval pharmacovigilance studies.","Andreadis, Panagiotis; Karagiannis, Thomas; Malandris, Konstantinos; Avgerinos, Ioannis; Liakos, Aris; Manolopoulos, Apostolos; Bekiari, Eleni; Matthews, David R; Tsapas, Apostolos","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.13361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29756388/,721

We conducted a systematic review and comparative meta-analysis of VCM and LZD efficacy against proven MRSA pneumonia. METHODS We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed until November 2019. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were mortality, clinical cure, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. RESULTS Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1,239 patients and eight retrospective cohort or case-control studies (CSs) with a total 6,125 patients were identified. Clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates were significantly increased in patients treated with LZD in RCTs (clinical cure: risk rate (RR) = 0.81, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.71-0.92, microbiological eradication: RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.81) and CSs (clinical cure: odds rate (OR) = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69). However, mortality was comparable between patients treated with VCM and LZD in RCTs (RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.88-1.32) and CSs (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.94-1.53). Likewise, there was no significant difference in adverse events between VCM and LZD in CSs (thrombocytopenia: OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.50-1.82, nephrotoxicity: OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.85-3.45).

The purpose of this study was to report our experience with two new-generation DES for the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with Taxus Element™ or Resolute Integrity™ stent for an intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis between March 2011 and August 2013. Technical success was defined as the ability to deploy the device at the desired location and reduce the degree of stenosis below 50 %. All procedure-related strokes were recorded. Control angiography was scheduled after 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. A luminal narrowing ≥50 % was regarded as a restenosis. Stroke recurrence in the territory of the treated artery was reported. RESULTS In the defined period we treated 101 patients harboring 117 intracranial stenoses. The procedure was successful in 100 (85.5 %) lesions. Procedure-related strokes occurred in 10 (9.9 %) patients with a permanent morbidity in 3 (3.0 %). Follow-up angiography was available for 83 of 100 (83.0 %) successfully treated lesions with an average of 355 days (IQR 153-482 days). Three (3.6 %) asymptomatic restenoses were detected. All occurred after treatment with Resolute Integrity™, none after Taxus Element™ (p = 0.059). New strokes in the territory of the treated artery were encountered in 2 (2.6 %) occasions. CONCLUSION Thin-strut DES improve long-term patency and reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. Differences between devices may exist. Feasibility is comparable to bare-metal balloon-mounted stents and procedure-related strokes occurred within the expected range.","Kurre, Wiebke; Aguilar-Pérez, Marta; Fischer, Sebastian; Arnold, Guy; Schmid, Elisabeth; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-1001-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342135/,721

To combat this crisis, research communities worldwide are falling back on the existing repertoire of approved/investigational drugs to probe into their anti-coronavirus properties. In this report, we describe our unique efforts in identifying potential drugs that could be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). To achieve this goal, we have primarily exploited the principles of 'neighbourhood behaviour' in the protein 3D (workflow-I) and chemical 2D structural space (workflow-II) coupled with docking simulations and insights into the possible modes of action of the selected candidates from the available literature. This integrative approach culminated in prioritizing 29 potential repurpose-able agents (20 approved drugs and 9 investigational molecules) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Apart from the approved/investigational anti-viral drugs, other notable hits include anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs. Our analysis suggests that some of these drugs have the potential to simultaneously modulate the functions of viral proteins and the host response system. Interestingly, many of these identified candidates (12 molecules from workflow-I and several molecules, belonging to the chemical classes of alkaloids, tetracyclines, peptidomimetics, from workflow-II) are suggested to possess anti-viral properties, which is supported by laboratory and clinical data. Furthermore, this work opens a new avenue of research to probe into the molecular mechanism of action of many drugs, which are known to demonstrate anti-viral activity but are so far not known to target viral proteases.","Chakraborti, Sohini; Bheemireddy, Sneha; Srinivasan, Narayanaswamy",Molecular omics,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0mo00057d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696772/,721

A significant proportion of patients with OSA in the UK are undiagnosed. This study aims to identify risk factors for OSA in an obese cohort. METHOD A population-based study was conducted of obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). A logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for developing OSA according to other clinicopathological characteristics. Multivariate analysis was conducted of individual factors that affect the propensity to develop OSA. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS From 276,600 obese patients identified during a data extraction of the CPRD in July 2017, the prevalence of OSA was 5.4%. The following risk factors were found to be independently associated with increased likelihood of OSA: male sex (OR = 3.273; p < 0.001), BMI class II (OR = 1.640; p < 0.001), BMI class III (OR = 3.768; p < 0.001), smoking (OR = 1.179; p < 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.722; p < 0.001), GERD (OR = 1.557; p < 0.001), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.311; p < 0.001), acromegaly (OR = 3.543; p < 0.001), and benzodiazepine use (OR = 1.492; p < 0.001). Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced risk of OSA amongst this obese population (OR = 0.260; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In obese patients, there are numerous comorbidities that are associated with increased likelihood of OSA. These factors can help prompt clinicians to identify undiagnosed OSA. Bariatric surgery appears to be protective against developing OSA.","Erridge, S; Moussa, O; McIntyre, C; Hariri, A; Tolley, N; Kotecha, B; Purkayastha, S",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05196-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423181/,721

Triaca published a paper «chin wing technique» in detail, which we used as a prototype. In this article, we will present the technique and experience of using osteoplastic three-dimensional mandible plasty, which has a number of special features: the increase in the bigonial width is due to the median vertical osteotomy of the free lower edge of the lower jaw, followed by lateralization of the distal parts of the lower fragments, osteosynthesis is performed using the original trapezoidal titanium mini-plate. Since 2018 30 patients have been operated on with different variants of the anatomy of the lower jaw with requirements for increasing the projection of the chin, increasing the width of the lower third of the face and changing the contour of the mandible.

Method: Latent Class Analyses (LCA) were used to determine neuropsychological classification in 231 patients referred to general adult neuropsychology services. A clinical rating scale was also used to approximate clinical decision-making. Regression models were constructed in a training sample (n = 127) drawn from an adult neuropsychology clinic using test scores from seven different a priori test battery combinations to predict group membership or clinical rating. The utility of the seven models was assessed in a testing sample (n = 104) from another independent adult neuropsychology clinic. Results: The LCA yielded a two class solution characterized by impaired versus non-impaired performance on neuropsychological tests. A seven test battery provided the best balance of accuracy and length in predicting LCA group with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 90%. Sensitivity and specificity were slightly attenuated using the clinical rating scale as the criterion, but the seven test battery still provided good accuracy (AUC=.906). Conclusions: Test protocols based on only five to eight test scores can accurately identify most patients with clinical impairment in a diverse adult neuropsychology clinic. Development of short protocols with adequate sensitivity and specificity will become increasingly important to address long waiting lists in light of the COVID pandemic against the general backdrop of increasing demand for neuropsychological services.","Kubu, C S; Frazier, T; Lapin, B; Naugle, R",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1850868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33228438/,721

Little is known about the epistatic effects of combined SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. We now investigate the neutralization sensitivity of variants containing the non-RBD mutation Q677H, including B.1.525 (Nigerian isolate) and Bluebird (U.S. isolate) variants. The effect on neutralization of Q677H was determined in the context of the RBD mutations and in the background of major VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom, Alpha), B.1.351 (South Africa, Beta), and P1-501Y-V3 (Brazil, Gamma). We demonstrate that the Q677H mutation increases viral infectivity and syncytium formation, as well as enhancing resistance to neutralization for VOCs, including B.1.1.7 and P1-501Y-V3. Our work highlights the importance of epistatic interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and the continued need to monitor Q677H-bearing VOCs. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is rapidly evolving to be more transmissible and to evade acquired immunity. To date, most investigations of SARS-CoV-2 variants have focused on RBD mutations. However, the impact of non-RBD mutations and their synergy with studied RBD mutations are poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the non-RBD Q677H mutation arising in many SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including VOCs. We demonstrate that the Q677H mutation enhances viral infectivity and confers neutralizing antibody resistance, particularly in the background of other SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.","Zeng, Cong; Evans, John P; Faraone, Julia N; Qu, Panke; Zheng, Yi-Min; Saif, Linda; Otlz, Eugene; Lozanski, Gerard; Gumina, Richard J; Liu, Shan-Lu",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02510-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607452/,721

METHODS Participants were recruited by sending a survey through various social network channels via the snowball method. A voluntary sample of 2430 individuals consisting of 1,203 men and 1,227 women (aged between 18 to 73 years old) from the Spanish national territory participated in this study. An online survey was performed to collect the information, which was tested through ad hoc analysis with different socio-demographic variables. Participants were a median of 34 years old (18-73 years old) with a mean BMI of 23.6 kg/m2.

Modern diabetes care in India grapples with multiple challenges. The twin enemies of uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and unwanted hypoglycaemia pose an ethical dilemma during the decision-making process of DM management. With an unfavourable support system against this rapidly emerging public health threat, we look to the Indian Constitution for guidance. Apart from just euglycaemia (a state of normal blood glucose levels), every Indian living with DM has some requirements and rights, that can be summarised with the help of three basic principles of the Constitution, ie, justice, equality and liberty. Together, these words remind us to practise accurate and appropriate diabetes care, delivered in a patient-centred manner. Justice, equality and liberty should be incorporated into diabetes-care systems, and fraternity encouraged. This will ensure that we achieve the dreams of our founding fathers through evolution of a comprehensive disease management model.","Kalra, Sanjay; Verma, Madhur",Indian journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.20529/ijme.2021.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018961/,721
137105,[Otorhinolaryngological aspects of the disease course in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus].,2020,"The ability to identify the functional correlates of structural and sequence variation in proteins is a critical capability. We related structures of influenza A N10 and N11 proteins that have no established function to structures of proteins with known function by identifying spatially conserved atoms. We identified atoms with common distributed spatial occupancy in PDB structures of N10 protein, N11 protein, an influenza A neuraminidase, an influenza B neuraminidase, and a bacterial neuraminidase. By superposing these spatially conserved atoms, we aligned the structures and associated molecules. We report spatially and sequence invariant residues in the aligned structures. Spatially invariant residues in the N6 and influenza B neuraminidase active sites were found in previously unidentified spatially equivalent sites in the N10 and N11 proteins. We found the corresponding secondary and tertiary structures of the aligned proteins to be largely identical despite significant sequence divergence. We found structural precedent in known non-neuraminidase structures for residues exhibiting structural and sequence divergence in the aligned structures. In N10 protein, we identified staphylococcal enterotoxin I-like domains. In N11 protein, we identified hepatitis E E2S-like domains, SARS spike protein-like domains, and toxin components shared by alpha-bungarotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin I, anthrax lethal factor, clostridium botulinum neurotoxin, and clostridium tetanus toxin. The presence of active site components common to the N6, influenza B, and S. pneumoniae neuraminidases in the N10 and N11 proteins, combined with the absence of apparent neuraminidase function, suggests that the role of neuraminidases in H17N10 and H18N11 emerging influenza A viruses may have changed. The presentation of E2S-like, SARS spike protein-like, or toxin-like domains by the N10 and N11 proteins in these emerging viruses may indicate that H17N10 and H18N11 sialidase-facilitated cell entry has been supplemented or replaced by sialidase-independent receptor binding to an expanded cell population that may include neurons and T-cells.","Weininger, Arthur; Weininger, Susan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25706124/,721

Ours is the first unit within the National Health Service of the United Kingdom to be routinely performing this procedure. This retrospective cohort study reports our experience with first 125 procedures. Data were retrospectively analysed from a prospective database. Information was further supplemented by interviewing team members, contacting patients' general practitioners and telephonic follow-up. The mean follow-up was 11.4 months. There were 86 (68.8%) females and the mean age was 45 (range 20-70) years. Mean weight and body mass index was 135.8 (range 85-244) kilograms and 48.1 (range 34.5-73.8) kg m(-2) , respectively. The mean operating time was 92.4 (range 45-150) minutes and the mean post-operative hospital stay was 2.2 (range 2-17) days. There was no leak, one 30-day reoperation and no mortality in this study. Three patients required late reoperations and four patients developed marginal ulcers.

METHODS The search strategy was restricted to publications in English before December 1, 2019 in the PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We only included oral diseases considered as public health issues with a global burden. As a result, investigations reporting the frequency of brushing, poor lifestyle behaviours, non-white ethnicity, DMFT scores, and periodontal disease as an outcome were included. The two reviewers resolved any disagreements. Reviewers analyzed the full-texts, considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, a manual search of the reference lists was performed on all the selected studies. RESULTS In total, 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Findings indicate a positive association between non-white ethnicity and PQoL among PW. Among PW, those who had non-white ethnicity were 1.43 times more likely to have PQoL (OR= 1.43, 95% CI=1.17, 1.70). A positive association between DMFT and poor QoL among PW was also observed. Those who has suffers DMFT were 1.4 times more likely to have poor QoL (OR= 1.4, 95% CI= 1.24, 1.55). CONCLUSIONS Results from this meta-analysis support the need for behavioral interventions for improving oral hygiene in expectant mothers. This could help to decrease periodontal conditions and improve their oral- and general life quality.","Mohammadi Gharehghani, Mohammad Ali; Bayani, Azadeh; Bayat, Amir-Hosein; Hemmat, Morteza; Karimy, Mahmood; Ahounbar, Elahe; Armoon, Bahram; Fakhri, Yadolah; Schroth, Robert J",International journal of dental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1111/idh.12465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941664/,721
141610,The Struggle Against MERS-CoV (The Novel Coronavirus).,2013,"OBJECTIVE To carry out an in vitro study of Boussignac CPAP valve performance with a new humidification method, using a heated humidifier. METHODS Two heated humidifiers were evaluated: Fisher & Paykel MR850, and Covidien Kendall Aerodyne 2000. Baseline measurements were taken in all experimental conditions without humidification. The Boussignac valve was adapted to the input of the humidification chamber. The system was connected to a test lung to assess the degree of pressurization. Hygrometric and pressure measurements were performed with the following gas flows: 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min. RESULTS The mean values of pressure generated by the Boussignac valve were 1.99 ± 0.02, 6.97 ± 0.05, 16.61 ± 0.08 and 21.24 ± 0.08 cm H2O, 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min, respectively, no differences being detected between study groups. Overall absolute humidity was significantly greater with a heated humidifier than without humidification (range 40.01 ± 0.57-25.46 ± 0.49 compared to 0.16 ± 0.13 mgH2O/L, P < .001). Absolute humidity was significantly higher in Kendall Aerodyne 2000 compared to MR850, regardless of the selected temperature and flow (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS This new method of Boussignac CPAP humidification yielded humidity values above 25 mg H2O/L regardless of the heated humidifier and flow used. Pressurization values remained constant in each experimental situation and were not influenced by adding humidification. These data open up the possibility of using Boussignac CPAP on different types of patients, with different interfaces and for long periods of time.","Alonso-Iñigo, José M; Almela, Amadeo; Albert, Alejandro; Carratalá, José M; Fas, María J",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22906896/,721

Basic science research in animal models helps us understand the transition from acute to chronic pain by identifying the numerous molecular and cellular changes that occur in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is now well recognized that inflammation and nerve injury lead to long-term synaptic plasticity that amplifies and also maintains pain signaling, a phenomenon referred to as pain sensitization. In the context of surgery in humans, pain sensitization is both responsible for an increase in postoperative pain via the expression of wound hyperalgesia and considered a critical factor for the development of persistent postsurgical pain. Using specific drugs that block the processes of pain sensitization reduces postoperative pain and prevents the development of persistent postoperative pain. This narrative review of the literature describes clinical investigations evaluating different preventative pharmacologic strategies that are routinely used by anesthesiologists in their daily clinical practices for preventing persistent postoperative pain. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed in both basic and clinical science research to identify preclinical models and novel therapeutics targets. There remains a need for more patient numbers in clinical research, for more reliable data, and for the development of the safest and the most effective strategies to limit the incidence of persistent postoperative pain.","Richebé, Philippe; Capdevila, Xavier; Rivat, Cyril",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000002238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738328/,721

METHODS We analyzed the clinical features, underlying diseases, and indicators of infection in 12 patients with COVID-19 on the second day after their admission to our hospital between January 20 and February 20, 2020.The data including CK-MB, aTnI, BNP, heart rate, changes in ECG, LVEF (%), left ventricular general longitudinal strain (GLS, measured by color Doppler ultrasound) were collected.The changes of liver function biochemical indicators were dynamically reviewed.BUN, UCR, eGFR, Ccr, and UACR and the levels of MA, A1M, IGU, and TRU were recorded. RESULTS The 12 patients included 2 severe cases, 8 common type cases, and 2 mild cases.Four of the patients presented with sinus tachycardia, ECG changes and abnormal GLS in spite of normal aTNI and LVEF; 1 patient had abnormal CKMB and BNP.On the first and third days following admission, the patients had normal ALT, AST and GGT levels.On day 7, hepatic function damage occurred in the severe cases, manifested by elevated ALT and AST levels.Abnormalities of eGFR, Ccr and UACR occurred in 8, 5 and 5 of the patients, respectively.Abnormal elevations of MA, A1M, IGU and TRU in urine protein were observed in 4, 4, 5, and 2 of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In patients with COVID-19, heart damage can be identified early by observing the GLS and new abnormalities on ECG in spite of normal aTNI and LVEF.Early liver injury is not obvious in these patients, but dynamic monitoring of the indicators of should be emplemented, especially in severe cases. In cases with normal CR and BUN, kidney damage can be detected early by calculating eGFR, Ccr and UACR and urine protein tests.","Fan, Jingru; Zhang, Yonghai; Pan, Zequn; Wang, Liangyu; Hong, Xuwei; Wu, Lingjie; Guo, Shunqi",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.10.20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118517/,721
148513,Early experience with universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in a New York-based reproductive endocrinology ‎practice.,2021-03-16,"INTRODUCTION To reduce the occurrence of complications in the setting of high-risk patients with contaminated operative field, a wide range of biologic meshes has been developed. Yet, few series have reported outcomes after abdominal wall repair (AWR) using such meshes. Permacol is an acellular porcine dermal collagen matrix with a cross-linked pattern. This study reports short- and long-term outcomes after AWR for incisional hernia using Permacol. MATERIALS AND METHODS All consecutive patients undergoing single-stage open AWR using Permacol mesh at eight university hospitals were included. Mortality, complication and hernia recurrence rates were assessed. Independent risk factors for complications and hernia recurrence were identified with logistic regression and Fine and Gray analysis, respectively. RESULTS Overall, 250 patients underwent single-stage AWR with Permacol. Nearly 80% had a VHWG grade 3 or 4 defect. In-hospital mortality and complication rates were 4.8% (n = 12) and 61.6% (n = 154), respectively. Reintervention for complications was required for 74 patients (29.6%). Mesh explantation rate was 4% (n = 10). Independent risk factors for complications were smoking, defect size and VHWG grade. After a mean follow-up time of 16.8 months (± 18.1 months), 63 (25.2%) experienced hernia recurrence. One-, 2- and 3-year RFS were 90%, 74% and 57%, respectively. Previous AWR, mesh location and the need for reintervention were independent predictors of hernia recurrence. DISCUSSION Single-stage AWR is feasible using Permacol. Mortality and complication rates are high due to patients' comorbidities and the degree of contamination of the operative field. Given the observed recurrence rate, the benefit of biologics remains to be ascertained.","Doussot, Alexandre; Abo-Alhassan, Fawaz; Derbal, Sofiane; Fournel, Isabelle; Kasereka-Kisenge, Faustin; Codjia, Tatiana; Khalil, Haitham; Dubuisson, Vincent; Najah, Haythem; Laurent, Alexis; Romain, Benoît; Barrat, Christophe; Trésallet, Christophe; Mathonnet, Muriel; Ortega-Deballon, Pablo",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-018-4853-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30426186/,721

METHODS In this article, we review soft tissue management techniques that can optimize the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with the goal of reducing surgical-site occurrences. RESULTS Regardless of the hernia repair technique used, outcomes can be highly dependent on the appropriate management of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Indeed, dehiscence and surgical-site infection can jeopardize the entire reconstruction, especially in cases where synthetic mesh might become exposed and/or infected, setting up a ""vicious cycle"" (Holihan et al. in J Am Coll Surg 221:478-485, 2015).

However, everyday life has been dramatically affected by highly restrictive government-imposed measures such as stay-at-home curfews, prohibitions on mobility across national and county boundaries, and strict policing, especially of the urban poor, which has culminated in violence. This open letter highlights the effects of these measures on how three community-based organizations (CBOs) deliver HIV programs and services to highly stigmatized communities of men who have sex with men living in the counties of Kisumu, Kiambu and Mombasa. In particular, emphasis is placed on how HIV testing programs, which are supported by systematic peer outreach, are being disrupted at a time when global policymakers call for expanded HIV testing and treatment targets among key populations. While government measures have greatly undermined local efforts to deliver health services to members and strengthen existing HIV testing programs, each of the three CBOs has taken innovative steps to adapt to the government restrictions and to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Although HIV testing in clinical spaces among those who were once regular and occasional program attendees dropped off noticeably in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdown, the program eventually began to rebound as outreach approaches shifted to virtual platforms and strategies. Importantly and unexpectedly, HIV self-testing kits proved to fill a major gap in clinic-based HIV testing at a time of crisis.","Odinga, Manas Migot; Kuria, Samuel; Muindi, Oliver; Mwakazi, Peter; Njraini, Margret; Melon, Memory; Kombo, Bernadette; Kaosa, Shem; Kioko, Japtheth; Musimbi, Janet; Musyoki, Helgar; Bhattacharjee, Parinita; Lorway, Robert",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13152.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954217/,721

A variety of different forms of EUS-BD have been described, allowing for both intrahepatic and extrahepatic approaches. Recent studies have reported high success rates utilizing EUS-BD for both transpapillary and transluminal drainage, with fewer adverse events when compared to PTBD. Advancements in novel technologies designed specifically for EUS-BD have led to increased success rates as well as improved safety profile for the procedure. The techniques of EUS-BD are yet to be fully standardized and are currently performed by highly trained advanced endoscopists.

An EEG analog front-end (AFE) that can compensate ±380-mV electrode DC offset using a coarse digital DC servo loop is implemented in the proposed system. The EEG-based MAC, EEGMAC, is introduced as a novel index to accurately predict the DoA, which is designed for applying to patients anesthetized by both volatile and intravenous agents. The proposed deep learning protocol consists of four layers of convolutional neural network and two dense layers. In addition, we optimize the complexity of the deep neural network (DNN) to operate on a microcomputer such as the Raspberry Pi 3, realizing a cost-effective small-size DoA monitoring system. Fabricated in 110-nm CMOS, the prototype AFE consumes 4.33 μW per channel and has the input-referred noise of 0.29 μVrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz with the noise efficiency factor of 2.2. The proposed DNN was evaluated with pre-recorded EEG data from 374 subjects administrated by inhalational anesthetics under surgery, achieving an average squared and absolute errors of 0.048 and 0.05, respectively. The EEGMAC with subjects anesthetized by an intravenous agent also showed a good agreement with the bispectral index value, confirming the proposed DoA index is applicable to both anesthetics. The implemented monitoring system with the Raspberry Pi 3 estimates the EEGMAC within 20 ms, which is about thousand-fold faster than the BIS estimation in literature.","Park, Yongjae; Han, Su-Hyun; Byun, Wooseok; Kim, Ji-Hoon; Lee, Hyung-Chul; Kim, Seong-Jin",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbcas.2020.2998172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746339/,721

Quality mealtime engagement is critical to improve mealtime difficulties and intake among older adults with dementia requiring eating assistance. Few tools are feasible and valid to measure mealtime engagement. This study developed and tested the Mealtime Engagement Scale (MES). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Items were developed based on literature review and expert review and finalized based on content validity and corrected item-total correlation. A secondary analysis of 87 videotaped observations capturing 18 nursing home staff providing mealtime care to residents with dementia was conducted. Internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and intra-rater reliability were assessed. Concurrent and convergent validity were examined through correlation (rs) with the Relational Behavior Scale (RBS) and the Mealtime Relational-Care Checklist (M-RCC), respectively. RESULTS The 18-item MES was developed with adequate content validity (Scale-CVI=1.00; Scale-CVI/Average=0.962-0.987). Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 3 (always). The total scale score ranges from 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate greater mealtime engagement. The MES had very good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.837), outstanding inter-rater reliability (Interclass Correlation=0.920), outstanding intra-rater reliability (Interclass Correlation =0.956), adequate concurrent validity based on strong correlation with the RBS (rs=0.821, p&.001), and fair convergent validity based on weak correlation with the M-RCC (rs=0.219, p=.042).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the burst pressure of the anastomosis depending on the firing direction of the stapler. METHODS Pig esophagus and small bowel were used for all experiments. The small intestine represented a thin intestinal tract and the esophagus represented a thick intestinal tract. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a linear stapler, and the burst pressure was measured. A leak test on the anastomosis was then performed and burst pressures measured. RESULTS Burst pressures after anastomosis using a GIA™ 100-3.8 were 47.4 ± 10.4 mm Hg. With the same GIA, the burst pressure was significantly greater when the staples were driven from the small intestine into the esophagus (83.3 ± 17.3 mm Hg). Using the GIA™ 100-4.8, it was found that the burst pressure was significantly greater when the staplers were driven into the small intestine versus the esophagus (51.6 ± 7.1 vs. 68.6 ± 16.1 mm Hg). There was no significant difference between the different GIAs when fired in the same direction. CONCLUSION Burst pressures were significantly greater when the staplers were driven from the small intestine into the esophagus. The direction of the staple line influences the strength of the anastomosis.","Kimura, Masahiro; Takahashi, Hiroki; Tanaka, Tatsuya; Sagawa, Hiroyuki; Takeyama, Hiromitsu",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000440817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26488286/,721

Even individuals that are never exposed to antibiotics showing resistance to antifungal drugs. The increase in resistant candida species strains requires a search for novel targets for new antifungal agents. Preventing infection caused by candida species is a tremendous challenge in medicine. Although availability and use of antifungal drugs, disseminated candidiasis leads to a high mortality rate of about 40-60%, poor diagnosis, and improper disease management. Interest in G-quadruplexes as a therapeutic target has been increased in recent years, following the implication of this non-canonical G-quadruplex secondary structure in pathological diseases. However, G-quadruplex has been reported in many pathogens contributing to virulence and pathogenesis, including bacterial pathogens such as Staphylcoccus aureus and Enterococcus spp. Etc, viruses such as SARS-CoV2, HIV, HPV etc., and Fungi such as Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, etc. The present aim of the study is to identify and targeting G-Quadruplex forming sequences present in the Candida glabrata. PQSFinder (R Package) identified more than 5000 putative G-quadruplex forming sequences. Out of these, we have used PQS present in the SDH1 gene of Candida glabrata. It may be a key target to ameliorate the C.glabrata infection because it encodes a protein that plays a vital role in energy production in C.glabrata cells shown in the figure. The structure was built based on the already current structure that is telomeric G4 AGGG (TTAGGG)3 {PDB ID-4G0F} for identifying its stabilization by Gold carbine derivatives. Molecular docking and ADMET analysis show that Compound A has the highest binding affinity and has the best ADMET properties among the two compounds. The present study represents PQS in the SDH1 gene could be a novel antifungal target.","Yadav, Ankush",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.455387,721

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 on the marketing of eggs in the Vhembe district of Limpopo province, South Africa. In this study, the research design, which involved investigating the effect of COVID-19 on the marketing of eggs during the pandemic in the Vhembe district, using qualitative and explorative research was employed. The study employed focus group discussions where 7 members of the project from a total of 3 projects were interviewed. Egg layer projects have experienced a market loss of eggs during the past three months, structured interviews were also carried out with 1 extension officer in the college of agriculture who is responsible for conducting training and monitoring of such projects. The coded data were then analyzed using Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS version 22). The egg layer projects were facing the low market return of egg sales because of competition with commercial farmers who bring the stock to the local market. In conclusion, it is presumed that the results of this study would lead to informed decisions by the department of agriculture in terms of arranging markets and making sure that the commercial farmers do not compete with the projects in terms of prices of eggs.","Nesengani, T.

163184,REACT-1 round 7 interim report: fall in prevalence of swab-positivity in England during national lockdown,2020-12-02,"Metabolic diseases, like hypertension, excess weight, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and vascular diseases, have rapidly increased to epidemic proportions worldwide. Metabolic risks (such as oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, altered glucose and lipid metabolism, changes in hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction, and subclinical atherosclerosis) contribute significantly to the progress of vascular disease and drive it eventually to acute vascular events like heart attacks and stroke. Although this situation has been noticed and discussed extensively by the global public health experts, and professional societies, the unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has demonstrated for the first time the interdependency or syndemic nature of metabolic diseases and a pathogenic virus that takes advantage of the compromised metabolic function in these diseases. The most common clinical symptoms reported are fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, sore throat, and sputum production. The main mode of transmission is through respiratory particles containing viral virions. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients seem to be infectious. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a 10-to 20-fold higher affinity to the human ACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV. Since these receptors are highly expressed on a variety of cells, including vascular endothelial cells and adipose tissue, individuals with compromised function of these tissues are more vulnerable to greater infection, replication, and severity with COVID-19. In most cases, the severity of the coronavirus disease is associated with pre-existing comorbidities, which include metabolic diseases such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and vascular diseases. Those with such diseases, or with elevated risk factors for such diseases, will have a compromised endothelium, favoring endothelial dysfunction. The infection of the endothelium by SARS-CoV-2 and resulting endothelialitis seems to add to this problem by further damaging the endothelium, causing dysfunction, disruption of vascular integrity, and endothelial cell death. These events lead to the exposure of the thrombogenic basement membrane and result in the activation of the thrombotic and clotting cascade. Because of these observations, critical care clinicians recommend aggressive anti-thrombotic and thrombolytic therapies in the management of acute COVID-19 cases. In the absence of a cure for coronavirus disease, sensible medicine proposes the following: primary prevention by following the best public health practices, such as social distancing, use of face coverings, and quarantine of COVID-positive individuals;and a gentler, moderate, and humble view and application of available treatment options and their effectiveness in patients with COVID-19. The FDA has created a special emergency program for possible coronavirus therapies, the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP). Currently, there are 590 drug development programs in planning stages, 390 trials in review, and five authorized for emergency use. None are approved for use in COVID-19 management. Currently, there are at least 51 studies listed in the COVID-19 vaccine tracker of the Regulatory Affairs Professional Society (RAPS) site.

163335,"Comparative single-dose mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, including early variants of concern: a test-negative design, British Columbia, Canada",2021-09-22,"Identification of specific epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies is essential to advance epitope-based vaccine design strategies. We report a facile methodology for rapid epitope mapping of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against HIV-1 Envelope (Env) at single residue resolution, using Cys labeling, viral neutralization assays and deep sequencing. This was achieved by the generation of a library of Cys mutations in Env glycoprotein on the viral surface, covalent labeling of the Cys residues using a Cys reactive label that masks epitope residues, followed by infection of the labeled mutant virions in mammalian cells in the presence of NAbs. Env gene sequencing from NAb-resistant viruses was used to accurately delineate epitopes for the NAbs VRC01, PGT128 and PGT151. These agreed well with corresponding experimentally determined structural epitopes previously inferred from NAb:Env structures. HIV-1 infection is associated with complex and polyclonal antibody responses, typically composed of multiple antibody specificities. Deconvoluting the epitope specificities in a polyclonal response is a challenging task. We therefore extended our methodology to map multiple specificities of epitopes targeted in polyclonal sera, elicited in immunized animals as well as in an HIV-1 infected elite neutralizer capable of neutralizing Tier-3 pseudoviruses with high titers. The method can be readily extended to other viruses for which convenient reverse genetics or lentiviral surface display systems are available.","Datta, Rohini; Chowdhury, Rohan Roy; Manjunath, Kavyashree; Hanna, Luke Elizabeth; Varadarajan, Raghavan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.041996,721

163689,SARS-CoV-2 viral load monitoring by extraction-free testing of saliva,2021-08-04,"Background and Objectives: The widespread prevalence of Coronavirus disease and the resulting epidemic and implementation of quarantine has increased Coronavirus anxiety. On the other hand, collective tragedies, especially those involving infectious diseases, often increase waves of fear and anxiety that appear to cause widespread behavioral disturbances and threaten the mental health of many people in the population. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of coronavirus anxiety on self-esteem, life satisfaction and mood of women with moderate to moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period. Material and Methods: The present study is a descriptive survey study. The sample consisted of 165 women with regular moderate physical activity who participated in the study through available sampling through telegram and WhatsApp virtual networks by distributing online questionnaire link. Required data through standard questionnaires including coronary anxiety Alipour, Brumez Mood Scale (BRUMS) Items, Life satisfaction of Diener. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSES) and IPAQ physical activity questionnaire was provided. Data in SPSS 26 software were analyzed using descriptive statistics and path analysis using SMARTPLS software. Results The results showed that anxiety caused by coronavirus had a significant inverse effect on self-esteem (P = -0.238) and life satisfaction (P = -0.307) of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during coronavirus 19 quarantine, and has a positive and significant effect on mood (P = 0.573) of women with regular moderate physical activity and their model has a good fit (p &lt;0.05). Conclusion: Coronary anxiety disorder plays an important role in the self-esteem, life satisfaction, and mood of women with moderate-to-moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period. Reducing coronary anxiety through appropriate exercise programs can be effective in improving the self-esteem, life satisfaction, and mood of women with moderate to moderate physical activity during the Covid-19 quarantine period.","Esteki, Samira",Depiction of Health,https://doi.org/10.34172/doh.2021.10,721

A version of the model that is calibrated to known characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 is used to estimate the transmission rate of COVID-19 in the United States in 2020. The transmission rate is then decomposed into a part that reflects observable changes in employment and social contacts, and a residual component that reflects disease properties and all other factors that affect the spread of the disease. I then construct counterfactuals for an alternative employment path that avoids the sharp employment decline in the second quarter of 2020, but also results in higher cumulative deaths due to a higher contact rate. For the simulations a modest permanent increase of quarantine effectiveness counteracts the increase in deaths, and the introduction of contact tracing and random testing further reduces deaths, although at a diminishing rate. Using a conservative assumption on the statistical value of life, the value of improved health outcomes from the alternative policies far outweighs the economic gains in terms of increased output and the potential fiscal costs of these policies. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Hornstein, A.",B.E.

We modeled the situation when cells can produce different costly secretions which increase the carrying capacity of the population. Strains that lose the function of producing one or more secretions avoid the cost of production and can exhaust the producers. However, secreting substances provides a private benefit for the producers in a density-dependent way. We developed a model to examine the outcome of the selection among different type of producer strains from the non-producer strain to the partial producers, to the full producer one. We were particularly interested in circumstances under which selection maintains partners that produce complementary secreted materials thus forming an interdependent mutualistic interaction. We show that interdependent mutualism is selected under broad range of conditions if private benefit decreases with density. Selection frequently causes the coexistence of more and less generalist cooperative strains, thus cooperation and exploitation co-occur. Interdependent mutual-ism is evolved under more specific circumstances if private benefit increases with density and these general observations are valid in a well-mixed and in a structured deme model. We show that the applied population structure supports cooperation in general, which, depending on the level of private benefit and intensity of mixing helps either the specialist or the generalist cooperators.","Jimenez, Paul; Scheuring, István",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.28.224550,721
166141,Evaluation of Changes on World Stock Exchanges in Connection with the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic. Survival Analysis Methods,2021,"Study Objectives: Racial disparities between White and minority (non-White) asthmatics in the United States have long been documented before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, minorities were also found to disproportionately bear the burden of COVID-19-related severe outcomes. The pandemic hastened the adoption of several health care system and societal changes, including expansion of telemedicine via video or phone visits, mask usage, social distancing, and remote work and schooling. These could be seen as protective to asthmatics via decreased exposure to respiratory pathogens, and increased provider access. However, it is unclear how the pandemic affected racial disparities for asthmatics. In this study, we employ the Epic Corporation’s Aggregate Data Program (ADP) to examine how the pandemic affected emergency department (ED) utilization between White and minority asthmatics. Methods: Epic’s ADP General Asthma Data Set collects national level data across all Epic customers and reports asthma prevalence, cumulative incidence of asthma exacerbation ED visits, and proportion of ED visits that comprise asthma exacerbations. This de-identified aggregate data is broken down by race, ethnicity, age groups, sex, and location (ie, state). We examined data from January 1, 2017 to February 1, 2021. We defined the start of the pandemic as March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization officially declared a pandemic. We determined the monthly incidence of asthma ED visits for non-White and White asthmatics separately, and then calculated the risk ratio by dividing incidence for minority asthmatics by incidence for White asthmatics. This risk ratio served as our measure for racial disparity. We compared the pre-pandemic and pandemic risk ratio with an unpaired t-test. We then performed an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to compare the trends of pre-pandemic and pandemic risk ratio. Results: Our data included 15.4e6 asthma ED visits, with 59.0% of visits comprised by minority asthmatics. The number of asthma ED visits per month on average were 3.1e5 +/- 1.2e5. Pandemic risk ratio was statistically significantly lower than pre-pandemic risk ratio (pre-pandemic mean 2.61, pandemic mean 2.54, 95% CI [0.024, 0.128], p < 0.01). ITS analysis demonstrated pre-pandemic risk ratio trend of 0.006/month, (95% CI 0.003, 0.009, p < 0.01). During the pandemic, the change in the risk ratio trend was -0.027/month, (95% CI -0.043, -0.012, p < 0.01). Pre-pandemic and pandemic trends in risk ratio are demonstrated in the figure. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that during the pandemic, known racial disparities in asthmatic ED utilization (ie, risk ratio between minority and White asthmatics) did not worsen. In fact, the pandemic reversed a marginally positive trend pre-pandemic, although this trend appeared to begin normalizing. It is possible that any one of the changes during the pandemic caused this shift in trend, but the limitations of our dataset prevent further investigation. More research is needed to investigate the factors underlying this trend change to learn how we may address racial disparities going forward.

Though neutrophils represent crucial players in the burn-induced immunological events, the dynamic secretion pattern and systemic levels of neutrophil-derived factors have not been investigated in detail so far. Methods Serum levels of neutrophil elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), and complement factor C3a were quantified in burn victims over 4 weeks post injury. Furthermore, the potential association with mortality, degree of burn injury, and inhalation trauma was evaluated. In addition, leukocyte, platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts were assessed. Lastly, we analyzed the association of neutrophil-derived factors with clinical severity scoring systems. Results Serum levels of NE, MPO, CitH3, and C3a were remarkably elevated in burn victims compared to healthy controls. Leukocyte and neutrophil counts were significantly increased on admission day and day 1, while relative lymphocytes were decreased in the first 7 days post burn trauma. Though neutrophil-derived factors did not predict mortality, patients suffering from 3rd degree burn injuries displayed increased CitH3 and NE levels. Accordingly, CitH3 and NE were elevated in cases with higher abbreviated burn severity indices (ABSI). Conclusions Taken together, our data suggest a role for neutrophil activation and NETosis in burn injuries and burn injury progression. Targeting exacerbated neutrophil activation might represent a new therapeutic option for severe cases of burn injury.","Laggner, M.; Lingitz, M.-T.; Copic, D.; Direder, M.; Klas, K.; Bormann, D.; Gugerell, A.; Moser, B.; Radtke, C.; Hacker, S.; Mildner, M.; Ankersmit, H.

Materials and Methods: In this study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients hospitalized between 01.03.2020-31.05.2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Computed tomography images of the patients were grouped as typical, indeterminate, atypical, and no pneumonia based on the Radiological Society of North America. After recording patient information on SPSS, clinical and laboratory findings of the patients were analyzed by comparing them to CT findings. Results: Among 237 RT-PCR positive patients, 104 (43.9%) were female and 133 (56.1%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 50.46 +/- 17.26 (18-92) years and the mean symptom onset time of the patients was 3.75 +/- 2.72 (median: 3) days. Eighty-seven of the patients (36.7%) had contact stories. Twenty-three (9.7%) patients were healthcare professionals. Of the patients, 49.8% had a comorbid disease.

167336,TB endemic evolution in Romania in the shadow of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic and associated supply-chain disruptions emphasise the requirement for antimicrobial materials for on-demand manufacturing. Besides aerosol transmission, SARS-CoV-2 is also propagated through contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. As such, the development of effective biofunctional materials that can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are critical for pandemic preparedness. Such materials will enable the rational development of antiviral devices with prolonged serviceability reducing the environmental burden of disposable alternatives. This research reveals the novel use of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) to 3D print porous Cobalt-Chromium-Molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) superalloy with potent antiviral activity (100% viral inactivation in 30 mins). The porous material was rationally conceived using a multi-objective surrogate model featuring track thickness (tt) and pore diameter (ϕd) as responses. The regression analysis found the most significant parameters for Co-Cr-Mo track formation to be the interaction effects of scanning rate (Vs) and laser power (Pl) in the order PlVs > Vs > Pl. Contrastively, the pore diameter was found to be primarily driven by the hatch spacing (Sh). The study is the first to demonstrate the superior antiviral properties of 3D printed Co-Cr-Mo superalloy against an enveloped virus used as biosafe viral model of SARS-CoV-2. The material significantly outperforms the viral inactivation time of other broadly used antiviral metals such as copper and silver from 5 hours to 30 minutes. As such the study goes beyond the current state-of-the-art in antiviral alloys to provide extra-protection to combat the SARS-COV-2 viral spread. The evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic brings new and unpredictable challenges where on-demand 3D printing of antiviral materials can achieve rapid solutions while reducing the environmental impact of disposable devices.

At the macrogeographic scale, we argue the pandemic is unlikely to significantly alter the winner-take-all economic geography and spatial inequality of the global city system. At the microgeographic scale, however, we suggest that it may bring about a series of short-term and some longer-running social changes in the structure and morphology of cities, suburbs and metropolitan regions.

Of the 240 individuals, 24 showed seroconversion in ELISA after experiencing COVID-19. All of them showed a positive reaction against the full-length nucleocapsid protein in the immunoblot. The highest reactivity was seen either against fragment N(100–300) or in a minority against the posterior part N(200–419). In general, the staining pattern of COVID-19 patients showed four phenotypes. In contrast, three individuals classified as borderline by ELISA reacted exclusively with fragments N(1–220) and N(100–300) containing the octamer amino acid sequence FYYLGTGP, which is identical in human coronaviruses sharing this sequence with SARS-CoV-2. These represent a unique and thus fifth phenotype. This work suggests the existence of distinct phenotypic patterns of IgG production towards N-protein subdomains.","Pajenda, Sahra Kapps Sebastian Reiter Thomas Freire Raimundo Smits Veronique A.

Today, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the help of technology appears to be relevant to keep the increase in new infections stable and help medical staff in treatment. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how AI can be employed against COVID-19 outbreak. Using a multiple case study approach, researchers find out the following insights. First, AI could be used for drugs discovery and knowledge sharing, tracking and prediction, clinical decision making and diagnosis, social distancing and medical chatbots. Second, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of international best practice for tracking contacts and social distance applications. Third, AI technologies could have a transversal impact, also focusing on prevention strategies as a new corporate social responsibility vein. In the end, this paper has theoretical and managerial implications, too. On the theoretical side, we contribute to the extensive discussion about AI and healthcare considering COVID-19 outbreak. On the practical side, we provide medical personnel and policymakers with a tool to understand artificial intelligence and focus investment choices in the practical applications analyzed.","Calandra, D.; Favareto, M.",European Journal of Social Impact and Circular Economy,https://doi.org/10.13135/2704-9906/5067,721

Given the popularity of Facebook and the restricted opportunities for off-line activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, assessment of this question could generate important results to shape future interventions. To evaluate the impact of the Cooking Matters (CM) Facebook page on healthy eating behaviors among low-income caregivers of young children. A pre-post survey of new CM Facebook followers in early 2020 was used. A convenience sample was recruited from low-income app users and the CM Facebook page. The baseline survey included 397 low-income caregivers of a child younger than 5 who never followed CM Facebook;184 of them completed the follow-up survey. Paired t test and McNemar-Bowker tests were conducted to compare the outcomes before and after following CM Facebook. A binary indicator was developed to measure whether the outcomes were improved (1 = Improved;0 = Not improved). Multi-variate logistic regressions were applied to examine the relationship between whether the outcome was improved with reference to the baseline socio-demographics. New followers had active exposure to CM Facebook content. About 75% of new followers viewed the CM page at least a few times a week. Additionally, 28.7% of followers commented on CM posts and 48.5% of followers watched CM videos. Approximately 60% of respondents rated CM as having impacted them ""somewhat"" or ""a great deal."" Single-parent families were more likely to achieve improvement in attitude toward cooking and younger age caregivers were more likely to achieve improvement in preparing healthy meals with the time available (P &lt; 0.05). The CM Facebook page could be an important platform to improve the attitudes or healthy eating behaviors among certain low-income caregivers of young children. Share Our Strength.

172667,Spraying disinfectants to combat SARS-CoV-2 transmission: is it fruitless rather than fruitful?,2020,"Purpose The aims of this paper are to explore the rise of cyberhate on the Zoom video conferencing platform at the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine victimized cases of Zoombombing where it was used as a cyberhate tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only impacted our lives and modes of working and studying, but also created new environments for cybercriminals to engage in cybercrime, cyberhate and hacking by exploiting tools such as Zoom. This new phenomenon called ""Zoombombing"" was first reported in mid-March 2020, when the social distancing and stay-at-home policies in the United States were nationally introduced. Design/methodology/approach This research conducted a news media content analysis on cases of Zoombombing. To conduct this analysis empirically, a dataset with all of the reported Zoombombing cases from March to April 2020 was created. Google Trends, news media and tweets were used to analyze Zoombombing as a form of cyberhate, particularly digital racism. Findings The results reveal prevalent Zoom-mediated racism toward Asian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans. This study understands Zoombombing from a sociopolitical/cultural perspective through news reporting of victimized cases and explores various ways that Zoombombing shapes, mediates, transforms and escalates racism. Originality/value This study is one of the very first studies to analyze Zoombombing in a way that builds upon an emerging body of literature on cyberhate. This paper considers Zoom as a space where curious young people, cybercriminals, extremists and hackers impose their ideologies and beliefs upon newly established online learning and working environments and engage in a struggle for identity recognition in the midst of increasingly accessible vulnerable software and cyberspace.","Lee, C.

173960,"Antibody kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 at 13.5 months, by disease severity",2021-09-15,"Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.","Bowick, Mark J.; Giomi, Luca",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3064v2.pdf,721

Therefore, a new therapy method, which is safe and can inactivate pathogenic microbes effectively without developing a resistance, is highly needed. Ultraviolet irradiation is well known for its ability of effective microbial inactivation and it is widely used in sterilization of inanimate objects based on conventional ultraviolet light sources. Meanwhile, applying ultraviolet irradiation in human disinfection application is an emerging and rapidly progressing field. This review focuses on recent studies in ultraviolet based disinfection methods including both animal and human studies. We will introduce different microbial inactivation mechanisms, which are associated with the ultraviolet irradiation wavelength.

174414,Trajectory of viral load in a prospective population-based cohort with incident SARS-CoV-2 G614 infection,2021-08-31,"Introduction To further improve efficacy and duration of response of CAR-T therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (R/R MM), we have designed a dual FasT CAR-T targeting both B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a well-established MM target, and CD19, which is expressed on MM cells and their progenitors. Here we report early results from the first-in-human multicenter clinical study (NCT04236011;NCT04182581) to determine safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of BCMA-CD19-directed FasT CAR-T (GC012F) in patients with R/R MM. Methods The BCMA-CD19 dual CAR was constructed by linking BCMA and CD19 scFv, joined by a CD8 hinge, transmembrane domain, co-stimulatory domain and CD3z. Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells were obtained by leukapheresis, T cells were isolated and CAR-T cells were manufactured (FasT CAR platform). From September 2019 to April 2020, we enrolled 16 heavily pretreated R/R MM patients (Age range 27-71), with a median of 5 prior lines of therapies (range 2-7), 93.8% (15/16) of these patients were high risk as defined by mSMART criteria, 5 had extramedullary disease. 4 out of 16 patients had received prior anti CD38 therapy, 93.8% (15/16) patients had received prior IMiD, all patients received at least 1 prior PI and corticosteroids with 3 patients being primary refractory to last therapy. Prior to CAR-T infusion patients received a conditioning regimen over 3 days of 30 mg/m2/d fludarabine and 300 mg/m2/d cyclophosphamide. CAR-T cells were administered in a single infusion at 3 dose levels 1x105/Kg (DL1) (1 patients), 2x105/Kg (DL2) (9 patients) and 3x105/Kg (DL3) (6 patients). Results As of July 17th 2020, all 16 patients were evaluable for response assessment, 15 out of 16 patients responded to treatment (ORR 93.8%) in all dose levels with the earliest response observed at day 28. Best response to date is MRD- CR/sCR in 9/16 patients (56.3%). In DL3 100% (6/6) of patients achieved sCR, 3 at data cut off had been confirmed by PET-CT. In all response evaluable patients, 78.6% (11/14) were MRD- by flow at month 1, and 100% at month 3 (11/11) and 6 (10/10) (sensitivity by flow cytometry measured at 10-4 in 7 patients, and at 10-6 in 9 patients tested by EuroFlow with at least 1.08x107 cells analyzed). At data cut off, the median follow up time was 7.3 months, the longest follow up was 10 months post infusion. CAR-T PK in PB was monitored by qPCR and flow cytometry. The CAR-T median proliferation peak was reached on Day10 (Day8-Day14), and the median peak copy number was 140,982 (16,011-374,346) copies /ug DNA. GC012F showed an acceptable safety profile with 14 out of 16 patients experiencing a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 1-2 (n=14, 87.5%) and 2 grade 3 (n=2, 12.5%). The median duration of CRS was 4 days (1-8 days). No neurotoxicity of any grade was observed. One patient (DL2) presented with fever and died shortly after Day 78 of unknown cause during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Two patients had progression of extramedullary disease while achieving MRD negativity at month 1 and 3, respectively. At landmark analysis at 6 months, all patients in DL3 had achieved and maintained MRD- sCR including patients heavily pretreated including Daratumumab - among them 83.3% (5/6) patients in DL3 had high risk features according to mSMART criteria, and 5 out of 6 patients in DL3 were assessed by 10-6 Euroflow for MRD. The study is still enrolling patients and we will continue to be monitoring safety and efficacy including duration of response. Conclusion The data of BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T showed an early and high response rate with 93.8% ORR to date with a promising early high MRD-sCR rate in the highest dose level DL3 (100%) which was sustained with a median duration of follow up of 7.3 months at cut off. The data shows very promising activity of the BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T with a favorable safety profile in R/R MM patients. 93.8% (15/16) of the treated patients exhibited high risk features - a specifically difficult to treat patient population which remains a high unmet medical need in Mul iple Myeloma. This data indicates that BCMA-CD19 dual FasT CAR-T (GC012F) may present an effective new treatment option for patients with R/R MM including those with high-risk features who failed multiple prior therapies including anti-CD38. The study is still ongoing and enrolling patients, we will update the results as they become available. Disclosures: Zhao: Gracell Biotechnologies Ltd: Current Employment.

While anticipating escape could aid rational therapeutic design, the complex rules governing viral escape are challenging to model. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented ability to predict viral escape by using machine learning algorithms originally developed to model the complexity of human natural language. Our key conceptual advance is that predicting escape requires identifying mutations that preserve viral fitness, or “grammaticality,” and also induce high antigenic change, or “semantic change.” We develop viral language models for influenza hemagglutinin, HIV Env, and SARS-CoV-2 Spike that we use to construct antigenically meaningful semantic landscapes, perform completely unsupervised prediction of escape mutants, and learn structural escape patterns from sequence alone. More profoundly, we lay a promising conceptual bridge between natural language and viral evolution.

Severe COVID-19 cases with excessive hyperinflammation have many overlap features with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objectives: We aimed to describe the typical clinical and laboratory features and treatment of children diagnosed with MIS-C and to understand the differences as compared to severe/critical pediatric cases with COVID-19 in an eastern Mediterranean country. Methods: Children (aged <18 years) who diagnosed with MIS-C and severe/ critical pediatric cases with COVID-19, were admitted to hospital between 26 March and 3 November 2020 were enrolled in the study. Results: A total of 52 patients, 22 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with severe/critical disease course and 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C. Although severe COVID-19 cases and cases with MIS-C share many clinical and laboratory features, MIS-C cases had longer fever duration and higher rate of the existence of rash, conjunctival injection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, altered mental status, and myalgia than in severe cases (p<0.001 for each). Of all, 53.3% of MIS-C cases had the evidence of myocardial involvement as compared to severe cases (27.2%). Additionally, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) are the independent predictors for the diagnosis of MIS-C, particularly in the existence of conjunctival injection and rash. Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and biologic immunomodulatory treatments were mainly used in MIS-C cases rather than cases with severe disease course. There were only 3 deaths among 52 patients, one of whom had Burkitt lymphoma and the two cases with severe COVID-19 of late referral. Conclusion: Differences between clinical presentations, acute phase responses, organ involvements, and management strategies indicate that MIS-C might be a distinct immunopathogenic disease as compared to pediatric COVID-19. Conjunctival injection and higher CRP and low WBC count seem good diagnostic parameters for MIS-C cases.","Ozsurekci, Y.; Gürlevik, S.; Kesici, S.; Kaya Akca, U.; Oygar, P.

175457,Age-related susceptibility of ferrets to SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-08-16,"Background To counter the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines, namely tozinameran and elasomeran, have been authorized in several countries. These next generation vaccines have shown high efficacy against COVID-19 and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. As widespread vaccinations efforts are taking place, incidents of myocarditis and pericarditis cases following vaccination have been reported. This safety signal has been recently confirmed by the European Medicine Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This study aimed to investigate and analyze this safety signal using a dual pharmacovigilance database analysis. Methods This is as an observational study of reports of inflammatory heart reactions associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines reported in the World Health Organization's global individual case safety report database (up to June 30th 2021), and in the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, up to May 21st 2021). Cases were described, and disproportionality analyses using reporting odds-ratios (ROR) and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were performed to assess relative risk of reporting according to patient sex and age. Results At a global scale, the inflammatory heart reactions most frequently reported were myocarditis (1241, 55%) and pericarditis (851, 37%), the majority requiring hospitalization (n=796 (64%)). Overall, patients were young (median age 33 [21-54] years). The main age group was 18-29 years old (704, 31%), and mostly males (1555, 68%). Pericarditis onset was delayed compared to myocarditis with a median time to onset of 8 [3-21] vs. 3 [2-6] days, respectively (p=0.001). Regarding myocarditis, an important disproportionate reporting in males (ROR, 9.4 [8.3-10.6]) as well as in adolescents (ROR, 22.3 [19.2-25.9]) and 18-29 years old (ROR, 6.6 [5.9-7.5]) compared to older patients were observed. Conclusions The inflammatory heart reactions, namely myocarditis and pericarditis, have been reported world-wide shortly following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. An important disproportionate reporting among adolescents and young adults, particularly in males, was observed especially for myocarditis. Guidelines must take this specific risk into account and to optimize vaccination protocols according to sex and age. While the substantial benefits of COVID-19 vaccination still prevail over risks, clinicians and the public should be aware of these reactions and seek appropriate medical attention.","Chouchana, L.; Blet, A.; Al-Khalaf, M.; Kafil, T.

Amid the pandemic, the stock market showed return volatilities primarily due to the unexpected investors? behaviour. One of the behavioural biases is herding, which has the power to wreck the market equilibrium and shatter the market efficiency. Given that the pandemic has generated unprecedented spirals of uncertainties across the globe, thereby creating interruptions in the pattern of stock market investment decisions, this study examined the herding behaviour of 54 stocks of banking and financial services sectors listed in the national stock exchange. In the quantile regression framework, the study provides evidence of the presence of herding for public sector banking and financial services under the bull market conditions during the pandemic in the 90th quantile of the return distribution. This finding has implications for the mispricing of financial assets in these sectors. So, the study suggests removing information asymmetry among the market participants and devising policy initiatives for ensuring market stability.","Mishra, P. K.; Mishra, S.

Here, we asked whether musical engagement is an effective strategy for socio-emotional coping. During the first lockdown period (April–May 2020), we surveyed changes in music listening and making behaviours of over 5000 people, with representative samples from three continents. More than half of respondents reported engaging with music to cope. People experiencing increased negative emotions used music for solitary emotional regulation, whereas people experiencing increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction. Light gradient-boosted regressor models were used to identify the most important predictors of an individual’s use of music to cope, the foremost of which was, intriguingly, their interest in “coronamusic.” Overall, our results emphasise the importance of real-time musical responses to societal crises, as well as individually tailored adaptations in musical behaviours to meet socio-emotional needs.","Fink, Lauren K.; Warrenburg Lindsay, A.; Howlin, Claire Randall William M.; Hansen, Niels Chr Wald-Fuhrmann Melanie",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00858-y,721

Socioeconomic status is known to affect dietary habits. To examine the associations between changes in household income and changes in diet, dietary behavior, and lifestyle. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted via the Internet in November 2020. The participants were 6,000 Japanese men and women (aged 20–64 years old) who were registered with a research company. After excluding participants with invalid responses, a total of 5,158 participants were included in the analysis. The questionnaire included the following items: demographic characteristics;socioeconomic status;and changes in household income, diet, dietary behavior, and lifestyle since before the COVID-19 pandemic (November 2019) to the present (November 2020). Changes in household income and demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status were compared using the χ2 test. The association between changes in household income and dietary habits was examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Household income had decreased for 1,144 participants (22.2%). In this group, a high proportion were in their 50s, were high school graduates, and had household income under 2 million yen in 2019. Decrease in household income was negatively associated with vegetable intake, frequency of eating out, time spent on breakfast, and time spent exercising, and positively associated with frequency of drinking and time spent on lunch. The results of this study suggest that decrease in household income during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with expansion of economic disparities and changes in dietary habits, such as vegetable intake and mealtimes.

The objective of the study was to assess which aspects of the pain regulatory system that account for this augmented pain perception. In a cross-sectional design, 81 women, aged 18-35 (mean [SD] age, 23.4 [3.9]), were included (41 with NSSI and 40 healthy controls). A quantitative sensory testing protocol, including heat pain thresholds, heat pain tolerance, pressure pain thresholds, conditioned pain modulation (assessing central down-regulation of pain), and temporal summation (assessing facilitation of pain signals) was used. Thermal pain stimuli were assessed during fMRI scanning and NSSI behaviors and clinical symptoms were self-assessed. NSSI participants demonstrated higher pain thresholds during heat and pressure pain compared to controls. During conditioned pain modulation, NSSI participants showed a more effective central down-regulation of pain for NSSI participants. Temporal summation did not differ between the groups. There were no correlations between pain outcomes and NSSI behaviors or clinical characteristics. The fMRI analyses revealed increased activity in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex in NSSI participants, compared to healthy controls, which are brain regions implicated in sensory aspects of pain processing. The findings suggest segregated inhibitory mechanisms for pain and emotion in NSSI, as pain insensitivity was linked to enhanced inhibitory control of pain in spite of significant impairments in emotion regulation. This may represent an endophenotype associated with a greater risk for developing self-injurious behavior.","Lalouni, M.; Fust, J.; Bjureberg, J.; Kastrati, G.; Fondberg, R.; Fransson, P.; Jayaram-Lindstrom, N.; Kosek, E.; Hellner, C.; Jensen, K.

Clinicians are faced with multi-faceted requirements and fragmented interfaces for information exploration and documentation. These challenges are only exacerbated in the Emergency Department -- clinicians often see 35 patients in one shift, during which they have to synthesize an often previously unknown patient's medical records in order to reach a tailored diagnosis and treatment plan. To better support this information synthesis, clinical documentation tools must enable rapid contextual access to the patient's medical record. MedKnowts is an integrated note-taking editor and information retrieval system which unifies the documentation and search process and provides concise synthesized concept-oriented slices of the patient's medical record. MedKnowts automatically captures structured data while still allowing users the flexibility of natural language. MedKnowts leverages this structure to enable easier parsing of long notes, auto-populated text, and proactive information retrieval, easing the documentation burden.","Murray, Luke; Gopinath, Divya; Agrawal, Monica; Horng, Steven; Sontag, David; Karger, David R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11451v1.pdf,721

The meeting took place as Australia was completing three decades of uninterrupted economic growth and as the run was being ended by COVID-19 and associated lockdowns. This paper provides a commentary on the Review. It begins by examining the evolution of Australia's trade policies, with emphasis on the period covered by the TPR, 2015-19. The second section evaluates the discussion at the TPR meeting, when WTO members raised questions about the policies described in the Review and the Australian delegation responded. The third section considers developments in the year after the meeting. The paper concludes that, despite its stellar economic performance in the three decades before COVID and strong record on trade liberalisation within and beyond the WTO, Australia faces a difficult post-COVID policy environment. The final section focuses on two challenges: rapidly deteriorating relations with China, Australia's largest trade partner, and the impact of climate change policies.","Pomfret, R.",World Economy,https://doi.org/10.1111/twec.13182,721

The conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiqutin-like modifiers (Ubls) to proteins has been shown to be especially crucial in regulating a variety of cellular processes including the cell cycle, growth control, quality control, localization and many more. It is a highly dynamic process and involves a number of enzymes called E1, E2 and E3. Ub and Ubls are removed from the target proteins by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) or Ubl-specific proteases (ULPs), thereby deconjugation can act as an additional level of control over the ubiquitin-conjugation system. In addition, DUBs and ULPs are responsible for activating Ub and Ubls from their inactive corresponding precursor forms. Here we review recent progress in molecular details of these deconjugating enzymes of Ubls.","Ha, Byung Hak; Kim, Eunice EunKyeong",BMB reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18593526/,721

We discussed how the traveler case reports could aid in a timely detection of a disease outbreak. METHODS Using the traveler data, we estimated a few indicators of the epidemic that affected decision making and policy, including the exponential growth rate, the doubling time, and the probability of severe cases exceeding the hospital capacity, in the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in multiple countries. We imputed the arrival dates when they were missing. We compared the estimates from the traveler data to the ones from domestic data. We quantitatively evaluated the influence of each case report and knowing the arrival date on the estimation. FINDINGS We estimated the travel origin's daily exponential growth rate and examined the date from which the growth rate was consistently above 0.1 (equivalent to doubling time < 7 days). We found those dates were very close to the dates that critical decisions were made such as city lock-downs and national emergency announcement. Using only the traveler data, if the assumed epidemic start date was relatively accurate and the traveler sample was representative of the general population, the growth rate estimated from the traveler data was consistent with the domestic data. We also discussed situations that the traveler data could lead to biased estimates. From the data influence study, we found more recent travel cases had a larger influence on each day's estimate, and the influence of each case report got smaller as more cases became available. We provided the minimum number of exported cases needed to determine whether the local epidemic growth rate was above a certain level, and developed a user-friendly Shiny App to accommodate various scenarios.","Bao, Le; Zhang, Ying; Niu, Xiaoyue",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868994/,721

MATERIALS AND METHODS Findings were reviewed for 40 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS. A template was designed for the analysis of each serial radiograph to observe patterns and distribution of disease, interval changes, and complications. The majority of radiographs were anteroposterior views. A clinical database of these patients was also collected for clinical-radiologic comparison. RESULTS The mean age of the patients (18 male, 22 female) was 42.7 years. Patients had a normal chest radiograph and focal, multifocal, and/or bilateral consolidation. The pattern of consolidation tended to be peripheral and poorly marginated and involved middle and lower lung zones. The serial sequence fell into two major subgroups, which correlated closely with clinical outcome. Consolidation in one group cleared within a matter of days, while the second group went on to develop rapid and extensive bilateral pneumonia, with a prolonged hospital stay. Subsegmental atelectasis and pleural complications were rarely observed. CONCLUSION SARS pneumonia can manifest as focal peripheral consolidation that clears relatively quickly and does not cause secondary complications or that progresses to bilateral consolidation and a more protracted clinical course.","Grinblat, Leonard; Shulman, Harry; Glickman, Aaron; Matukas, Larissa; Paul, Narinder",Radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12853655/,721

We randomized 87 Chinese schools to usual practices: standard intervention (handwashing program) or expanded intervention (handwashing program, soap for school sinks, and peer hygiene monitors). We compared student absence rates, adjusting for cluster design. In control schools, children experienced a median 2.0 episodes (median 2.6 days) of absence per 100 student-weeks. In standard intervention schools, there were a median 1.2 episodes (P = 0.08) and 1.9 days (P = 0.14) of absence per 100 student-weeks. Children in expanded intervention schools experienced a median 1.2 episodes (P = 0.03) and 1.2 days (P = 0.03) of absence per 100 student-weeks. Provision of a large-scale handwashing promotion program and soap was associated with significantly reduced absenteeism. Similar programs could improve the health of children worldwide.","Bowen, Anna; Ma, Huilai; Ou, Jianming; Billhimer, Ward; Long, Timothy; Mintz, Eric; Hoekstra, Robert M; Luby, Stephen",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17556631/,721

Prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission also requires effective infection control in health-care facilities. In Taipei, Taiwan, an area with moderate to high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) (50-74 cases per 100,000 population), health-care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk for M. tuberculosis (Taiwan Center for Disease Control, unpublished data, 2002). In April 2003, SARS-related screening in a hospital in Taipei resulted in the detection of suspected TB among HCWs. This report summarizes how SARS screening led to the discovery of 60 cases of TB.

200638,"A cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Italian tourists visiting India, March 2020",2020,"UNLABELLED In the worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, cluster of cases occurred in a number of large high-rise residential building blocks, especially in Hong Kong. In this study, we examined one of the most likely virus-spread mechanisms, which is related to the inter-flat or inter-zonal airflow through open-windows caused by buoyancy effects. Dual tracer gases of CO2 and SF6 are employed simultaneously to quantify the amount of the exhaust air coming out of the upper part of the window of a floor that re-enters the lower part of the open-window at the immediate upper floor. It was found that the room air could contain up to 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor, and this occurs at low wind conditions with a combination of indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The results can well explain the earlier governmental finding that DNA strings of SARS Corono-Virus were detected within the sampled deposits on the window sills of the upper floors of the two index patients' flats. The preliminary and yet alarming conclusion may be that, in high-rise buildings, windows flush with a flat façade can be a major route for the vertical spread of pathogen-containing aerosols. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS The confirmation of the transmission route can have a number of implications to both building design and infectious disease control. With respect to the former, considerations should be given to minimize the inter-flat airflow via windows flush with façade for high-rise buildings with natural ventilation; and with respect to the latter, more targeted and earlier intervention can be implemented in case of any highly infectious disease outbreaks.","Niu, J; Tung, T C W",Indoor air,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18093125/,721

201151,Urticaria in an infant with SARS-CoV-2 positivity,2020,"Although of zoonotic origin, pathogens or infections posing a global threat to human health such as human immunodeficiency virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome or emerging influenza type A viruses may actually have little in common with known, established zoonotic agents, as these new agents merely underwent a transient zoonotic stage before adapting to humans. Evolution towards person-to-person transmission depends on the biological features of the pathogen, but may well be triggered or facilitated by external factors such as changes in human exposure. Disease emergence may thus be depicted as an evolutionary response to changes in the environment, including anthropogenic factors such as new agricultural practices, urbanisation, or globalisation, as well as climate change. Here the authors argue that in the case of zoonotic diseases emerging in livestock, change in agricultural practices has become the dominant factor determining the conditions in which zoonotic pathogens evolve, spread, and eventually enter the human population. Livestock pathogens are subjected to pressures resulting from the production, processing and retail environment which together alter host contact rate, population size and/or microbial traffic flows in the food chain. This process is illustrated by two study cases: a) livestock development in the 'Eurasian ruminant street' (the area extending from central Asia to the eastern Mediterranean basin) and the adjacent Arabian peninsula b) poultry production in Southeast Asia. In both scenarios, environmental factors relating to demography, land pressure and imbalances in production intensification have led to an unstable epidemiological situation, as evidenced by the highly pathogenic avian influenza upsurge early in 2004, when the main outbreaks were located in areas which had both large scale, peri-urban commercial holdings and a high density of smallholder poultry units.","Slingenbergh, J I; Gilbert, M; de Balogh, K I; Wint, W",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702714/,721

203098,Clinical Samples for SARS-CoV-2 Detection: Review of the Early Literature,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Immunodeficiency underlying the development of severe forms of new coronavirus infection may be the result of mixed infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).The aim is to study the prevalence and epidemiological features of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and EBV. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional randomized study was conducted in Moscow region from March to May 2020. Two groups were examined for EBV-markers: hospital patients (n = 95) treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood donors (n = 92). RESULTS: With equal EBV prevalence the detection of active infection markers in donors (10.9%) was noticeably lower than in SARS-CoV-2 patients (80%). Significant differences in this indicator were also found when patients from subgroups with interstitial pneumonia with the presence (96.6%) and absence (97.2%) of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal smear were compared with the subgroup of patients with mild COVID-19 (43.3%). The average IgG VCA and IgG EBNA positivity coefficients in donor group were higher than in patient group (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with active EBV infection markers were significantly more likely to have pneumonia, exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes (odds ratio - 23.6; 3.5; 9.7, respectively). DISCUSSION: The present study examined the incidence and analyzed epidemiological features of active EBV infection in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: A significantly higher rate of detection of active EBV infection markers in hospital patients indicates a combined participation SARS-CoV-2 and EBV in the development of interstitial pneumonia. Low levels of specific IgG EBV serve as predictors of EBV reactivation. Exceeding the reference values of ALT and the relative number of monocytes in patients should serve as a reason for examination for active EBV infection markers.","Solomay, T V; Semenenko, T A; Filatov, N N; Vedunova, S L; Lavrov, V F; Smirnova, D I; Gracheva, A V; Faizuloev, E B",Vopr Virusol,,721
203281,SARS-CoV-2: a storm is raging,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of the first COVID-19 surge (March through June 2020) on mental well-being and associated risk factors among intensive care unit nurses. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. CONCLUSION: The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care. Effort should be made to optimize working conditions and decrease workload to guarantee care in the next months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heesakkers, Hidde; Zegers, Marieke; van Mol, Margo M C; van den Boogaard, Mark",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,,721
203434,Vaccinating children against SARS-CoV-2: maximise uptake among adults while prioritising the most vulnerable,2021,"The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine first offered the elective Student Shelter Opportunities I (SSOI) course in 2016 to provide pre-clinical students with an opportunity to engage with shelter medicine and high-quality high-volume surgery (HQHVS) concepts. The course utilized online asynchronous coursework to deliver content that was completed on a self-guided timeline by students. With most of the veterinary medical curriculum delivered in a traditional classroom format, it is important to assess learning in this unique course format. There is also limited information on educational experiences in online shelter medicine coursework. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate student learning in the asynchronous online portion of the SSOI elective course using paired pre- and post-test scores from a multiple-choice type assessment. The study investigated how students' pre-test and post-test scores compared and whether time to completion of material influenced student assessment performance. Paired assessments from 400 students were analyzed, and a statistically significant increase was found in post-test scores compared to pre-test following completion of the online coursework (p < .001). There was no significant difference in the mean change in score from pre-test to post-test for students who completed the online course material in 30 days or less compared to those who completed it in greater than 30 days. This study's findings support online asynchronous learning as an effective option to teach veterinary students and can be considered in the development of veterinary coursework, including for curricular adjustments to increase online learning during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Reinhard, Chelsea L; Powell, Lauren; Watson, Brittany",J Vet Med Educ,,721
204040,How an infectious disease could influence the development of a region: The evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak over the tourism intentions in azores archipelago,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity is characterized by a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This review describes acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity, outlines the complex pathophysiologic derangements, and addresses the emergency department (ED) management of this patient population. DISCUSSION: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are aminoquinoline derivatives widely used in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis as well as for malaria prophylaxis. In early 2020, anecdotal reports and preliminary data suggested utility of hydroxychloroquine in attenuating viral loads and symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aminoquinoline drugs pose unique and significant toxicological risks, both during their intended use as well as in unsupervised settings by laypersons. The therapeutic range for chloroquine is narrow. Acute severe toxicity is associated with 10-30% mortality owing to a combination of direct cardiovascular effects and electrolyte derangements with resultant dysrhythmias. Treatment in the ED is focused on decontamination, stabilization of cardiac dysrhythmias, hemodynamic support, electrolyte correction, and seizure prevention. CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the pathophysiology of acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine toxicity and available emergency treatments can assist emergency clinicians in reducing the immediate morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.","Della Porta, Alessandra; Bornstein, Kasha; Coye, Austin; Montrief, Tim; Long, Brit; Parris, Mehruba Anwar",Am. j. emerg. med,,721

Vascular surgery departments are no exception and Vascular societies across the world issued some guidance through these turbulent times, resulting all together in surgery reduction and surgeons' reallocations. Objectives As expected, this impacts vascular trainees and their training and so, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact o COVID-19 pandemic on vascular education. Materials and Methods A remote digital survey was spread across European networks aiming vascular residents and their activities during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Questions were related to possible trainee relocations, COVID-19 infections, daily activities reduction, scientific activity, exams and internships. Results reported here are from 7th July to 20th September. Duplicate responses were removed. Results A total of 104 answers across 27 countries were included. The mean age of the trainee's responders were 31.2 ± 3.58 years old, 63% were male and the residency year mode was the 5th. Forty-four (42.3%) of the trainees stood in the COVID- 19 frontline, of which were mainly for COVID-19 wards (50%) and emergency departments (22.1%), with only two (1.9%) being relocated to a different hospital. Concerning time in the frontline, the most frequent answers were up to two weeks in 34.8% and above 12 weeks in 28.8%. More than half (76.9%) said to had suffer a decrease in number of surgical procedures performed and/or assisted with over 60% reporting a decrease superior to 50%. Annual or final exams were re-schedule or cancelled for 16.3% and 10.6% of the participants, respectively. Of the responders, 56.7% as stated to have operated COVID- 19 positive patients at the time of the survey. Six responders (5.8%) had said to have themselves being infected by COVID-19 while 63.5% answer to have had medical staff infected in their vascular departments. Accordingly, to the survey, 73.5% claims that the first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a negative impact on vascular education and 73.4% agrees for the need of ""some compensation"" on their vascular residency curriculum. Conclusions The first COVID-19 pandemic wave brough a significant negative impact on vascular education with more than 50% of the responders suggesting a need for compensation after this period. However, as a second wave is emerging, this negative impact is expected to increase even more significantly.","Pereira-Neves, António; Domingues, Liliana Fidalgo; Ancetti, Stefano",Rev Port Cir Cardiotorac Vasc,,721

The purpose of this study was to investigate the sleep quality and changes in sleep patterns before and during the outbreak in the general population in China and to determine factors related to sleep quality. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire from 20 February to 29 February 2020 in China. Socio-demographic data, self-designed COVID-19-related characteristics, sleep patterns, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores were obtained. Single factor analysis and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were used. RESULTS: A total of 1897 individuals were included in our study, and 30.0% of participants reported suffering poor sleep quality (PSQI&#8805;8). Logistic regression analysis found that the factors related to sleep quality included poor physical health (OR = 3.382, p < 0.001), respiratory disease (OR = 1.629, p = 0.008), other diseases (OR = 2.504, p = 0.012), suspected case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR = 1.928, p = 0.002), confirmed case of COVID-19 in the same community (OR = 2.183, p = 0.007), worry about being infected (OR = 2.336, p < 0.001), &#8805;1 h/day spent hearing COVID-19 information (OR = 1.960, p < 0.001), time difference in midpoint time in bed (OR = 1.230, p < 0.001), and time difference in time in bed (OR = 0.711, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that more than one-fourth of the participants suffered poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the poor health status and COVID-19-related anxiety, delayed sleep phase and reduced time in bed impacted sleep quality in the general population in China.","Lin, Yanmei; Liu, Shuai; Li, Shuangyan; Zuo, Heming; Zhang, Bin",Sleep medicine,,721

METHODS: Two-hundred-fifty-one patients with respiratory symptoms underwent CT few days after hospitalization. ""Aerated"" (AV), ""consolidated"" (CV) and ""intermediate"" (IV) lung sub-volumes were quantified by an operator-independent method based on individual HU maximum gradient recognition. AV, CV, IV, CV/AV, IV/AV, and HU of the first peak position were extracted. Relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected. The population was composed by training (n = 166) and validation (n = 85) consecutive cohorts, and backward multi-variate logistic regression was applied on the training group to build a CT_model. Similarly, models including only clinical parameters (CLIN_model) and both CT/clinical parameters (COMB_model) were developed. Model's performances were assessed by goodness-of-fit (H&L-test), calibration and discrimination. Model's performances were tested in the validation group. RESULTS: Forty-three patients died (25/18 in training/validation). CT_model included AVmax (i.e. maximum AV between lungs), CV and CV/AE, while CLIN_model included random glycemia, C-reactive protein and biological drugs (protective). Goodness-of-fit and discrimination were similar (H&L:0.70 vs 0.80; AUC:0.80 vs 0.80). COMB_model including AVmax, CV, CV/AE, random glycemia, biological drugs and active cancer, outperformed both models (H&L:0.91; AUC:0.89, 95%CI:0.82-0.93). All models showed good calibration (R2:0.77-0.97). Despite several patient's characteristics were different between training and validation cohorts, performances in the validation cohort confirmed good calibration (R2:0-70-0.81) and discrimination for CT_model/COMB_model (AUC:0.72/0.76), while CLIN_model performed worse (AUC:0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Few automatically extracted densitometry parameters with clear functional meaning predicted mortality of COVID-19 patients. Combined with clinical features, the resulting predictive model showed higher discrimination/calibration.","Mori, Martina; Palumbo, Diego; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Broggi, Sara; Compagnone, Nicola; Guazzarotti, Giorgia; Giorgio Esposito, Pier; Mazzilli, Aldo; Steidler, Stephanie; Pietro Vitali, Giordano; Del Vecchio, Antonella; Rovere Querini, Patrizia; De Cobelli, Francesco; Fiorino, Claudio",Phys Med,,721

206225,Do Ocular Fluids Represent a Transmission Route of SARS-CoV-2 Infection?,2020,"Exposure to nitrate is toxic to aquatic animals due to the formation of methaemoglobin and a subsequent loss of blood-oxygen carrying capacity. Yet, nitrate toxicity can be modulated by other stressors in the environment, such as elevated temperatures. Acclimation to elevated temperatures has been shown to offset the negative effects of nitrate on whole animal performance in fish, but the mechanisms underlying this cross-tolerance interaction remain unclear. In this study, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to a factorial combination of temperature (28 °C or 32 °C) and nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg NO3- L-1) treatments to test the hypothesis that thermal acclimation offsets the effects of nitrate via compensatory changes to the cardiorespiratory system (gills, ventricle and blood oxygen carrying capacity). Following 21 weeks of thermal acclimation, we found that fish acclimated to 32 °C experienced an expansion of gill surface area and an increase in ventricular thickness regardless of nitrate exposure concentration. Exposure to nitrate (both 50 and 100 mg NO3- L-1) reduced the blood oxygen carrying capacity of silver perch due to increases in methaemoglobin concentration and a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves in fish from both thermal acclimation treatments. These results indicate that plasticity of the gills and ventricle of warm acclimated fish are potential mechanisms which may provide cross-tolerance protection to elevated nitrate concentrations despite nitrate induced reductions to oxygen transport.","Gomez Isaza, Daniel F; Cramp, Rebecca L; Franklin, Craig E",Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,,721

To fight the spread of the virus, governments have taken various restricting measures including stay at home orders. Ultimately, the home delivery volume increased significantly, which still bears the risk of human-human infection during the final delivery. From a logisticians perspective, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), which are a contactless delivery solution, have the potential to radically change the way groceries are delivered to customer homes and help to stop the spread of the virus. However, to date, research on user acceptance of ADVs is rare. This paper theoretically extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) including gender as a moderator. The study is based on quantitative data collected in Germany through an online questionnaire (n=501). Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that trust in technology, price sensitivity, innovativeness, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, social influence, and perceived risk determine behavioural intention. However, some constructs are only significant for women. The findings of this paper have theoretical, managerial and policy contributions and implications within the areas of last-mile delivery and technology acceptance.","Kapser, Sebastian; Abdelrahman, Mahmoud; Bernecker, Tobias",,,721
210774,The Relationship between Fear of Infection and Insomnia among Dentists from Oradea Metropolitan Area during the Outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rages on, it is important to explore new evolution-resistant vaccine antigens and new vaccine platforms that can produce readily scalable, inexpensive vaccines with easier storage and transport. We report here a synthetic biology-based vaccine platform that employs an expression vector with an inducible gram-negative autotransporter to express vaccine antigens on the surface of genome-reduced bacteria to enhance interaction of vaccine antigen with the immune system. As a proof-of-principle, we utilized genome-reduced Escherichia coli to express SARS-CoV-2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) fusion peptide (FP) on the cell surface, and evaluated their use as killed whole-cell vaccines. The FP sequence is highly conserved across coronaviruses; the six FP core amino acid residues, along with the four adjacent residues upstream and the three residues downstream from the core, are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV. We tested the efficacy of PEDV FP and SARS-CoV-2 FP vaccines in a PEDV challenge pig model. We demonstrated that both vaccines induced potent anamnestic responses upon virus challenge, potentiated interferon-Î³ responses, reduced viral RNA loads in jejunum tissue, and provided significant protection against clinical disease. However, neither vaccines elicited sterilizing immunity. Since SARS-CoV-2 FP and PEDV FP vaccines provided similar clinical protection, the coronavirus FP could be a target for a broadly protective vaccine using any platform. Importantly, the genome-reduced bacterial surface-expressed vaccine platform, when using a vaccine-appropriate bacterial vector, has potential utility as an inexpensive, readily manufactured, and rapid vaccine platform for other pathogens.","Maeda, Denicar Lina Nascimento Fabris; Tian, Debin; Yu, Hanna; Dar, Nakul; Rajasekaran, Vignesh; Meng, Sarah; Mahsoub, Hassan M; Sooryanarain, Harini; Wang, Bo; Heffron, C Lynn; Hassebroek, Anna; LeRoith, Tanya; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Zeichner, Steven L",Proc.

211566,New evidences that discard the possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between intimate relationships, psychological health, and endometriosis-related variables such as pelvic pain and infertility. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected with an online survey delivered through Qualtrics and posted on the Facebook page and website of a patient association (Associazione Progetto Endometriosi-APE) in August 2020. The survey was composed of a researcher-made questionnaire and four validated questionnaires assessing relational satisfaction (adapted Quality of Marriage Index), dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Questionnaire), and psychological health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). RESULTS: Participants were 316 women (age: 35.9 ± 6.7) with endometriosis, who reported being in an intimate relationship from at least one year. A greater perceived negative impact of the disease on past and current intimate relationships was associated with poorer psychological health, lower relational satisfaction and worse dyadic coping. Women who perceived their partner as more informed about endometriosis, more informed about and interested in their health conditions, and more likely to accompany them to the medical appointments, showed greater relational satisfaction and dyadic coping. Relational satisfaction and dyadic coping were associated with psychological health. A greater perceived negative impact of endometriosis on intimate relationships was associated with more severe pelvic pain (especially dyspareunia). CONCLUSION: Endometriosis has a negative impact on intimate relationships, which is associated with poorer psychological health. For the women with the disease, partner's support is important, and our findings suggest that effort should be made to involve both members of the couple in multidisciplinary treatment.","Facchin, Federica; Buggio, Laura; Vercellini, Paolo; Frassineti, Annalisa; Beltrami, Sara; Saita, Emanuela",J Psychosom Res,,721

We enrolled 181 patients admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) with confirmed COVID-19 between January 2020 and February 2020. Ninety-two patients were treated with tocilizumab, and 89 patients were treated conventionally. We analyzed the clinical manifestations, changes in CT scan images, and laboratory tests before and after tocilizumab treatment, and compared these results with the conventionally treated group. A significant reduction in the level of C-reactive protein was observed 1 week after tocilizumab administration. In some cases this meant the end of the IL-6-related cytokine storm. In addition, tocilizumab relieved fever, cough, and shortness of breath with no reported adverse drug reactions. These findings suggest tocilizumab improves clinical outcomes and is effective for treatment of patients with critical or severe COVID-19. However, future clinical trials are needed to better understand the impact of tocilizumab interference with IL-6 and provide a therapeutic strategy for treatment of COVID-19.","Zheng, Kai-Lian; Xu, Ying; Guo, Yu-Feng; Diao, Le; Kong, Xiang-Yu; Wan, Xiao-Jian; Zhao, Feng; Ning, Fang-Zheng; Wang, Li-Bing; Qiao, Fan; Zhao, Jiang-Man; Zhou, Jia-Huan; Zhong, Yue-Qian; Wu, Shou-Xin; Chen, Yi; Jin, Gang; Dong, Yu-Chao",Aging (Albany NY),,721

However, during flu seasonal early identification of viral infection in CAP is crucial to guide treatment and in-hospital management. Though recommended, the routine use of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) to detect viral infection has been poorly scaled-up, especially in the emergency department (ED). This study sought to assess the prevalence and associated clinical outcomes of viral infections in patients with CAP during peak flu season. In this retrospective, observational study adults presenting at the ED of our hospital (Rome, Italy) with CAP from January 15th to February 22th, 2019 were enrolled. Each patient was tested on admission with Influenza rapid test and real time multiplex assay. Seventy five consecutive patients were enrolled. 30.7% (n = 23) tested positive for viral infection. Of these, 52.1% (n = 12) were H1N1/FluA. 10 patients had multiple virus co-infections. CAP with viral infection did not differ for any demographic, clinic and laboratory features by the exception of CCI and CURB-65. All intra-ED deaths and mechanical ventilations were recorded among CAP with viral infection. Testing only patients with CURB-65 score &#8805;2, 10 out of 12 cases of H1N1/FluA would have been detected saving up to 40% tests. Viral infection occurred in one-third of CAP during flu seasonal peak 2019. Since not otherwise distinguishable, NPS is so far the only reliable mean to identify CAP with viral infection. Testing only patients with moderate/severe CAP significantly minimize the number of tests.","Spagnolello, Ornella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Cedrone, Maria Civita; Di Biagio, Valentina; Gentile, Massimo; Leonardi, Annalisa; Valeriano, Camilla; Innocenti, Giuseppe Pietro; Santinelli, Letizia; Borrazzo, Cristian; Russo, Alessandro; Oliveto, Giuseppe; Viscido, Agnese; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Bertazzoni, Giuliano; d039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo",J Med Virol,,721

Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails-including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","Greaney, Allison J; Starr, Tyler N; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Zost, Seth J; Binshtein, Elad; Loes, Andrea N; Hilton, Sarah K; Huddleston, John; Eguia, Rachel; Crawford, Katharine H D; Dingens, Adam S; Nargi, Rachel S; Sutton, Rachel E; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Rothlauf, Paul W; Liu, Zhuoming; Whelan, Sean P J; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Bloom, Jesse D",Cell host microbe,,721

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed using RT-PCR-based testing over a 6-week period. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the two-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants' baseline, pre-COVID-19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: PHQ-2 and GAD-2 significantly (P < .001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ-2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.40, 95% CI, 1.10-1.78, P = .006), age (aIRR = 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, P = .006), and baseline PHQ-2 score (aIRR = 1.39, 95% CI, 1.09-1.76, P = .007). GAD-2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.02-1.62, P = .035), age (aIRR = 1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, P = .025) and baseline GAD-2 score (aIRR = 1.55, 95% CI, 1.24-1.93, P < .001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and GAD-2. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID-19 course. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of symptoms-such as SOB-associated with severe manifestations of COVID-19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were associated with depressed mood and anxiety.

In the lack of a specific treatment and vaccine for this novel infection, finding effective drugs against this infection is crucial. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin, the main carotenoid of saffron, has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS-CoV2 infection for several reasons: (a) crocin possesses powerful antioxidant properties, (b) crocin can alleviate the uncontrolled cytokine production responsible for acute lung injury, (c) crocin can upregulate PPARÎ³ and downregulate NF-&#954;B expression which leads to a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and (d) crocin can reduce the viral-induced oxidative stress and downregulates ACE2 expression by activating Nrf2 pathway. We hope our hypothesis, corroborated by preclinical evidence, will inspire further targeted studies to test crocin as a beneficial drug against the SARS-CoV2 infection. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Crocin is a natural antioxidant and the main active carotenoid components of saffron. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS-CoV2 infection because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, this compound may prevent viral entry to host cells and reduce SARS-CoV2-induced lung injury.

224102,"Effect of Environmental Pollution PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone on the Incidence and Mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection in London, United Kingdom",2021,"Background COVID-19 has impacted the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers and has forced pharmacists to adapt their services. Objective To measure burnout and describe the work and psychosocial factors affecting pharmacists during COVID-19, and to compare males and females. Setting An online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists practicing in any setting in Australia during April and June 2020. Method The survey collected demographic data, burnout scores using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), psychosocial and work-related variables using questions adapted from previous surveys. It was tested for readability by a group of pharmacists and academic clinicians before distribution via social media and professional organisations. Main outcome measure Burnout was calculated using mean MBI scores, descriptive statistics were used to report work and psychosocial variables and Pearson's chi-square compared males and females. Results Overall, 647 responses were analysed. Most participants were female n = 487 (75.7%) with hospital n = 269 (42.2%) and community n = 253 (39.9%) pharmacists well represented. Mean (SD) for emotional exhaustion (possible range 0-54) and depersonalisation (possible range 0-30) were 28.5 (13.39) and 7.98 (5.64), which were higher (increased burnout) than reported pre-COVID-19. Personal accomplishment (range 0-48, lower scores associated with burnout) mean (SD) 36.58 (7.56), was similar to previously reported. Males reported higher depersonalisation indicating more withdrawal and cynicism. Working overtime, medication supply and patient incivility were reported to affect work. Conclusion Pharmacists are experiencing burnout, with work and psychosocial factors affecting them during COVID-19. Knowledge of this and that males experience more depersonalisation is valuable to inform advocacy and interventions to support pharmacists.","Johnston, Karlee; O039,; Reilly, Claire L; Scholz, Brett; Georgousopoulou, Ekavi N; Mitchell, Imogen",Int J Clin Pharm,,721

METHOD: An active screening for olfactory dysfunction using water and vinegar was conducted in April to June 2020 among 4120 meat packing workers in Latin America. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the active olfactory screening examination were 41.2% and 85.3%, respectively, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests as a gold standard. 10.6% of employees who tested positive for COVID-19 had an olfactory dysfunction as their only symptom. These individuals would not have been identified with standard workplace screening measures including temperature screening. CONCLUSION: Active screening for olfactory dysfunction may serve as a valuable tool to both identify potential COVID-19 infections and exclude those who do not have infection and should be a part of parallel algorithm combined with standard workplace entrance screening procedures.","Kalia, Nimisha; Moraga, Jessica Aguilar; Manzanares, Max; Friede, Vanessa; Kusti, Mohannad; Bernacki, Edward J; Tao, Xuguang Grant",J Occup Environ Med,,721

Although different antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs are used, current evidence is insufficient as to which drug is more efficient. Our study compared favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) therapies in inpatient care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic data, test results, treatments, and latest status of patients receiving inpatient COVID-19 pneumonia therapy were recorded. The initial favipiravir and LPV/RTV receiving groups were compared regarding the need for intensive care units (ICU) and mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed by including variables showing significant differences as a result of paired comparisons into the model. RESULTS: Of the 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 59 (28.9%), 131 (64.2%), and 14 were administered LPV/RTV, favipiravir, and favipiravir with LPV/RTV, respectively. No difference was found in age, sex, presence of comorbidity, and tocilizumab, systemic corticosteroid, and plasma therapy use between patients administered with these three different treatment regimens. The mean mortality age of the patients was 71±14.3 years, which was substantially greater than that of the survivors (54.2±15.5 years). Compared with patients administered with LPV/RTV, ICU admission and mortality rates were lower in patients administered with favipiravir. CK-MB, AST, CRP, LDH, and creatinine levels were higher, whereas lymphocyte counts were lower in patients who died. Age, AST, CRP, LDH, and neutrophil counts were higher in patients needing ICU, and eosinophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower. Logistic regression analysis showed that favipiravir use independently decreased mortality (P=0.006). CONCLUSION: The use of favipiravir was more effective than LPV/RTV in reducing mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Çinarka, HalIt; GÜnlÜoGlu, GÜlSah; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yurt, SIbel; Kiyik, Murat; KoSar, AySe FIlIz; TanriverdI, ElIf; Arslan, MelIh Akay; BaydIlI, KÜrSad NurI; KoÇ, Aysu SInem; Altin, Sedat; ÇetInkaya, ErdoGan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,,721

227562,Viable SARS-CoV-2 Shedding,2021,"BackgroundIt was urgent and necessary to synthesize the evidence for vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness profile of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC. MethodsPublished and preprinted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies that evaluated the VE against VOC (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta) were searched until 31 August 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. VE was defined as (1- estimate). ResultsSeven RCTs (51,169 participants), 10 cohort studies (14,385,909 participants) and 16 case-control studies (734,607 cases) were included. Eight COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BBV152, CoronaVac, and BBIBP-CorV) were included in this analysis. Full vaccination was effective against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants, with VE of 88.3% (95% CI, 82.4-92.2), 70.7% (95% CI, 59.9-78.5), and 71.6% (95% CI, 64.1-77.4), respectively. But partial vaccination was less effective, with VE of 59.0% (95% CI, 51.3-65.5), 49.3% (95% CI, 33.0-61.6), and 52.6% (95% CI, 43.3-60.4), respectively. mRNA vaccines seemed to have higher VE against VOC over others, significant interactions (pinteraction < 0.10) were observed between VE and vaccine type (mRNA vaccines vs. non-mRNA vaccines). ConclusionsFull vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines is highly effective against Alpha variant, and moderate effective against Beta/Gamma and Delta variants. Partial vaccination has less VE against VOC. mRNA vaccines seem to have higher VE against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants over others.","Zeng, Baoqi; Gao, Le; Zhou, Qingxin; Yu, Kai; Sun, Feng",,,721

We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish COVID-19 from CAP. Methods: We compared the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission and 221 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of COVID-19 were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results: Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19 were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be predictive of a diagnosis of COVID-19. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.87 and hemoglobin with an AUC of 0.81. Red blood cell, albumin, eosinophil, hematocrit, alkaline phosphatase, and mean platelet volume had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions: Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","Pan, Yunbao; Ye, Guangming; Zeng, Xiantao; Liu, Guohong; Zeng, Xiaojiao; Jiang, Xianghu; Zhao, Jin; Chen, Liangjun; Guo, Shuang; Deng, Qiaoling; Hong, Xiaoyue; Yang, Ying; Li, Yirong; Wang, Xinghuan",Clin.

228311,Peripheral Neuropathy as a Complication of SARS-Cov-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Office blood pressure (OBP) measurement is the most common method of blood pressure measurement. However, it is associated with several pitfalls as white coat effect and masked hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is usually used for diagnosis of hypertension and elimination of white coat effect. This study aimed to assess the correlation and degree of agreement of the automated sequential blood pressure (ASqBP) with OBP and ABPM. Patients presented to hypertension clinic were included. Each patient had his blood pressure recorded by three methods: OBP using a digital sphygmomanometer device, unattended ASqBP using sequential BP devices with recording of the readings over 30 min, and ABPM that was performed within 48 h of office visit using portable BP devices with BP recording over 24 h. RESULTS: We recruited 64 patients (age 50.0 ± 15.0 years and female gender 53.1%). We found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and OBP readings (r 0.81 for SBP and 0.83 for DBP, p < 0.001). We also found a strong positive correlation between ASqBP and ABPM readings (r 0.74, p < 0.001). The ASqBP readings were lower than OBP (137.0 ± 16.8/86.4 ± 13.8 vs. 142.7 ± 15.5/88.5 ± 12.3) and close to ABPM readings (average 24 h, 134.0 ± 15.4/88.5 ± 12.3, and daytime, 135.8 ± 15.7/82.1 ± 13.7). For SBP readings, there was moderate agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). For DBP readings, there was fair agreement between ASqBP and AMBP (both average and daytime). CONCLUSION: ASqBP measurement has good correlation with OBP and ABPM readings. Unattended automated office pressure has moderate degree of agreement with ABPM for the SBP& fair degree of agreement for the DBP. It can be used in the hypertension clinics to eliminate the problems of white coat effect and marked BP variability.","Mahmoud, Kareem; ElAroussy, Ayah; Baghdady, Yasser; ElAroussy, Wafaa; ElDeeb, Heba",Egypt Heart J,,721

The final, copyedited version of the paper will be available at a later date. Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols, transmission by fomites remains plausible. During Halloween, a major event for children in numerous countries, SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk via candy fomites worries many parents. To address this concern, we enrolled 10 recently diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly/moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients to handle typical Halloween candy (pieces individually wrapped) under three conditions: normal handling with unwashed hands, deliberate coughing and extensive touching, and normal handling following handwashing. We then used a factorial design to subject the candies to two post-handling treatments: no washing (untreated) and household dishwashing detergent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 load by RT-qPCR and LAMP. From the candies not washed post-handling, we detected SARS-CoV-2 on 60% of candies that were deliberately coughed on, 60% of candies normally handled with unwashed hands, but only 10% of candies handled after hand washing. We found that treating candy with dishwashing detergent reduced SARS-CoV-2 load by 62.1% in comparison to untreated candy. Taken together, these results suggest that although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is low even from known COVID-19 patients, viral RNA load can be reduced to near zero by the combination of handwashing by the infected patient and &#8805;1 minute detergent treatment after collection. We also found that the inexpensive and fast LAMP protocol was more than 80% concordant with RT-qPCR.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to important tradeoffs between risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mental health due to deprivation from normal activities, with these impacts being especially profound in children. Due to the ongoing pandemic, Halloween activities will be curtailed as a result of the concern that candy from strangers might act as fomites. Here we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands, and by washing collected candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent. We conclude that with reasonable precautions, even if followed only by either the candy giver or the candy recipient, the risk of viral transmission by this route is very low.","Salido, Rodolfo A; Morgan, Sydney C; Rojas, Maria I; Magallanes, Celestine G; Marotz, Clarisse; DeHoff, Peter; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; Aigner, Stefan; Kado, Deborah M; Yeo, Gene W; Gilbert, Jack A; Laurent, Louise; Rohwer, Forest; Knight, Rob",,,721

Research on SARS-CoV-2 has produced an abundance of data spanning multiple parallels, including clinical data, SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture, host response captured through transcriptome and genetic variants, microbial co-infections (metagenome), and comorbidities. Disease phenotypes in the case of COVID-19 present an intriguing complexity that includes a broad range of symptomatic to asymptomatic individuals, further compounded by a vast heterogeneity within the spectrum of clinical symptoms displayed by the symptomatic individuals. The clinical outcome is further modulated by the presence of comorbid conditions at the point of infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced an expansive wealth of literature touching many aspects of SARS-CoV-2 ranging from causal to outcome, predisposition to protective (possible), co-infection to comorbidity, and differential mortality globally. As challenges provide opportunities, the current pandemic's challenge has underscored the need and opportunity to work for an integrative approach that may be able to thread together the multiple variables. Through this review, we have made an effort towards bringing together information spanning across different domains to facilitate researchers globally in pursuit of their response to SARS-CoV-2.","Kanakan, Akshay; Mishra, Neha; Srinivasa Vasudevan, Janani; Sahni, Shweta; Khan, Azka; Sharma, Sachin; Pandey, Rajesh",,,721

The aim of this study was the synthesis and evaluation of in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity for phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin 3-5 as well as an in silico study of new compounds as potential ligands of the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid-spacer peptide 1 (CA-CTD-SP1) as a molecular target of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors. In vitro studies showed that 28-diethoxyphosphoryl-3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulin (compound 3), the phosphate analog of bevirimat (betulinic acid derivative, HIV-1 maturation inhibitor), has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) equal to 0.02 µM. Compound 3 inhibits viral replication at a level comparable to bevirimat and is also more selective (selectivity indices = 1250 and 967, respectively). Molecular docking was used to examine the probable interaction between the phosphate derivatives of 3-carboxyacylbetulin and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the HIV-1 capsid (CA)-spacer peptide 1 (SP1) fragment of Gag protein, designated as CTD-SP1. Compared with interactions between bevirimat (BVM) and the protein, an increased number of strong interactions between ligand 3 and the protein, generated by the phosphate group, were observed. These compounds might have the potential to also inhibit SARS-CoV2 proteins, in as far as the intrinsically imprecise docking scores suggest.","Marciniec, Krzysztof; Chrobak, Elwira; Dabrowska, Aleksandra; Bebenek, Ewa; Kadela-Tomanek, Monika; Pecak, Pawel; Boryczka, Stanislaw",Biomolecules,,721

(Das 2006) and ?fall? (Rosaldo 2014) into accepting improvisation of life and death forms This descent and fall can be towards an abyss risking the very continuum of life, but what we also gain from discerning the relation of mourning with knowledge is that life can be regained at many levels of the fall Just as the unreposed dead manifest the sovereignty of the virus, I suggest this descent and fall can be ethically attested in improvisation as the social surface of regaining life It is my contention that this full-time improvisation, which in turn must be its own source, energy and end, must operate facing the unreposed dead Deriving and extending from my own work of studying the dead, the present essay shows this improvisation and regaining of life through two brief assemblages of bacteriophage virus and media morgue The relation of mourning and knowledge is built through the essay to arrive at the conclusion that the classic trope of life cycle in anthropology has to be seen as part of a complex texture of the social where vitality and the unreposed dead are concurrent and overlapping","Singh, Ravi Nandan",Society and Culture in South Asia,,721

The dataset included 2087 chest CT exams collected from four hospitals between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2020. The true positive rate, true negative rate, receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC) and convolutional feature map were used to evaluate the model. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning model was trained on 1538 patients and tested on an independent testing cohort of 549 patients. The overall sensitivity was 91.5% (195/213; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 89.2-93.9%), the overall specificity was 90.5% (304/336; p < 0.001, 95% CI: 88.0-92.9%) and the general AUC value was 0.955 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model can accurately detect COVID-19 and serve as an important supplement to the COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. KEY POINTS: â¢ The implementation of a deep learning model to identify mild COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed to be effective and feasible. â¢ The strategy of using a binary code instead of the region of interest label to identify mild COVID-19 pneumonia was verified. â¢ This AI model can assist in the early screening of COVID-19 without interfering with normal clinical examinations.","Yao, Jin-Cao; Wang, Tao; Hou, Guang-Hua; Ou, Di; Li, Wei; Zhu, Qiao-Dan; Chen, Wen-Cong; Yang, Chen; Wang, Li-Jing; Wang, Li-Ping; Fan, Lin-Yin; Shi, Kai-Yuan; Zhang, Jie; Xu, Dong; Li, Ya-Qing",Eur. radiol,,721

Overall, 1219 respondents participated in the survey. The mean age was 32 ± 13 years;693 participants (57%) were female. In total, 1109 (91%) of the participants indicated they were willing to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, if the vaccine is at least 95% effective;835 (68.5%) if it is 90% effective and 493 (40.5%) if it is 70% effective;676 (55.5%) participants indicated they feared side effects and 237 (19.4%) thought the vaccine was not effective. Older age, having had a postgraduate education, a history of a negative COVID-19 test, a high level of worry of contracting COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 infection can be prevented with a vaccine and understanding there is currently an effective vaccine against COVID-19 were associated with higher vaccination acceptance. A vaccination education campaign will be needed to increase the knowledge of Ecuadorians about the COVID-19 vaccine and to increase their trust in the vaccine. People with a lower education level and living in rural areas may need to be targeted during such a campaign.","Jaramillo-Monge, Julio Obimpeh Michael Vega Bernardo Acurio David Boven Annelies Verhoeven Veronique Colebunders Robert",Vaccines,,721

We examined the educational effects of the program by evaluating clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation among the participants, namely 27 nurses in the emergency center of a general hospital. Data were collected from 3 to 24 May 2017, and analyzed using SPSS 22.0. There was a significant difference in nurses' mean scores on clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation before and after the simulation-based education. In other words, after completing the KTAS-based simulation education program, the emergency nurses showed improved clinical decision-making ability, job satisfaction, and customer orientation. Based on the results of this study, it is expected that this educational program can be effectively used for KTAS education, and it was confirmed that simulation-based education is a useful learning method for triage nurses in emergency medical centers.","Jang, Jae-Hyuk; Kim, Sang Suk; Kim, Sunghee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

The reallocation of medical resources, staff, and ambulatory services, as well as critical shortages in pharmaceutical and medical supplies have compelled healthcare professionals to prioritize patients with cancer to treatment and screening services based on a set of classification criteria in cancer-related guidelines. Cancer patients themselves have been affected on multiple levels, and addressing their concerns poses another challenge to the oncology community. (2) Methods: We conducted a Canada-wide search of cancer-related clinical practice guidelines on the management and prioritization of individuals into treatment and screening services. We also outlined the resources provided by Canadian cancer charities and patient advocacy groups to provide cancer patients, or potential cancer patients, with useful information and valuable support resources. (3) Results: The identified provincial guidelines emphasized cancer care (i.e., treatment) more than cancer control (i.e., screening). For cancer-related resources, a clear significance was placed on knowledge & awareness and supportive resources, mainly relating to mental health. (4) Conclusion: We provided a guidance document outlining cancer-related guidelines and resources that are available to healthcare providers and patients across Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Farah, Eliya; Ali, Rami; Tope, Parker; El-Zein, Mariam; Franco, Eduardo L",Curr Oncol,,721
235936,Measures to Protect the Health and Safety of Massachusetts Employees Who Must Work at the Workplace During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: All over the world, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is causing a significant short-term morbidity and mortality, but the medium-term impact on lung function and quality of life of affected patients are still unknown. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were recruited from a single COVID-19 hospital in Southern Switzerland. At three months patients underwent radiological and functional follow-up through CT scan, lung function tests, and 6 min walking test. Furthermore, quality of life was assessed through self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 32 (82% of all participants) presented abnormalities in CT scan and 25 (64.1%) had lung function tests impairment at three months. Moreover, 31 patients (79.5%) reported a perception of poor health due to respiratory symptoms and all 39 patients showed an overall decreased quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-term follow up at three months of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia shows the persistence of abnormalities in CT scans, a significant functional impairment assessed by lung function tests and a decreased quality of life in affected patients. Further studies evaluating the long-term impact are warranted to guarantee an appropriate follow-up to patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Gianella, Pietro; Rigamonti, Elia; Marando, Marco; Tamburello, Adriana; Grazioli Gauthier, Lorenzo; Argentieri, Gianluca; Puligheddu, Carla; Pagnamenta, Alberto; Pons, Marco; Fusi-Schmidhauser, Tanja",BMC Pulm Med,,721
236222,SARS-CoV-2 serology across scales: a framework for unbiased seroprevalence estimation incorporating antibody kinetics and epidemic recency,2021,"To explore the metabolic changes and immune profiles in patients with COVID-19, we analyzed the data of patients with mild and severe COVID-19 as well as young children with COVID-19. Of the leukocytes, 47% (IQR, 33-59) were lymphocytes [2.5 × 109/L (IQR, 2.2-3.3)], and monocytes were 0.51 × 109/L (IQR, 0.45-0.57) in young children with COVID-19. In 32 mild COVID-19 patients, circulating monocytes were 0.45 × 109/L (IQR, 0.36-0.64). Twenty-one severe patients had low PO2 [57 mmHg (IQR, 50-73)] and SO2 [90% (IQR, 86-93)] and high lactate dehydrogenase [580 U/L (IQR, 447-696)], cardiac troponin I [0.07 ng/mL (IQR, 0.02-0.30)], and pro-BNP [498 pg/mL (IQR, 241-1,726)]. Serum D-dimer and FDP were 9.89 mg/L (IQR, 3.62-22.85) and 32.7 mg/L (IQR, 12.8-81.9), and a large number of RBC (46/µL (IQR, 4-242) was presented in urine, a cue of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in severe patients. Three patients had comorbidity with diabetes, and 18 patients without diabetes also presented high blood glucose [7.4 mmol/L (IQR, 5.9-10.1)]. Fifteen of 21 (71%) severe cases had urine glucose +, and nine of 21 (43%) had urine ketone body +. The increased glucose was partially caused by reduced glucose consumption of cells. Severe cases had extraordinarily low serum uric acid [176 µmol/L (IQR, 131-256)]. In the late stage of COVID-19, severe cases had extremely low CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, but unusually high neutrophils [6.5 × 109/L (IQR, 4.8-9.6)], procalcitonin [0.27 ng/mL (IQR, 0.14-1.94)], C-reactive protein [66 mg/L (IQR, 25-114)] and an extremely high level of interleukin-6. Four of 21 (19%) severe cases had co-infection with fungi, and two of 21 (9%) severe cases had bacterial infection. Our findings suggest that, severe cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) I-III, and metabolic disorders of glucose, lipid, uric acid, etc., even multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) and DIC. Increased neutrophils and severe inflammatory responses were involved in ARDS, MODS, and DIC. With the dramatical decrease of T-lymphocytes, severe cases were susceptible to co-infect with bacteria and fungi in the late stage of COVID-19. In young children, extremely high lymphocytes and monocytes might be associated with the low morbidity of COVID-19. The significantly increased monocytes might play an important role in the recovery of patients with mild COVID-19.","He, Bing; Wang, Jun; Wang, Yudie; Zhao, Juan; Huang, Juan; Tian, Yu; Yang, Cheng; Zhang, Heng; Zhang, Mingxia; Gu, Lixing; Zhou, Xiaocui; Zhou, Jingjiao",Front Immunol,,721

To provide information essential for understanding the biologic underpinnings of this association, we analyzed whole-transcriptome RNA expression data obtained from a large cohort of cancer patients to characterize expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and other proteases that are involved in viral attachment to and entry into target cells. We find substantial variability of expression of these factors across tumor types and identify subpopulations expressing ACE2 at very high levels. In some tumor types, especially in gastrointestinal cancers, expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is highly correlated. Furthermore, we found infiltration with T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration to be particularly pronounced in ACE2-high tumors. These findings suggest that subsets of cancer patients exist with gene expression profiles that may be associated with heightened susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in whom malignant tumors function as viral reservoir and possibly promote the frequently detrimental hyper-immune response in patients infected with this virus.","Elliott, Andrew; Saul, Michelle; Zeng, Jia; Marshall, John L; Kim, Edward S; Nagasaka, Misako; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Schwartzberg, Lee; Spetzler, David; Abraham, Jim; Xiu, Joanne; Stafford, Phillip; Michael Korn, W",Sci Rep,,721

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a public health crisis that affects every nation in the world. METHODS: Purposeful sampling was used to recruit 28 leaders in a large health care system. Data were collected via semi-structured audiotaped interviews. Results were analysed using hermeneutic phenomenology. RESULTS: The structure in which leaders worked was described as: from the day-to-day grind to derailment and from manning the hospital to manning the frontlines. Five phenomenological themes were as follows: embodied leadership, navigating differently, trusting and earning trust, being the calm voice and envisioning the future. CONCLUSION: Disaster policies and procedures are needed that will alleviate leadership angst, maximize nursing resources, heighten trust and enhance communications. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: In 2020, we witnessed a previously inconceivable media and public focus on the value of nursing care.

240035,Azithromycin: Immunomodulatory and antiviral properties for SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been widely employed to treat acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia, but their role in terms of efficacy and safety are still debated. The aim of this review was to analyse mortality and intubation rates in COVID-19 patients treated with NIV/CPAP. METHODS: Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published since December-2019 until November-2020 with available data on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients treated with NIV or CPAP. RESULTS: 23 manuscripts were included (4776 patients, 66% males, 46% with hypertension). 46% of patients received non-invasive respiratory support, of which 48.4% with CPAP, 46% with NIV, and 4% with either CPAP or NIV. Non-invasive respiratory support failed in 47.7% of patients, of which 26.5% were intubated and 40.9% died. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients treated with NIV compared with CPAP (35.1% vs. 22.2%). Complications were under-reported, but mostly not related to CPAP/NIV treatment. CONCLUSION: CPAP and NIV appear equally and frequently applied in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but associated with high mortality. Robust evidence is urgently needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of non-invasive respiratory support in COVID-19-related ARDS.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Coppola, Silvia; Franceschi, Elisa; Gervasoni, Fabrizio; Duscio, Eleonora; Chiumello, Davide Alberto; Santus, Pierachille",J Crit Care,,721
240398,Cytologic and molecular correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are key in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, delays of boost immunization due to limited availability of vaccines may leave individuals vulnerable to infection and prolonged or severe disease courses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil), may exacerbate this issue, as the latter two are able to evade control by antibodies. METHODS: We assessed humoral and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 WT, VOC and endemic human coronaviruses (hCoV) that were induced after single and double vaccination with BNT162b2. RESULTS: Despite readily detectable IgG against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at day 14 after a single vaccination, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-driven host cell entry was weak and particularly low for the B.1.351 variant. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 WT and VOC specific T cells were low in many vaccinees after application of a single dose and influenced by immunity against endemic hCoV. The second vaccination significantly boosted T cell frequencies reactive for WT, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. CONCLUSION: These results call into question whether neutralizing antibodies significantly contribute to protection against COVID-19 upon single vaccination and suggest that cellular immunity is central for the early defenses against COVID-19.","Stankov, Metodi V; Cossmann, Anne; Bonifacius, Agnes; Dopfer-Jablonka, Alexandra; Ramos, Gema Morillas; Gödecke, Nina; Scharff, Anna Zychlinsky; Happle, Christine; Boeck, Anna-Lena; Tran, Anh Thu; Pink, Isabell; Hoeper, Marius M; Blasczyk, Rainer; Winkler, Martin S; Nehlmeier, Inga; Kempf, Amy; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Hoffmann, Markus; Eiz-Vesper, Britta; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Behrens, Georg M N",Clin. infect. dis,,721

Most recently, it has been widely utilized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most previous studies have not performed in-depth analyses of patient satisfaction with telehealth technologies. This project investigated patient satisfaction with the abrupt implementation of telemedicine within pediatric surgical subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a single-center review to determine patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the early stages of the pandemic. Surveys were distributed to patients who completed a telemedicine video visit within a pediatric surgical subspecialty at Connecticut Children's Medical Center between March 16 and May 16, 2020. Results: A total of 1,608 patients were contacted, with 457 surveys completed (28.4%). Of all respondents, 95.6% were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their overall telemedicine appointment. Seventy-three percent reported no difficulty with completing their visit. Eighty-seven percent would consider another telemedicine visit again in the future. No significant difference was found between the payor mix for telemedicine and in-person appointments. Conclusions: The implementation of telemedicine at Connecticut Children's Medical Center during the COVID-19 pandemic was successful despite numerous barriers to use. Families not only showed high rates of satisfaction with the overall visit and provider interaction, but also an overwhelming openness to future use of telehealth.","Schmidtberg, Lauren C; Grindle, Christopher; Hersh, David S; Rowe, Courtney; Healy, James; Hughes, Christopher D",Telemed. j. e. health,,721

242154,New threatening of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection and strategies to fight the current pandemic,2021,"Motivation: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

(Special Issue: Focus on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.),2020,"Multi-state models provide an extension of the usual survival/event-history analysis setting. In the medical domain, multi-state models give the possibility of further investigating intermediate events such as relapse and remission. In this work, a further extension is proposed using relative survival, where mortality due to population causes (i.e. non-disease-related mortality) is evaluated. The objective is to split all mortality in disease and non-disease-related mortality, with and without intermediate events, in datasets where cause of death is not recorded or is uncertain. To this end, population mortality tables are integrated into the estimation process, while using the basic relative survival idea that the overall mortality hazard can be written as a sum of a population and an excess part. Hence, we propose an upgraded non-parametric approach to estimation, where population mortality is taken into account. Precise definitions and suitable estimators are given for both the transition hazards and probabilities. Variance estimating techniques and confidence intervals are introduced and the behaviour of the new method is investigated through simulations. The newly developed methodology is illustrated by the analysis of a cohort of patients followed after an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The work is also implemented in the R package mstate.","Manevski, D.; Putter, H.; Perme, M. Pohar; Bonneville, E. F.; Schetelig, J.; Wreede, L. C. de",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12399v1.pdf,721
245875,Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ex-vivo human lung tissues by targeting class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase,2020,"In the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., consumers experienced surprising shortages of essential goods such as toilet paper, yeast and flour, and some of their favorite meat cuts that appeared to be unrelated to the pandemic at first look. The “usual” explanations attributing these shortages to “demand spikes” (e.g., foreign suppliers, trade wars and tariffs, and “hoarding behavior” of panicked consumers) often failed to explain them, and in the best of cases, predicted only temporary shortages. However, shortages in these supply chains ended up being in many cases real “supply chain struggles,” with their true causes going beyond the “usual” ones, and revealing a set of deeper and “unusual causes.” Our detailed analysis of the affected supply chains identifies these overlooked failure factors and hidden causes. Our underestimated causes include demand shifts among market segments, siloed demand planning, bottlenecks in shared resources such as transportation and distribution, and supply chain structures driven by the economics of an efficiency era that failed in a risk-fraught environment. We conclude on the profound lessons learned from the pandemic crisis on supply chains, and the implied challenges to address for building resilient supply chains for the future. The resilient supply chains of the future require rethinking the relevant “systems” we plan and optimize (e.g., firm, industry, region, global factor resources, etc.). The usual answer of building firm-specific redundancy of assets and operational flexibility might be prohibitive in the level of investment required for any one firm, or their financial stakeholders, to pursue and accept.","Kouvelis, Panos",Business Horizons,,721

The patterns of dependency between such measures and their effects on disease incidence may vary dynamically and across different populations. We described a new computational framework to measure and compare the temporal relationships between human mobility and new cases of COVID-19 across more than 150 cities of the United States with relatively high incidence of the disease. We used a novel application of Optimal Transport for computing the distance between the normalized patterns induced by bivariate time series for each pair of cities. Thus, we identified 10 clusters of cities with similar temporal dependencies, and computed the Wasserstein barycenter to describe the overall dynamic pattern for each cluster. Finally, we used city-specific socioeconomic covariates to analyze the composition of each cluster.","Nielsen, Frank; Marti, Gautier; Ray, Sumanta; Pyne, Saumyadipta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10677v1.pdf,721
247433,The Lung Macrophage in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Friend or a Foe?,2020,"Background: Little is known about the COVID-19 impact on Russian medical, psychology and social work students’ psycho-emotional well-being, substance use and resilience. Methods: More than 2000 helping profession students, 75.4% female, participated in an online survey about COVID-19 impact at a peak time of infection (October/November 2020). The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were used for study purposes. Furthermore, the influence of COVID-19 on student psycho-emotional well-being and substance use (i.e., tobacco and alcohol) was examined. Results: Medical, female and religious students reported higher fear values. Social work students reported more current substance use, including binge drinking (five or more drinks on one particular occasion). Students who reported COVID-19 associated with their psycho-emotional well-being had higher fear values. Regarding resilience, no association was found based on the student study area. However, male and non-religious students reported more resilience. Students who reported substance use and psycho-emotional problems had lower resilience values. Conclusion: COVID-19 fear and substance use differs among Russian students based on background characteristics. including gender, religiosity and study area. The FCV-19S and the BRS were found to be reliable instruments for research of COVID-19-related psycho-emotional problems, substance use and resilience. Study findings have implications for “front line” helping profession students in terms of education, training and intervention, in support of promoting their ability to address difficult conditions resulting from the pandemic and other disaster conditions in the future.","Konstantinov, Vsevolod Gritsenko Valentina Zinurova Raushaniia Kulesh Elena Osipenko Irina Reznik Alexander Isralowitz Richard",Psych,,721

Infection prevention and control guidelines have been created and updated to include important preventive measures such as switching from reusable needles to sterile single use ones, use of vacuumassisted blood collection systems, non-breakable containers, as well as use of gloves as part of routine personal protective equipment for invasive maneuvers, to name only a few. HIV infection has changed over these past 40 years from a death sentence1 to a treatable chronic infection and now, after 4 decades of medical development, with efficient treatment options widely available, the main focus of medical care is on quality of life, long-term impact of ARVs, drug-drug interactions, as well as evaluation and management of comorbidities in a mature but aging population.2 While virological and immunological control of HIV infection have remained important targets of ARV treatment, the focus of medical care now also goes beyond viral suppression, towards the overall wellbeing of the patient, through integrated management and person-centered HIV care.3,4 Similar to how HIV infection represented a turning point in infectious diseases, SARS-CoV-2 infection has represented a turning point in 2020, and definitely a new era in infectious diseases has started, for which we are better prepared.","Streinu-Cercel, Adrian",Germs,,721
248171,[Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2],2020,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how obtaining a medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling versus traditional in-clinic care impacted participants' access to care. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who completed a medication abortion by mail through the TelAbortion study. We asked participants how they learned about telemedicine abortion, reasons for choosing it, what their alternative would have been, and about their experience. We transcribed, coded, and performed qualitative content analysis of the interviews and are presenting a subset of themes related to access to care when the restrictions on clinic dispensing of mifepristone are removed. RESULTS: We interviewed 45 people from January to July 2020. Direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion was more convenient and accessible than in-clinic abortion care when considering the burdens of travel, clinic availability, logistics, and cost that were associated with in-clinic abortion. Stigma led to a prioritization of privacy, and by going to a clinic, participants feared a loss of privacy whereas obtaining a medication abortion by mail made it easier to maintain confidentiality. Faced with these barriers, 13% of participants stated they would have continued their pregnancy if TelAbortion had not been an option. Participants found direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be acceptable and recommended it to others. Benefits of telemedicine were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns around infection exposure with in-clinic care. CONCLUSION: Going to a clinic was a burden for participants, to the point where some would not have otherwise been able to get an abortion. Medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling was a highly acceptable alternative. IMPLICATIONS: Medication abortion by mail can increase access to abortion with the added benefits of increased perceived privacy and decreased logistical burdens. Removing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone would allow direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be implemented outside of a research setting without compromising the patient experience.","Kerestes, Courtney; Delafield, Rebecca; Elia, Jennifer; Chong, Erica; Kaneshiro, Bliss; Soon, Reni",Contraception,,721

253126,No evidence of hemoglobin damage by SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Global supply chains (GoSCs) have become common for industries. However, relatively little research has emphasized products' complex supply chain environmental assessments. Against this background, this paper maps key environmental issues in the GoSCs of the West Africa cashew industry. The initial-oriented green design and supply chain-wide assessment of the kernel product system was conducted through an eco-design approach based on the matrix method, life cycle design strategy wheel and analytical hierarchical process. The results reveal static/technical eco-design issues that can reduce negative environmental impacts. Additionally, it highlights the strategic opportunities for redesign related to the selection of low-impact materials and gaseous emission. The main issues that arise in mapping the complex supply chains such as the need to re-examine some environmental issues such as solid and liquid residues from production and processing stages as more strategic concerns are discussed. In conclusion, the study points out that it is important not to compromise supply chain-wide assessment of environmental impacts and to understand both technical and strategic values of environmental issues in complex supply chains of products even at the initial stage of interest in green supply chain design. Thus, the eco-design approach of the study has potential to enhance environmental sustainability.","Agyemang, Martin; Jia, Fu; Faibil, Daniel; Lin, Zhongyan",,,721

The data collected included the patients' demographic data, presenting symptoms, clinical features, laboratory parameters, diagnostic investigations, and medications. Of 27 children with MIS-C, 63 % were male. The median age of the patients was nine years. Intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids were used for treatment in 100 % of the patients, anakinra in 51.8 %, vasopressors in 85.1 %, noninvasive mechanical ventilation in 25.9 %, and invasive mechanical ventilation in 18.5 %. Ten of the 27 patients (37 %) underwent TPE. In the patients who underwent TPE, the median PELOD score was 21 (IQR: 11-30.25) before TPE and 10 (IQR: 10-11) after TPE (p < 0.001). Moreover, their median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 52 % (IQR: 49.25 %-55 %) before TPE and median LVEF was 66.5 (IQR: 58 %-68.5 %) after TPE (p = 0.012). The median number of TPE sessions was three (IQR: 2-4.75). The mortality rate of the patients with severe MIS-C admitted to the PICU was 7.4 %. We suggest that TPE should be considered as a therapeutic option in children with severe MIS-C. Early initiation of TPE followed by immunomodulatory therapy in critically ill children with MIS-C may help improve clinical and laboratory outcomes.","Emeksiz, Serhat; Özcan, Serhan; Perk, Oktay; Uyar, Emel; Çelikel Acar, Banu; Kibar Gül, Ayse Esin; Özkaya Parlakay, Aslinur; Özbek, Namik; Ekici Tekin, Zahide; Coskun, Serkan; Aydin, Fatma; Çelikel, Elif; Kavurt, Ahmet Vedat; Ece, Ibrahim; Ok Bozkaya, Ikbal; Ertürk, Ahmet; Güney, Dogus; Senel, Emrah",Transfus Apher Sci,,721

258353,SARS-CoV-2 and the testis: similarity with other viruses and routes of infection,2020,"Deciphering the dynamic changes in antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is essential for understanding the immune response in COVID-19 patients. Here we analyze the laboratory findings of 1,850 patients to describe the dynamic changes of the total antibody, spike protein (S)-, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels during SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery. The generation of S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG occurs one week later in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 compared to patients with mild/moderate disease, while S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during hospitalization. The RBD-specific IgG levels are 4-fold higher in older patients than in younger patients during hospitalization. In addition, the S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in the recovered patients who are SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative than those who are RNA positive. Lower S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG levels are associated with a lower lymphocyte percentage, higher neutrophil percentage, and a longer duration of viral shedding. Patients with low antibody levels on discharge might thereby have a high chance of being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery. Our study provides important information for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development.","Li, Kening; Huang, Bin; Wu, Min; Zhong, Aifang; Li, Lu; Cai, Yun; Wang, Zhihua; Wu, Lingxiang; Zhu, Mengyan; Li, Jie; Wang, Ziyu; Wu, Wei; Li, Wanlin; Bosco, Bakwatanisa; Gan, Zhenhua; Qiao, Qinghua; Wu, Jian; Wang, Qianghu; Wang, Shukui; Xia, Xinyi",Nat Commun,,721

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction. We hope the achievements reached thus far will outlive COVID-19 and provide an infrastructure to make science computable for future generations.

Cancer has been identified as one of the major comorbidities which cause more severe disease due to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, there are several resource limitations and restrictions to avail the standard oncological health facilities due to robust measures taken for infection control. In this situation, palliative care in cancer patients deserves special attention. Their symptom management, psychological, social, cultural needs tremendously increase during the epidemic. Thus, we need to recognize the unique palliative care needs of cancer patients during pandemic and formulate the plan to maintain continuity of services. Triaging systems are essential tools for proper resource allocation during a pandemic. Therefore, we suggest triaging tools for emergency in hospital palliative care services: community-based palliative care and end of life care for cancer patients.

263643,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and its individual differences with ACE2-expressing human iPS cells,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Empagliflozin reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in clinical trials. A registry study was undertaken to describe evolution of patient characteristics and assess the real-world effectiveness/safety of empagliflozin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV)/Diabetes Versorgungsevaluation (DIVE) registries on 9571 adults with T2DM (registered in 2014-2019) receiving empagliflozin were used. Patients were grouped according to the following: early users (group 1; n=505) received empagliflozin before the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study publication (mid-September 2015); intermediate users (group 2; n=2961) started empagliflozin after the EMPA-REG OUTCOME publication but before the European Medicines Agency label change (from mid-September 2015 to mid-January 2017); and late users (group 3; n=6105) started empagliflozin after mid-January 2017. Data on clinical and treatment characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Over time, the proportion of recipients aged <65 years decreased (71.1% vs 54.4% among early and late adopters), male patients increased (from 50.9% to 66.5%), body mass index (mean±SD) decreased (from 35.5±6.7 to 32.7±6.6 kg/m2), proportion with cardiovascular morbidities increased (from 20.4% to 26.4%), and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (from 83.2±19.5 to 78.5±21.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) (all p<0.001). Patients increasingly received empagliflozin in combination with metformin (60.8% vs 68.6% of early and late adopters; p<0.001), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (11.0 vs 14.1%; p<0.001) or insulin (34.3% vs 49.9%; p<0.001). Empagliflozin was generally added to existing antidiabetic regimens. Six months after empagliflozin initiation, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) decreased by 0.4%, the proportion of patients with HbA1c <6.5% increased (19.2% vs 12.8%), and the mean fasting plasma glucose decreased (155.8±49.7 vs 168.0±55.1 mg/dL) (all p<0.001). No significant changes in rates of severe hypoglycemia and no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Over time, empagliflozin is being prescribed to a broader patient range in routine practice, is usually added to existing antidiabetic regimens, and is increasingly used in combination with metformin, GLP-1 agonists and/or insulin. Empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on glycemic control, with no increase in hypoglycemia.","Bramlage, Peter; Tittel, Sascha R; Wagner, Christian; König, Kerstin; Raddatz, Dirk; Weber-Lauffer, Rosmarie; Erath, Diether; Hilgenberg, Jost; Spies, Carsten; Danne, Thomas; Gabler, Maximilian; Foersch, Johannes; Ley, Ludwin; Seufert, Jochen",,,721

As a policy response, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare which exercises jurisdiction over telemedicine in India, rapidly issued India's first guidelines for use of telemedicine. The authors argue that: guidelines must be expanded to address ethical concerns about the use of privacy, patient data and its storage; limited access to the internet and weaknesses in the telecom infrastructure challenge widespread adoption of telemedicine; only by simultaneously improving both will use of telemedicine become equitable; Indian medical education curricula should include telemedicine and India should rapidly extend training to practitioner. They determine that for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), including India, positive externalities of investing in telemedicine are ample, thus use of this option can render healthcare more accessible and equitable in future.","Dash, Sambit; Aarthy, Ramasamy; Mohan, Viswanathan",J. public health policy,,721

266652,Tumor markers as an entry for SARS-CoV-2 infection?,2020,"Governments issue""stay at home""orders to reduce the spread of contagious diseases, but the magnitude of such orders' effectiveness is uncertain. In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level in the United States. We estimate the effect of stay-at-home orders using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) reduction in weekly cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities where they were implemented.","Fowler, James H.; Hill, Seth J.; Levin, Remy; Obradovich, Nick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06098v4.pdf,721

Methods This cross-sectional study on DHCPs was carried out at five dental teaching hospitals/colleges in four provinces of Saudi Arabia from October to December 2020. A 35-item valid and reliable questionnaire was used to assess the concerns, perceived impact, and preparedness of DHCPs in the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare parameters between the clinical and non-clinical staff. Results A total of 320 DHCPs participated in this study with proportion of clinical staff (57.5%) surpassing the non-clinical staff (42.5%). The clinical DHCPs felt greater odds of falling ill with COVID-19 than non-clinical workers (OR, 2.61) and willing to look for another job (OR, 3.50). The higher proportion in both groups was worried that people close to them would be at higher exposure risk (96.3%) however, slightly more clinical DHCPs were concerned for their children than a non-clinical worker (OR, 3.57). The clinical DHCPs have greater odds of worrying that people would avoid them and their family members because of their job (OR, 2.75). A higher proportion in both groups (75.0%, 63.2%) felt that they would feel stress at work. More non-clinical DHCPs (94.1%) had received training for infection control than clinical (94.1% vs 63.0%: OR 0.10). Similarly, more DHCPs in the nonclinical group received adequate personal protective equipment training (88.2%;OR, 0.48). Most participants practiced self-preparation such as buying masks and disinfection (94.4%, 96.9%). Conclusion The majority of DHCPs felt concerned about their risk of exposure and falling ill from infection and infecting friends/family. These concerns could potentially affect the working of DHCPs during this pandemic. Measures to improve protection for DHCPs, minimize psychological implications, and potential social stigmatization should be identified at the planning phase before any pandemic.","Muhammad Qasim, Javed Farooq Ahmad Chaudhary Mohsin Syed Fareed Mustafa Hussein AlAttas Hadeel Yaseen Edrees Syed Rashid Habib Riaz Arham",PeerJ,,721

All the papers available in the first five pages of Google Scholar using time frames of any time and 2016-2020 (10 web pages) and 2020 (five web pages) were reviewed. The review found that surveys using many different types of measurement frameworks was the methodology of choice for a majority of works. Among the topics, framework validation, care dimensions and specific problems like AIDS, surgery patients and cancer patients were researched most. Many types of measurement frameworks have been used for measuring patient perceptions of nursing care quality. Factors related to the patient, care environment and nursing were identified by the researchers. Individualised care, communicating the truth, competent and prompt care and response to various personal care needs of the patient, timely attention to urgent calls, safety, avoiding medical errors, empathy and instilling trust and confidence in the patient are important care dimensions. Patient-related dimensions are mainly demographic. They include age, education, occupation, income, marital status and certain behavioural attributes, which are outside the control of hospitals. Nurses may be able to adjust to individual behavioural problems to some extent, but not of all patients all the time. Nursing dimensions like working environment, staff strength, leadership effectiveness, involvement or empowerment for independent decision making, strain and burnout and work-life balance problems affect their care quality at professional level. At their personal level, knowledge, skills, competence and training, positive attitude towards the profession are important determinants. A care quality improvement bundle can be designed by the hospital to facilitate the nurses to improve on these factors. The hospitals need to obtain periodical feedback on the administrative aspects of nursing care from the nurses and make any improvement required to provide the proper working conditions without strain and burnout and facilitating work-life balance.","Althobaiti, Salman; Alharthi, Sultan; ALZahrani, Ali Moosa",Int.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was used to simulate spatial-temporal aerosol concentrations and quantified risks of exposure as a function of separation distance, exposure duration, environmental conditions (e.g., airflow/ventilation), and face coverings. The CFD results were combined with infectivity models to determine probability of infection, which is a function of the spatial-temporal aerosol concentrations, viral load, infectivity rate, viral viability, lung-deposition probability, and inhalation rate. Uncertainty distributions were determined for these parameters from the literature. Probabilistic analyses were performed to determine cumulative distributions of infection probabilities and to determine the most important parameters impacting transmission.

RESULTS: We synthesized data regarding common practices around 5 major domains: (1) isolation and transmission mitigation; (2) criteria for discharge to non-home settings including skilled nursing, assisted living, or homeless; (3) clinical criteria for discharge including oxygenation levels, fever, and symptom improvement; (4) social support and ability to perform activities of daily living; (5) post-discharge instructions, monitoring, and follow-up. LIMITATIONS: We used streamlined methods for rapid review of published guidance and collected discharge documents only in a focused sample of US academic medical centers. CONCLUSION: AMCs studied showed strong consensus on discharge practices for COVID-19 patients related to post-discharge isolation and transmission mitigation for home and non-home settings. There was high concordance among AMCs that discharge practices should address COVID-19-specific factors in clinical, functional, and post-discharge monitoring domains although definitions and details varied.","Greysen, S Ryan; Auerbach, Andrew D; Mitchell, Matthew D; Goldstein, Jennifer N; Weiss, Rachel; Esmaili, Armond; Kuye, Ifedayo; Manjarrez, Efren; Bann, Maralyssa; Schnipper, Jeffrey L",J. gen. intern. med,,721
272996,Staff perceptions of military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear (CBRN) air-purifying masks during a simulated clinical task in the context of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions (19dels) appear in a large number of variants, which has not been distinguished in previously published trials despite differences in deletion and insertion locations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic response of patients with different EGFR exon 19dels to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the mechanisms by which their tumors acquire resistance to these TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical outcomes of 195 patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels and receiving first-generation EGFR TKIs between July 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of twenty EGFR exon 19dels variants were identified. The patients were divided into three groups according to the first residue of the deletion, including E746, L747, and other residues (T751 or S752). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with EGFR TKIs was significantly different between groups (p < 0.001). Patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels starting at T751 or S752 had the shortest median PFS (2.9 months), followed by those with E746 (11.4 months) and those with L747 (17.2 months). Analyzing 140 patients who had progressed on therapy, EGFR exon 19dels beginning at T751 or S752 were associated with a low incidence of the T790M mutation (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Deletion location and type variants (with or without an insertion and/or a substitution) might affect first-generation TKI efficacy, and different EGFR exon 19dels should be considered when making decisions on which EGFR TKI should be used.","Xu, Haiyan; Li, Weihua; Yang, Guangjian; Li, Junling; Yang, Lu; Xu, Fei; Yang, Yaning; Ying, Jianming; Wang, Yan",,,721

This study identifies organizational factors that promoted successful implementation of telehealth and adoption of ""no test"" medication abortion protocols. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 21 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with health care providers and clinic administrators implementing clinician-supported telehealth abortion during the COVID pandemic. We selected 15 clinical sites to represent 4 different practice settings: independent primary care practices, online medical services, specialty family planning clinics, and primary care clinics within multispecialty health systems. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided our thematic analysis. RESULTS: Successful implementation of telehealth abortion included access to formal and informal inter-organizational networks, including professional organizations and informal mentorship relationships with innovators in the field; organizational readiness for implementation, such as having clinic resources available for telehealth services like functional electronic health records and options for easy-to-use virtual patient-provider interactions; and motivated and effective clinic champions. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the need to offer remote clinical services, 4 different practice settings types leveraged key operational factors to facilitate successful implementation of telehealth abortion. Information from this study can inform implementation strategies to support the dissemination and adoption of this model. IMPLICATIONS: Examples of successfully implemented telehealth medication abortion services provide a framework that can be used to inform and implement similar patient-centered telehealth models in diverse practice settings.","Godfrey, Emily M; Fiastro, Anna E; Jacob-Files, Elizabeth A; Coeytaux, Francine M; Wells, Elisa S; Ruben, Molly R; Sanan, Sajal S; Bennett, Ian M",Contraception,,721
275477,"SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Southern Region of New Zealand, 2020",2021,"This article serves to introduce the Special Issue of Economic Anthropology dedicated to ?Convenience as a Driver, Mediator, and Moderator of Social Economies.? The twelve articles in this issue are based on papers presented at the fortieth annual meeting of the Society for Economic Anthropology at the University of Notre Dame from April 30 to May 1, 2020. In this introductory article, I briefly introduce, conceptualize, and generally define ?convenience? as a heuristic and part of doxa and as a powerful force driving social economies, freshly revealed in the fractures left by the global COVID-19 pandemic. I then discuss the etymology of the term convenience and review previous research on the topic of convenience within marketing, technology, business, and the medical sectors, which reveal it to be a fluid, multidimensional concept centered on key concepts such as efficiency, efficacy, ease, comfort, and/or advantage, but also culturally circumscribed. The articles in this issue speak to the complexities of ?convenience? with ethnographic cases from the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Being one of the cornerstones of consumption driving contemporary global economies, ?convenience? as a driver of economies has significant and even positive impacts for issues such as poverty alleviation. It also has, in this hyperscale global economic landscape, negative implications for human societies in its impacts on health and the environment. As such, I argue that convenience is a crucial topic for future anthropological concern.","Oka, Rahul",Economic Anthropology,,721

276882,Simple Questionnaires to Improve Pooling Strategies for SARS-CoV-2 Laboratory Testing,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the rapid dissemination of papers and preprints investigating the disease and its associated virus, SARS-CoV-2. The multifaceted nature of COVID-19 demands a multidisciplinary approach, but the urgency of the crisis combined with the need for social distancing measures present unique challenges to collaborative science. We applied a massive online open publishing approach to this problem using Manubot. Through GitHub, collaborators summarized and critiqued COVID-19 literature, creating a review manuscript. Manubot automatically compiled citation information for referenced preprints, journal publications, websites, and clinical trials. Continuous integration workflows retrieved up-to-date data from online sources nightly, regenerating some of the manuscript's figures and statistics. Manubot rendered the manuscript into PDF, HTML, LaTeX, and DOCX outputs, immediately updating the version available online upon the integration of new content. Through this effort, we organized over 50 scientists from a range of backgrounds who evaluated over 1,500 sources and developed seven literature reviews. While many efforts from the computational community have focused on mining COVID-19 literature, our project illustrates the power of open publishing to organize both technical and non-technical scientists to aggregate and disseminate information in response to an evolving crisis.","Rando, Halie M.; Boca, Simina M.; McGowan, Lucy D'Agostino; Himmelstein, Daniel S.; Robson, Michael P.; Rubinetti, Vincent; Velazquez, Ryan; Consortium, COVID-19 Review; Greene, Casey S.; Gitter, Anthony",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08633v1.pdf,721

The single-hazard approach to disaster response system is not suited for this scenario. As shown from the experiences of the Philippines, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, the conventional single-hazard approach needed to integrate new measures, including basic skills training on handling COVID-19 for disaster responders; additional stockpiles of face coverings, disinfectants, tents, and personal protective equipment (PPE); social distancing at evacuation centers; updating of standard operation procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for disaster response to adapt to the concurrent crises situations. Building on the reports presented by the member countries of Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), this paper highlights three evolving disaster response practices during the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) digitalization of some aspects of disaster response, including early warning, surveillance, and impact assessment; (ii) dispersed evacuation to enforce social distancing, including other measures such as testing, tracing, and isolating infected individuals; (iii) remote psychological first aid to disaster-impacted individuals who are already experiencing anxieties from the pandemic. Indicative outcomes of the evolving response practices are discussed, including whether these could serve as entry points to transition the disaster response system from a single-hazard approach towards a multihazard approach.","Potutan, Gerald; Arakida, Masaru",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721
278250,SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Induced Promoter Hypomethylation as an Epigenetic Modulator of Heat Shock Protein A1L (HSPA1L) Gene,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Presence of comorbidities in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have often been associated with increased in-hospital complications and mortality. Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases. Despite the huge number of COVID-19 patients, India still has low volume research at the moment.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,721
278917,The Sars-Cov-2 Pandemic and the Brave New Digital World of Environmental Enrichment to Prevent Brain Aging and Cognitive Decline,2020,"In the absence of an efficacious and affordable vaccine, the current crisis of COVID-19 is likely to be a long drawn one for many developing countries. In Bangladesh, where the entire population is susceptible and strict lockdown has been relaxed (as of May 31st 2020) due to concerns over saving livelihoods, the best available resources and capacities in the country have to be mobilized for an integrated and adaptive response strategy. In this paper we argue that a suitable response strategy for a country with highly constrained health system, must consider how response components will be delivered at scale, along with what can be delivered. In order to save maximum number of lives, an optimal strategy will be one that is able to iteratively select the most feasible set of health response and the network of organizations that can deliver most effectively at scale. This might require thinking outside of the conventional vertical network of public health system. Given its history of high-capacity non-government organizations in Bangladesh, it is likely that there are multiple alternative horizontal network options for delivering any set of response interventions. In fact many horizontal networks are already actively engaged in COVID-19 response work. The goal should be to identify and coordinate these networks, create new networks, and embed mechanisms for scaling up what works and scaling down what does not work. For a rapidly escalating and unpredictable crisis such as COVID-19, an adaptive response strategy is needed which allows for old and new networks of organizations to align and work collectively with minimum loss of lives.","Khan, Mushtaq; Roy, Pallavi; Matin, Imran; Rabbani, Mehnaz; Chowdhury, Rajiv",World Dev,,721

In particular, it has played an important role during the COVID-19 epidemic. One of the important composites of ECMO is membrane oxygenator, and the core composite of the membrane oxygenator is hollow fiber membrane, which is not only a place for blood oxygenation, but also is a barrier between the blood and gas side. However, the formation of blood clots in the oxygenator is a key problem in the using process. According to the study of the mechanism of thrombosis generation, it was found that improving the hemocompatibility is an efficient approach to reduce thrombus formation by modifying the surface of materials. In this review, the corresponding modification methods (surface property regulation, anticoagulant grafting, and bio-interface design) of hollow fiber membranes in ECMO are classified and discussed, and then, the research status and development prospects are summarized.","He, Ting; He, Jinhui; Wang, Zhaohui; Cui, Zhaoliang",Adv Compos Hybrid Mater,,721
285952,Editoral commentary: Cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammatory syndromes,2020,"PURPOSE: Interval exercise allows very high-power outputs to be maintained, a key for stimulating training adaptations. The main purpose of this study was to develop a sprint interval protocol that stimulated both anaerobic and aerobic systems while maximizing power output and minimizing fatigue. The secondary goal was to investigate the influence of inter-sprint recovery duration. METHODS: Sixteen (8 females) participants (age: 23.5 ± 3.4 years, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak): 45.6 ± 9.2 ml kg-1 min-1) took part in this study. The exercise protocol involved 30 bouts of 4 s maximal cycling sprints using an 'Inertial Load Ergometer'. Recovery durations between sprints of 15, 30 and 45 s were studied in three trials. RESULTS: Peak power output (PPO) was maintained while taking 45 and 30 s of recovery, although it was 9% higher (p < 0.05) during 45 vs. 30 s. PPO with 15 s recovery declined 18% (p < 0.05) and then stabilized as did oxygen consumption (72±2% VO2peak) at a level that might reflect the peak rate of ATP-PC resynthesis from oxidative metabolism. The 15-, 30-, and 45 s trials elicited 72, 56, and 49% VO2peak and 86, 80, and 75% of maximal heart rate (all p<0.001). Perceived exertion increased with shorter recovery periods but remained at 12.6-14.7 and never became 'very hard'.

However, this disease is still orphaned in the country; large-scale control actions are rare, and little is known about its management. OBJECTIVE: To assess current practices in the management of SCD in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in six health facilities in Kisangani. It involved 198 presumed sickle cell patients attending the above health facilities. The study focused on the sociodemographic and clinical data of the participants, obtained through a clinical examination and their medical records. Diagnostic confirmation of SCD was made by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: The diagnosis of SCD was confirmed in 194 (98.0%; 95% CI: 94.9-99.2) participants, while it was not confirmed in 4 (2.0%; 95% CI: 0.8-5.1) participants. The diagnosis was mainly made by the Emmel test (42.9%). 45.8% of participants had previously been transfused with the blood of their parents. Folic acid was taken by 48.5% of participants and the previous intake of hydroxyurea was reported in 5.1% of participants. The participants vaccinated against Pneumococcus were 13.6% and against Haemophilus influenzae type b 28.3%. Penicillin prophylaxis was received by only 1.5% and malaria prophylaxis by 11.6% of participants. CONCLUSION: Standard-care practices for SCD patients in Kisangani are insufficient. The Congolese government should regard this disease as a health priority and consider actions to improve its management.","Kambale-Kombi, Paul; Djang039, Marini; eing039,; a, Roland; Alworong039,; a Opara, Jean-Pierre; Minon, Jean-Marc; Boemer, François; Bours, Vincent; Tonen-Wolyec, Serge; Kayembe Tshilumba, Charles; Batina-Agasa, Salomon",Hematology,,721

286874,Discharge ward during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: an effective way to increase patient turnover when human resources are scarce,2020,"Research identifying adults' mental health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic relies solely on demographic predictors without examining adults' health condition as a potential predictor. This study aims to examine individuals' perception of health conditions and test availability as potential predictors of mental health-insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress-during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during 2-8 May 2020, six weeks after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. We found adults' perception of health conditions had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress. Perceived test availability for COVID-19 also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. The results indicated that adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, and the worse degree deepened for unhealthy people. Perceived test availability negatively predicted anxiety and depression, especially for adults perceiving COVID-19 test unavailability. The significant predictions of perceived health condition and perceived COVID-19 test availability suggest a new direction for the literature to identify the psychiatric risk factors directly from health-related variables during a pandemic.","Dai, Huiyang; Zhang, Stephen X; Looi, Kim Hoe; Su, Rui; Li, Jizhen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 may experience MI during the course of the viral infection. However, this association is currently poorly understood. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective study of consecutive patients with concomitant COVID-19 and MI who underwent coronary angiography. Quantitative and qualitative coronary angiography were analyzed by two observers in an independent core lab. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included, of whom 142 (93.4%) had COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation. The median time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 5 (1-10) days. A total of 83 (54.6%) patients presented with ST-elevation MI. The median angiographic Syntax score was 16 (9.0-25.3) and 69.0% had multi-vessel disease. At least one complex lesion was found in 73.0% of patients, 51.3% had a thrombus containing lesion, and 57.9% had myocardial blush grades 0/1. The overall in-hospital mortality was 23.7%. ST-segment elevation MI presentation and baseline myocardial blush grades 0 or 1 were independently associated with a higher risk of death (HR 2.75, 95%CI 1.30-5.80 and HR 3.73, 95%CI 1.61-8.61, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have a MI in the context of ongoing COVID-19 mostly present complex coronary morphologies, implying a background of prior atherosclerotic disease superimposed on a thrombotic milieu. The in-hospital prognosis is poor with a markedly high mortality, prompting further investigation to better clarify this newly described condition.","Abizaid, Alexandre; Campos, Carlos M; Guimarães, Patrícia O; Costa, José de Ribamar; Falcão, Breno A A; Mangione, Fernanda; Caixeta, Adriano; Lemos, Pedro A; S de Brito, Fabio; Cavalcante, Ricardo; Bezerra, Cristiano Guedes; Cortes, Leandro; Ribeiro, Henrique B; de Souza, Francis R; Huemer, Natassja; do Val, Renata M; Caramelli, Bruno; Calderaro, Daniela; Lima, Felipe G; Hajjar, Ludhmila A; Mehran, Roxana; Filho, Roberto Kalil",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,721

Hence, it is of great significance to develop devices for monitoring their levels in COVID-19 patients, and thus enabling detecting COVID-19 patients that are worsening and to treat them before they become critically ill. Here, an intelligent aptameric dual channel graphene-TWEEN 80 field effect transistor (DGTFET) biosensing device for on-site detection of IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, and IL-6 within 7 min with limits of detection (LODs) of 476 × 10-15 , 608 × 10-15 , or 611 × 10-15 m respectively in biofluids is presented. Using the customized Android App together with this intelligent device, asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients can have a preliminary self-detection of cytokines and get a warning reminder while the condition starts to deteriorate. Also, the device can be fabricated on flexible substrates toward wearable applications for moderate or even critical COVID-19 cases for consistently monitoring cytokines under different deformations. Hence, the intelligent aptameric DGTFET biosensing device is promising to be used for point-of-care applications for monitoring conditions of COVID-19 patients who are in different situations.","Hao, Zhuang; Luo, Yang; Huang, Cong; Wang, Ziran; Song, Guoli; Pan, Yunlu; Zhao, Xuezeng; Liu, Shaoqin",Small,,721

292875,"Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wanzhou, China",2020,"The onset of human disease by infection with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 has revealed risk factors for disease severity. There are four identified factors that puts one at high-risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health comorbidities are common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socioeconomic structures in the United States likely drive development of comorbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men. Overall, COVID-19 has generated disparities for who is infected and the severity of that infection. Understanding the mechanisms for the disparity will help nullify the differences in risk for COVID-19.","Carethers, John M",J. intern. med,,721

294039,The burden of the pandemic on the non-SARS-CoV-2 emergencies: A multicenter study,2021,"The negative impact of COVID-19 on adults with underlying chronic kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients, has been well documented. Children have a less severe presentation and better prognosis compared to adults. However, little is known regarding the spectrum of COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents with underlying autoimmune disorders necessitating solid organ transplant and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Case Report. An adolescent male developed end-stage kidney disease secondary to microscopic polyangiitis requiring a living-donor kidney transplant. Six years later, he developed antibody-mediated rejection of his kidney transplant. During his rejection treatment course, he contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed new-onset nephrotic syndrome with severe acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant biopsy revealed de novo collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on a background of chronic active antibody mediated rejection. Immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 on the biopsy specimen demonstrated positive staining of the proximal tubular epithelium consistent with intra-renal viral infection. Pulse corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and temporary reduction of anti-metabolite therapy resulted in successful recovery with return of graft function back to pre-infection baseline. This case highlights the clinical conundrum of treating kidney transplant recipients with active rejection in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric kidney transplant recipients can develop severe COVID-19-related kidney complications. Judicious immunosuppression modulation is necessary to balance infection and rejection risk.","Levenson, Emma; Shepherd, Tara N; Aviles, Diego; Craver, Randall; Ehlayel, Abdulla; Love, Gordon L; Simms, K039; Joy,; Straatmann, Caroline; Ashoor, Isa F",Pediatr Transplant,,721

However, short and/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high-throughput experimental approaches - such as ribosome profiling - cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus) and correlating the results with the conserved presence of an open reading frame (ORF) and a plausible translation mechanism, a putative new gene - ORF3c - was identified. ORF3c overlaps ORF3a in an alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3c is indeed translated during infection. ORF3c is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and encodes a 40-41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.","Firth, Andrew E",J Gen Virol,,721

When training deep learning models under an FL setting, people employ the predefined model architecture discovered in the centralized environment. However, this predefined architecture may not be the optimal choice because it may not fit data with non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID). Thus, we advocate automating federated learning (AutoFL) to improve model accuracy and reduce the manual design effort. We specifically study AutoFL via Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which can automate the design process. We propose a Federated NAS (FedNAS) algorithm to help scattered workers collaboratively searching for a better architecture with higher accuracy. We also build a system based on FedNAS. Our experiments on non-IID dataset show that the architecture searched by FedNAS can outperform the manually predefined architecture.","He, Chaoyang; Annavaram, Murali; Avestimehr, Salman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08546v1.pdf,721

This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and tolerance of prone positioning combined with non-invasive respiratory support in patients with AHRF or ARDS. METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (prospective or retrospective cohort studies, RCTs and case series) published in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2020. We included studies that compared prone and supine positioning with non-invasive respiratory support in awake patients with AHRF or ARDS. The meta-analyses used random effects models. The methodological quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies fulfilled selection criteria and included 243 patients. The aggregated intubation rate and mortality rate were 33% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.42, I2 = 25%], 4% (95% CI: 0.01-0.07, I2 = 0%), respectively, and the intolerance rate was 7% (95% CI: 0.01-0.12, I2 = 5%).

Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the intubation rate of shorter duration prone (â©½5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 34% and 21%, respectively; and the mortality rate of shorter duration prone (â©½5 h/day) and longer duration prone (>5 h/day) were 6% and 0%, respectively. PaO2/FiO2 and SpO2 were significantly improved in COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients.

In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . METHODS: By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. RESULTS: The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099-1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209-2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252-7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609-0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923-0.951). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents.

Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.","Block, Per; Hoffman, Marion; Raabe, Isabel J; Dowd, Jennifer Beam; Rahal, Charles; Kashyap, Ridhi; Mills, Melinda C",Nat Hum Behav,,721

Hybrids of P. sibirica and true mume, belonging to the apricot mei group, inherited strong cold resistance from P. sibirica. These materials are favourable for research on the molecular mechanisms of cold resistance. However, no suitable reference genes have been identified for analysing gene expression patterns between P. sibirica and P. mume. Ten candidate reference genes were assessed, namely, actins (ACT2-1, ACT2-2, ACT2-3, ACT2-4), protein phosphatase 2A-1 (PP2A-1), ubiquitins (UBQ2, UBQ3), ubiquitin extension protein (UBQ1) and tubulins (TUB1, TUB2), with four distinct algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). UBQ2 was recognized as the best reference gene in stems and buds across materials (P. sibirica; 'Xiaohong Zhusha', 'Beijing Yudie', and 'Xiao Lve' for true mume; and 'Dan Fenghou', 'Fenghou', and 'Yanxing' for apricot mei) under cold stress. In addition, the temporal and spatial expression patterns of PmCBF6 and PmLEA10 among seven varieties during winter periods were analysed using UBQ2 as a reference gene. The expression differed significantly among cultivars, which may contribute to their differences in cold tolerance. This paper confirmed the strong cold tolerance of apricot mei. And the best internal reference gene suitable for seven varieties was selected: UBQ2. Based on the above results, the expression of PmCBF6 and PmLEA10 genes during wintering in seven varieties was analysed. The molecular mechanisms of cold resistance were found to be possibly different in different varieties of P. sibirica and P. mume.","Ding, Anqi; Bao, Fei; Zhang, Tengxun; Yang, Weiru; Wang, Jia; Cheng, Tangren; Zhang, Qixiang",Mol.

However, they have been overshadowed for decades, due to the success of lithium-ion batteries that demonstrated higher energy densities and longer cycle lives. Since then, the witness a re-emergence of the SIBs and renewed interest evidenced by an exponential increase of the publications devoted to them (about 9000 publications in 2019, more than 6000 in the first six months this year). This huge effort in research has led and is leading to an important and constant progress in the performance of the SIBs, which have conquered an industrial market and are now commercialized. This progress concerns all the elements of the batteries. We have already recently reviewed the salts and electrolytes, including solid electrolytes to build all-solid-state SIBs. The present review is then devoted to the electrode materials. For anodes, they include carbons, metal chalcogenide-based materials, intercalation-based and conversion reaction compounds (transition metal oxides and sulfides), intermetallic compounds serving as functional alloying elements. For cathodes, layered oxide materials, polyionic compounds, sulfates, pyrophosphates and Prussian blue analogs are reviewed. The electrode structuring is also discussed, as it impacts, importantly, the electrochemical performance. Attention is focused on the progress made in the last five years to report the state-of-the-art in the performance of the SIBs and justify the efforts of research.","Mauger, Alain; Julien, Christian M",,,721

In its simplest implementation, each group is tested with a single test in the first phase, while in the second phase only subjects in positive groups, if any, need to be tested again individually. In this paper, we address the problem of group testing design, which aims to determine a partition into groups of a finite population in such a way that cardinality constraints on the size of each group and a constraint on the expected total number of tests are satisfied while minimizing a linear combination of the expected number of false negative and false positive classifications. First, we show that the properties and model introduced by Aprahmian et al. can be extended to the group test design problem, which is then modeled as a constrained shortest path problem on a specific graph. We design and implement an ad hoc algorithm to solve this problem. On instances based on Sant\'e Publique France data on Covid-19 screening tests, the results of the computational experiments are very promising.","Almeftah, Tifaout; Brotcorne, Luce; Cattaruzza, Diego; Fortz, Bernard; Keita, Kaba; Labb'e, Martine; Ogier, Maxime; Semet, Fr'ed'eric",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06927v1.pdf,721

Access to healthcare and related social determinants of health are at the core of this disparity. To explore the geographical links between race and COVID-19 mortality, we created descriptive maps of COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the percentage of populations self-identifying as African-American across the USA, by state, and Pennsylvania (PA), by county. In addition, we used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to quantify the statistical relationship between these variables, and control for area-level demographic, healthcare access, and comorbidity risk factors. We found that COVID-19 mortality rates were generally higher in areas that had higher African-American populations, particularly in the northeast USA and eastern PA. These relationships were quantified through Pearson correlations showing significant positive associations at the state and county level. At the US state-level, percent African-American population was the only significant correlate of COVID-19 mortality rate. In PA at the county-level, higher percent African-American population was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rate even after controlling for area-level confounders. More resources should be allocated to address high COVID-19 mortality rates among African-American populations.","Anaele, Beverly I; Doran, Cierrah; McIntire, Russell",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,721

Patients with asthma were significantly affected by the 2019/2020 bushfire season with an increased burden compared to the general population. Patients with controlled asthma do not appear to be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection or death than the general population. Personalized medicine is proposed as the next era for asthma management, with treatable traits as a strategy to implement personalized medicine into practice. Patient engagement in personalized medicine strategies is important and needs to be further explored. Oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in asthma is common and contributes a major burden. OCS stewardship is recommended. Biologic therapies reduce exacerbations of severe asthma and biomarkers can be used to predict treatment responders. Epithelia at mucosal and cutaneous surfaces are components in asthma pathogenesis, through airway immunity and inflammation. Dysregulation of resident microbial communities in the lung, gut and skin microbiome is relevant to asthma pathogenesis, but there are still many unknowns in this field.","Wang, Gang; McDonald, Vanessa M",Respirology,,721
302059,Antibodies Responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a Large Cohort of Vaccinated Subjects and Seropositive Patients (preprint),2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented impact to haemophilia healthcare delivery. In particular, rapid implementation of telehealth solutions was required to ensure continued access to comprehensive care. AIMS: To explore patient and healthcare provider (HCP) experience of telehealth in a European Haemophilia Comprehensive Care Centre. METHOD: A systematic evaluation was performed to survey patient and HCP experience and compare clinical activity levels with telehealth to in-person attendances. RESULTS: Public health measures implemented in March 2020 to reduce COVID-19 spread resulted in a 63% decrease in medical/nursing clinic consultation activity compared to the same period in 2019. Implementation of digital care pathways resulted in marked increase in activity (52% greater than 2019). Importantly, enhanced patient engagement was noted, with a 60% reduction in non-attendance rates. Survey of patients who had participated in medical/nursing teleconsultations demonstrated that teleconsultations improved access (79%), reduced inconvenience (82%), was easy to use (94%) and facilitated good communication with the HCP (97%). A survey exploring the telemedicine experience of HCPs, illustrated that HCPs were satisfied with teleconsultation and the majority (79%) would like to continue to offer teleconsultation as part of routine patient care. In addition to medical/nursing reviews, continued access to physiotherapy with virtual exercise classes for people with haemophilia and teleconsultation for acute dental issues was equally successful. CONCLUSION: During an unprecedented public health emergency, telehealth has enabled continued access to specialized haemophilia comprehensive care. Our novel findings show that this alternative is acceptable to both patients and HCPs and offers future novel opportunities.","O039,; Donovan, Mairead; Buckley, Catherine; Benson, Julie; Roche, Sheila; McGowan, Mark; Parkinson, Laura; Byrne, Patricia; Rooney, Gloria; Bergin, Catherine; Walsh, Deirdre; Bird, Rachel; McGroarty, Feargal; Fogarty, Helen; Smyth, Elizabeth; Ahmed, Saad; Donnell, James S; Ryan, Kevin; Mahony, Brian; Dougall, Alison; Connell, Niamh M",Haemophilia,,721
302149,Evaluation of an ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing: clinical performances and correlation with plaque reduction neutralization titer,2020,"BACKGROUND: 10 days after the first reported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Netherlands (on Feb 27, 2020), 55 (4%) of 1497 health-care workers in nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We aimed to gain insight in possible sources of infection in health-care workers. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study at three of the nine hospitals located in the south of the Netherlands. We screened health-care workers at the participating hospitals for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on clinical symptoms (fever or mild respiratory symptoms) in the 10 days before screening. We obtained epidemiological data through structured interviews with health-care workers and combined this information with data from whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples taken from health-care workers and patients. We did an in-depth analysis of sources and modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and patients. FINDINGS: Between March 2 and March 12, 2020, 1796 (15%) of 12â022 health-care workers were screened, of whom 96 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We obtained complete and near-complete genome sequences from 50 health-care workers and ten patients. Most sequences were grouped in three clusters, with two clusters showing local circulation within the region. The noted patterns were consistent with multiple introductions into the hospitals through community-acquired infections and local amplification in the community. INTERPRETATION: Although direct transmission in the hospitals cannot be ruled out, our data do not support widespread nosocomial transmission as the source of infection in patients or health-care workers.

303373,Probable Case of Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a Newborn in Mexico,2021,"Background and Aim: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 primarily affects the respiratory system, involvement of cardiovascular system is not uncommon and a range of cardiac manifestations among Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients were reported in the literature. Furthermore, it is evident from scientific literature that the incidence of deaths and hospitalizations has been increasingly more among COVID-19 subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19. Another emerging significant concern is the varying presentations of COVID-19 and side effects due to the medication used in the management of COVID-19 patients. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on the possible association between CVD and COVID-19 with emphasis on the pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations, and impact of medications used for COVID-19 on cardiovascular health. Based on the available literature, we conclude that though CVD could not be reckoned as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection, it is evident that pre-existing CVD has an influence on the severity of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. Relevance for Patients: Literature suggests that people with pre-existing CVD are at increased risk for COVID-19 and associated severity. Consequently, it becomes important to thoroughly gain insights into the possible pathophysiological mechanisms, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 treatment on the cardiovascular system.","Vudathaneni, V.

We hold that such an evaluation must accommodate the necessarily fragile relation between the information that numbers are taken to carry and the policy decisions they are meant to support. In doing so, attention needs to be paid to differences in &lt;italic&gt;how&lt;/italic&gt; that relation is formed. With this in mind, we investigated a public discourse that heavily relied on numbers in the context of introducing, maintaining, and easing the rules and regulations directed to contain the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 during the first epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Germany with its peak in early April 2020. We used a public-service broadcasting outlet as data. Our theoretical stance is affiliated with post-structuralist discourse theory. As an outcome, we identified four major related strategies of using numbers, which we named &lt;italic&gt;rationalisation&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;contrast&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;italic&gt;association&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;recharging&lt;/italic&gt;.

305719,Communication: Comparison of Respiratory Specimens for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Learning unsupervised node embeddings facilitates several downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. A node embedding is universal if it is designed to be used by and benefit various downstream tasks. This work introduces PanRep, a graph neural network (GNN) model, for unsupervised learning of universal node representations for heterogenous graphs. PanRep consists of a GNN encoder that obtains node embeddings and four decoders, each capturing different topological and node feature properties. Abiding to these properties the novel unsupervised framework learns universal embeddings applicable to different downstream tasks. PanRep can be furthered fine-tuned to account for possible limited labels. In this operational setting PanRep is considered as a pretrained model for extracting node embeddings of heterogenous graph data. PanRep outperforms all unsupervised and certain supervised methods in node classification and link prediction, especially when the labeled data for the supervised methods is small. PanRep-FT (with fine-tuning) outperforms all other supervised approaches, which corroborates the merits of pretraining models. Finally, we apply PanRep-FT for discovering novel drugs for Covid-19. We showcase the advantage of universal embeddings in drug repurposing and identify several drugs used in clinical trials as possible drug candidates.","Ioannidis, Vassilis N.; Zheng, Da; Karypis, George",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10445v1.pdf,721

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. Staphylococcus aureus, like SARS-CoV2, is a harmful microorganism. Once the skin is breached, S. aureus can cause infections like pneumonia and skin infections. The coinfections between these two microorganisms present high risk on human health. This study deals with investigating the effect of electromagnetic radiation on Staphylococcus aureus. It focuses on exposing the S. aureus bacteria samples to different Ultra High Frequencies (UHF). The number of bacterial colonies that grew from the exposed sample and unexposed samples were assessed. The average bacterial growth was 90.51%. This means that some of the bacteria did not survive after exposure to radiation. This result showed that some of the UHFs had affected the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The correlation between the frequency and the growth of the bacteria was also calculated by means of computing the Pearson Correlation coefficient. The result is 0.4344 which signifies a small positive linear relation between the two parameters mentioned.

A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a 4.6 × 3.9 cm tumor in the caudate lobe adjacent to the inferior vena cava, middle hepatic vein, right hepatic vein, as well as the bifurcation of the main trunk of the portal pedicle. The carbohydrate antigen was elevated to 54.58 U/ml (normal < 37 U/ml), and his liver function was normal. With the preoperative diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, laparoscopic caudate lobectomy was contemplated. RESULTS: The operative time was 300 min. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 180 ml. The patient was discharged on the seventh postoperative day without any complications. Histopathological examination showed a 4.2 cm cholangiocarcinoma (T2N0M0) with a negative margin. He received a course of adjuvant chemotherapy. No recurrence was noted upon follow-up at 6 months after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection for caudate lobe is a feasible and safe procedure. An experienced hepatobiliary surgeon could perform the procedure in selected cases, even with hepatic vein invasion.","Wan, Hai-Feng; Xie, Kun-Lin; Li, Jia-Xin; Ho, Kit-Man; Wu, Hong; Huang, Ji-Wei",Ann. surg. oncol,,721
309013,Pre-test probability for SARS-Cov-2-related infection score: The PARIS score,2020,"Histone acetylation modification plays a vital role in plant cell division and differentiation. However, the function on wheat mature embryo culture has not been reported. Here, we used the mature embryo of wheat genotypes including CB037, Fielder, and Chinese Spring (CS) as materials to analyze the effects of different concentrations of trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB) on plant regeneration efficiency. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the induction rates of embryogenic callus and green shoot were significantly increased with the addition of 0.5 µM TSA, while they were reduced under treatment of 2.5 µM TSA on wheat mature embryo. With the respective addition of 200 µM and 1000 µM SB, regeneration frequency of three genotypes was enhanced, especially in Fielder, which reached significant difference compared with the control group. Unfortunately, 0.5 µM TSA and 200 µM SB combination had no apparent effect on wheat regeneration frequency. The results indicated that TSA and SB increase plant regeneration in common wheat. In addition, TSA had a common effect and SB had different effect among genotypes on wheat regeneration frequency. The mechanism of action needs further investigation.","Bie, Xiao Min; Dong, Luhao; Li, Xiao Hui; Wang, He; Gao, Xi-Qi; Li, Xing Guo",Plant Signal Behav,,721

309999,SARS-CoV-2 infection in children/ Çocuklarda sars-cov-2 enfeksiyonu,2020,"We propose a partial identification method for estimating disease prevalence from serology studies. Our data are results from antibody tests in some population sample, where the test parameters, such as the true/false positive rates, are unknown. Our method scans the entire parameter space, and rejects parameter values using the joint data density as the test statistic. The proposed method is conservative for marginal inference, in general, but its key advantage over more standard approaches is that it is valid in finite samples even when the underlying model is not point identified. Moreover, our method requires only independence of serology test results, and does not rely on asymptotic arguments, normality assumptions, or other approximations. We use recent Covid-19 serology studies in the US, and show that the parameter confidence set is generally wide, and cannot support definite conclusions. Specifically, recent serology studies from California suggest a prevalence anywhere in the range 0%-2% (at the time of study), and are therefore inconclusive. However, this range could be narrowed down to 0.7%-1.5% if the actual false positive rate of the antibody test was indeed near its empirical estimate (~0.5%). In another study from New York state, Covid-19 prevalence is confidently estimated in the range 13%-17% in mid-April of 2020, which also suggests significant geographic variation in Covid-19 exposure across the US. Combining all datasets yields a 5%-8% prevalence range. Our results overall suggest that serology testing on a massive scale can give crucial information for future policy design, even when such tests are imperfect and their parameters unknown.","Toulis, Panos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16214v1.pdf,721

In light of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, many health-care settings are now implementing these techniques amid respirator shortages. We sought to perform a critical review of the available literature regarding decontamination methods to determine which strategies are effective at inactivating the target organism, preserve performance (filter efficiency and fit) of the respirator, leave no residual toxicity from the treatment, and are fast-acting, inexpensive, and readily available. We also identified areas for future research. We found that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is the most widely studied method, and treatments are effective at inactivating SARS-CoV-2 without diminishing filtration efficiency or fit. These treatments were found to leave no residual toxicity for the wearer, have a relatively short cycle time of less than 1 h, and existing systems can likely be retrofitted to accommodate this method. Further, UVGI (among other treatment methods) has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and respirator manufacturers. Methods involving microwave-generated steam also show potential in that they are likely effective against SARS-CoV-2, preserve performance, have no residual toxicity, require a short duration treatment cycle (often less than 10 min), and microwave ovens are inexpensive and readily available. Steam methods are currently recommended by the CDC, OSHA, and manufacturers. These respirator decontamination methods are likely also useful against other viruses or pathogens.","Jacobs, Neva; Chan, Kathy; Leso, Veruscka; D039,; Anna, Andrea; Hollins, Dana; Iavicoli, Ivo",Toxicol Ind Health,,721

313211,Compartmentalized Replication of SARS-Cov-2 in Upper vs. Lower Respiratory Tract Assessed by Whole Genome Quasispecies Analysis,2020,"Introduction: Myocardial injury as evidenced by elevated cardiac troponin levels may occur in 7-36% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with elevated cardiac troponin are more likely to require the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation and have a higher risk of death. However, studies on the impact of elevated troponins at the time of hospital admission on mortality of ICU patients are limited. Here we aim to characterize, compare, and analyze COVID-19 patients in our institution's ICUs who had elevated troponins. Methods:This study is a retrospective analysis of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICUs of a tertiary care hospital between 03/01/2020 and 05/31/2020. Myocardial injury was defined as troponin ≥ 0.04 ng/mL. Only patients who had troponins measured within 24 hours of hospital admission were included. We excluded patients with a past medical history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We also excluded those patients who were transferred to our ICU from another hospital and where admission labs from the transferring institution were not available for our review. We compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients who had elevated troponins with those who did not.Results: Of the 210 patients admitted with COVID-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, 178 had troponin measured within 24 hours of hospital admission. 25 patients had a past medical history of CKD or ESRD and 11 patients were transferred from another hospital with no labs available from their day of admission. Of the 142 remaining patients, 72 (50.7%) had an elevated troponin while 70 (49.9%) had a normal troponin at presentation. Patients with elevated troponins were older (67.5 ± 15.1 vs 60.2 ± 14.2), and predominantly male (72.2% vs. 54.3%). Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in both groups but not statistically different. Therapies provided were similar in both groups. Most importantly, patients with an elevated troponin had significantly increased risk of mortality compared to those with a normal troponin at admission (55.6% vs. 34.3%).Conclusion: Our results suggest that myocardial injury is a common occurrence in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission. Additionally, mortality in this population is significantly higher further indicating myocardial injury as a predictor of mortality. To determine if elevated troponin levels are independent of other risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 such as age, and gender will need to be determined in future studies.","Yaqoob, H.; Greenberg, D.; Lee, C.; Vernik, D.; Hwang, F.; Chandy, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,721

While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited. A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients. Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies. Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives. (2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure. Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks. Use non-rebreather masks when possible. Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment. (3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission. If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation. (4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Whittle, Jessica S; Pavlov, Ivan; Sacchetti, Alfred D; Atwood, Charles; Rosenberg, Mark S",,,721

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the level of anxiety and depression of healthcare students living in Jordan, and the effect on their learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey completed by students studying a healthcare-oriented degree in a university in Jordan. Participants were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The validated previously published Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was used as a part of the online survey to assess students' anxiety/depression scores. Students' responses regarding their learning process during the COVID-19 was also assessed. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 21.62 (SD = 4.90), with the majority being females (67.1%). The HADs' assessment revealed that 43.8% and 40.0% of participants had normal anxiety and depression scores, while 22.4% showed borderline abnormal anxiety/depression scores (33.8%). Many students (33.8%) were classified to have abnormal anxiety scores, while a smaller proportion (26.2%) was classified to have abnormal depression scores. Smoking (p = 0.022), lower family income (p = 0.039), and use of medications (p = 0.032) were positively associated with higher (worse) anxiety scores. Ranking the learning process during COVID-19 showed that 45.8% of the participants believed it was a 'good/very good/excellent' process. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression levels amongst university healthcare students in Jordan were found to be high when assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the learning process during the pandemic was not accepted by more than half of the students. Implementing psychological interventions for healthcare students during pandemics is strongly recommended in order to optimize students' mental health and their learning process alike.","Basheti, Iman A; Mhaidat, Qassim N; Mhaidat, Hala N",PLoS One,,721

Along the western slope of the Andes, the modification of natural landscapes have resulted in significant declines in native prey, the introduction of non-native species, and an increase in the availability of anthropogenic resources. These factors have likely influenced the resources available to Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), however, data are lacking as to how condor's diet vary along their large latitudinal range. We evaluated differences in Andean condor diet along a ~2500 km latitudinal gradient in Chile from the heavily modified Central zone (32-34°S) to the more pristine Austral zone (44-56°S). We assessed diet composition through the identification of prey remains in condor pellets, and carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of condor feathers and their primary prey identified from pellet analysis. Our results identified medium- and large-bodied domesticated mammals (ungulates) and introduced exotic species (lagomorphs) as common prey across the study area. Condors from the Central zone had the largest isotopic niche width, probably related to consumption of anthropogenic resources with distinctly high carbon isotope values indicative of C4-based foods likely acquired from landfills or corn-fed livestock. Isotopic niches for condors from the Southern and Austral zones almost completely overlapped. Andean condor diet is strongly influenced by local conditions determining differential access to prey sources. The high dependence of Andean condors on livestock across a large geographical area, and landfills in more (sub)urban areas, may help stabilize their populations via anthropogenic resources subsidies. Long-term dependence on such resources, however, may have health costs including contaminant exposure and greater mortality risk. These data will help identify potential threats related to resource availability and use, and better inform management and conservation decisions.","Duclos, Melanie; Sabat, Pablo; Newsome, Seth D; Pavez, Eduardo F; Galbán-Malagón, Cristóbal; Jaksic, Fabian M; Quirici, Verónica",Sci Total Environ,,721

Methods: A prospective study was used to conduct continuous quarantine medical observations of close contacts of people infected with COVID-19, collect epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and laboratory test data to estimate the infection rate of close contacts under different exposures. Results: The epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Ningbo showed persistent human-to-human characteristics. A total of 2 147 close contacts were tracked and investigated. The total infection rate was 6.15%. The infection rates of confirmed cases and positive contacts were 6.30% and 4.11%, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Among close contacts of different relationships, friends/pilgrims (22.31%), family members (18.01%), and relatives (4.73%) have a higher infection rate, and close contacts of medical staff were not infected. Differences in infection rates among the close contacts were statistically significant (P<0.005). Living with the case (13.26%), taking the same transportation (11.91%), and dining together (7.18%) are high risk factors for infection. Cross-infection in the hospital should not be ignored (1.94%). The median of incubation period is 5 days. Conclusion: The infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases is high, and isolation medical observation measures should be implemented in strict accordance with the close contact management plan.","Chen, Y; Wang, A H; Yi, B; Ding, K Q; Wang, H B; Wang, J M; Shi, H B; Wang, S J; Xu, G Z",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,721

In China, a major reason for the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 in early stage of the outbreak is the huge numbers of passengers boarding their ""last train home"" to meet family members during the Spring Festival. Most of these travelers were internal migrant workers. In order to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission, public transportation networks were suspended, and many migrant workers who returned to their hometowns needed to be quarantined for 2 weeks, which led to the delay of returning back to cities to work. Many businesses have temporarily closed because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission, leading to unemployment of many workers. Sudden loss of income and further quarantine enforcement in cities can exacerbate existing mental health problems or trigger new mental disorders among affected migrant workers. However, to date no specific guidelines or strategies about mental health services of migrant workers have been released. Health authorities and professionals should pay more attention to this vulnerable group and provide timely mental health service support for those in need.","Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Feng, Yuan; Zhang, Qinge; Zhong, Bao-Liang; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Global Health,,721

In multivariable regression analysis, compared with true-negative test results, false-negative test results were associated with anosmia or ageusia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-50.5; P = .02), having had a COVID-19-positive contact (aOR, 10.5; 95% CI, 4.3-25.4; P < .0001), and having an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (aOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.3; P = .03). Demographics, symptom duration, other laboratory values, and abnormal chest imaging were not significantly associated with false-negative test results in our multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features can help predict which patients are more likely to have false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.","MacKenzie, Erica L; Hareza, Dariusz A; Collison, Maggie W; Czapar, Anna E; Kraft, Antigone K; Waxse, Bennett J; Friedman, Eleanor E; Ridgway, Jessica P",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,721
321159,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response in PCR positive patients: Comparison of nine tests in relation to clinical data,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures. DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.","Zhu, Siyi; Gao, Qiang; Yang, Lin; Yang, Yonghong; Xia, Wenguang; Cai, Xiguo; Hui, Yanping; Zhu, Di; Zhang, Yanyan; Zhang, Guiqing; Wu, Shuang; Wang, Yiliang; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Liu, Hongfei; Zhang, Changjie; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Jianrong; Feng, Mei; Ni, Zhong; Chen, Baoyu; Du, Chunping; He, Hongchen; Qu, Yun; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi; Reinhardt, Jan D",PLoS One,,721
321969,Impact of Comorbidities in Mexican Sars-cov-2-positive Patients: a Retrospective Analysis in a National Cohort,2020,"Machine learning (ML) provides us with numerous opportunities, allowing ML systems to adapt to new situations and contexts. At the same time, this adaptability raises uncertainties concerning the run-time product quality or dependability, such as reliability and security, of these systems. Systems can be tested and monitored, but this does not provide protection against faults and failures in adapted ML systems themselves. We studied software designs that aim at introducing fault tolerance in ML systems so that possible problems in ML components of the systems can be avoided. The research was conducted as a case study, and its data was collected through five semi-structured interviews with experienced software architects. We present a conceptualisation of the misbehaviour of ML systems, the perceived role of fault tolerance, and the designs used. Common patterns to incorporating ML components in design in a fault tolerant fashion have started to emerge. ML models are, for example, guarded by monitoring the inputs and their distribution, and enforcing business rules on acceptable outputs. Multiple, specialised ML models are used to adapt to the variations and changes in the surrounding world, and simpler fall-over techniques like default outputs are put in place to have systems up and running in the face of problems. However, the general role of these patterns is not widely acknowledged. This is mainly due to the relative immaturity of using ML as part of a complete software system: the field still lacks established frameworks and practices beyond training to implement, operate, and maintain the software that utilises ML. ML software engineering needs further analysis and development on all fronts.","Myllyaho, Lalli; Raatikainen, Mikko; Mannisto, Tomi; Nurminen, Jukka K.; Mikkonen, Tommi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07989v1.pdf,721
321970,Impact of Comorbidities in Mexican Sars-cov-2-positive Patients: a Retrospective Analysis in a National Cohort,2020,"Social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news globally and acts as a platform for people to express their opinions on various topics. A wide variety of views accompanies COVID-19 vaccination drives across the globe, often colored by emotions, which change along with rising cases, approval of vaccines, and multiple factors discussed online. This study aims at analyzing the temporal evolution of different Emotion categories: Hesitation, Rage, Sorrow, Anticipation, Faith, and Contentment with Influencing Factors: Vaccine Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as lexical categories created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out programs, namely, India, United States of America, Brazil, United Kingdom, and Australia. We extracted a corpus of nearly 1.8 million Twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination. Using cosine distance from selected seed words, we expanded the vocabulary of each category and tracked the longitudinal change in their strength from June 2020 to April 2021. We used community detection algorithms to find modules in positive correlation networks. Our findings suggest that tweets expressing hesitancy towards vaccines contain the highest mentions of health-related effects in all countries. Our results indicated that the patterns of hesitancy were variable across geographies and can help us learn targeted interventions. We also observed a significant change in the linear trends of categories like hesitation and contentment before and after approval of vaccines. Negative emotions like rage and sorrow gained the highest importance in the alluvial diagram. They formed a significant module with all the influencing factors in April 2021, when India observed the second wave of COVID-19 cases. The relationship between Emotions and Influencing Factors was found to be variable across the countries.","Chopra, Harshita; Vashishtha, Aniket; Pal, Ridam; Ashima,; Tyagi, Ananya; Sethi, Tavpritesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01131v2.pdf,721

Various circuit setups have been described to reduce virus aerosolization. However, these setups may alter ventilator performance. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the consequences of the various suggested circuit setups on ventilator efficacy during CPAP and noninvasive ventilation (NIV)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight circuit setups, evaluated in bench tests, consisted of a three-dimensional printed head and an artificial lung. Setups included a dual-limb circuit with an oronasal mask, a dual-limb circuit with a helmet interface, a single-limb circuit with a passive exhalation valve, three single-limb circuits with custom-made additional leaks, and two single-limb circuits with active exhalation valves. All setups were evaluated during NIV and CPAP. The following variables were recorded: the inspiratory flow preceding triggering of the ventilator, the inspiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator, the triggering delay, the maximal inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator, the tidal volume generated to the artificial lung, the total work of breathing, and the pressure-time product needed to trigger the ventilator. RESULTS: With NIV, the type of circuit setup had a significant impact on inspiratory flow preceding triggering of the ventilator (P < .0001), the inspiratory effort required to trigger the ventilator (P < .0001), the triggering delay (P < .0001), the maximal inspiratory pressure (P < .0001), the tidal volume (P = .0008), the work of breathing (P < .0001), and the pressure-time product needed to trigger the ventilator (P < .0001). Similar differences and consequences were seen with CPAP as well as with the addition of bacterial filters. Best performance was achieved with a dual-limb circuit with an oronasal mask. Worst performance was achieved with a dual-limb circuit with a helmet interface. INTERPRETATION: Ventilator performance is significantly impacted by the circuit setup. A dual-limb circuit with oronasal mask should be used preferentially.","Patout, Maxime; Fresnel, Emeline; Lujan, Manuel; Rabec, Claudio; Carlucci, Annalisa; Razakamanantsoa, Léa; Kerfourn, Adrien; Nunes, Hilario; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Cuvelier, Antoine; Muir, Jean-François; Lalmoda, Cristina; Langevin, Bruno; Sayas, Javier; Gonzalez-Bermejo, Jesus; Janssens, Jean-Paul",Chest,,721

The possibility to compare data across different settings depends on the systematic and reproducible manner the scans are analyzed and reported. The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and the corresponding CT severity score (CTSS) introduced by the Radiological Society of the Netherlands (NVvR) attempt to do so. However, this system has not been externally validated. RESEARCH QUESTION: We aimed to prospectively validate the CO-RADS as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool at the emergency department (ED), and evaluate if the CTSS is associated with prognosis. STUDY DESIGN METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study in two tertiary centers in The Netherlands, between March 19 and May 28, 2020. We consecutively included 741 adult patients at the ED with suspected COVID-19, who received a chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 PCR (PCR). Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. Logistic regression was performed for CTSS in relation to hospital admission, ICU admission and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 741 patients were included. We found an AUC of 0.91 (CI 0.89-0.94) for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. The optimal CO-RADS cut-off was 4, with a sensitivity of 89.4% (CI 84.7-93.0) and specificity of 87.2% (CI 83.9-89.9). We found a significant association between CTSS and hospital admission, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality; adjusted odds ratios per point increase in CTSS were 1.19 (CI 1.09-1.28), 1.23 (1.15-1.32), 1.14 (1.07-1.22), respectively. Intra-class correlation coefficients for CO-RADS and CTSS were 0.94 (0.91-0.96) and 0.82 (CI 0.70-0.90).

COVID-19 case number, migration scale index, Baidu index, demographic, economic and public health resource data were collected from 22 Chinese provinces from 19 January 2020 to 12 March 2020. Spline regression was applied to the data of all included, eastern, central and western provinces. The research period was divided into three stages by two knots. The first stage (from 19 January to around 25 January) was similar among three regions. However, in the second stage, growth of COVID-19 case number was flatter and lasted longer in western provinces (from 25 January to 18 February) than in eastern and central provinces (from 26 February to around 11 February). In the third stage, the growth of COVID-19 case number slowed down in all the three regions. Included covariates were different among the three regions.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COPD-related hospital admissions and mortality in relation to the presence of COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We conducted a case-control study of patients admitted in four teaching hospitals throughout Spain between March 15 and April 30, 2020. Hospital admissions of respiratory cause with and without PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COPD were evaluated. Baseline and episode-related clinical characteristics were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk for mortality. Results: During the study period, 2101 patients were admitted for respiratory worsening, 1200 (57.1%) with COVID-19. A total of 228 (10.8%) were admitted due to COPD worsening, of whom 52 (22.8%) tested positive for COVID-19. COPD patients with COVID-19, when compared to those without COVID-19, were more frequently males with better lung function (FEV1 postbronchodilator 71% vs 46% respectively, p<0.001) and had higher mortality (44.9% vs 13.6% respectively, p<0.001) despite similar age, comorbidities, total days of hospitalization and admission to intensive care unit. COVID-19 and eosinopenia were the strongest risk factors for mortality in the multivariate analysis in the overall COPD population. Inhaled corticosteroid use was not associated to mortality. Conclusion: Hospitalizations for ECOPD without COVID-19 were more frequent than COPD with COVID-19 during the first outbreak, but the latter were associated with higher mortality and low eosinophil counts that warrant further analysis.","Cosio, Borja G; Shafiek, Hanaa; Toledo-Pons, Nuria; Iglesias, Amanda; Barcelo, Margalida; Represas-Represas, Cristina; Comeche, Lorena; Catalan, Pablo; Fernandez-Villar, Alberto; Lopez-Campos, Jose Luis; Echave-Sustaeta, Jose; Soler-Cataluna, Juan Jose",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,721

METHODS: The Emory Center for AIDS Research developed CareKit for research study participants to request HIV self-test kits, STI specimen collection kits, and condom/lubricant packs to be shipped to any mailing address in the United States. STI kits were customized according to study needs, and could include materials to collect whole blood, dried blood spots, urine, rectal and pharyngeal swab samples for syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. Specimens were mailed back to a central CLIA-approved laboratory for testing and results were returned to participants. RESULTS: CareKit was utilized by 12 MSM studies and mailed 1,132 STI kits to 775 participants between January 2018 and March 2020. Participants returned 507 (45%) STI kits, which included 1,594 individual specimens. Eighty-one kits (16%) had at least one positive STI test: pharyngeal Chlamydia (N=7); pharyngeal gonorrhoea (N=11); rectal Chlamydia (N=15); rectal gonorrhoea (N=12); genital Chlamydia (N=6); genital gonorrhoea (N=1); and syphilis (N=54). In this same two-year period, 741 HIV self-test kits were mailed to 643 MSM. CONCLUSIONS: CareKit successfully met studies' needs for home HIV/STI testing and diagnosed many STIs. These processes continue to be adapted for research and programs. The ability to mail home test kits has become increasingly important to reach those who may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Norelli, Jenna; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Sanchez, Travis; Sullivan, Patrick S",Sex. transm. dis,,721
334546,Methods matter - Tailoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody targets to vaccination status,2021,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a phenolic compound that has been well studied for its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immune stimulating properties. This research was aimed to focus on the antiviral properties of CGA on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in vivo and in vitro for the very first time. The outcome of in vitro experiments validated that, out of five previously reported antiviral components, CGA significantly reduced the relative mRNA expression of IBV-N in CEK cells. At high concentration (400 mg/kg), CGA supplementation reduced IBV-N mRNA expression levels and ameliorated the injury in trachea and lungs. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-12, and NF-&#954;B were considerably turned down, but IL-22 and IL-10 were enhanced in trachea. However, CGA-H treatment had considerably increased the expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TLR7, MyD88, IRF7, IFN-ß and IFN-&#945; both in trachea and lungs. Moreover, CGA-H notably induced the CD3+, CD3+ CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ proliferation and significantly increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in the serum. In conclusion, these results showed that at high concentration CGA is a strong anti-IBV compound that can effectively regulate the innate immunity through MDA5, TLR7 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways and have the potential to induce the cell mediated and humoral immune response in IBV infected chickens.","Abaidullah, Muhammad; Peng, Shuwei; Song, Xu; Zou, Yuanfeng; Li, Lixia; Jia, Renyong; Yin, Zhongqiong",Int Immunopharmacol,,721

The changes seen reflect responses to new COVID-19 cases, local health guidelines, and seasonality, making the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 unique from region to region. This paper presents a data-driven case study of electric vehicle (EV) charging and mobility in the wake of COVID-19. The study shows that the number of EV charging sessions and total energy consumed per day dropped by 40% immediately after the arrival of the first COVID-19 case in Utah. By contrast, the energy consumed per charging session fell by just 8% over the same periods and the distribution of session start and end times remained consistent throughout the year. While EV mobility dropped more dramatically than total vehicle mobility during the first wave of COVID-19 cases, and returned more slowly, both returned to stable levels near their mean values by September 2020, despite a dramatic third wave in new infections.","Palomino, Alejandro; Parvania, Masood; Zane, Regan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10182v1.pdf,721

337520,Common genetic variation in humans impacts in vitro susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Understanding influencing factors is essential for the surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, and the factors are likely to vary spatially and temporally as the disease progresses. Taking daily cases and deaths data during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the U.S. as a case study, we develop a mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted regression (M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of social-demographic factors and human activities on the COVID-19 dynamics. Different from the base GTWR model, we incorporate a mobility-adjusted distance weight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial adjacency to capture the correlations among local observations. The model residuals suggest that the proposed model achieves a substantial improvement over other benchmark methods in addressing the spatiotemporal nonstationarity. Our results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity variables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, a 1% increase in population density may lead to 0.63% and 0.71% more daily cases and deaths, and a 1% increase in the mean commuting time may result in 0.22% and 0.95% increases in daily cases and deaths. Although increased human activities will, in general, intensify the disease outbreak, we report that the effects of grocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high population density. And activities at the workplace and public transit are found to either increase or decrease the number of cases and deaths, depending on particular locations. The results of our study establish a quantitative framework for identifying influencing factors during a disease outbreak, and the obtained insights may have significant implications in guiding the policy-making against infectious diseases.","Ling, Lu; Qian, Xinwu; Ukkusuri, Satish V.; Guo, Shuocheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12875v1.pdf,721

Para apoiar estudos epidemiológicos no âmbito dos programas de controle, recentemente surgiram vários métodos de discriminação molecular de isolados de M. bovis. Os mais utilizados são o Spoligotyping, Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units (MIRU) e Exact Tandem Repeat (ETR), que apresentam diferentes poderes de discriminação. No presente estudo calculou-se a diversidade alélica para cada locus de MIRU e de ETR e o índice discriminatório de Hunter-Gaston (HGI) para o Spoligotyping, 10 MIRU e 3 ETR em 116 amostras de M. bovis isoladas de bovinos. Além disso, verificou-se se a capacidade de detectar agrupamentos espaciais de focos aumenta na medida em que é aumentado o poder discriminatório das análises moleculares. Comparou-se a utilização dessas três técnicas moleculares em análises espaciais para verificação de agrupamentos de focos da doença. A análise da diversidade alélica indicou que os MIRU 16, 26 e 27 e os ETR A, B e C foram os que apresentaram maior diversidade dentre os ensaiados. O HGI para cada uma das técnicas foi de: Spoligotyping = 0,738381; MIRU = 0,829835 e ETR = 0,825337. A associação desses métodos aumentou o poder discriminatório: Spoligotyping + MIRU = 0,930585; Spoligotyping + ETR = 0,931034; MIRU + ETR = 0,953373. O maior poder discriminatório foi alcançado quando as três técnicas foram associadas (HGI = 0,98051). Considerando as análises realizadas no presente estudo, o método inicial deveria ser o Spoligotyping, por diferenciar o M. bovis dos outros integrantes do complexo Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Como as associações do MIRU e do ETR com o Spoligotyping resultaram em HGI praticamente idênticos, depois do Spoligotyping, o método ETR parece ser a melhor escolha, pois é mais rápido e econômico do que o MIRU. Finalmente, o MIRU deve ser o último método a ser realizado. Assim, a escolha do método depende do poder discriminatório necessário para o objetivo em questão. Embora a capacidade de detectar agrupamentos espaciais de focos não tenha sido aumentada na medida em que cresceu o poder discriminatório das análises moleculares, a premissa continua válida","Rocha, Vivianne Cambuí Mesquita",,,721

Its rapid transmissibility has transformed healthcare delivery and forced countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. The vast majority of the United States cardiac surgical programs have deferred all but truly emergent/urgent operative procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and to mobilize resources to combat the pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, the incidence of new cases has begun to decline in many North American cities. This ""flattening of the curve"" has prompted interest in reopening the economy, relaxing public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent healthcare delivery. The following document provides a template whereby adult cardiac surgical programs may begin to ramp-up the care delivery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease. ""Resuscitating"" the timely delivery of care is guided by three principles: (1) Collaborate to permit increased case volumes, balancing the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgical procedures with the local resources available within each healthcare system. (2) Prioritize patients awaiting elective procedures while proactively engaging all stakeholders, focusing on those with high-risk anatomy, changing/symptomatic clinical status, and, once these variables have been addressed, prioritizing by waiting times. (3) Reevaluate local conditions continuously to assess for any increase in admissions due to a recrudescence of cases, to assure adequate resources to care for patients, and to monitor in-hospital infectious transmissions to both patients and healthcare workers.","Engelman, Daniel T; Lother, Sylvain; George, Isaac; Ailawadi, Gorav; Atluri, Pavan; Grant, Michael C; Haft, Jonathan W; Hassan, Ansar; Legare, Jean-Francois; Whitman, Glenn; Arora, Rakesh C",Ann Thorac Surg,,721

METHODS: The self-quarantine programme and pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening were initiated for patients who were scheduled for admission later than 7 May 2020 for elective orthopaedic surgery on admission. On the day of admission, the patients declared compliance with self-quarantine regulations. The admission was refused in cases of non-compliance. After admission, the patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR screening. If PCR results were negative, isolation was terminated. If PCR results were positive, the surgery was postponed. If the patients had symptoms suspicious of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after surgery, the PCR test was repeated. RESULTS: Overall, 308 patients (age: 63.2 ± 18.8 years, 197 female and 111 male) were scheduled for elective orthopaedic surgery. Two patients did not agree with the requirements of self-quarantine, and two other procedures were cancelled. No non-compliance was reported; thus, the completion rate of the self-quarantine programme was 304/308 (98.7%). Finally, 304 patients underwent PCR testing, and there were no positive PCR results. After cancellations of four operations due to reasons other than COVID-19, 300 surgical procedures were performed. No patients developed COVID-19 during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Although this system is based on trusting the good behaviour of patients, accompanied by PCR screening, we believe that the results showed the efficacy of the system in safely performing orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nishitani, Kohei; Nagao, Miki; Matsuda, Shuichi",Int Orthop,,721

We developed risk prediction models to identify patients with low risk for COVID-19 from this cohort of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients admitted to our institution's respiratory surveillance wards from 10 February to 30 April 2020 contributed data for analysis. Prediction models for COVID-19 were derived from a training cohort using variables based on demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure risks and blood investigations fitted into logistic regression models. The derived prediction models were subsequently validated on a test cohort. RESULTS: Of the 1,228 patients analysed, 52 (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Two prediction models were derived, the first based on age, presence of sore throat, dormitory residence, blood haemoglobin level (Hb), and total white blood cell counts (TW), and the second based on presence of headache, contact with infective patients, Hb and TW. Both models had good diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 and 0.866, respectively. Risk score cut-offs of 0.6 for Model 1 and 0.2 for Model 2 had 100% sensitivity, allowing identification of patients with low risk for COVID-19. Limiting COVID-19 screening to only elevated-risk patients reduced the number of isolation days for surveillance patients by up to 41.7% and COVID-19 swab testing by up to 41.0%. CONCLUSION: Prediction models derived from our study were able to identify patients at low risk for COVID-19 and rationalise resource utilisation.","Chew, Wui Mei; Loh, Chee Hong; Jalali, Aditi; Fong, Grace Shi En; Senthil Kumar, Loshini; Sim, Rachel Hui Zhen; Tan, Russell Pinxue; Gill, Sunil Ravinder; Liang, Trilene Ruiting; Koh, Jansen Meng Kwang; Tay, Tunn Ren",Singap. med. j,,721

The ideal number of groups, according to STRUCTURE, was K = 2 for both SNPs and SSRs. This could be expected considering the two original gene pools-Andean (AND) and Mesoamerican (MES). The matrices of genetic simple matching dissimilarity for SSRs and SNPs were highly correlated; therefore, the allelic data of the markers was combined and analyzed to understand the genetic relationships of the studied collection. The neighbor-joining analysis considering the genetic distance of simple matching grouped the 265 genotypes into 17 subgroups. The markers SSR and SNP presented high power to discriminate among the genotypes. The ample genetic diversity observed in the work collection makes it a valuable source for the conservation, sustainable management and exploration in breeding programs of the crop.","Carvalho, Marina Santos; de Oliveira Moulin Carias, Cintia Machado; Silva, Matheus Alves; da Silva Ferreira, Marcia Flores; de Souza, Thiago Lívio Pessoa Oliveira; Posse, Sheila Cristina Prucoli; Ferreira, Adesio",Mol.

Due to the lack of consistency in data reporting during the initial spread of COVID-19, the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act was introduced into the Congress that mandates collection and reporting of demographic COVID-19 data on testing, treatments, and deaths by age, sex, race and ethnicity, primary language, socioeconomic status, disability, and county. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated how COVID-19 demographic data have been collected before and after the introduction of this legislation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate differences in reporting and public availability of COVID-19 demographic data by US state health departments and Washington, District of Columbia (DC) before (pre-Act), immediately after (post-Act), and 6 months after (6-month follow-up) the introduction of the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act in the Congress on April 21, 2020. METHODS: We reviewed health department websites of all 50 US states and Washington, DC (N=51). We evaluated how each state reported age, sex, and race and ethnicity data for all confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths and how they made this data available (ie, charts and tables only or combined with dashboards and machine-actionable downloadable formats) at the three timepoints. RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in the number of health departments reporting age-specific data for COVID-19 cases (P=.045) and resulting deaths (P=.002), sex-specific data for COVID-19 deaths (P=.003), and race- and ethnicity-specific data for confirmed cases (P=.003) and deaths (P=.005) post-Act and at the 6-month follow-up (P<.05 for all). The largest increases were race and ethnicity state data for confirmed cases (pre-Act: 18/51, 35%; post-Act: 31/51, 61%; 6-month follow-up: 46/51, 90%) and deaths due to COVID-19 (pre-Act: 13/51, 25%; post-Act: 25/51, 49%; and 6-month follow-up: 39/51, 76%). Although more health departments reported race and ethnicity data based on federal requirements (P<.001), over half (29/51, 56.9%) still did not report all racial and ethnic groups as per the Office of Management and Budget guidelines (pre-Act: 5/51, 10%; post-Act: 21/51, 41%; and 6-month follow-up: 27/51, 53%). The number of health departments that made COVID-19 data available for download significantly increased from 7 to 23 (P<.001) from our initial data collection (April 2020) to the 6-month follow-up, (October 2020). CONCLUSIONS: Although the increased demand for disaggregation has improved public reporting of demographics across health departments, an urgent need persists for the introduced legislation to be passed by the Congress for the US states to consistently collect and make characteristics of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations available in order to allocate resources to mitigate disease spread.","Ossom-Williamson, Peace; Williams, Isaac Maximilian; Kim, Kukhyoung; Kindratt, Tiffany B",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,721

This prospective study aimed to evaluate the results of a follow-up program for patients discharged from a nonintensive COVID-19 ward. METHODS: 3-6 months after hospital discharge, 59 of 105 COVID-19 patients (31 males, aged 68.2 ± 12.8 years) were recruited in the study. Forty-six patients were excluded because of nontraceability, refusal, or inability to provide informed consent. The follow-up consisted of anamnesis (including a structured questionnaire), physical examination, blood tests, ECG, lower limb compression venous ultrasound (US), thoracic US, and spirometry with diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). RESULTS: 22% of patients reported no residual symptoms, 28.8% 1 or 2 symptoms and 49.2% 3 or more symptoms. The most frequently symptoms were fatigue, exertional dyspnea, insomnia, and anxiety. Among the inflammatory and coagulation parameters, only the median value of fibrinogen was slightly above normal. A deep vein thrombosis was detected in 1 patient (1.7%). Thoracic US detected mild pulmonary changes in 15 patients (25.4%), 10 of which reported exertional dyspnea. DLCO was mildly or moderately reduced in 19 patients (37.2%), 13 of which complained of exertional dyspnea. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that a substantial percentage of COVID-19 patients (77.8%) continue to complain of symptoms 3-6 months after hospital discharge. Exertional dyspnea was significantly associated with the persistence of lung US abnormalities and diffusing capacity alterations. Extended follow-up is required to assess the long-term evolution of postacute sequelae of COVID-19.","Fortini, Alberto; Torrigiani, Arianna; Sbaragli, Serena; Lo Forte, Aldo; Crociani, Andrea; Cecchini, Paolo; Innocenti Bruni, Giulia; Faraone, Antonio",Infection,,721

OBJECTIVE: The median effective concentrations (EC50) of Sal-B and ZDDY against SARSCoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells were 55.47 µmol/L and 36.07 µg/mL, respectively. Both Sal-B and ZDDY successfully inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into the cells that stably expressed human ACE2 (ACE2/293T), with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 1.69 µmol/L and 24.81 µg/mL, respectively. Sal-B showed a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol to the 6-helix bundle (6-HB) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Molecular dynamics simulation showed stable binding between Sal-B and the 6-HB of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the predicted binding site. Sal-B disturbed the formation of the secondary structure of 6-HB in HR1P/HR2P mixture, resulting in a significantly lowered &#945;-helicity (P < 0.05). Sal-B dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, with an IC50 of 3.33 µmol/L. Sal-B showed no effect on RBD-Fc protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. OBJECTIVE: Sal-B and its magnesium salt ZDDY can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells in vitro by blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion.","Yang, C; Cheng, C; Wang, J; Chen, K; Zhan, J; Pan, X; Xu, X; Xu, W; Liu, S",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,721

This population is already acknowledged to be at risk of burnout. AIM: We aim to provide a 'snapshot' of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 open to any UK healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, distress and subjective measures of stress were also recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. RESULTS: A total of 539 persons responded to the survey; 90% female, 53% nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% versus 33% under 40 years, P = 0.004), more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P = 0.031), twice as likely to have been redeployed from their usual role (22% versus 11%; P = 0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus 32%, P < 0.001), and were almost 4 times more likely to have previous depression (24% versus 7%; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Independent predictors of burnout were being younger, redeployment, exposure to patients with COVID-19, being female, and a history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.","Ferry, Amy V; Wereski, Ryan; Strachan, Fiona E; Mills, Nicholas L",QJM,,721

347043,[Palmar pulpitis as an isolated expression of SARS-CoV-2 infection],2020,"Despite the virulence and high fatality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no specific antiviral treatment exists until the current moment. Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone. Thus, the use of bee products as an adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 may produce beneficial effects. Implications for treatment outcomes and issues to be considered in future studies are discussed.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Molecules (Basel),,721

METHODS: An internet-based survey of 2,400 Japanese people was conducted in two phases: early phase (baseline survey: February 25-27, 2020) and community-transmission phase (follow-up survey: April 1-6, 2020). The presence of severe psychological distress (SPD) was measured using the Kessler's Six-scale Psychological Distress Scale. The difference of SPD percentages between the two phases was examined. Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the factors associated with the change of SPD status between the two phases. RESULTS: Surveys for both phases had 2,078 valid respondents (49.3% men; average age, 50.3 years). In the two surveys, individuals with SPD were 9.3% and 11.3%, respectively, demonstrating a significant increase between the two phases (P = 0.005). Significantly higher likelihood to develop SPD were observed among those in lower (ie, 18,600-37,200 United States dollars [USD], odds ratio [OR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-3.46) and the lowest income category (ie, <18,600 USD, OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.16-3.86). Furthermore, those with respiratory diseases were more likely to develop SPD (OR 2.56; 95% CI, 1.51-4.34). CONCLUSIONS: From the early to community-transmission phases of COVID-19, psychological distress increased among the Japanese. Recommendations include implementing mental health measures together with protective measures against COVID-19 infection, prioritizing low-income people and those with underlying diseases.","Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Saito, Reiko; Odagiri, Yuko; Kojima, Takako; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Fukui, Keisuke; Inoue, Shigeru",J Epidemiol,,721

In addition, comparisons across different seasons (2016-2017; 2017-2018; 2018-2019 and 2019-2020) using the same methods were also analyzed. Results showed no differences (p > 0.05) between first 24 rounds and the last 10 in 2019-2020 season as well as in the 3 previous seasons. With Pollard's method, no differences (p > 0.05) were also found among those four seasons on global (all 34 rounds) home advantage. However, a significance difference between 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 (p < 0.05) was founded using Matos et al.'s (2020) method, which is an indicator of the importance of using complementary methods when analyzing the same realities. Overall, despite what might be expectable from recent findings, the lack of an audience in the last 10 rounds of Portuguese Football League 2019-2020 season, due to COVID-19 pandemic, did not affect home advantage. Therefore, future studies could try to analyze other different variables in Portuguese Football League, such as referees' behaviors, rules changing (e.g., the possibility of making five substitutions, instead of three), crowd dimension and density as well as include variables about odds as forecasts in football being played without crowds.","Matos, Rui; Monteiro, Diogo; Antunes, Raul; Mendes, Diogo; Botas, João; Clemente, João; Amaro, Nuno",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection. Collectively, these findings hint at the possibility that IL1 and related pro-inflammatory pathways may be prognostic and serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

Laboratory test alterations have been described in COVID-19 patients, but differences with other pneumonias have been poorly investigated to date, especially in Caucasian populations. The aim of this study was to investigate differences and prognostic potential of routine blood tests in a series of Italian patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. METHODOLOGY: Clinical data and routine laboratory tests of a consecutive series of 30 COVID-19 patients and 30 age and sex matched patients with non COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia have been retrospectively collected. Differences in laboratory tests between patients with COVID-19 and non COVID-19 pneumonias have been investigated, as well as differences between COVID-19 survivors and non survivors. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and higher platelet counts. In addition, COVID-19 patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower C reactive protein concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio. Combined blood cell indexes of systemic inflammation were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients. In further analysis of the COVID-19 group, the neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR, systemic inflammation response index and De Ritis ratio, were significantly higher in non survivors than in survivors, while the number of platelets was significantly lower in non survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed several alterations in blood cell populations and indexes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison with patients with non COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these indexes showed promising prognostic abilities. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results.","Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Zinellu, Angelo; Scano, Valentina; Mulas, Giulia; De Riu, Giacomo; Pascale, Rosa M; Arru, Luigi B; Carru, Ciriaco; Pirina, Pietro; Mangoni, Arduino A; Fois, Alessandro G",J Infect Dev Ctries,,721

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed potential barriers to the large-scale adoption of the official contact tracing app that was introduced in Germany on June 16, 2020. METHODS: Survey data were collected from 3276 adults during the week the app was introduced using an offline-recruited, probability-based online panel of the general adult population in Germany. RESULTS: We estimate that 81% of the population aged 18 to 77 years possess the devices and ability to install the official app and that 35% are also willing to install and use it. Potential spreaders show high access to devices required to install the app (92%) and high ability to install the app (91%) but low willingness (31%) to correctly adopt the app, whereas for vulnerable groups, the main barrier is access (62%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a pessimistic view on the effectiveness of app-based contact tracing to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend targeting information campaigns at groups with a high potential to spread the virus but who are unwilling to install and correctly use the app, in particular men and those aged between 30 and 59 years. In addition, vulnerable groups, in particular older individuals and those in lower-income households, may be provided with equipment and support to overcome their barriers to app adoption.","Blom, Annelies G; Wenz, Alexander; Cornesse, Carina; Rettig, Tobias; Fikel, Marina; Friedel, Sabine; Möhring, Katja; Naumann, Elias; Reifenscheid, Maximiliane; Krieger, Ulrich",J Med Internet Res,,721

352387,Immune responses and pathogenesis in persistently PCR-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Social distancing is crucial in breaking the cycle of transmission of COVID-19. However, many religions require the faithful to congregate. In Malaysia, the number of COVID-19 cases spiked up from below 30 in February 2020 to more than a thousand a month later. The sudden increase was mostly linked to a large Islamic gathering attended by 16,000 near the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Another large COVID-19 cluster was from a church gathering in Kuching, Sarawak. Within a few weeks, Malaysia became the worst hit country by COVID-19 in Southeast Asia. While religious leaders have advised social distancing among their congregants, the belief that ""God is our shield"" is often cited for gathering. There is a need to promote sound decision-making among religious adherents so that they will not prioritize their loyalty to the subjective interpretation of religion over evidence-based medicine. Malaysia, a multi-cultural and multi-faith country, is an example of how religious beliefs could strongly influence health behaviours at individual and community levels. In this article, we detail the religious aspects of COVID-19 prevention and control in Malaysia and discuss the possible role of religious organizations in encouraging sound decision-making among religious adherents in mitigating this crisis. We make recommendations on how to promote a partnership between the healthcare system and religious organizations, and how religion and faith could be integrated into health promotion channels and resources in the response of COVID-19 and future communicable diseases.","Tan, M.

352966,New understanding of the damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside the respiratory system,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evidence is accumulating that coronavirus disease 2019 increases the risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation in pregnant patients and for preterm delivery. However, the impact on maternal mortality and whether morbidity is differentially affected by disease severity at delivery and trimester of infection are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. RESULTS: The principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, and class III obesity; (4) 3 maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 for a maternal mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257-3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 vs 5.2% mild coronavirus disease 2019; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalization and case-fatality rates in pregnant patients were significantly higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State. These data indicate that pregnant patients are at risk of severe or critical disease and mortality compared to nonpregnant adults, and also at risk for preterm birth.","Lokken, Erica M; Huebner, Emily M; Taylor, G Gray; Hendrickson, Sarah; Vanderhoeven, Jeroen; Kachikis, Alisa; Coler, Brahm; Walker, Christie L; Sheng, Jessica S; Al-Haddad, Benjamin J S; McCartney, Stephen A; Kretzer, Nicole M; Resnick, Rebecca; Barnhart, Nena; Schulte, Vera; Bergam, Brittany; Ma, Kimberly K; Albright, Catherine; Larios, Valerie; Kelley, Lori; Larios, Victoria; Emhoff, Sharilyn; Rah, Jasmine; Retzlaff, Kristin; Thomas, Chad; Paek, Bettina W; Hsu, Rita J; Erickson, Anne; Chang, Andrew; Mitchell, Timothy; Hwang, Joseph K; Erickson, Stephen; Delaney, Shani; Archabald, Karen; Kline, Carolyn R; LaCourse, Sylvia M; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,721

Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies. It is unknown whether these therapies are associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility or worse outcomes in infected patients. In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of nonbiologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and AD and provide therapeutic recommendations. In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered. Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL-17 and IL-23 favored over IL-12/23 inhibitors. Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than tumor necrosis factor alpha blockers. Apremilast, acitretin, and dupilumab have favorable safety data and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients. Without definitive COVID-19 data, these recommendations may be useful in guiding treatment of psoriasis and AD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ricardo, Jose W; Lipner, Shari R",Dermatol Ther,,721

355424,SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy: maternal and perinatal outcome data of 34 pregnant women hospitalised between May and October 2020,2021,"Sequential diving by wild marine mammals results in a lifetime of rapid physiological transitions between lung collapse-reinflation, bradycardia-tachycardia, vasoconstriction-vasodilation, and oxygen store depletion-restoration. The result is a cycle of normoxia and hypoxia in which blood oxygen partial pressures can decline to <20-30 mmHg during a dive, a level considered injurious to oxygen-dependent human tissues (i.e., brain, heart). Safeguards in the form of enhanced on-board oxygen stores, selective oxygen transport, and unique tissue buffering capacities enable marine-adapted mammals to maintain physiological homeostasis and energy metabolism even when breathing and pulmonary gas exchange cease. This stands in stark contrast to the vulnerability of oxygen-sensitive tissues in humans that may undergo irreversible damage within minutes of ischemia and tissue hypoxia. Recently, these differences in protection against hypoxic injury have become evident in the systemic, multi-organ physiological failure during COVID-19 infection in humans. Prolonged recoveries in some patients have led to delays in the return to normal exercise levels and cognitive function even months later. Rather than a single solution to this problem, we find that marine mammals rely on a unique, integrative assemblage of protections to avoid the deleterious impacts of hypoxia on tissues. Built across evolutionary time, these solutions provide a natural template for identifying the potential for tissue damage when oxygen is lacking, and for guiding management decisions to support oxygen-deprived tissues in other mammalian species, including humans, challenged by hypoxia.","Williams, Terrie M; Davis, Randall W",Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol,,721

In the present study, 662 serum samples collected from February 2020 to January 2021 from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients were tested to determine neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers using a microneutralization test (MNT) for live SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM directed against different viral antigens were measured by high-throughput automated platforms. We observed higher levels of NAbs in elderly (>60 years old) individuals and in patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs develop as soon as five days from symptom onset and, despite a decline after the second month, persist for over 11 months, showing variable dynamics. Through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we set up a testing algorithm, suitable for the laboratory workload, by establishing an optimal cutoff value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for convalescent plasma donors to exclude from MNT samples foreseen to have low/negative NAb titers and ineligible for plasma donation. Overall, MNT, although cumbersome and not suitable for routine testing of large sample sizes, remains the reference tool for the assessment of antibody-mediated immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smart testing algorithms may optimize the laboratory workflow to monitor antibody-mediated protection in COVID-19 patients, plasma donors, and vaccinated individuals.","Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Lapa, Daniele; Meschi, Silvia; Bordi, Licia; Piselli, Pierluca; Gagliardini, Roberta; Corpolongo, Angela; Nicastri, Emanuele; Antinori, Andrea; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta",Viruses,,721

But what methods and conclusions should we endorse as we move from analytics in-the small (dealing with a handful of projects) to analytics in-the-large (dealing with hundreds of projects)? To answer this question, we recheck prior small-scale results (about process versus product metrics for defect prediction) using 722,471 commits from 770 Github projects. We find that some analytics in-the-small conclusions still hold when scaling up to analytics in-the large. For example, like prior work, we see that process metrics are better predictors for defects than product metrics (best process/product-based learners respectively achieve recalls of 98%/44% and AUCs of 95%/54%, median values). However, we warn that it is unwise to trust metric importance results from analytics in-the-small studies since those change, dramatically when moving to analytics in-the-large. Also, when reasoning in-the-large about hundreds of projects, it is better to use predictions from multiple models (since single model predictions can become very confused and exhibit very high variance). Apart from the above specific conclusions, our more general point is that the SE community now needs to revisit many of the conclusions previously obtained via analytics in-the-small.","Majumder, Suvodeep; Mody, Pranav; Menzies, Tim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09569v1.pdf,721

In the absence of curative drugs and with vaccines development still in progress, alternative approaches to stem the tide of the pandemic are being considered. The potential of a phytotherapeutic approach in the management of the dreaded disease has gained attention, especially in developing countries, with several claims of the development of anti-COVID-19 herbal formulations. This is a plausible approach especially with the increasing acceptance of herbal medicine in both alternative and orthodox medical practices worldwide. Also, the established efficacy of herbal remedies in the treatment of numerous viral diseases including those caused by coronaviruses, as well as diseases with symptoms associated with COVID-19, presents a valid case for serious consideration of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.

Thirty minutes after trauma (impact-acceleration model), anesthetized rats were randomly allocated to receive a 2-h infusion of isotonic saline solution (TBI-saline group) or HSL (TBI-HSL group) (n = 10 rats per group). In another series of experiments using a similar protocol, the effects of equiosmolar doses of HSL and hypertonic saline solution (HSS) were compared in TBI rats (n = 10 rats per group). Blood lactate and ion concentrations were measured during the 2-h infusions. RESULTS: Compared to the TBI-saline group, the TBI-HSL group had a reduced latency to complete the adhesive removal test: 6 s (5-9) (median [25-75th centiles]) versus 13 s (8-17) on day 7, and 5 s (5-9) versus 11 s (8-26) on day 14 (P < 0.05), respectively, and a shorter delay to complete the radial arm maze test on day 7: 99 s (73-134) versus 176 s (127-300), respectively (P < 0.05). However, no differences were found between the TBI-HSL and TBI-HSS groups in neurocognitive tests performance. Compared to the TBI-saline group, the HSL and HSS groups had higher serum osmolality: 318 mOsm/Kg (315-321) and 315 mOsm/Kg (313-316) versus 307 mOsm/Kg (305-309), respectively (P < 0.05), and the HSL group had a higher serum lactate concentration: 6.4 mmol/L (5.3-7.2) versus 1.5 mmol/L (1.1-1.9) and 1.6 mmol/L (1.5-1.7), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that improvements in cognitive and sensorimotor tests with HSL infusion post-TBI could be related to elevation of serum osmolality, not to exogenous administration of lactate.","Crespy, Thibaud; Durost, Maxime; Fricault, Pierre; Lemasson, Benjamin; Bouzat, Pierre; Barbier, Emmanuel L; Payen, Jean-François",,,721

Antibiotics and antiviral medicines are essential medicines for the therapy of infectious diseases. This study aims to evaluate their availability, cost and affordability of AaAMs against infectious diseases in 41 public hospitals from 2013 to 2019 in Nanjing, China. METHODS: Data on the availability and price of 17 antibiotics and 6 antiviral medicines in 41 public hospitals were obtained from the Jiangsu Institute of Medicine Information. We adopted the WHO/Health Action International method to measure the availability, cost and affordability of these medicines. RESULTS: The availability of selected medicines against infectious diseases was relatively low; the median availability of originator brands was near-zero and that of lowest-priced generics during the survey period less than 50%. The total availability of medicines was poor in primary hospitals as compared to secondary and tertiary hospitals. The median daily-defined dose cost of originator brands was expensive (range from 66.11 RMB to 107.83 RMB), whereas that of lowest price generics was fairly acceptable at < 8 RMB. The affordability of most surveyed medicines was reasonable, which showed significant improvement over time, but the daily cost of a few medicines for originator brands exceeded the average daily wage. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the affordability of medicines surveyed was acceptable, while the availability was too low. There should be a great concern for improving the reserve system of anti-infective medicines in healthcare institutions. Policy should focus on improving the availability of generic drugs in hospitals and encouraging preferentially prescribed.","Zhu, Yulei; Xu, Xinglu; Fang, Wenqing; Wang, Ying; Dai, Huizhen; Li, Xin",Trop Med Int Health,,721

We investigated the risk of COVID-19 infection and subsequent hospitalisation and death in splenectomized patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of all individuals with a microbiologically verified COVID-19 infection in Denmark through December 31, 2020. To each case, we matched three controls on age, sex, and region of residence. We examined the association between previous splenectomy and the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: We identified 165,623 individuals with a positive COVID-19 test and 493,300 matched controls. Mean age was 38 years. 130 and 422 splenectomies were performed in the COVID-19 positive individuals and controls, respectively. Splenectomized patients did not have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-splenectomized patients (adjusted OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73-1.08). Among COVID-19 positive individuals, splenectomized patients may have an increased risk of hospitalisation or death (adjusted OR for combined endpoint: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.79-2.61). CONCLUSIONS: Splenectomized patients are not at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, but they may have a higher risk of hospitalisation or death among COVID-19 positive individuals. This may be attributed to higher comorbidity levels.","Bojesen, Anders Bo; Lund, Andrea; Mortensen, Frank Viborg; Kirkegård, Jakob",Infect Dis (Lond),,721

Although this topic has been repeatedly reviewed before, the history of human intervention has never been considered a critical factor. A two-stage literature search online for this review, however, yielded a rich history indispensable for the debate over this medical enigma. As we combat the pandemic of COVID-19 coronavirus worldwide today, we can learn invaluable lessons from the historical events in Asia. In this review, I explore the history first and then critically examine in depth major hypotheses proposed in light of accumulated data, global dispersal of the principal vector, patterns of YF transmission, persistence of urban transmission, and the possibility of YF in Asia. Through this process of re-examination of the current knowledge, the subjects for research that should be conducted are identified. This review also reveals the importance of holistic approach incorporating ecological and human factors for many unresolved subjects, such as the enigma of YF absence in Asia, vector competence, vector dispersal, spillback, viral persistence and transmission mechanisms.","Kuno, Goro",Viruses,,721

We aimed at describing COVID-19 infections in the French cohort of lung transplant (LT) patients. METHODS: Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients, 7 (53.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients. Overall survival rate was 85.7% after a median follow-up of 50 days [41.0-56.5]. Four of 5 nonsurvivors had had bronchial complications or intensification of immunosuppression in the previous weeks. On univariate analysis, overweight was significantly associated with risk of death (odds ratio 16.0 [95% confidence interval1.5-170.6], p=0.02).

373695,Different scenarios in the Dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 Infection: an adapted ODE model,2020-04-02,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the optimal examination technique for patients with glaucoma during the COVID-19 pandemic that includes one of the safest methods of tonometry [transpalpebral tonometry (TPT), contour dynamic tonometry (CDT) and Icare rebound tonometry (RBT)] in combination with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 65 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who sought medical aid at the Ophthalmological Center of FMBA during the COVID-19 pandemic; they were examined using three tonometry methods: RBT, TPT and CDT. All patients underwent central corneal thickness measurement, perimetry, OCT and OCTA with assessment of vessel density (VD) of the superficial plexus in the macula (whole image macula) and peripapillary retina (PPR). RESULTS: High correlation was found between the results obtained with RBT, TPT and CDT. None of the methods showed a correlation between IOP and corneal thickness. The correlations between IOP and OCTA parameters were obtained: IOPTPT and VDPPR in the inferior temporal sector (r= -0.386, p=0.027), IOPRBT and VD whole image macula (r= -0.69, p=0.019), and in the macula inferior hemisphere (r= -0.75, p=0.008), as well as between the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and VD in the macular inferior hemisphere (r=0.380, p=0.039). The OCTA parameters had a moderate, but significant correlation with the perimetric indices. CONCLUSIONS: Tonometry methods (TPB, CDT and RBT) exhibit high correlation with each other and no correlation with corneal thickness. IOP parameters measured by different methods, especially using the Icare tonometer, correlate with OCTA parameters, and the latter - with perimetric indices. The combination of these tonometry methods with SD-OCT and OCTA is optimal for examining patients during the pandemic.","Kurysheva, N I; Pechenkina, A A; Goncharova, A S",Vestn Oftalmol,,721

Indeed, the recent COVID‐19 pandemic created the largest disruption of education in history, affecting 94% of the world's student population. In emergencies, technology is often utilised as part of a crisis response protocol by continuing education using emergency remote education (ERE). The purpose of this study is to determine how technology has been used to continue K‐12 learning remotely during an emergency. This systematic review included an aggregated and configurative synthesis to examine extant empirical work over eleven years, from January 2010 to December 2020. Following a rigorous, PRISMA selection process, 60 articles were included in the final analysis from 48 countries. Grounded coding of the strategies used for learning revealed the following categories: communication, delivery systems, student ERE readiness, partnerships, promoting student learning and engagement, and resources. Grounded coding of the technologies revealed that types of technologies used were divided into two major categories: Internet‐based and non‐Internet based, with the majority using Internet‐based technologies. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused school closures across the globe and prevented in‐person school teaching. The rapid shift to distance education in schools can be conceptualised as ‘emergency remote education’ (ERE). Prior ERE research focused on bounded geographic locations where localised emergencies occurred. What this paper adds This provides the scholarly community with a unique systematic review of existing academic research on K‐12 ERE implementation in emergencies. This provides aggregated data and analysis on the past 11 years of the types of emergencies, participants, subject domain, technologies used, and location information. This provides findings of the types of remote teaching strategies involving technology used to continue K‐12 learning in emergency situations. This provides a set of recommendations on ERE for teachers, school leaders, policy makers, and funders. This provides researchers with a review of the field with identification of gaps and future research opportunities. Implications for practice and/or policy Recommendations regarding ERE are provided in this paper that will be of benefit to K‐12 teachers, school leaders policymakers, and funders in the continuing COVID‐19 pandemic and future emergencies. The research gaps highlighted in this paper, such as the lack of studies conducted in low and low middle‐income countries, are presented with suggestions for much needed future research.

375140,Concern about Human Infection from Animals Infected with SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The epidemic of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted worldwide with its infectious spread and mortality rate. Thousands of articles have been published to tackle this crisis and many of these have indicated that high air pollution levels may be a contributing factor to high outbreak rates of COVID-19. Atmospheric pollutants, indeed, producing oxidative stress, inflammation, immuno-unbalance, and systemic coagulation, may be a possible significant co-factor of further damage, rendering the body prone to infections by a variety of pathogens, including viruses. Spermatozoa are extremely responsive to prooxidative effects produced by environmental pollutants and may serve as a powerful alert that signals the extent that environmental pressure, in a specific area, is doing damage to humans. In order to improve our current knowledge on this topic, this review article summarizes the relevant current observations emphasizing the weight that environmental pollution has on the sensitivity of a given population to several diseases and how semen quality, may be a potential indicator of sensitivity for virus insults (including SARS-CoV-2) in high polluted areas, and help to predict the risk for harmful effects of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. In addition, this review focused on the potential routes of virus transmission that may represent a population health risk and also identified the areas of critical importance that require urgent research to assess and manage the COVID-19 outbreak.","Montano, Luigi; Donato, Francesco; Bianco, Pietro Massimiliano; Lettieri, Gennaro; Guglielmino, Antonino; Motta, Oriana; Bonapace, Ian Marc; Piscopo, Marina",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,721

Improving the efficiency of healthcare waste transfer and treatment has become an important task for government health and environmental protection departments at all levels. Based on the situation of healthcare waste disposal in Wuhan during the critical period of the pandemic, this paper analyzes and studies green governance principles and summarizes the problems that exist in the current healthcare waste management system. Through the establishment of temporary storage facilities along transit routes, digital simulation and bionic experiments were carried out in the Hongshan District of Wuhan to improve the efficiency of healthcare waste transfer. Furthermore, this study discusses the coordination and cooperation of government, hospitals, communities, and other departments in the healthcare waste disposal process and provides guiding suggestions for healthcare waste disposal nationwide in order to deal with potential risks and provide effective references in all regions.","Liu, Ziyuan; Liu, Tianle; Liu, Xingdong; Wei, Aijing; Wang, Xiaoxue; Yin, Ying; Li, You",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

376750,Pooled Testing for Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Asymptomatic Individuals,2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-Cov-2 infection or COVID-19 is a global pandemic. In this manuscript, we investigated the primary symptoms and basic hematological presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the Bangladeshi patients. METHODOLOGY: This was a multicentre cross-sectional study done on COVID-19 patients tested positive by RT PCR in Bangladesh. Clinical features of mild to moderate degree of COVID-19 patients; hematological and biochemical admission day laboratory findings of moderate to severe degree hospitalized COVID-19 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh commonly presented with fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and sore throat. But symptoms like myalgia, diarrhea, skin rash, headache, Abdominal pain/cramp, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and a higher temperature of >100°F have a greater presentation rate and more frequent than other published studies. CRP and Prothrombin time was found to increase in all the patients. Serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, and D-Dimer were increased among 53.85%, 80.43, 44%, and 25% patients. 17.39% of the patients had leucocytosis and neutrophilia, 28.26% presented with lymphocytopenia, and 62.52% had mild erythrocytopenia. The difference between the decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) against gender was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study had evaluated a different expression in presenting symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. CRP, Prothrombin time, serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, D-Dimer, erythrocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia can be assessments for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) establish these two markers as a good candidate for diagnostic value against gender.","Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Abu Taiub Mohammed; Karim, Md Rezaul; Mehedi, Hm Hamidullah; Shahbaz, Mohammad; Chowdhury, Md Wazed; Dan, Guo; He, Shuixiang",J Infect Dev Ctries,,721
377726,SARS-CoV-2 docet,2021,"Clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been widely reported in the Korea and around the world. COVID-19 has a high mortality rate, and older patients and those with underlying diseases are at particularly high risk of being infected. Outbreaks in LTCFs, where many high-risk patients reside, result in the occupation of beds meant for severely ill patients and even death in many patients. Long-term care hospitals (LTCH) are major LTCFs in Korea. Therefore, it is very important to protect patients in LTCHs from COVID-19. The reality is that preparedness for COVID-19 in LTCHs is inadequate, and there are barriers to improvements in preparedness. Through institutional improvement and policy support, the government should help healthcare personnel and LTCHs improve installation and raise the level of knowledge of infection prevention and control. With these improvement, prevention, surveillance, and screening for COVID-19 should be done and a response system to the COVID-19 outbreak should be established. There are many challenges that must be overcome to meet the goals proposed in this article. This may be possible only with a spirit of solidarity and cooperation of government, public and private healthcare facilities.","Kim, Tark",,,721

378126,Swab-Free Transport as an Optimized Preanalytical Workflow for SARS-CoV-2 Amplification,2021,"BACKGROUND: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. METHODS: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the ""Parenting During the Pandemic"" survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. FINDINGS: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. INTERPRETATIONS: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent- child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.","Roos, Leslie E; Salisbury, Marlee; Penner-Goeke, Lara; Cameron, Emily E; Protudjer, Jennifer L P; Giuliano, Ryan; Afifi, Tracie O; Reynolds, Kristin",PLoS One,,721
379023,Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 Viral RNA in Nasopharyngeal Swabs after Death: An Observational Study,2021,"BackgroundMexico has suffered one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world. In this study we examined how socio demographic and population health characteristics shape the geospatial variability in excess mortality patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. MethodsWeekly all-cause mortality time series for all 32 Mexican states, from January 4, 2015 to April 10, 2021, were analyzed to estimate the excess mortality rates using Serfling regression models. The association between socio-demographic, health indicators and excess mortality rates were determined using multiple linear regression analyses. Finally, we used functional data analysis to characterize clusters of states with distinct mortality growth rate curves. ResultsThe overall all-cause excess deaths rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico until April 10, 2021 was estimated at 39.66 per 10 000 population. The lowest excess death rates were observed in southeastern states including Chiapas (12.72), Oaxaca (13.42) and Quintana Roo (19.41) whereas Mexico City had the highest excess death rate (106.17), followed by Tlaxcala (51.99) and Morelos (45.90). We found a positive association of excess mortality rates with aging index (P value<.0001), marginalization index (P value<.0001), and average household size (P value=0.0003) in the final adjusted model (Model R2=76%). We identified four distinct clusters with qualitatively similar excess mortality curves. ConclusionCentral states exhibited the highest excess mortality rates whereas the distribution of aging index, marginalization index, and average household size explained the variability in excess mortality rates across Mexico. Our findings can help tailor interventions to mitigate the mortality impact of the pandemic.

381306,"Observational study of people infected with SARS-Cov-2, treated with amantadine",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Interferons are produced in response to the presence of pathogens in cells and are responsible for the proper formation of immune reaction. Preliminary data obtained in studies of properties of recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) that involved patients with community-acquired pneumonia (including bacterial), acute respiratory viral infection (ARVI), influenza and new coronavirus infection have shown promising results.The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of subcutaneous administration of IFN-Î³ in patients with viral pneumonia on the changes of vital signs and the duration of hospital stay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An open-label, randomized, low-interventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID-19 over 18 years of age of both sexes. IFN-Î³ 500,000 IU was administered s/c, daily, once a day, during 5 days. RESULTS: IFN-y in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID-19. Special emphasis should be made to the fact that patients who received recombinant IFN- Î³ experienced no progression of respiratory failure and required no transfer to intensive care unit. DISCUSSION: This study confirms earlier obtained data on the positive effect of IFN-y on the rate of clinical stabilization and recovery of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and viral infections. Presented results are limited to a small number of patients; further study of drug properties in post-marketing studies is required. CONCLUSION: Progress in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 by adding recombinant IFN-Î³ to the complex therapy may reasonably expand the range of existing treatment options for this infection.","Myasnikov, A L; Berns, S A; Talyzin, P A; Ershov, F I",Vopr Virusol,,721
382854,Hyposalivation as a potential risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection: Inhibitory role of saliva,2020,"Most recently, the whole world is struggling against the virulent pandemic COVID-19. Due to the unbounded global spread of the disease, having biosensors with high performance such as high sensitivity and accuracy is of utmost importance. In this paper, the effects of various parameters on the behaviors of micro-biosensors are investigated in order to enhance their performance. These parameters are related to the geometry and material, and they are assumed to be gradually changing in the longitudinal direction of the biosensor according to a power law. Therefore, they are called functionally graded geometrical and material parameters. Another aspect is when considering microcantilever-based biosensors, the main behavior parameter is the deflection at the free end. In the analyses, the influences of the surface stress and van der Waals intermolecular forces are taken into account. Also, the total energy of the beam, which is the combination of the van der Waals energy and the elastic strain energy, is accomplished. In addition, the equivalent force causing the deflection is also evaluated using Castigliano method for two cases. These cases account for a concentrated force at the free end and a distributed load along the biosensor, respectively. Since the governing equations account for the size dependency and the considered parameters are functions of the position, the solution is too complex to be achieved analytically, and therefore, numerical methods are applied. For uniform biosensors made of homogeneous materials, or in other words when all parameters are not varying with the position, the obtained results are compared with those in the literature, and good agreement is obtained. On the other hand, the performance, which include sensitivity and limit of detection, of functionally graded biosensors can be enhanced by proper choices of the considered parameters and the corresponding exponent of the gradation function.","Shabana, Yasser M; Samy, Mohamed A; Abdel-Aziz, Mohamed A; Hindawi, Mohamed E; Mosry, Mohamed G; Albarawy, Abdul-Rahman M; Omar, Mazen M; Mohamed, Ayman A; Attia, Ahmed A",Arch Appl Mech,,721

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C.; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Krznaric, Zeljko; Nitzan, Dorit; Pirlich, Matthias; Singer, Pierre",Aktuel.

With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19, as in a post-surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started on March 17, 2020, and ended on April 24, 2020. Consulting/phone interviews were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated structure and psychological resistance. Eight patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. RESULTS: In essence, from the overall analysis of the data derived from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function, the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects, and the use of positive personal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V kidney failure are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient. CONCLUSION: Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.","Lupi, Diana; Binda, Barbara; Montali, Filippo; Natili, Andrea; Lancione, Laura; Chiappori, Davide; Parzanese, Ida; Maccarone, Daniela; Pisani, Francesco",Transplant Proc,,721

There have been a variety of guidelines and precautions developed to help mitigate this risk. While many reviews have focused on the personal protective equipment (PPE) and preparation guidelines for surgery in the COVID-19 era, none have focused on the more creative and unusual solutions designed to limit viral transmission. This review aims to fill that need. Data Sources: PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus. Methods: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on September 28, 2020 using PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus databases. All English-language studies were included if they proposed or assessed novel interventions developed for Otolaryngology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: A total of 41 papers met inclusion criteria and were organized into 5 categories ('General Recommendations for Otolaryngologic Surgery', 'Equipment Shortage Solutions', 'Airway Procedures', 'Nasal Endoscopy and Skull Base Procedures', and 'Otologic Procedures'). Articles were summarized, highlighting the innovations created and evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Creative solutions such as application of topical viricidal agents, make-shift mask filters, three-dimensional (3-D) printable adapters for headlights, aerosol containing separation boxes, and a variety of new draping techniques have been developed to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Conclusions: Persistent risk of COVID-19 exposure remains high. Thus, there is an increased need for solutions that mitigate the risk of viral transmission during office procedures and surgeries, especially given that most COVID-19 positive patients present asymptomatically. This review examines and organizes creative solutions that have been proposed and utilized in the otolaryngology.

389233,Na+/K+-ATPase as a Target of Cardiac Glycosides for the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Advances in perioperative care have enabled early discharge and outpatient primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However, the safety of early discharge after revision TJA (rTJA) remains unknown and the COVID-19 pandemic will force decreased hospitalization. This study compared 90-day outcomes in patients undergoing aseptic rTJA discharged the same or next day (early) to those discharged 2 or 3 days postoperatively (later). METHODS: In total, 530 aseptic rTJAs performed at a single tertiary care referral center (December 5, 2011 to December 30, 2019) were identified. Early and later discharge patients were matched as closely as possible on procedure type, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, age, and body mass index. All patients were optimized using modern perioperative protocols. The rate of 90-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions was compared between groups. RESULTS: In total, 183 early discharge rTJAs (54 hips, 129 knees) in 178 patients were matched to 183 later discharge rTJAs (71 hips, 112 knees) in 165 patients. Sixty-two percent of the sample was female, with an overall average age and body mass index of 63 ± 9.9 (range: 18-92) years and 32 ± 6.9 (range: 18-58) kg/m2. There was no statistical difference in 90-day ED visit rates between early (6/178, 3.4%) and later (11/165, 6.7%) discharge patients (P = .214). Ninety-day hospital admission rates for early (7/178, 3.9%) and later (4/165, 2.4%) discharges did not differ (P = .545). CONCLUSION: Using modern perioperative protocols with appropriate patient selection, early discharge following aseptic rTJA does not increase 90-day readmissions or ED visits. As hospital inpatient capacity remains limited due to COVID-19, select rTJA patients may safely discharge home the same or next day to preserve hospital beds and resources for more critical illness.","Buller, Leonard T; Hubbard, Trey A; Ziemba-Davis, Mary; Deckard, Evan R; Meneghini, R Michael",J. arthroplasty,,721
389288,Concordance of Pre-Procedure Testing With Time of Surgery Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Children,2021,"The chemical treatment of the wastewater used for the bioinsecticide production by the bacterium Photorhabdus temperata was investigated in this study. An improvement of the volatile suspended solids (VSS) solubilization along with an increase in protein, carbohydrate, reducing sugar and nitrogen concentrations were demonstrated after alkali and thermo-alkali hydrolysis. In contrast, the application of acidic and thermo-acidic pretreatments reduced the organic matter hydrolysis. Compared to untreated wastewater, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization and the heavy metal concentration, except manganese, were enhanced in all the chemically pretreated wastewaters. Although its low contribution in the solubilization of the wastewater organic matter, the acidic-pretreated wastewater showed the highest performance in supporting P. temperata biopesticide production. Indeed, using the acidic-pretreated wastewater as a fermentation medium decreased the lag phase, enhanced the growth of the strain K122 to reach a final biomass production of 20 × 108 cells/mL, increased culturable cell count to 262 × 106 cells/mL and improved oral toxicity against Ephestia kuehniella larvae by 68.4%. Among chemical pretreatments performed, the acidic hydrolysis was demonstrated to be the unique promising one for P. temperata bioinsecticide production due to its ability to reduce aromatic compounds as shown by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.","Jallouli, Wafa; Keskes, Sahar; Guidara, Wassim; Rezgui, Fatma; Sayadi, Sami; Tounsi, Slim",J Environ Manage,,721

391564,On the molecular determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 attack,2020,"There is a new public health crisis threatening the world with the emergence and spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was later named as a novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. It was then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of February 5, 2021, 103 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. The number of death tolls continue to rise, and a large number of countries have been forced to implement social distancing and lockdown. As per literature, Coronavirus is transmitted human to human or human to animal via airborne droplets. Coronavirus enters the human cell through membrane ACE-2 exopeptidase receptor. WHO, ECDC, and ICMR advised to avoid public places and close contact with infected persons and pet animals. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and respiratory therapy. Although several therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic. In the present literature review, the causative agents of the pandemic, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis techniques are discussed. Further, currently used treatment and prevention strategies along with vaccine trials and computational tools are all described in detail.","Sharma, Rahul; Khokhar, Dharmendra; Gupta, Bhanushree; Saxena, Purnendu; Ghosh, Kallol Kumar; Geda, Arvind Kumar; Kuca, Kamil",Curr. med. chem,,721

It even causes death in people who are fond of it. In this case, the role of the immune system is vital. In particular, the cycle of melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol released from the pineal hormone ensures that immunity continues for 24 h. While 5-MTX is active in sunlight, melatonin secretion increases in the dark at night. 5-MTX, like melatonin, has shown antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties in studies. Therefore, people who are sick and those who are not must strictly comply with the 24-h circadian rhythm during this period. We think that it is crucial in terms of being protected from the disease that we should carry out our activities according to the circadian rhythm.","Sehirli, Ahmet Özer; Sayiner, Serkan",Med Hypotheses,,721

METHODS: We analyzed national surveillance data to compare incidence of respiratory viruses during 2016-2019 vs. 2020. Results of multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for eight respiratory viruses were included: adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV; non-SARS-CoV-2), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). RESULTS: During 2016-2019, rates of detection of respiratory viruses were relatively stable: ADV, 3.7%-9.2%; PIV, 1.4%-17.0%; RSV, 0.3%-15.3%; IFV, 0.4%-35.6%; HCoV, 1.5%-8.4%; HRV, 7.0%-25.1%; HBoV, 0.6%-6.3%; and HMPV, 0.7%-14.5%. Following implementation of social distancing in February 2020, rates of detection of enveloped viruses (HCoV, HMPV, IFV, PIV and RSV) were significantly reduced by up to 100%. However, non-enveloped viruses (ADV, HRV and HBoV) persisted throughout 2020, and HRV rates in hospitalized patients significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of social distancing for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea, rates of detection of enveloped respiratory viruses decreased significantly, whereas non-enveloped viruses persisted, suggesting that enhanced infection prevention strategies are required to mitigate spread of these viruses.","Park, Sangshin; Michelow, Ian C; Choe, Young June",J. infect. dis,,721

395506,Noscapine anticancer drug designed with ionic liquids to enhance solubility: DFT and ADME approach,2020,"Older adults with cancer are more likely to have worse clinical outcomes than their younger counterparts, and shared decision-making can be difficult, due to both complexity from adverse ageing and under-representation in clinical trials. Geriatric assessment (GA) has been increasingly recognised as a predictive and prehabilitative tool for older adults with cancer. However, GA has been notoriously difficult to implement in oncological settings due to workforce, economic, logistical, and practical barriers. We aimed to review the heterogenous literature on implementation of GA in oncology settings to understand the different implementation context configurations of GA and the mechanisms they trigger to enable successful implementation. A systematic realist review was undertaken in two stages: i) systematic searches with structured data extraction combined with iterative key stakeholder consultations to develop programme theories for implementing GA in oncology settings; ii) synthesis to refine programme theories. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA, Epistemonikos, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, DARE and Health Technology Assessment were searched. Four programme theories were developed from 53 included articles and 20 key stakeholder consultations addressing the major barriers of GA implementation in oncology practice: time (leveraging non-specialists), funding (creating favourable health economics), practicalities (establishing the use of GA in cancer care), and managing limited resources. We demonstrate that a whole system approach is required to improve the implementation of GA in cancer settings. This review will help inform policy decisions regarding implementation of GA and provide a basis for further implementation research.","McKenzie, Gordon A G; Bullock, Alex F; Greenley, Sarah L; Lind, Michael J; Johnson, Miriam J; Pearson, Mark",Journal of geriatric oncology,,721

The disease manifestations in patients with chronic kidney disease and especially those on haemodialysis are still being understood, with only a few overseas case series, and small observational trials thus far. It appears that the disease is more severe in this patient cohort. Part of the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 is related to accompanying cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, has been trialled for treatment of CRS in COVID-19, but not yet approved. We present a case of an Australian patient on long-term haemodialysis with severe COVID-19 who was successfully treated with Tocilizumab. The peak of her illness was on day 7, with a C-reactive protein of 624 mg/L (reference < 5 mg/L), ferritin of 5293 ng/mL (reference 30-500 ng/mL), and interleukin-6 level 1959.7 pg/mL, consistent with CRS. She was severely hypoxic on a ventilator, with rising inotropic requirements. With the use of Tocilizumab, there was a significant and immediate response in her inflammatory markers, and she made a steady recovery.

397306,The age-dependent decline of the extracellular thiol-disulfide balance and its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease “COVID-19” emerged in China and rapidly spread to other countries; due to its rapid worldwide spread, the WHO has declared this as a global emergency. As there is no specific treatment prescribed to treat COVID-19, the seeking of suitable therapeutics among existing drugs seems valuable. The structure availability of coronavirus macromolecules has encouraged the finding of conceivable anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics through in silico analysis. The results reveal that quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI) and saquinavir strongly interact with the active site (Cys-His catalytic dyad), thereby are predicted to hinder the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Out of 113 quinoline-drugs, elvitegravir and oxolinic acid are able to interact with the NTP entry-channel and thus interfere with the RNA-directed 5′-3′ polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The bioactivity-prediction results also validate the outcome of the docking study. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 Spike-glycoprotein uses human ACE2-receptor for viral entry, targeting the Spike-RBD-ACE2 has been viewed as a promising strategy to control the infection. The result shows rilapladib is the only quinoline that can interrupt the Spike-RBD-ACE2 complex. In conclusion, owing to their ability to target functional macromolecules of SARS-CoV-2, along with positive ADMET properties, quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI), saquinavir, elvitegravir, oxolinic acid, and rilapladib are suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.","Alexpandi, Rajaiah; De Mesquita, Joelma Freire; Pandian, Shunmugiah Karutha; Ravi, Arumugam Veera",Front.

398708,Pulmonary surfactant itself must be a strong defender against SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Rationale: Many viral infections are known to activate the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. However, the role of p38 activation in viral infection and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. The role of virus-hijacked p38 MAPK activation in viral infection was investigated in this study. Methods: The correlation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and p38 activation was studied in patient tissues and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation, GST pulldown and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the interaction of p38&#945; and the HCV core protein. In vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometry were used to analyze the phosphorylation of the HCV core protein. Plaque assays, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to determine the effect of p38 activation on viral replication. Results: HCV infection was associated with p38 activation in clinical samples. HCV infection increased p38 phosphorylation by triggering the interaction of p38&#945; and TGF-ß activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1 (TAB1). TAB1-mediated p38&#945; activation facilitated HCV replication, and pharmaceutical inhibition of p38&#945; activation by SB203580 suppressed HCV infection at the viral assembly step. Activated p38&#945; interacted with the N-terminal region of the HCV core protein and subsequently phosphorylated the HCV core protein, which promoted HCV core protein oligomerization, an essential step for viral assembly. As expected, SB203580 or the HCV core protein N-terminal peptide (CN-peptide) disrupted the p38&#945;-HCV core protein interaction, efficiently impaired HCV assembly and impeded normal HCV replication in both cultured cells and primary human hepatocytes. Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also activated p38 MAPK. Most importantly, pharmacological blockage of p38 activation by SB203580 effectively inhibited SFTSV, HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Our study shows that virus-hijacked p38 activation is a key event for viral replication and that pharmacological blockage of p38 activation is an antiviral strategy.","Cheng, Yuting; Sun, Fang; Wang, Luyao; Gao, Minjun; Xie, Youli; Sun, Yu; Liu, Huan; Yuan, Yufeng; Yi, Wei; Huang, Zan; Yan, Huan; Peng, Ke; Wu, Yingliang; Cao, Zhijian",Theranostics,,721

Consequently, the design of these urban environments requires new approaches. It is our view that Human Factors and Ergonomics approaches can be used to provide these insights. This article explores the opportunities for making public spaces safer and more accessible for community use under pandemic conditions. The study utilizes a sociotechnical systems model of an archetype public space, developed pre-COVID-19, to explore the infrastructure and activities that are impacted by the introduction of the virus to the public space system. The aim was to identify those elements of the system that are completely unavailable under pandemic conditions, those elements that become limited in use, and those which remained unaffected by the presence of the virus. The findings show that under pandemic conditions pre-COVID-19 public spaces were surprisingly resilient with proportionally few elements within the model completely unavailable. They also demonstrate that overall, the public spaces system, while still operating, is significantly constrained in achieving and optimizing community and individual health and well-being. The insertion of five (5) urban design interventions within the system model presented unique insights into the possibilities for optimizing adaptive capacity. These interventions revealed design opportunities across several levels of the systems model. Such insights are argued to assist in not only re-establishing community access under pandemic conditions but also more inclusive access to a broader range of the community under all conditions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Stevens, N.

Furthermore, supplying firms are facing increased lead times amid the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, each affected entity has employed specific strategies to address these disruptions. For instance, manufacturing firms are refining their production schedules based on the inventory, getting better visibility to their suppliers’ performance and developing new inbound routes to meet the production challenges. They are also assessing the tier-1 supplier’s risk and activating the relationship with secondary suppliers to address the procurement issues. Second, distributors are modifying inventory policies to meet the inventory shortage. Finally, supplying firms are developing alternative outbound logistics to meet the growing demand. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations to this study. First, the results of this study cannot be generalized to a wider population. Second, this study explores the interpretations of senior managers based in four Asian countries only. Originality/value: Our study contributes to the supply chain literature by exploring the disruptions caused by COVID-19 to the supply chain operations. It also contributes to theory and practice by articulating the strategies adopted by firms to address such disruptions. Firms can use the steps highlighted in this study to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the supply chain disruptions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Butt, A.

Two elements are essential to monitor the evolution of the pandemic as well as to analyze the effectiveness of the response measures: reliable data and useful indicators. We present an indicator that helps to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the community's health, combining two different components: the extent of the pandemics (i.e. the share of the population affected) and its severity (the intensity of the disease on those affected). The severity measure derives from the application of an evaluation protocol that allows comparing population distributions based on the proportions of those affected with different health conditions. We illustrate the functioning of this indicator over a case study regarding the situation of the Italian regions on March 9 (the beginning of the confinement) and April 8, 2020, one month later.","Herrero, Carmen; Villar, Antonio",PLoS One,,721

With delays in the 2021 Electronic Residency Applications Service (ERAS) timeline, students and programs have had more time to interact prior to the formal application process. This communication will report recent trends in social media presence by OHNS residency programs, and discuss mechanisms to compensate for decreased applicant-program interactions using social media ahead of the 2021 Match. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of the accredited otolaryngology residency programs in the United States, the number of social media profiles on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook from 2009 to 2019 were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Most programs (61%) have at least 1 social media profile. Over the past 10 years, the number of programs on social media has increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter and Instagram showed higher rates of growth compared to Facebook. With the reduction of in-person opportunities for interactions, both applicants and programs are utilizing social media to showcase their values and their research. Twitter, in particular, also serves as a platform for professional networking. CONCLUSION: Both Twitter and Instagram are growing in popularity among programs and applicants to enhance networking. Social media is a powerful tool for networking and may help compensate for limitations imposed on the residency match process by the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining professionalism considerations. The impact of social media on the 2021 otolaryngology residency match is an evolving phenomenon.","Ahmadmehrabi, Shadi; Xie, Deborah X; Ward, Bryan K; Bryson, Paul C; Byrne, Patrick",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,721

Given that early reports from heavily affected areas demonstrated a very high mortality rate amongst kidney transplant recipients, ranging between 30% and 40%, we sought to evaluate outcomes at a center with a high burden of cases but not experiencing acute crisis due to COVID-19. PROCEDURES: In this single center retrospective observational study, medical records of all kidney transplant recipients at the UCLA Medical Center were reviewed for a diagnosis of COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction, followed by chart review to determine kidney transplant characteristics and clinical course. MAIN FINDINGS: A total of 41 kidney transplant recipients were identified with COVID-19 positive polymerase chain reaction. Recipients had been transplanted for a median of 47 months before diagnosis. The large proportion of infected individuals were minorities (Hispanic 65.9%, black 14.6%), on prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (95.1%, 87.8%, and 87.8%, respectively), and had excellent allograft function (median 1.25 mg/dL). The most common presenting symptoms were fever, dyspnea, or cough. Most patients were hospitalized (63.4%); mortality was 9.8% and occurred only in patients in the intensive care unit. The most common treatment was reduction or removal of antimetabolite (77.8%). Approximately 26.9% presented with AKI. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients results in a higher rate of hospitalization and mortality than in the general population. In an area with a high number of infections, the mortality rate was lower compared with earlier reports from areas experiencing early surge and strain on the medical system. Minorities were disproportionately affected. Future studies are needed to determine optimal approach to treatment and management of immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection.","Lum, Erik; Bunnapradist, Suphamai; Multani, Ashrit; Beaird, Omer E; Carlson, Margrit; Gaynor, Pryce; Kotton, Camille; Abdalla, Basmah; Danovitch, Gabriel; Kendrick, Elizabeth; Pham, Phuong T; Yabu, Julie; Schaenman, Joanna",Transplant. proc,,721

This study, as a first attempt, assesses how COVID-19 lockdown affects the Chinese consumers’ purchasing and consumption behaviour from a sustainability point of view. To reach this objective, a semi-structured questionnaire is designed, collecting data from 1006 participants. The food purchasing behaviour towards the importance of sustainable attributes (P), sustainable healthy diets (D) and food waste (W) as three dependent variables are measured, and three binary logistic regressions are estimated. Results show that gender and age are relevant factors affecting sustainable behaviour. Household size has a significant effect on the healthy diet shift and food waste reduction. Risk attitude has a negative and significant impact on the sustainable purchase decision. In addition, consumers’ food security, financial and health risk perceptions are highly important factors in understanding consumers’ sustainable purchasing and consumption behaviour. Consumers’ subjective and objective knowledge levels regarding COVID-19 influence consumers’ sustainability shift during the lockdown. The findings provide some practical implications for policymakers and stakeholders to carry out more socially acceptable policy actions that ensure consumers’ sustainable purchasing and consumption behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Shanshan Kallas Zein Rahmani Djamel",Food Control,,721

Existing research has provided mixed evidence concerning the diagnostic demarcation of AN and AAN. The aim of the present study was to identify research priorities for furthering the understanding of AN and AAN as diagnostic entities. METHOD: Employing the Delphi methodology, experts in the field were invited to suggest research questions that need to be explored in the demarcation of AN from AAN. This yielded 24 research areas, that were presented in subsequent rounds where panelists were asked to prioritize areas of primary interest. RESULTS: Fifty-three panelists completed all three Delphi rounds. Consensus was only reached on three items considered to be of primary interest: medical, neurobiological, and neurological factors; epidemiology and natural course; and treatment response in AAN compared to AN. In contrast, questions of premorbid weight and determining the need for and nature of a body mass index cutoff differentiating between AAN and AN were seen as being of low priority. DISCUSSION: These findings reveal a relatively low degree of consensus on the demarcation of AN from AAN in the field of eating disorders. A reason could be that the definition and use of the AAN category vary in research and clinical practice. In order to achieve further diagnostic clarity, research on the demarcation of AAN and AN should focus on the identified prioritized research areas.","Strand, Mattias; Zvrskovec, Johan; Hübel, Christopher; Peat, Christine M; Bulik, Cynthia M; Birgegård, Andreas",Int J Eat Disord,,721

407196,Spreading of a new SARS-CoV-2 N501Y spike variant in a new lineage,2021,"BACKGROUND: The major complication of COVID-19 is hypoxaemic respiratory failure from capillary leak and alveolar oedema. Experimental and early clinical data suggest that the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib reverses pulmonary capillary leak. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was done at 13 academic and non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Hospitalised patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19, as confirmed by an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation of greater than 94% were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing pulmonary disease, had pre-existing heart failure, had undergone active treatment of a haematological or non-haematological malignancy in the previous 12 months, had cytopenia, or were receiving concomitant treatment with medication known to strongly interact with imatinib. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral imatinib, given as a loading dose of 800 mg on day 0 followed by 400 mg daily on days 1-9, or placebo. Randomisation was done with a computer-based clinical data management platform with variable block sizes (containing two, four, or six patients), stratified by study site. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours, while being alive during a 28-day period. Secondary outcomes included safety, mortality at 28 days, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. All efficacy and safety analyses were done in all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of study medication (modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020-001236-10). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2020, and Jan 4, 2021, 805 patients were screened, of whom 400 were eligible and randomly assigned to the imatinib group (n=204) or the placebo group (n=196). A total of 385 (96%) patients (median age 64 years [IQR 56-73]) received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 h was not significantly different between the two groups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·95 [95% CI 0·76-1·20]). At day 28, 15 (8%) of 197 patients had died in the imatinib group compared with 27 (14%) of 188 patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0·51 [0·27-0·95]). After adjusting for baseline imbalances between the two groups (sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) the HR for mortality was 0·52 (95% CI 0·26-1·05). The HR for mechanical ventilation in the imatinib group compared with the placebo group was 1·07 (0·63-1·80; p=0·81). The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 days (IQR 3-13) in the imatinib group compared with 12 days (6-20) in the placebo group (p=0·0080). 91 (46%) of 197 patients in the imatinib group and 82 (44%) of 188 patients in the placebo group had at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. The safety evaluation revealed no imatinib-associated adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The study failed to meet its primary outcome, as imatinib did not reduce the time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The observed effects on survival (although attenuated after adjustment for baseline imbalances) and duration of mechanical ventilation suggest that imatinib might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but further studies are required to validate these findings.

Green infrastructure (GI) has been increasingly recognized as a promising nature-based solution for climate change adaptation, mitigation, and other societal objectives for sustainable development. Although the climate contribution of GI has been extensively addressed in the literature, the linkages between the climate benefits and associated co-benefits and trade-offs remain unclear. We systematically reviewed the evidence from 141 papers, focusing on their climate benefits, relevant co-benefits and trade-offs, and the GI types that provide such climate (co-)benefits. This study presents a comprehensive overview of the links between climate benefits, co-benefits and types of GI, categorized along a green-grey continuum so that researchers/practitioners can find information according to their topic of interest. We further provide an analysis of trade-offs between various GI benefits. 'Bundles' of major co-benefits and trade-offs for each climate benefit can be identified with recommendations for strategies to maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs. To promote climate-resilient pathways through GI, it is crucial for decision-makers to identify opportunities to deliver multiple ecosystem services and benefits while recognizing disservices and trade-offs that need to be avoided or managed.","Choi, Changsoon; Berry, Pam; Smith, Alison",J Environ Manage,,721

Nonetheless, we continue to see children and adolescents with HIVAN all over the world. Furthermore, once HIVAN is established in children, it is difficult to revert its long-term progression, and we need better animal models of childhood HIVAN to test new treatments.Objectives. To define whether the HIV-1 trans-activator (Tat) gene precipitates HIVAN in young mice, and to develop an inducible mouse model of childhood HIVAN.Design/Methods: An HIV-Tat gene cloned from a child with HIVAN was used to generate recombinant adenoviral vectors (rAd-Tat). rAd-Tat and LacZ control vectors (2 x 109) were expressed in the kidney of newborn wild type and HIV-transgenic (Tg26) FVB/N mice without significant proteinuria (n=5 - 8 per group). Mice were sacrificed 7 and 35 days later to assess their renal outcome, the expression of HIV-genes and growth factors, and markers of cell growth and differentiation by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and/or Western blots.Results: HIV-Tat induced the expression of HIV-1 genes (env) and heparin binding growth factors in the kidney of HIV-Tg26 mice, and precipitated HIVAN in the first month of life. No significant renal changes were detected in wild type mice infected with rAd-Tat vectors, suggesting that HIV-Tat alone does not induce renal disease.Conclusion This new mouse model of childhood HIVAN highlights the critical role that HIV-Tat plays in the pathogenesis of HIVAN, and could be used to study the pathogenesis and treatment of HIVAN in children and adolescents.","Tang, Pingtao; Das, Jharna R; Li, Jinliang; Yu, Jing; Ray, Patricio E",Dis. model. mech.

In the present parafoveal preview study conducted in Finnish, we examined the exact nature of this effect by comparing reading of morphologically complex words (a stem + two suffixes) to that of monomorphemic words. In the preview-change condition, the final 3-4 letters were replaced with other letters making the target word a pseudoword; for suffixed words, the word stem remained intact but the suffix information was unavailable; for monomorphemic words, only part of the stem was parafoveally available. Three alternative predictions were put forth. According to the first alternative, the morphological effect in initial fixation location is due to parafoveally perceiving the suffix as a highly frequent letter cluster and then adjusting the saccade program to land closer to the word beginning for suffixed than monomorphemic words. The second alternative, the processing difficulty hypothesis, assumes a morphological complexity effect: suffixed words are more complex than monomorphemic words. Therefore, the attentional window is narrower and the saccade is shorter. The third alternative posits that the effect reflects parafoveal access to the word's stem. The results for the initial fixation location and fixation durations were consistent with the parafoveal stem-access view.","Hyönä, Jukka; Heikkilä, Timo T; Vainio, Seppo; Kliegl, Reinhold",Cognition,,721

Additionally, we compared vaccinated patients indexed on the date of vaccination and the same patients indexed on a prior date or visit. ResultsCOVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination differ drastically from each other in terms of populations vaccinated and their status on the day of vaccination. When compared to indexing on a visit in unvaccinated population, influenza vaccination had markedly higher covariate proportions and COVID-19 vaccination had lower proportions of most covariates on the index date. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccination had similar covariate proportions when compared to an arbitrary date. These effects attenuated but were still present with a longer lookback period. The effect of day 0 was present even when patients served as their own controls. ConclusionPatient baseline characteristics are sensitive to the choice of the index date. In vaccine safety studies, unexposed index event should represent vaccination settings. Study designs previously used to assess influenza vaccination must be reassessed for COVID-19 to account for a potentially healthier population and lack of medical activity on the day of vaccination.","Ostropolets, Anna; Ryan, Patrick B; Schuemie, Martijn J; Hripcsak, George",,,721

411780,Utility of nasopharyngeal swabs in series before hospitalization during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak,2020,"This study investigated parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years among Chinese parents who are healthcare workers. A closed online survey among full-time doctors or nurses employed by the five collaborative hospitals who had access to smartphones was conducted. Facilitated by the hospital administrators, prospective participants received an invitation sent by the research team via the existing WeChat/QQ groups to complete an online questionnaire. A total of 2,281 participants completed the survey. This study was a sub-analysis of 1332 participants who had at least one child under the age of 18 years. Among the participants, 44.5% reported that they would likely or very likely to have their children under the age of 18 years take up COVID-19 vaccination in the next six months. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, perceived higher vaccine efficacy, longer protection duration, perceived high/very high chance for China to prevent another wave of COVID-19 outbreak with vaccines in place and willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination for themselves were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. At interpersonal level, higher frequency of information exposure through social media and direct interpersonal communication were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination, while knowing some people who experienced serious side effects following COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Despite their important roles in vaccination promotion, Chinese doctors and nurses showed low parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Effective health promotion is needed when COVID-19 vaccination become available.","Wang, Zixin; She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,721
412478,SARS-CoV-2 infection aggravates chronic comorbidities of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in mice,2021,"From a healthcare perspective, infection due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the ensuing syndrome called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents the biggest challenge the world has faced in several decades. Particularly worrisome are the high contagiousness of the virus and the saturation of hospitals' capacity due to overwhelming caseloads. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine and inter-personal distancing are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus in the general population, but more tailored interventions may be needed at an individual level on a case-by-case basis. In this perspective, the most insidious situation is when an individual has contact with a contagious subject without adequate protection. If rapidly recognized afterwards, this occurrence may be promptly addressed through a post-exposure chemoprophylaxis (PEP) with antiviral drugs. This strategy has been implemented for other respiratory viruses (influenza above all) and was successfully used in South Korea among healthcare workers against the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, by providing people who were exposed to high-risk contacts with lopinavir-ritonavir plus ribavirin. Initial experiences with the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 also seem promising. Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis might help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gentile, Ivan; Maraolo, Alberto Enrico; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

413146,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies are stable in convalescent plasma when stored at 4° Celsius for at least 6 weeks,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) has accounted for multiple deaths and economic woes.While the entire medical fraternity and scientists are putting their best feet forward to find a solution to contain this deadly pandemic, there is a growing interest in integrating other known alternative therapies in to standard care. This study is aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of ozone therapy (OT), as an adjuvant to the standard of care (SOC). METHODS: In the current randomized control trial, 60 patients with mild to moderate score NEWS score were included in two parallel groups (n = 30/group). The interventional group (OZ) received ozonized rectal insufflation and minor auto haemotherapy, daily along with SOC, while the control group (ST) received SOC alone. The main outcome measures included changes in clinical features, oxygenation index (SpO2), NEWS score, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR), inflammatory markers, requirement of advanced care, and metabolic profiles. RESULTS: The OZ group has shown clinically significant improvement in the mean values of all the parameters tested compared to ST Group. However, statistical significance were only observed in RT-PCR negative reaction (P = 0.01), changes in clinical symptoms (P < 0.05) and requirement for Intensive care (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported in OZ group, as against 2 deaths reported in ST group. CONCLUSION: OT when integrated with SOC can improve the clinical status and rapidly reduce the viral load compared to SOC alone, which facilitate early recovery and check the need for advanced care and mortality as demonstrated in this study.","Shah, Mili; Captain, Jignasha; Vaidya, Vidyadhar; Kulkarni, Arvind; Valsangkar, Kedar; Nair, Pradeep M K; Ganu, Gayatri",Int Immunopharmacol,,721

RESULTS: In the DNA sequence isolated from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Iran, a coding sequence for the RNA binding domain of N protein was detected. The comparison of Chinese and Iranian DNA sequences displayed that a thymine (T) was mutated to cytosine (C), so ""TTG"" from China was changed to ""CTG"" in Iran. Both DNA sequences from Iran and China have been encoded for leucine. In addition, the second T in ""CTG"" in the DNA or uracil (U) in ""CUG"" in the RNA sequences from Iran can be mutated to another C by a missense mutation resulting from thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) of human and base excision repair mechanism to produce ""CCG"" encoding for proline, which consequently may increase the affinity of the RNA binding domain of N protein to viral RNA and improve the transcription rate, pathogenicity, evasion from human immunity system, spreading in the human body, and risk of human-to-human transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2.","Zolfaghari Emameh, Reza; Eftekhari, Mahyar; Nosrati, Hassan; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Falak, Reza",BMC Res Notes,,721

Our method trains additional prediction heads on top of intermediate layers, and dynamically decides when to stop allocating computational effort to each input using a meta consistency classifier. To calibrate our early prediction stopping rule, we formulate a unique extension of conformal prediction.

(Special Issue: Coronavirus.),2020,"BACKGROUND: In situations of increased need, such as mass casualty incidents (MCIs) and COVID-19, donated blood products are in shortage across the United States. Medical students are a potential pool for blood donors. The aim of this study was to determine overall attitudes of medical students at a single academic institution toward blood donation during times of increased need. METHODS: Three anonymous REDCap surveys were administered to all medical students at a rural academic institution. Surveys 1 and 2 were administered preceding and after an institution-wide MCI drill, in September and November 2019, respectively. Survey 3 was administered following a student-organized COVID-19 blood drive in June 2020. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if factors, ie, experience with MCI drills and emergency medical services (EMS) training, were associated with willingness to donate blood. Furthermore, barriers to donation among those not willing to donate were assessed. RESULTS: Overall response rate for MCI surveys (surveys 1 and 2) was 38% (mean age 25.2 years and 50% women). 91% (n = 210) of respondents were willing to donate blood. Previous participation in MCI drills and EMS training was not associated with higher willingness to donate blood. Response rate for survey 3 was 15.6% (59.4% women), and 30 (31.3%) respondents indicated they did not volunteer to donate blood during the COVID-19 drive. Most common reasons for not donating were ""other,"" medical concerns, and being out-of-town. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of medical students are willing to donate blood during times of increased need and offer a possible solution to increase blood donor pool.","Khatun, Rahima; Otaibi, Banan W; Ssentongo, Anna; Hazelton, Joshua P; Cooper, AmandaB",Am Surg,,721

419729,The treatment and outcome of a pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patient infected with SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak led to the cancellation of sporting events across the world in the spring of 2020 and forced billions of people across the globe to stay home and self-isolate for a number of months. One of the first sports to reposition and adapt their product during the global lockdown in March/April 2020 was professional darts. The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) took an opportunity to promote their version of darts via an elite online home tournament, the PDC Home Tour, in a vast sports market craving live sporting action. This commentary provides an understanding of how professional darts, a sport that has relied on fan interaction within multi-purpose arenas at live events, attempted to move online to a home-based tournament for a temporary period to fill a sporting void. The commentary discusses the reaction to the tournaments held by the PDC and MODUS and issues encountered, before exploring the reasons for the tournaments being held during the primary global lockdown. As a niche sport, it is hoped that this commentary can provide some insight into the contemporary sport of professional darts, a sport rarely discussed in the scholarly field of sport and leisure.","Davis, Leon",Manag.

421887,False-positive results in SARS-CoV-2 antigen test with rhinovirus-A infection,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most significant public health threats in worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 usually have pneumonia concomitant with local inflammation and sometimes a cytokine storm. Specific components of the SARS-CoV-2 virus trigger lung inflammation, and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs exacerbates this process, although much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our study of lung type II pneumocyte cells (A549) demonstrated that ORF7, an open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, induced the production of CCL2, a chemokine that promotes the chemotaxis of monocytes, and decreased the expression of IL-8, a chemokine that recruits neutrophils. A549 cells also had an increased level of IL-6. The results of our chemotaxis transwell assay suggested that ORF7 augmented monocyte infiltration and reduced the number of neutrophils. We conclude that the ORF7 of SARS-CoV-2 may have specific effects on the immunological changes in tissues after infection. These results suggest that the functions of other ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 should also be comprehensively examined.","Wang, Gang; Guan, Jun; Wu, Fengtian; Yang, Qin; Huang, Chunhong; Shao, Junwei; Xu, Lichen; Guo, Zixuan; Zhou, Qihui; Zhu, Haihong; Chen, Zhi",,,721
422178,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Leads to Neurological Dysfunction,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Given the significant overlap of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with other common childhood illnesses presenting to the emergency department, extensive workup of this syndrome has become necessary. Nevertheless, little has been published on the factors differentiating MIS-C from other conditions in the acute care setting. We investigated differences in presentation and laboratory studies between suspected versus confirmed MIS-C patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study on patients 21 years or younger undergoing investigation for possible MIS-C at a single institution between April 21 and July 1, 2020. The primary outcome was diagnosis of MIS-C or an alternative final diagnosis. Clinical features and laboratory findings from initial presentation were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients (median, 4 years; 55.7% male) were included, of whom 17 (16%) of 106 met the criteria for MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients were significantly more likely to report a coronavirus disease 2019 exposure (odds ratio (OR), 13.17 [3.87-44.9]), have gastrointestinal symptoms (OR, 3.81 [1.02-14.19]), and have a significantly higher odds of having abnormal laboratory values including high-sensitivity troponin T (OR, 13 [4.0-42.2]), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (OR, 8.4 [2.3-30.1]), D-dimer (OR, 13 [1.6-103]), and ferritin (OR, 7.8 [2.2-27.2]). There were also differences between groups in inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (median, 134.45 mg/L vs 12.6 mg/L; P < 0.05) and procalcitonin (1.71 ng/mL vs 0.14 ng/mL; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher elevations in key laboratory studies may help to distinguish between MIS-C patients and non-MIS-C patients presenting to the emergency department.","Kelly, Michael S; Fernandes, Neil D; Carr, Audrey V; Lahoud-Rahme, Manuella; Cummings, Brian M; Chiu, Joanne S",Pediatr Emerg Care,,721

Prior health economic analyses estimated incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 40-50 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars (US$2008, equivalent to 48-59 billion US$2019), assuming the achievement of polio eradication by 2012. Given the delays in achieving polio eradication and increased costs, we performed an updated economic analysis of the GPEI using an updated integrated global model, and considering the GPEI trajectory as of the beginning of 2020. Applying similar methods and assuming eradication achievement in 2023, we estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI of 28 billion US$2019, which falls below the prior estimate. Delays in achieving polio eradication combined with the widescale introduction of relatively expensive inactivated poliovirus vaccine significantly increased the costs of the GPEI and make it less cost-effective, although the GPEI continues to yield expected incremental net benefits at the global level when considered over the time horizon of 1988-2029. The overall health and financial benefits of the GPEI will depend on whether and when the GPEI can achieve its goals, when eradication occurs, the valuation method applied, and the path dependence of the actions taken. Reduced expected incremental net benefits of the GPEI and the substantial economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic pose large financial risks for the GPEI.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A",Risk Anal,,721
425380,High-titre anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donation after donors' vaccination,2021,"CLINICAL QUESTION: What is the role of drugs in preventing covid-19? WHY DOES THIS MATTER?: There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19. RECOMMENDATION: The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty). HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION: The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19. UPDATES: This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline. READERS NOTE: This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of rapid transition to TM-based care (video visit followed by in-person visits dedicated to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures when needed) at an academic A/I practice during COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data were compared for patients originally scheduled for in-person visits between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, who completed a video visit instead between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and those who did not. Appointment completion, diagnoses, and drug allergy and skin testing completion were compared for visits between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and 1 year prior (March 10, 2019-June 30, 2019). RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent (265 of 382) of patients originally scheduled between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were able to complete video visits. Patients who completed video visits were more likely to be white (52% vs 33%; P < .001), English-speaking (96% vs 89%; P = .01), and privately insured (70% vs 54%; P = .004). With TM-based care compared with in-person care, there were significant decreases in environmental and food skin testing completion rates (91% and 92% in 2019 vs 60% and 64% in 2020, respectively, P < .001). Drug allergy testing completed after internal referral remained low but comparable (51% in 2019 vs 52% in 2020). Transitioning nonprocedural visits to video allowed allergen immunotherapy and biologic injection visits to resume at a volume similar to pre-COVID. No COVID-19 infections resulted from in-clinic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although transitioning to TM-based care allowed continued A/I care delivery, strategies are needed to achieve higher testing completion rates and ensure video visits do not exacerbate existing health disparities.","Tsao, Lulu R; Villanueva, Stephanie Anne; Pines, David A; Pham, Michele N; Choo, Eugene M; Tang, Monica C; Otani, Iris M",J.

Although diagnostic laboratory testing is utilized ubiquitously by physicians and encountered regularly by individuals receiving medical care, several aspects of test interpretation are incompletely understood by medical communities and the general population, creating a significant challenge in minimizing the damage caused by disease spread through informed decision making and proper testing utilization. Here, general principles of test interpretation are reviewed and applied to specific examples, such as whether asymptomatic individuals should be tested, what it means to test positive (or negative), and how to interpret tests for ""immunity passports"". Unexpectedly, the answers seem to run contrary to many of the popular narratives about testing as a tool for managing COVID-19. Although testing is an important and essential part of managing diseases like COVID-19, improper utilization can potentially have unintended negative consequences.","Stites, Edward C; Wilen, Craig B",,,721

Insights into AKI mechanisms may be provided by analyzing the temporal associations of clinical parameters reflecting disease processes and AKI development. Methods: We performed an observational cohort study of 223 consecutive COVID-19 patients treated at 3 sites of a tertiary care referral center to describe the evolvement of severe AKI (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 3) and identify conditions promoting its development. Descriptive statistics and explanatory multivariable Cox regression modeling with clinical parameters as time-varying covariates were used to identify risk factors of severe AKI. Results: Severe AKI developed in 70 of 223 patients (31%) with COVID-19, of which 95.7% required kidney replacement therapy. Patients with severe AKI were older, predominantly male, had more comorbidities, and displayed excess mortality. Severe AKI occurred exclusively in intensive care unit patients, and 97.3% of the patients developing severe AKI had respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and inflammatory markers (serum procalcitonin levels and leucocyte count) were independent time-varying risk factors of severe AKI. Increasing inflammatory markers displayed a close temporal association with the development of severe AKI. Sensitivity analysis on risk factors of AKI stage 2 and 3 combined confirmed these findings. Conclusion: Severe AKI in COVID-19 was tightly coupled with critical illness and systemic inflammation and was not observed in milder disease courses. These findings suggest that traditional systemic AKI mechanisms rather than kidney-specific processes contribute to severe AKI in COVID-19.","Hardenberg, Jan-Hendrik B; Stockmann, Helena; Aigner, Annette; Gotthardt, Inka; Enghard, Philipp; Hinze, Christian; Balzer, Felix; Schmidt, Danilo; Zickler, Daniel; Kruse, Jan; Körner, Roland; Stegemann, Miriam; Schneider, Thomas; Schumann, Michael; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Angermair, Stefan; Budde, Klemens; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Witzenrath, Martin; Treskatsch, Sascha; Siegmund, Britta; Spies, Claudia; Suttorp, Norbert; Rauch, Geraldine; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Schmidt-Ott, Kai M",,,721

437500,Facing the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the immunotherapy era,2020,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an option for drug development for treating COVID-19. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two groups of mouse neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. MAbs 2H2 and 3C1, representing the two antibody groups, respectively, bind distinct epitopes and are compatible in formulating a noncompeting antibody cocktail. A humanized version of the 2H2/3C1 cocktail is found to potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 12 ng/mL and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2-infected mice even when administered at as late as 24 h post-infection. We determine an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of 2H2 or 3C1 Fab in complex with the S trimer up to 3.8 Å resolution, revealing the conformational space of the antigen-antibody complexes and MAb-triggered stepwise allosteric rearrangements of the S trimer, delineating a previously uncharacterized dynamic process of coordinated binding of neutralizing antibodies to the trimeric S protein.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of pandemic-associated stress on food parenting practices including interactions surrounding snacks, and child diet. METHODS: Parents (N = 318) of 2-12-year old children completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing current COVID-19-specific stress, pre-COVID-19 stress, financial stress (e.g. food insecurity), food parenting practices, and child snack intake frequency. Structural Equation Modeling was used to model simultaneous paths of relationships and test direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Stress, including financial hardship, was higher compared with before the crisis. The majority of children had regular mealtimes and irregular snack times. Higher COVID-19-specific stress was associated with more non-nutritive use of food and snacks (e.g. emotional and instrumental feeding), but also more structure and positive interactions (e.g. eating with or engaging with child around mealtimes). Higher COVID-19-specific stress was also associated with greater child intake frequency of sweet and savory snacks, with some evidence for mediation by snack parenting practices. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be linked to child snack intake with potential impacts on child obesity risk, and suggest several modifiable points of intervention within the family context.","Jansen, E; Thapaliya, G; Aghababian, A; Sadler, J; Smith, K; Carnell, S",Appetite,,721

This report presents capacity scenarios for Australian public transit to control the spread of COVID-19 during the transition phase (Stage 2) in which restrictions on travel are progressively eased. Sample floor plans for one vehicle per mode (bus, tram, train) illustrate capacity reductions that could be utilized during strict social distancing, moderate distancing, or relaxed distancing. Percentage of seating, percentage of capacity, and total number of passengers are provided for each vehicle. Two bus routes, one in Sydney and one in Newcastle, are used as case studies for bus transportation capacity reduction. It is suggested that for a normally busy route like Sydney's M52 bus route, in order to maintain moderate distancing, service levels may need to be adjusted to meet travel demand. For Newcastle bus route 11, the existing supply of buses is probably sufficient but certain busier stops may require demand management such as encouraging active transport. The report concludes with issues for transit operating agencies to consider during the Stage 2 (transition) phase including: worker safety, contactless ticketing, enforcing vehicle capacity, travel demand management, real time traveler information, and supporting complementary modes.","Short, Eleanor Gouge Taylor Mills Gareth W.

Several factors, including higher stress due to social isolation, diminished melatonin levels with age, and higher exposure of individuals to light at the evening, which reduces melatonin levels and disrupts circadian rhythmicity are relevant for maintaining the circadian health in aged individuals. Properly administered, chronotherapy restores the optimal circadian pattern of the sleep-wake cycle in the elderly. It involves adequate sleep hygiene, timed light exposure, and the use of a chronobiotic medication like melatonin, which affects the output phase of circadian rhythms thus controlling the biological clock. Besides, the therapeutic potential of melatonin as an agent to counteract the consequences of COVID-19 infections has been advocated due to its wide-ranging effects as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and as an immunomodulatory agent, as well as to a possible antiviral action.

To achieve this, an instructional theory and intelligent techniques are combined, namely the Component Display Theory along with content-based filtering and multiple-criteria decision analysis, with the intention of providing personalized learning material and thus, improving student interaction. Until now, the majority of the research efforts mainly focus on adapting the presentation of learning material based on students' characteristics. As such, there is free space for researching issues like delivering the appropriate type of learning material, in order to maintain the pedagogical affordance of the educational software. The blending of instructional design theories and sophisticated techniques can offer a more personalized and adaptive learning experience to learners of computer programming. The paper presents a fully operating intelligent educational software. It merges pedagogical and technological approaches for sophisticated learning material delivery to students. Moreover, it was used by undergraduate university students to learn Java programming for a semester during the COVID-19 lockdown.

In a subset of 93 patients, frozen plasma samples collected during a previous study between September 2009 and February 2016 were analyzed for the presence of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Exposures: Diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequencies of admission thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 ×103/µL), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (as diagnosed by the treating physician), and platelet factor 4/heparin IgG antibodies (optical density >0.4, in a subset of patients with previously collected plasma samples). Results: Of 865 patients (median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 29-53 years], 70% women), 73 (8.4%; 95% CI, 6.8%-10.5%) had thrombocytopenia, which was mild (100-149 ×103/µL) in 52 (6.0%), moderate (50-99 ×103/µL) in 17 (2.0%), and severe (<50 ×103/µL) in 4 (0.5%). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies was diagnosed in a single patient (0.1%; 95% CI, <0.1%-0.7%). Of the convenience sample of 93 patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis included in the laboratory analysis, 8 (9%) had thrombocytopenia, and none (95% CI, 0%-4%) had platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, baseline thrombocytopenia was uncommon, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies were rare. These findings may inform investigations of the possible association between the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia.","Sánchez van Kammen, Mayte; Heldner, Mirjam R; Brodard, Justine; Scutelnic, Adrian; Silvis, Suzanne; Schroeder, Verena; Kremer Hovinga, Johanna A; Middeldorp, Saskia; Levi, Marcel; Hiltunen, Sini; Lindgren, Erik; Mansour, Maryam; Arauz, Antonio; Barboza, Miguel A; Zuurbier, Susanna M; Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; Ferro, Jose M; Fischer, Urs; Field, Thalia S; Jood, Katarina; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Putaala, Jukka; Arnold, Marcel; Coutinho, Jonathan M",JAMA,,721

446534,Stroke in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Pictorial Overview of the Pathoetiology,2021,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) are urgently needed. The effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines on viral replication in both upper and lower airways is important to evaluate in nonhuman primates. METHODS: Nonhuman primates received 10 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, a vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, or no vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens. RESULTS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-µg dose group and 3481 in the 100-µg dose group. Vaccination induced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)-biased CD4 T-cell responses and low or undetectable Th2 or CD8 T-cell responses. Viral replication was not detectable in BAL fluid by day 2 after challenge in seven of eight animals in both vaccinated groups. No viral replication was detectable in the nose of any of the eight animals in the 100-µg dose group by day 2 after challenge, and limited inflammation or detectable viral genome or antigen was noted in lungs of animals in either vaccine group. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of nonhuman primates with mRNA-1273 induced robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, rapid protection in the upper and lower airways, and no pathologic changes in the lung.

However, data on CNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 are still evolving. We performed a literature review of CNS inflammatory disorders associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords; ""SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication"" looking for reports of transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, myelitis, Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Disorder (MOGAD), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalitis/Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHNE/AHLE), Cytotoxic lesion of the Corpus Callosum/Mild Encephalopathy Reversible Splenium Lesion(CLOCC/MERS) and Optic neuritis published between December 01, 2019 and March 15, 2021. RESULTS: Our literature search revealed 43 patients meeting the diagnosis of myelitis, including Transverse Myelitis, ADEM, AHNE/AHLE or CLOCC/MERS and Optic neuritis. Acute myelitis was most commonly associated with non-severe COVID-19 and all reported cases of AHNE/AHLE had severe COVID-19 infection. Based on IDSA/ATS criteria of either requiring vasopressor for septic shock or mechanical ventilation, 49% (n = 18) patients were considered to have a severe COVID infection. There were 7 (n = 19%) fatalities. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes the clinical features, neuroimaging, CSF findings and outcomes in COVID-19-associated CNS inflammatory disorders. Our observational review study reveals that although rare, myelitis, ADEM, AHNE and CLOCC can be associated with COVID-19 infection. Further studies using MRI imaging and CSF analysis in early diagnosis and intervention of these disorders are warranted.","Sriwastava, Shitiz; Tandon, Medha; Podury, Sanjiti; Prasad, Apoorv; Wen, Sijin; Guthrie, Garret; Kakara, Mihir; Jaiswal, Shruti; Subedi, Roshan; Elkhooly, Mahmoud; Lisak, Robert P",J. neurol,,721

Judicious resource allocation is paramount but difficult due to the unpredictable disease course. Once hospitalized, discerning which patients may progress to critical disease would be valuable for resource planning. Medical records were reviewed for consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a large healthcare system in Texas. The main outcome was progression to critical disease within 10 days from admission. Albumin trends from admission to 7 days were analyzed using mixed-effects models, and progression to critical disease was modeled by multivariable logistic regression of laboratory results. Risk models were evaluated in an independent group. Of 153 non-critical patients, 28 (18%) progressed to critical disease. The rate of decrease in mean baseline-corrected (&#916;) albumin was -0.08 g/dL/day (95% CI -0.11 to -0.04; p<0.001) or four times faster, in those who progressed compared with those who did not progress. A model of &#916; albumin combined with lymphocyte percentage predicting progression to critical disease was validated in 60 separate patients (sensitivity, 0.70; specificity, 0.74). ALLY (delta albumin and lymphocyte percentage) is a simple tool to identify patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of disease progression when: (1) a 0.9 g/dL or greater albumin drop from baseline within 5 days of admission or (2) baseline lymphocyte of &#8804;10% is observed. The ALLY tool identified >70% of hospitalized cases that progressed to critical COVID-19 disease. We recommend prospectively tracking albumin. This is a globally applicable tool for all healthcare systems.","van Zyl, Johanna S; Alam, Amit; Felius, Joost; Youssef, Ronnie M; Bhakta, Dipesh; Jack, Christina; Jamil, Aayla K; Hall, Shelley A; Klintmalm, Göran B; Spak, Cedric W; Gottlieb, Robert L",,,721

It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human. Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness. We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation. The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages. Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes. We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration. The patient was cured and discharged.

Initially, it's soluble form (sDPP-4) was described as an adipokine mediating metabolic inflammation. This is recently questioned in mechanistic rodent studies. To further clarify sDPP-4's role in physiology and metabolic diseases, we examined sDPP-4 in a large human cohort and during weight-loss interventions. Like ACE2, sDPP-4 serves as a binding partner for certain corona-like viruses enabling virus entry. As metabolic diseases are major risk factors for the COVID-19 pandemic, we additionally examined sDPP-4 in patients suffering severe Sars-CoV-2 infection. Methods sDPP-4 serum concentrations were measured using ELISA and related to various metabolic variables. Using a case-control-design, sDPP-4 was assessed in acute COVID-19 and sepsis infection. Results sDPP-4 increased with body weight, insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia but reduced in type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension. Altered serum concentrations appeared with impaired liver and kidney but not cardiac function. No association to systemic inflammation was observed. Having found increased sDPP-4 in obesity, surgical (gastric bypass/sleeve gastrectomy) and non-surgical weight-loss interventions revealed a significant association of sDPP-4 with the improvement of liver function but neither with changes in body weight nor fat mass. Complementary, the case control study revealed reduced sDPP-4 concentrations specific for COVID-19 infection. Conclusions We suggest that sDPP-4 is rather related to hepatic abnormalities in obesity than primarily functioning as an adipokine. sDPP-4 is implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism, but not fundamentally in systemic inflammation. Additional to ACE-2, sDPP-4 might also have a regulatory role in COVID-19 infection.","Autoren Rohmann, N.; Schlicht, K.; Geisler, C.; Hollstein, T.; Knappe, C.; Krause, L.; Hagen, S.; Beckmann, A.; Seoudy, A.

How sport organisations can be resilient in adversity is comparatively neglected, so the purpose is to provide firm foundations for conceptualising organisational resilience in sport management. Research question: “How can organisational resilience best be theorised for sport management research and practice?” Design/Methodology/Approach: From a critique of the resilience literature, a new Framework for Organisational Resilience Management (FfORM) is developed, based on the theory of organisational resource conversion and the separation of normative and descriptive levels. The FfORM is applied to sport management contexts, including the resilience of National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) to reductions in UK Sport funding. Results and Findings: Organisational resilience is conceptualised as a means to an end, to achieve externally generated goals, emphasising its dynamic, temporal nature. The FfORM illuminates the challenges for NGBs in developing organisational resilience because of trade-offs in the actions they take. Practical implications: As well as being an evaluation tool, the FfORM will be of utility to sport organisations addressing the unprecedented challenges arising from COVID-19.

In this paper, we determine the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across 35 states using direct age standardization. We then explore the relationship between structural racism and differences in the magnitude of this disparity across states. METHODS: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated both crude and age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level structural racism index and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across states. We explored the potential mediating effects of disparities in exposure based on occupation, underlying medical conditions, and health care access. RESULTS: Relying upon crude death rate ratios resulted in a substantial underestimation of the true magnitude of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates. The structural racism index was a robust predictor of the observed racial disparities. Each standard deviation increase in the racism index was associated with an increase of 0.26 in the ratio of COVID-19 mortality rates among the Black compared to the White population. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism should be considered a root cause of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality. Dismantling the long-standing systems of racial oppression is critical to adequately address both the downstream and upstream causes of racial inequities in the disease burden of COVID-19.","Siegel, Michael; Critchfield-Jain, Isabella; Boykin, Matthew; Owens, Alicia",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,721

Therefore, the number of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase. A working group has been formed to provide telephone consultation services for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 in Japan. During the first 13 days of the service, there were 12 consultations. For each consultation, we advised the patient on the initiation of ECMO and arranged transportation for patients with ECMO.

453428,Special features of SARS-CoV-2 in daily practice,2020,"Prompt and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been important during public health responses for containing the spread of COVID-19, including in hospital settings (1-3). In vitro diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be expensive, have relatively long turnaround times, and require experienced laboratory personnel.* Antigen detection tests can be rapidly and more easily performed and are less expensive. The performance of antigen detection tests, compared with that of NAATs, is an area of interest for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Quidel Sofia 2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) (Quidel Corporation) received Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptom onset (4). The reported test positive percentage agreement§ between this test and an RT-PCR test result is 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83.3%-99.4%), and the negative percentage agreement is 100.0% (95% CI = 97.9%-100.0%) in symptomatic patients.¶ However, performance in asymptomatic persons in a university setting has shown lower sensitivity (5); assessment of performance in a clinical setting is ongoing. Data collected during June 30-August 31, 2020, were analyzed to compare antigen test performance with that of RT-PCR in a hospital setting. Among 1,732 paired samples from asymptomatic patients, the antigen test sensitivity was 60.5%, and specificity was 99.5% when compared with RT-PCR. Among 307 symptomatic persons, sensitivity and specificity were 72.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Health care providers must remain aware of the lower sensitivity of this test among asymptomatic and symptomatic persons and consider confirmatory NAAT testing in high-prevalence settings because a false-negative result might lead to failures in infection control and prevention practices and cause delays in diagnosis, isolation, and treatment.","Brihn, Auguste; Chang, Jamie; OYong, Kelsey; Balter, Sharon; Terashita, Dawn; Rubin, Zach; Yeganeh, Nava",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,721

Understanding the effect of BTKis on humoral immunity is timely because BTKis are widely used and vaccination against COVID-19 is urgently needed. In two open-label, single-arm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKis on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary endpoint was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-HBs &#8805;10 mIU/mL) and RZV (&#8805;4-fold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8% [95% CI, 0.7%-18.9%]) than TN patients (28.1% [95% CI, 15.6%-45.4%], P=.017).

456413,Potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection on reproductive health,2020,"Accurate and reliable non-invasive monitoring of early systemic disease—such as ongoing hemorrhage, sepsis, and acute respiratory disease like COVID-19—is one of the largest unmet needs in biomedicine. An early alert to progression with high sensitivity and an acceptable false-positive rate would allow medical staff to risk-stratify patients, saving resources, lives, and in the context of pandemic disease, minimize staff exposure. Noninvasive technologies have thus far failed to produce a reliable early detection system, reflecting the limitation of uniplex approaches to describe complex pathophysiology. Our team, in collaboration with an STTR start-up, have developed an optico-impedance system combining near-infrared spectroscopy and electrical impedance tomography measured at three locations (thorax, abdomen, limb) together with machine learning methods to provide exceptional diagnostic performance in systemic disease. The optical portion consists of 6 pairs of time-multiplexed red and IR LEDs embedded in custom 3D-printed probes, which are each connected to the leg of a trifurcated fiber bundle, allowing measurement of three-location, two-distance broadband 550-950 nm spectra using a single commercial spectrometer. Data is demultiplexed and analyzed using derivative spectroscopy to quantify oxy/deoxyhemoglobin. Additional diagnostic signal was obtained from: impedance tomography and spectroscopy, ECG and plethysmography. In one of the largest porcine hemorrhage studies to date (n = 60), we demonstrate an 85% accuracy to detect a 2-3% blood volume loss. Preliminary results from 11 healthy human subjects undergoing lower body negative pressure (LBNP) challenge show a 95% accuracy in detecting 15-mmHg changes in pressure—an excellent surrogate for occult hemorrhage. Our system fills a critical need, including in the current pandemic, where clinicians struggle to predict which patients will deteriorate. © 2021 SPIE","Elliott, J. T.; Sottosanti, J. S.; Murphy, E.

456559,The roles of signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection; lessons learned from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,2021,"The search for effective treatment against novel coronavirus (COVID-19) remains a global challenge due to controversies on available vaccines. In this study, data of SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors; a key drug target in the coronavirus genome was retrieved from CHEMBL database. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies, Molecular docking, Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion-Toxicity (ADMET) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were carried out using these 3CLpro inhibitors. QSAR model constructed using the data had correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.907; cross-validated correlation coefficient Q2 value of 0.866 and test set predicted correlation coefficient R2pred value of 0.517. Variance inflation factor (VIF) values for descriptors contained in the model ranged from 1.352 to 1.68, hence, these descriptors were orthogonal to one another. Therefore, the model was statistically significant and can be used to screen and design new molecules for their inhibitory activity against 3CLpro. Molecular docking showed that seven of the compounds (inhibitors) used in the study had a remarkable binding affinity (-9.2 to -10.3 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro. ADMET study revealed that five (CHEMBL Accession IDs 19438, 196635, 377150, 208763, and 210097) of the seven compounds with good binding ability obeyed Lipinski's rule of five. Hence, they were compounds with drug-like properties. MDS analysis revealed that 3CLpro-compound 21, 3CLpro-compound 22, 3CLpro-compound 40 complexes are very stable as compared to the reference 3CLpro-X77 complex. Therefore, this study identified three potent inhibitors of 3CLpro viz. CHEMBL194398, CHEMBL196635, and CHEMBL210097 that can be further explored for the treatment of COVID-19.","Ishola, Ahmed Adebayo; Adedirin, Oluwaseye; Joshi, Tanuja; Chandra, Subhash",Comput Biol Med,,721
456782,[Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Update of Information and proposed care. CNGOF.],2020,"PURPOSE: Three hundred seventy million years ago, bone marrow appeared in skeleton of a fish. More than one hundred years ago, the concept of bone marrow transplantation was proposed to treat human diseases. During the last five decades, this concept became a reality first in hematology and later for orthopaedic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: These advances were possible due to the comprehension of the three major components of bone marrow: the fat part, the haematologic part, and the stroma part. Each part has a different history, but the three parts are linked in physiology as in history. RESULTS: During many centuries, bone marrow was considered just as food; however, one hundred years ago, the concept of bone marrow transplantation to treat humans was proposed by the French physician Brown-Séquard. During the last five decades, this concept became a reality first in haematology and later for orthopaedic diseases. Transferring what was known from experimental animal models to humans was met with many challenges, the atomic bomb research, and many deaths. Yet through the recognition and subsequent understanding of fundamental processes, medical resiliency, and the determination of a few pioneers, local bone marrow transplantation in orthopaedic surgery became a therapeutic option first for a limited number of diseases and patients. Over the last two decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been the focus of intense research by acadaemia and industry due to their unique features. MSCs can be easily isolated and expanded through in vitro culture by taking full advantage of their self-renewing capacity. In addition, MSCs exert immunomodulatory effects and can be differentiated into various lineages, which makes them highly attractive for clinical applications in cell-based therapies. CONCLUSION: In this review, we attempted to provide a historical overview of bone marrow history, MSC discovery, characterization, and the first clinical studies conducted.","Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,,721

The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown, and how some non-cardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective follow-up design was adopted. A total of 1,160 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients' medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the associations between comorbidities (cardiometabolic or non-cardiometabolic diseases), clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19. Results: Overall, 158 (13.6%) patients were diagnosed with severe illness and 32 (2.7%) had unfavorable outcomes. Hypertension (2.87, 1.30-6.32), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (3.57, 2.32-5.49), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3.78, 1.81-7.89), fatty liver disease (7.53, 1.96-28.96), hyperlipidemia (2.15, 1.26-3.67), other lung diseases (6.00, 3.01-11.96), and electrolyte imbalance (10.40, 3.00-26.10) were independently linked to increased odds of being severely ill. T2DM (6.07, 2.89-12.75), CVD (8.47, 6.03-11.89), and electrolyte imbalance (19.44, 11.47-32.96) were also strong predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease on admission (5.46, 3.25-9.19), while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes (6.58, 1.46-29.64) within two weeks. Conclusion: Besides hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, other lung diseases, and electrolyte imbalance were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity and poor treatment outcome.

In this work, the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) prepared with four different techniques were investigated for the utilization as a disinfectant for cellulose-based wipes. These four methods are namely; 1) trisodium citrate with cotton yarn as a reducing agent, 2) preparing AgNP's using aqueous solution of PVA in the presence of glucose, 3) trisodium citrate with cotton fabric as a reducing agent, and 4) photochemical reaction of polyacrylic acid and silver nitrate solution. Polyester/viscose blended spunlace nonwoven fabrics as cellulose based fabrics were treated with the prepared silver nanoparticles to be used as surfaces disinfection wipes. The properties of the nonwoven fabrics were examined including thickness, tensile strength in dry and wet conditions in both machine direction (MD) and cross-machine direction (CMD), bursting strength, air permeability, water permeability and surface wettability. Characterization of the AgNPs was carried out in terms of UV-VIS spectroscopy, TEM, SEM, and Zeta potential analysis. The assessment of AgNPs active solutions for antimicrobial and antiviral activities was evaluated.

In this paper, I explore the role of uncertainty and learning on the optimal dynamic lockdown policy. I limit the analysis to suppression strategies where the SIR dynamics can be approximated by an exponential infection decay. In the absence of uncertainty, the optimal confinement policy is to impose a constant rate of lockdown until the suppression of the virus in the population.

(3) Results: We found significant negative effects of COVID-19 home confinement on depressive feelings (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +54%), loneliness (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +37.3%), life satisfaction (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = -19.8%) and mental wellbeing (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = -10.6%) which were accompanied with a significantly increased need for psychosocial support (p < 0.001, %&#8710; = +17.3%). However, the magnitude of psychosocial impact did not significantly differ between residents undergoing a more intense (Italy) versus a less intense (Netherlands) lockdown, although the decrease in social participation was found to be significantly different for both countries (z = -7.714, p < 0.001). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the increase in loneliness was associated with the adoption of new digital communication tools (r = 0.21, p < 0.001), and significantly higher for individuals who started to adopt at least one new digital communication tool during confinement than for those who did not (z = -4.252, p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: This study highlights that, although COVID-19 home confinement significantly impacted psychosocial wellbeing during the first wave of the pandemic, this impact did not differ based on lockdown intensity. Recognizing the increasing adoption of digital communication technology in an attempt to reduce lockdown loneliness, future studies should investigate what is needed from the technology to achieve this effect.","Bastoni, Sofia; Wrede, Christian; Ammar, Achraf; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Sanderman, Robbert; Gaggioli, Andrea; Trabelsi, Khaled; Masmoudi, Liwa; Boukhris, Omar; Glenn, Jordan M; Bouaziz, Bassem; Chtourou, Hamdi; van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,721

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV and was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Recently, on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a virus pandemic disease. Furthermore, it has been known that the malignancy and anticancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or surgery cause systemic immunosuppressive state in patients with cancer which exposes them to infection more than others especially for COVID-19 and with a high probability of complications. Additionally, the major concern for patients with cancer is the incapacity to get fundamental medical services due to the pandemic spread. In Morocco, thanks to measures such as contamination prevention, prioritization of care, and price control of therapies, cancer patients were able to continue their treatment during the covid-19 pandemic.","Addi, Rachid Ait; Benksim, Abdelhafid; Cherkaoui, Mohamed",Signa Vitae,,721
469119,Why not consider an endothelin receptor antagonist against SARS-CoV-2?,2020,"In quiescent cells, primary cilia function as a mechanosensor that converts mechanic signals into chemical activities. This unique organelle plays a critical role in restricting mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is essential for quiescent cells to maintain their quiescence. Multiple mechanisms have been identified that mediate the inhibitory effect of primary cilia on mTORC1 signaling. These mechanisms depend on several tumor suppressor proteins localized within the ciliary compartment, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), polycystin-1, and polycystin-2. Conversely, changes in mTORC1 activity are able to affect ciliogenesis and stability indirectly through autophagy. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the reciprocal regulation of mTORC1 and primary cilia.","Lai, Yandong; Jiang, Yu",,,721

This has a significant effect on the health of the mother and offspring. There is no doubt that screening for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks is important to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there is no consensus about diagnosis and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy. In this narrative review on the current evidence on screening for GDM in early pregnancy, we included 37 cohort studies and eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies have shown that a high proportion (15-70%) of women with GDM can be detected early in pregnancy depending on the setting, criteria used and screening strategy. Data from observational studies on the potential benefit of screening and treatment of GDM in early pregnancy show conflicting results. In addition, there is substantial heterogeneity in age and BMI across the different study populations. Smaller RCTs could not show benefit but several large RCTs are ongoing. RCTs are also necessary to determine the appropriate cut-off for HbA1c in pregnancy as there is limited evidence showing that an HbA1c &#8805;6.5% has a low sensitivity to detect overt diabetes in early pregnancy.","Raets, Lore; Beunen, Kaat; Benhalima, Katrien",,,721

Serology can provide valuable information regarding a patient's exposure to virus, and may have a larger role to play as vaccines becomes available. Limited data is available on the serological response in pediatric patients. Here we investigate the use of one manufacturer's commercial assays for detecting IgM and IgG in an exclusively pediatric population. Methods: Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays were performed on an Abbott Architect i1000. For specificity studies, we tested 78 patient specimens collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 66 specimens from patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For sensitivity we tested 181 specimens from 41 patients with a positive NAAT result. Precision data was acquired for 20 days. Results: For IgM, the highest qualitative positive agreement with molecular results was observed to be 15 to 30 days after a positive NAAT result or after symptom onset. For IgG, the highest positive agreement was 31-60 days after a positive NAAT result or 61-90 days after the start of symptoms. IgM started to decline 30 days after NAAT results and faded by 90 days. IgG started to decrease 60 days after a positive NAAT result. Conclusion: The Abbott IgM and IgG assays have negative agreements of 98.7-100% relative to NAAT results. The IgM and IgG levels assayed by these methods start to decline months after positive molecular results and onset of symptoms in a pediatric population.","Interiano, Cristina; Muze, Sheicho; Turner, Brian; Gonzalez, Mark; Rogers, Beverly; Jerris, Robert; Weinzierl, Elizabeth; Elkhalifa, Mohamed; Leung-Pineda, Van",Pract Lab Med,,721

471310,Self-collection: An appropriate alternative during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing process.","Heeney, Catherine; Malden, Stephen; Sheikh, Aziz",BMJ Open,,721

472627,Intensive Medicine and Nursing Home Care in Times of SARS CoV-2: A Norwegian Perspective,2020,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that result from uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Pathogenic Th17 cells, characterised by production of IL-17A in the absence of IL-10, are thought to contribute to this inflammation, but in humans, antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17A is an ineffective IBD therapy whereas IL-23 blockade is effective. Here, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of RORC2, the Th17 cell lineage-defining transcription factor, on in vivo-differentiated human Th17 cells and Th17-like regulatory T cells (Th17-Tregs). BMS-336, a small molecule RORC2 inverse agonist, inhibited expression of RORC2-regulated genes in peripheral Th17 cells (CD4+ CD25- CD127+ CXCR3- CCR4+ CCR6+ ) in a dose-dependent manner, with similar inhibitory effects on laminar propria mononuclear cells from IBD and non-IBD subjects. Exposure of peripheral Th17-Tregs (CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo CXCR3- CCR4+ CCR6+ ) to BMS-336 also inhibited IL-17A production and prevented inflammatory cytokine-induced destabilisation, as evidenced by preserved FOXP3 expression and epigenetic status of the Treg-specific demethylation region. In parallel, RORC2 inhibition increased the production of IL-10 in Th17-Tregs, resulting in enhanced suppression of inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells. Thus, via its ability to simultaneously inhibit Th17 cells and enhance the stability and function of Th17-Tregs, pharmacological inhibition of RORC2 is a promising approach to suppress inflammation and promote immune regulation in IBD.

472806,[SARS-CoV-2 infection: Available data on 15th April 2021]./ Infection à SARS-CoV-2 : connaissances au 15 avril 2021,2021,"BACKGROUND: Identifying predictors of success in postgraduate examinations can help guide the career choices of medical students and may aid early identification of trainees requiring extra support to progress in specialty training. We assessed whether performance on the educational performance measurement (EPM) and situational judgement test (SJT) used for selection into foundation training predicted success at the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) examination. METHODS: This was a longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk). UK medical graduates who had attempted Part A (n=2585) and Part B (n=755) of the MRCS between 2014 and 2017 were included. &#967;2 and independent t-tests were used to examine the relationship between medical school performance and sociodemographic factors with first-attempt success at MRCS Part A and B. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify independent predictors of MRCS performance. RESULTS: The odds of passing MRCS increased by 55% for Part A (OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.48 to 1.61)) and 23% for Part B (1.23 (1.14 to 1.32)) for every additional EPM decile point gained. For every point awarded for additional degrees in the EPM, candidates were 20% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.20 (1.13 to 1.29)) and 17% more likely to pass Part B (1.17 (1.04 to 1.33)). For every point awarded for publications in the EPM, candidates were 14% more likely to pass MRCS Part A (1.14 (1.01 to 1.28)). SJT score was not a statistically significant independent predictor of MRCS success. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the EPM's independent predictive power and found that medical school performance deciles are the most significant measure of predicting later success in the MRCS. These findings can be used by medical schools, training boards and workforce planners to inform evidence-based and contemporary selection and assessment strategies.","Ellis, Ricky; Scrimgeour, Duncan S G; Brennan, Peter A; Lee, Amanda J; Cleland, Jennifer",BMJ Open,,721

Decisions taken in such a complex process can change the course and the effects of a pandemic. Despite the critical role of knowledge management in pandemics, that inform and enable decision-makers, the literature on this specific issue is poor, fragmented, mainly addressed by “health” journals and marginally addressed by the “knowledge management” scholars.

The complex and heterogeneous nature of native human skin however creates difficulties for the construction of physiologically comparable organotypic models. Within the present study, we utilized bioprinting technology for the controlled deposition of separate keratinocyte subpopulations to create a reconstructed epidermis with two distinct halves in a single insert, each comprised of a different keratinocyte sub-population, in order to better model heterogonous skin and reduce inter-sample variability. As an initial proof-of-concept, we created a patterned epidermal skin model using GPF positive and negative keratinocyte subpopulations, both printed into 2 halves of a reconstructed skin insert, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We then demonstrated the physiological relevance of this bioprinting technique by generating a heterogeneous model comprised of dual keratinocyte population with either normal or low filaggrin expression. The resultant model exhibited a well-organized epidermal structure with each half possessing the phenotypic characteristics of its constituent cells, indicative of a successful and stable tissue reconstruction. This patterned skin model aims to mimic the edge of lesions as seen in atopic dermatitis or ichthyosis vulgaris, while the use of two populations within a single insert allows for paired statistics in evaluation studies, likely increasing study statistical power and reducing the number of models required per study. This is the first report of human patterned epidermal model using a predefined bioprinted designs, and demonstrates the relevance of bioprinting to faithfully reproduce human skin microanatomy.","Madiedo-Podvrsan, Sabrina; Belaïdi, Jean-Philippe; Desbouis, Stephanie; Simonetti, Lucie; Ben-Khalifa, Youcef; Soeur, Jérémie; Rielland, Maïté",Sci Rep,,721

SARS-CoV-2 mainly involves the respiratory system, however, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), neurological and special senses clinical manifestations have been reported rarely. The present study aims to investigate the MRI findings, clinical manifestations of neurological and special senses involvement in SARS-CoV-2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 284 articles from the databases ""Pub-Med, Web of Science-Clarivate Analytics, Embase and Google Scholar"" were identified. The keywords, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, MRI, brain, special senses, neurological involvement were entered into the search engines and the concerned documents were selected and reviewed. The descriptive information was recorded from the particular studies; finally, we included 48 publications. RESULTS: The common neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, tremors, meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhage, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and intracerebral hematoma, hemiparesis and seizures. However, common special senses manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were olfactory, auditory and gustatory disorders including red eyes, painless monocular visual disturbance, anosmia, ageusia, dysgeusia, dysosmia and hypoacusis. Moreover, the MRI findings identified in SARS-CoV-2 patients were isolated oval-shaped lesion in the corpus callosum, bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhage, ischemic lesions involving the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, cerebellum and vasogenic edema extending to the cerebral peduncles, pons and ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: The neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 patients are highly variable. The SARS-COV-2 exerts its damaging effects on the nervous system and special senses by developing determinant numerous neurological and special senses' clinical manifestations. Physicians with the help of MRI must rule out the neurological and special senses manifestations among SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Al-Hussain, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,721

This review aims to critically evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the quantity and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in feces and urine, and whether these pose an infection risk in sanitary settings, sewage networks, wastewater treatment plants, and the wider environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and marine waters). A review of 48 independent studies revealed that severe GI dysfunction is only evident in a small number of COVID-19 cases, with 11 ± 2% exhibiting diarrhea and 12 ± 3% exhibiting vomiting and nausea. In addition to these cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces from some asymptomatic, mildly- and pre-symptomatic individuals. Fecal shedding of the virus peaks in the symptomatic period and can persist for several weeks, but with declining abundances in the post-symptomatic phase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is occasionally detected in urine, but reports in fecal samples are more frequent. The abundance of the virus genetic material in both urine (ca. 102-105 gc/ml) and feces (ca. 102-107 gc/ml) is much lower than in nasopharyngeal fluids (ca. 105-1011 gc/ml). There is strong evidence of multiplication of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut and infectious virus has occasionally been recovered from both urine and stool samples. The level and infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2 in vomit remain unknown. In comparison to enteric viruses transmitted via the fecal-oral route (e.g. norovirus, adenovirus), the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted via feces or urine appears much lower due to the lower relative amounts of virus present in feces/urine. The biggest risk of transmission will occur in clinical and care home settings where secondary handling of people and urine/fecal matter occurs. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA genetic material can be detected by in wastewater, this signal is greatly reduced by conventional treatment. Our analysis also suggests the likelihood of infection due to contact with sewage-contaminated water (e.g. swimming, surfing, angling) or food (e.g. salads, shellfish) is extremely low or negligible based on very low predicted abundances and limited environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2. These conclusions are corroborated by the fact that tens of million cases of COVID-19 have occurred globally, but exposure to feces or wastewater has never been implicated as a transmission vector.","Jones, David L; Baluja, Marcos Quintela; Graham, David W; Corbishley, Alexander; McDonald, James E; Malham, Shelagh K; Hillary, Luke S; Connor, Thomas R; Gaze, William H; Moura, Ines B; Wilcox, Mark H; Farkas, Kata",Sci Total Environ,,721

METHODS: A descriptive report of the first 100 patients with suspected COVID-19 who have visited the SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2) (COVID-19) screening clinic at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Tobruk, Libya. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms were fever (90%), cough (89%), dyspnoea (85%), sore throat (79%), fatigue (78%), headache (64%), loss of smell (52%), loss of taste (53%), loss of appetite (43), nausea and vomiting (26%), diarrhoea (22%), and rhinorrhea (16%). 51% of the patients had lymphocytopenia while 13% had thrombocytopenia. Bilateral infiltrates was the most common radiologic finding on chest X-ray (76%), and COVID-19 IgM and /or IgG antibodies were detected in 80% of the patients, while only 37% of the patients were tested positive by the RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The disease continued its spread across the region. Fever, cough and dyspnoea were the main symptoms. 21% of the patients did not have any CXR abnormalities. Initial negative results for either antibody testing or RT-PCR-testing for COVID-19 do not rule out the infection.","Ismail, Faisal; Farag, Atiya; Haq, Soghra; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,721

Evidence from these countries indicates that their ethnic minorities could be as disproportionately disadvantaged in COVID-19 vaccines roll-out as they were affected by COVID-19-related serious illnesses. Their disadvantage is linked to their lower social status and fewer social goods compared with dominant population groups.Albeit limited by methodology, early studies attribute lower uptake of COVID-19 amongst ethnic minorities to the wider determinants of vaccine uptake, hesitancy or lack of vaccine confidence, including lower levels of trust and greater concerns about vaccine safety. Early sentinel studies are needed in all early adopter countries.One emerging theme among those of reproductive age in minority communities concerns a worry regarding COVID-19 vaccine's potential adverse effect on fertility. Respected professional groups reassure this is not a credible rationale. Drug and vaccine regulators use understandable, cautious and conditional language in emergency licencing of new gene-based vaccines. Technical assessments on whether there is any potential genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity should be more emphatic.From a public health perspective, sentinel studies should identify such community concerns and act early to produce convincing explanations and evidence. Local public health workforces need to be diverse, multiskilled, and able to engage well with minorities and vulnerable groups. The local Directors of Public Health in the UK are based in each local government area and have a remit and opportunity to stimulate speedy action to increase vaccine uptake.During the rapid Pandemic Pace of the vaccines roll-out, extra efforts to minimise uptake variations are likely to achieve improvements in the next year or two. We expect variations will not disappear however, given that underlying inequalities persist in less inclusive social systems.","Reid, John A; Mabhala, Mzwandile A",Isr J Health Policy Res,,721

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has a variable presentation ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Liver involvement is common during COVID-19 and exhibits a spectrum of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic elevations of liver function tests to hepatic decompensation. The presence of abnormal liver tests has been associated with a more severe presentation of COVID-19 disease and overall mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the liver of patients with COVID-19, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 productively infects and replicates in liver cells and has a direct liver-pathogenic effect. The cause of liver injury in COVID-19 can be attributed to multiple factors, including virus-induced systemic inflammation, hypoxia, hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver disease. Among patients with cirrhosis, COVID-19 has been associated with hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality. Additionally, COVID-19's impact on health care resources can adversely affect delivery of care and outcomes of patients with chronic liver disease. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of liver injury during COVID-19 will be important in the management of patients with COVID-19, especially those with advanced liver disease. This review summarizes our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactions in the liver as well the clinical impact of liver disease in COVID-19.","Saviano, Antonio; Wrensch, Florian; Ghany, Marc G; Baumert, Thomas F",Hepatology (Baltim.),,721
483570,Point Prevalence Testing of Residents for SARS-CoV-2 in a Subset of Connecticut Nursing Homes,2020,"Macrophages promote an early host response to infection by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), TNF, and IL-6. The bioactivity of interleukin-1ß is classically dependent upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation which culminates in caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis. Recent studies suggest a role for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lung inflammation and fibrosis in both COVID-19 and SARS, and there is evidence of NLRP3 involvement in HIV-1 disease. Here, we show that GU-rich single-stranded RNA (GU-rich RNA) derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and HIV-1 trigger a TLR8-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine response from human macrophages in the absence of pyroptosis, with GU-rich RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggering the greatest inflammatory response. Using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, we show that the induction of mature IL-1ß is through a non-classical pathway dependent upon caspase-1, caspase-8, the NLRP3 inflammasome, potassium efflux, and autophagy while being independent of TRIF (TICAM1), vitamin D3, and pyroptosis.","Campbell, Grant R; To, Rachel K; Hanna, Jonathan; Spector, Stephen A",iScience,,721

If testing methodology is such that samples from multiple subjects can be efficiently combined and tested at once, yielding a positive results if any one subject in the subgroup is positive, then one can often identify the infected sub-population with a considerably lower number of tests compared to the number of test subjects. We present two such methods that allow an increase in testing efficiency (in terms of total number of test performed) by a factor of $\approx$ 10 if population infection rate is $10^{-2}$ and a factor of $\approx$50 when it is $10^{-3}$. Such methods could be useful when testing large fractions of the total population, as will be perhaps required during the current coronavirus pandemic.","Slosar, Anvze",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14337v1.pdf,721
484988,Close contact risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-04-22,"Black-box nature hinders the deployment of many high-accuracy models in medical diagnosis. It is risky to put one's life in the hands of models that medical researchers do not trust. However, to understand the mechanism of a new virus, such as COVID-19, machine learning models may catch important symptoms that medical practitioners do not notice due to the surge of infected patients during a pandemic. In this work, the interpretation of machine learning models reveals that a high C-reactive protein (CRP) corresponds to severe infection, and severe patients usually go through a cardiac injury, which is consistent with well-established medical knowledge. Additionally, through the interpretation of machine learning models, we find phlegm and diarrhea are two important symptoms, without which indicate a high risk of turning severe. These two symptoms are not recognized at the early stage of the outbreak, whereas our findings are corroborated by later autopsies of COVID-19 patients. We find patients with a high N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) have a significantly increased risk of death which does not receive much attention initially but proves true by the following-up study. Thus, we suggest interpreting machine learning models can offer help to diagnosis at the early stage of an outbreak.","Wu, Han; Ruan, Wenjie; Wang, Jiangtao; Zheng, Dingchang; Li, Shaolin; Chen, Jian; Li, Kunwei; Chai, Xiangfei; Helal, Sumi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02006v2.pdf,721

But it is not clear whether endometriosis increases the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Women who referred to the gynecology clinic were evaluated and 507 women with endometriosis (case group) were compared with 520 women without endometriosis (control group). COVID-19 infection, symptoms, exposure, hospitalization, isolation, H1N1 infection and vaccination, and past medical history of the participants were recorded and compared between the groups using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21. RESULTS: Comparison between the groups represent COVID-19 infection in 3.2% of the case group and 3% of the control group (P = 0.942). The control group had a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection (95.7% vs. 94.5%; P < 0.001) and fever (1.6% vs. 0%; P = 0.004), while the frequency of rare symptoms was more common in the case group (P < 0.001). The average disease period was 14 days in both groups (P = 0.694). COVID-19 infection was correlated with close contact (r = 0.331; P < 0.001 in the case group and r = 0.244; P < 0.001 in the control group), but not with the history of thyroid disorders, H1N1 vaccination, traveling to high-risk areas, and social isolation (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Endometriosis does not increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infections, but alters the manifestation of the disease.

486388,A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-infected university students are asymptomatic,2020,"Recent research has questioned the fairness of face-based recognition and attribute classification methods (such as gender and race) for dark-skinned people and women. Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum is an alternate solution over face biometrics, thanks to its accuracy, security, robustness against facial expression, and ease of use in mobile devices. With the recent COVID-19 crisis, ocular biometrics has a further advantage over face biometrics in the presence of a mask. However, fairness of ocular biometrics has not been studied till now. This first study aims to explore the fairness of ocular-based authentication and gender classification methods across males and females. To this aim, VISOB 2.0 dataset, along with its gender annotations, is used for the fairness analysis of ocular biometrics methods based on ResNet-50, MobileNet-V2 and lightCNN-29 models. Experimental results suggest the equivalent performance of males and females for ocular-based mobile user-authentication in terms of genuine match rate (GMR) at lower false match rates (FMRs) and an overall Area Under Curve (AUC). For instance, an AUC of 0.96 for females and 0.95 for males was obtained for lightCNN-29 on an average. However, males significantly outperformed females in deep learning based gender classification models based on ocular-region. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Krishnan, A.; Almadan, A.; Rattani, A.",Lect.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways. The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations. Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals. In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism. Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system.

Conventionally, many researchers have directly applied regression analysis. However, interpreting the effect of weather on these loads is difficult with the existing methods. In this study, we build a statistical model that resolves this interpretation issue. A varying coefficient model with basis expansion is used to capture the nonlinear structure of the weather effect. This approach results in an interpretable model when the regression coefficients are nonnegative. To estimate the nonnegative regression coefficients, we employ nonnegative least squares. Real data analysis shows the practicality of our proposed statistical modeling. The interpretation would be helpful for making strategies for energy-saving intervention and demand response.","Hirose, Kei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01002v1.pdf,721

493929,A conceptual approach to the rationale for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine allocation prioritisation,2021,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are ubiquitous in the environment. However, only a limited number of predominantly persistent perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) have been analyzed in edible plants so far. We present a generic trace analytical method that allows for quantification of 16 intermediate fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH)- or perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanol (FASE)-based transformation products as well as 18 PFAAs in plants. Additionally, 36 suspected intermediate PFAS transformation products were qualitatively analyzed. The ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction of wheat and maize grain, maize leaves, Jerusalem artichoke and ryegrass (1-5 g plant sample intake) was followed by a clean-up with dispersive solid-phase extraction using graphitized carbon adsorbent (5-10 mg per sample) and chemical analysis by reversed phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method was based on matrix matched and extracted calibration and displayed good precision with relative standard deviations in triplicate analyses typically below 15% for all quantified analytes and matrices. An average deviation of 12% between quantified concentrations obtained by matrix matched and extracted calibration and a method based on isotopically labelled internal standards underlines the good trueness of the method. The method quantification limits for the majority of analytes in all plant samples were in the low ng/kg concentration range on a dry weight basis. Plant matrices were analyzed from crops grown on agricultural fields that have been contaminated with PFASs. FTOH- and/or FASE-based intermediate transformation products were detected in all samples with N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (EtFOSAA) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) as the prevailing compounds in concentrations up to several hundred ng/kg in maize leaves. The 9:3 Acid (a transformation product of 10:2 FTOH) was tentatively identified. In accordance with these findings, the final degradation products perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were frequently detected. For perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), according to earlier findings, short chain homologues generally displayed the highest levels (up to 98 µg/kg for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) in maize leaves). However, maize grain was an exception showing the highest concentrations for long chain PFCAs, whereas PFBA was not detected. The uptake of high levels of PFASs into plants is of concern since these may be used as animal feed or represent a direct exposure medium for humans.","Muschket, Matthias; Keltsch, Nils; Paschke, Heidrun; Reemtsma, Thorsten; Berger, Urs",J Chromatogr A,,721

The diffuse inflammation leads to endothelium dysfunction in pulmonary blood vessels, uncoupling eNOS activity, lowering NO production, causing pulmonary physiological alterations and coagulopathy. On the other hand, iNOS activity is increased, which may be advantageous for host defense, once NO plays antiviral effects. However, overproduction of NO may be deleterious, generating a pro-inflammatory effect. In this review, we discussed the role of endogenous NO as a protective or deleterious agent of the respiratory and vascular systems, the most affected in COVID-19 patients, focusing on eNOS and iNOS roles. We also reviewed the currently available NO therapies and pointed out possible alternative treatments targeting NO metabolism, which could help mitigate health crises in the present and future CoV's spillovers.","Guimarães, Lara M F; Rossini, Caio V T; Lameu, Claudiana",Nitric Oxide,,721

495870,An increased ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs within routine diagnostic upper respiratory tract swabs may be a marker of virion shedding,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The virus is likely to show seasonal dynamics in European climates as other respiratory viruses and coronaviruses do. Analysing the association with meteorological factors might be helpful to anticipate how cases will develop with changing seasons. METHODS: Routinely measured ambient daily mean temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity were the explanatory variables of this analysis. Test-positive COVID-19 cases represented the outcome variable. The analysis included 54 English cities. A two-stage meta-regression was conducted. At the first stage, we used a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model including distributed lag non-linear elements. Thereby, we investigate the explanatory variables' non-linear effects as well as the non-linear effects across lags. RESULTS: This study found a non-linear association of COVID-19 cases with temperature. At 11.9°C there was 1.62-times (95%-CI: 1.44; 1.81) the risk of cases compared to the temperature-level with the smallest risk (21.8°C). Absolute humidity exhibited a 1.61-times (95%-CI: 1.41; 1.83) elevated risk at 6.6 g/m3 compared to the centering at 15.1 g/m3. When adjusting for temperature RH shows a 1.41-fold increase in risk of COVID-19 incidence (95%-CI: 1.09; 1.81) at 60.7% in respect to 87.6%. CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that in England meteorological variables likely influence COVID-19 case development. These results reinforce the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing and mask use) during all seasons, especially with cold and dry weather conditions.","Nottmeyer, Luise N; Sera, Francesco",Environ Res,,721

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the risk factors of PONV in patients undergoing ambulatory strabismus surgery under general anaesthesia, with the treatments of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination. Methods: We reviewed 721 consecutive patients (12-60 years old) undergoing ambulatory strabismus surgery under general anaesthesia at an academic eye centre between December 2016 and January 2019. Patients received prophylactic treatment of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination during anaesthesia induction, and PONV was evaluated during the early recovery period before discharge. Results: The dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination effectively reduced the incidence of PONV (3.05%, 22/721), and the patients who experienced PONV had statistically prolonged phase II recovery time as compared those who did not (P = 0.006). The sum of the extraocular muscles manipulated and the use of nalbuphine (vs flurbiprofen axetil) were the independent risk factors for PONV (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The sum of the extraocular muscles manipulated and the use of nalbuphine are potentially modifiable risk factors for PONV after strabismus surgery with the treatments of dexamethasone and 5-HT3 antagonist combination.","Li, Jinfei; Ye, Huijin; Shen, Weihua; Chen, Qianru; Lin, Yiquan; Gan, Xiaoliang",Indian J Anaesth,,721

498941,Clinical Electroencephalography Findings and Considerations in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The endothelium, a cellular monolayer lining the blood vessel wall, plays a critical role in maintaining multiorgan health and homeostasis. Endothelial functions in health include dynamic maintenance of vascular tone, angiogenesis, hemostasis, and the provision of an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic interface. Dysfunction of the vascular endothelium presents with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, heightened oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, leukocyte adhesion and hyperpermeability, and endothelial cell senescence. Recent studies have implicated altered endothelial cell metabolism and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition as new features of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as a hallmark of many diverse human panvascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction has also been implicated in severe coronavirus disease 2019. Many clinically used pharmacotherapies, ranging from traditional lipid-lowering drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and antidiabetic drugs to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors and interleukin 1ß monoclonal antibodies, counter endothelial dysfunction as part of their clinical benefits. The regulation of endothelial dysfunction by noncoding RNAs has provided novel insights into these newly described regulators of endothelial dysfunction, thus yielding potential new therapeutic approaches. Altogether, a better understanding of the versatile (dys)functions of endothelial cells will not only deepen our comprehension of human diseases but also accelerate effective therapeutic drug discovery. In this review, we provide a timely overview of the multiple layers of endothelial function, describe the consequences and mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, and identify pathways to effective targeted therapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The endothelium was initially considered to be a semipermeable biomechanical barrier and gatekeeper of vascular health. In recent decades, a deepened understanding of the biological functions of the endothelium has led to its recognition as a ubiquitous tissue regulating vascular tone, cell behavior, innate immunity, cell-cell interactions, and cell metabolism in the vessel wall. Endothelial dysfunction is the hallmark of cardiovascular, metabolic, and emerging infectious diseases. Pharmacotherapies targeting endothelial dysfunction have potential for treatment of cardiovascular and many other diseases.","Xu, Suowen; Ilyas, Iqra; Little, Peter J; Li, Hong; Kamato, Danielle; Zheng, Xueying; Luo, Sihui; Li, Zhuoming; Liu, Peiqing; Han, Jihong; Harding, Ian C; Ebong, Eno E; Cameron, Scott J; Stewart, Alastair G; Weng, Jianping",Pharmacol Rev,,721

AAAs partner with other organizations to administer services authorized under the Older Americans Act (OAA). AAAs represent loosely coupled systems; they are responsive to guidelines established by the OAA while maintaining flexibility to leverage limited resources, establish partnerships, and create innovative programs to meet community needs. As stay-at-home orders and concern for safety have kept many older adults homebound during the COVID-19 pandemic, an important question is how the Aging Network, including the over 600 AAAs, has responded to these rapidly changing needs. Although time and more systematic assessments are required, available information suggests that the loosely coupled network of AAAs has been a key, adaptable resource. This article begins with a description of the Aging Network and its history before turning to how the community-specific, collaborative, and evolving nature of AAAs places them at a unique position to respond to the challenges that arise with COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients' self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Text analytics revealed that concepts such as smell and taste were more prevalent than expected in patients testing positive. As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. The deep learning model yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.729 for predicting positive results and was subsequently applied to prioritize testing appointment scheduling.

503514,Predicting the Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 Vaccine from SARS-CoV-2 Variants Neutralisation Data,2021,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) treat an expanding range of cancers. Consistent basic data suggest that these same checkpoints are critical negative regulators of atherosclerosis. Therefore, our objectives were to test whether ICIs were associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and a higher risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular events. Methods: The study was situated in a single academic medical center. The primary analysis evaluated whether exposure to an ICI was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in 2842 patients and 2842 controls, matched by age, a history of cardiovascular events and cancer type. In a second design, a case-crossover analysis was performed with an ""at-risk period"" defined as the two-year period after and the ""control period"" as the two-year prior to treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and ischemic stroke). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Additionally, in an imaging sub-study (n=40), the rate of atherosclerotic plaque progression was compared from before and after starting an ICI. All study measures and outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: In the matched cohort study, there was a 3-fold higher risk for cardiovascular events after starting an ICI (HR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.0-5.5]; P<0.001). There was a similar increase in each of the individual components of the primary outcome. In the case-crossover, there was also an increase in cardiovascular events from 1.37 to 6.55 per 100 person-years at two years (adjusted HR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.5-6.5]; P<0.001). In the imaging study, the rate of progression of total aortic plaque volume was >3-fold higher with ICIs (from 2.1%/year pre-to 6.7%/year post). This association between ICI use and increased atherosclerotic plaque progression was attenuated with concomitant use of statins or corticosteroids. Conclusions: Cardiovascular events were higher after initiation of ICIs, potentially mediated by accelerated progression of atherosclerosis. Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors and increased awareness of cardiovascular risk, prior to, during and after treatment, should be considered among patients on an ICI.","Drobni, Zsofia D; Alvi, Raza M; Taron, Jana; Zafar, Amna; Murphy, Sean P; Rambarat, Paula K; Mosarla, Ramya C; Lee, Charlotte; Zlotoff, Daniel A; Raghu, Vineet K; Hartmann, Sarah E; Gilman, Hannah K; Gong, Jingyi; Zubiri, Leyre; Sullivan, Ryan J; Reynolds, Kerry L; Mayrhofer, Thomas; Zhang, Lili; Hoffmann, Udo; Neilan, Tomas G",Circulation,,721
503901,Virucidal efficacy of different formulations for hand and surface disinfection targeting SARS CoV-2,2021,"For healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, well fitted filtering facepiece respirators, for example, N95/FFP2 or N99/FFP3 masks, are recommended as part of personal protective equipment. In this review, we evaluate the role of fit checking and fit testing of respirators, in addition to airborne protection provided by respirators. Filtering facepiece respirators are made of material with sufficient high filter capacity to protect against airborne respiratory viruses. Adequate viral protection can only be provided by respirators that properly fit the wearer's facial characteristics. Initial fit pass rates vary between 40% and 90% and are especially low in female and in Asian healthcare workers. Fit testing is recommended to ensure a proper fit of respirators for the individual healthcare worker so that alternative respirators can be selected if required. Although fit testing is required to comply with respirator standards, it is not performed consistently within all healthcare settings. Fit checking (a self-test) is recommended every time a healthcare worker dons a respirator, but is unreliable in detecting proper fit or leak. Additionally, fit testing has a high educational value and as such is best performed as part of a hospital respiratory protection programme. Whether fit checking alone, as opposed to fit tested and fit checked respirators, provides adequate airborne protection against aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other respiratory viruses remains unknown. While fit testing undoubtedly incurs additional costs, it is still recommended, not only to protect healthcare workers but also as it may reduce overall healthcare cost when considering the potential costs of sickness leave and the associated legal costs of compensation.","Regli, A; Sommerfield, A; von Ungern-Sternberg, B S",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,721

Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test. Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 ± 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude. Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed. We recommend continuous public health education of HCWs on SARS-COV-2 infection control and prevention.","Ejeh, Francis Enenche; Saidu, Adamu Saleh; Owoicho, Samuel; Maurice, Nanven Abraham; Jauro, Solomon; Madukaji, Laura; Okon, Kenneth O",Heliyon,,721

RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel as a result of social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs and chairs more likely to report a negative impact (P = .001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing, and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family as a result of fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSION: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","Keswani, Sundeep G; Parikh, Umang M; Gosain, Ankush; Ghaferi, Amir A; Thomas, Jayshree S; Dudeja, Vikas; Kim, Eugene S; Zuckerbraun, Brian S; Goldstein, Allan M",Surgery (St. Louis),,721

510208,The Potential for Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Sport: A Cricket Case Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 challenges world governments. In Spain, measures to contain the pandemic are novel, and include the possibility of contracting Nursing and Medical students who might not be ready or willing to treat infected cases. OBJECTIVES: To study Spanish Nursing and Medical students' knowledge about COVID-19 community transmission prevention measures, treating infected patients, and their confidence and willingness to treat cases. To learn their views about the first public health policy measures adopted by the Spain government to contain the pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 237 Spanish Nursing and Medical students. METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed on the knowledge, confidence and willingness to treat, and the suitability of the public health policy measures adopted in Spain. The data were collected through social networks. The results were compared according to their university degree. RESULTS: Knowledge about community prevention was suitable, unlike knowledge about treating infected patients. Students had little confidence in treating cases, but their willingness and moral responsibility were high. Very few significant differences were found in their university degrees. Medical students evaluated the measures taken in Spain more favorably. CONCLUSIONS: Students' knowledge about COVID-19 community prevention measures was adequate, but not about preventive measures when treating patients with COVID-19. They felt little confidence despite being willing to treat infected patients. The sample agreed with the public health measures adopted in Spain.","Mena-Tudela, Desirée; González-Chordá, Víctor M; Andreu-Pejó, Laura; Mouzo-Bellés, Víctor M; Cervera-Gasch, Águeda",Nurse Educ Today,,721
510233,Comparison of seven commercial SARS-CoV-2 rapid point-of-care antigen tests: a single-centre laboratory evaluation study,2021,"The processes of globalisation and time-space compression, driven mainly by the neoliberal agenda and the advancement of various space-shrinking technologies, have markedly re-shaped the world over the last 75 years in an almost unchallenged manner. Amongst the most significant outcomes of these processes have been the popularisation of international travel and the accompanying global expansion of the tourism industry. As the first major force ever to effectively stop (or even reverse) globalisation and time-space compression, the COVID-19 outbreak has also put on hold the whole travel and tourism industry. In this respect, the tourism as we knew it just a few months ago has ceased to exist. Although the price the world is paying for this is enormous, the temporary processes of de-globalisation offer the tourism industry an unprecedented opportunity for a re-boot–an unrepeatable chance to re-develop in line with the tenets of sustainability and to do away with various ‘dark sides’ of tourism’s growth such as environmental degradation, economic exploitation or overcrowding. However, the path of re-development and transformation which the global tourism production system will follow once the COVID-19 crisis has been resolved is yet to be determined.","Niewiadomski, Piotr",Tour.

Present work verified whether novel Crabtree negative yeast inoculant could promote RS utilization, rumen fermentation, and milk quality in tropical crossbred lactating Holstein cows. The new stain of Crabtree negative yeasts (Pichia kudriavzevii KKU20 and Candida tropicalis KKU20) was isolated from the rumen of dairy cattle. This study used 6 multiparous crossbreds between Holstein Frisian × Zebu dairy cows in their mid-lactation period. Dairy cows were randomly allocated to three ensiled RS with various yeast stains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. kudriavzevii KKU20, and C. tropicalis KKU20 according to a 3 × 3 replicated Latin square design. Crabtree-negative yeast (P. kudriavzevii and C. tropicalis) increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter by about 6.9% when compared with Crabtree-positive yeast (S. cerevisiae). Bacterial populations were highest with ensiled RS by C. tropicalis KKU20. Ensiled RS with Crabtree-negative yeasts were significantly increased with total volatile fatty acids, but they did not affect volatile fatty acid profiles. Milk protein precentage was highest at 35.6 g/kg when C. tropicalis was fed, and lowest when applied with S. cerevisiae and P. kudriavzevii KKU20 in ensiled RS at 34.5 and 34.1 g/kg, respectively. Thus, feeding ensiled RS with novel Crabtree negative yeast could improve RS digestion, rumen fermentation, and milk protein content in dairy cows.","Suntara, Chanon; Cherdthong, Anusorn; Uriyapongson, Suthipong; Wanapat, Metha; Chanjula, Pin",Sci Rep,,721

513395,Immune responses and reactogenicity after ChAdOx1 in individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection and those without,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Specific respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, may cause smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency. The aim was to determine whether new-onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres. Consecutive patients positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups. New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77-165.4, P = 0.003)]. COVID-19 patients with new-onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients without STDs (52.6 ± 17.2 vs. 67.4 ± 15.1, P < 0.001). Amongst COVID-19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction. The mean duration of STD was 7.5 ± 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 ± 2.3 days of onset. CONCLUSION: New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients; they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation. The use of STD assessment in anamnesis as a hint for COVID-19 and to support individuals' self-isolation in the current epidemic context is suggested.","Beltrán-Corbellini, Á; Chico-García, J L; Martínez-Poles, J; Rodríguez-Jorge, F; Natera-Villalba, E; Gómez-Corral, J; Gómez-López, A; Monreal, E; Parra-Díaz, P; Cortés-Cuevas, J L; Galán, J C; Fragola-Arnau, C; Porta-Etessam, J; Masjuan, J; Alonso-Cánovas, A",Eur. j. neurol,,721
513535,The relationship between cytokine and neutrophil gene network distinguishes SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by sex and age,2021,"BACKGROUND: Family-centered care contributes to improved outcomes for preterm and ill infants. Little is known about the perceptions of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) healthcare professionals regarding the degree to which their NICU practices or values family-centered care. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to describe attitudes and beliefs of NICU healthcare professionals about family-centered care and to explore professional characteristics that might influence those views. METHODS: Data were derived from the baseline phase of a multicenter quasi-experimental study comparing usual family-centered NICU care with mobile-enhanced family-integrated care. Neonatal intensive care unit healthcare professionals completed the Family-Centered Care Questionnaire-Revised (FCCQ-R), a 45-item measure of 9 core dimensions of Current Practice and Necessary Practice for family-centered care. RESULTS: A total of 382 (43%) NICU healthcare professionals from 6 NICUs completed 1 or more of the FCCQ-R subscales, 83% were registered nurses. Total and subscale scores on the Necessary Practice scale were consistently higher than those on the Current Practice scale for all dimensions of family-centered care (mean: 4.40 [0.46] vs 3.61 [0.53], P < .001). Only years of hospital experience and NICU site were significantly associated with Current Practice and Necessary Practice total scores. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Ongoing assessment of the perceptions of NICU healthcare professionals regarding their current practice and beliefs about what is necessary for the delivery of high-quality family-centered care can inform NICU education, quality improvement, and maintenance of family-centered care during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Further research is needed to identify additional factors that predict family-centered care perceptions and behaviors.","Franck, Linda S; Cormier, Diana M; Hutchison, Jennifer; Moore, Dishon; Bisgaard, Robin; Gay, Caryl; Ngo, Samantha; Kriz, Rebecca M; Lin, Carol; Ekno, Mary; Ribero, Denise; Sun, Yao",Adv. neonatal care,,721

This has led to a transition to telemedicine and directly impacts patient volume, evaluation and management practices. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of COVID-19 on patient characteristics in relation to outpatient attendance, ancillary testing, medical therapy, and surgical decision making. METHODS: A retrospective case series at an academic medical center was performed. Outpatient appointments from October 2019 (pre-COVID) and March 16-April 10, 2020 (COVID) were analyzed. Prevalence rates and odds ratios were used to compare demographics, visit characteristics, ancillary tests, medication prescribing, and surgical decisions between telemedicine and in-person visits, before and during COVID. RESULTS: There was a decrease in scheduled visits during the COVID timeframe, for both in-person and telemedicine visits, with a comparable proportion of no-shows. There was a higher overall percentage of Hispanic/Latino patients who received care during the COVID timeframe (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.07-1.90) in both groups, although primary language was not significantly associated with attendance. There were fewer ancillary tests ordered (OR = 0.54) and more medications prescribed (OR = 1.59) during COVID telemedicine visits compared with pre-COVID in-person visits. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has rapidly changed the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine can be used as a tool to reach patients with severe disease burden. Continued healthcare reform, expanded access to affordable care, and efficient use of resources is essential both during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

514220,Evaluation of Serological SARS-CoV-2 Lateral Flow Assays for Rapid Point of Care Testing,2020,"Patients with cancer, in particular patients with hematologic malignancies, are at increased risk for critical illness upon COVID-19. We here assessed antibody as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in unexposed and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer to characterize SARS-CoV-2 immunity and to identify immunologic parameters contributing to COVID-19 outcome. Unexposed patients with hematologic malignancies presented with reduced prevalence of preexisting SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4+ T-cell responses and signs of T-cell exhaustion compared with patients with solid tumors and healthy volunteers. Whereas SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and cancer and healthy volunteers, intensity, expandability, and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses were profoundly reduced in patients with cancer, and the latter associated with a severe course of COVID-19. This identifies impaired SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity as a potential determinant for dismal outcome of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in patients with cancer reports on the potential implications of impaired SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses for understanding pathophysiology and predicting severity of COVID-19, which in turn might allow for the development of therapeutic measures and vaccines for this vulnerable patient population.See related commentary by Salomé and Horowitz, p. 1877.","Bilich, Tatjana; Roerden, Malte; Maringer, Yacine; Nelde, Annika; Heitmann, Jonas S; Dubbelaar, Marissa L; Peter, Andreas; Hörber, Sebastian; Bauer, Jens; Rieth, Jonas; Wacker, Marcel; Berner, Fiamma; Flatz, Lukas; Held, Stefanie; Brossart, Peter; Märklin, Melanie; Wagner, Philipp; Erne, Eva; Klein, Reinhild; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Salih, Helmut R; Walz, Juliane S",Cancer discov.

RESULTS: In this nationwide cohort, a total of 16942 hospitalized older adults with COVID-19 were enrolled, of whom 8635 (51%) were women. Mean age was 71.2 ± 8.5 years, ranging from 60 to 113 years. Mortality rate before and after curfew was statistically different (32.2% vs 17.9%; p & 0.001, respectively). Through multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that male gender, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, dementia, cancer, admission to intensive care unit, computed tomography finding compatible with COVID-19 were all significantly associated with mortality in entire cohort. In addition to abovementioned risk factors, in patients aged between 60-79 years, coronary artery disease, oxygen support need, total number of drugs, and cerebrovascular disease during hospitalization, and in patients 80 years of age and older acute coronary syndrome during hospitalization were also associated with increased risk of mortality.

Design/Methods/Approach: An online survey has been conducted to examine self-protective behaviour in times of public health crisis. The survey was distributed to Slovenian citizens (n = 280) using the social network Facebook. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample and measured variables. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine associations between identified factors. Findings: The results of the study indicate that there are no significant differences in self-reported self-protection between younger adults and others. Additionally, attitude toward self-protective measures is the most important predictor of self-protective behaviour for both age groups. Only the attitude is significantly associated with self-protective behaviour among young adults, whereas among others, all three predictors are significantly associated with self-protective behaviour, explaining nearly twice the variance. Research Limitations/Implications: This research contributes to the understanding of motivators that drive individuals to engage in self-protective behaviour in times of health crises. It provides insight into young adults' self-protective behaviour. Most of the limitations are related to the sample, which only contains respondents from one social network and one country. Originality/Value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explored the self-protective behaviour of young adults during COVID-19 using the theory of planned behaviour and compares the differences in self-protective behaviour predictors among different age groups.","Jelovčan, Luka Prislan Kaja Mihelič Anže",Varstvoslovje,,721

The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. METHODS: In a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. RESULTS: We enrolled 1368 consecutive patients (median age 68 [interquartile range, IQR 53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3822 tests (median 2 [IQR 1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1368), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing.

518476,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions,2020,"The elderly and patients with several comorbidities experience more severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than healthy patients without underlying medical conditions. However, it is unclear why these people are prone to developing alveolar pneumonia, rapid exacerbations, and death. Therefore, we hypothesized that people with comorbidities may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more vulnerable to various factors; for example, they are likely to become more severely ill when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To test this hypothesis, we searched the literature extensively. Polymorphisms of genes, such as those that encode angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), have been associated with numerous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, and there are potential mechanisms to explain these associations (e.g., DD-type carriers have greater ACE1 activity, and patients with a genetic alpha-1 anti-trypsin (AAT) deficiency lack control over inflammatory mediators). Since comorbidities are associated with chronic inflammation and are closely related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), these individuals may already have a mild ACE1/ACE2 imbalance before viral infection, which increases their risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19. However, there is still much debate about the association between ACE1 D/I polymorphism and comorbidities. The best explanation for this discrepancy could be that the D allele and DD subtypes are associated with comorbidities, but the DD genotype alone does not have an exceptionally large effect. This is also expected since the ACE1 D/I polymorphism is only an intron marker. We also discuss how polymorphisms of AAT and other genes are involved in comorbidities and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presumably, a combination of multiple genes and non-genetic factors is involved in the establishment of comorbidities and aggravation of COVID-19.","Yamamoto, Naoki; Yamamoto, Rain; Ariumi, Yasuo; Mizokami, Masashi; Shimotohno, Kunitada; Yoshikura, Hiroshi",Int. j. mol. sci.

This study was aimed to assess the clinical preference of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescence immunoassay. Methods: An upper respiratory specimen was collected in a series of patients referred to the Laboratory Medicine service of Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) for screening or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed with DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Altona Diagnostics RealStar R SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit. Results: The final study population consisted of 421 patients (median age, 48 years;227 women), 301 (71.5%) with positive result of molecular testing, and 126 (29.9%) with cycle threshold (Ct) values of both E and S genes <29.5, thus reflecting higher infectivity. The area under the curve of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) for sample positivity and 0.98 for higher sample infectivity (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99). The optimal cut-off for sample positivity was 82 TCID50/mL (0.78 sensitivity, 0.73 specificity and 77% diagnostic accuracy), whilst that for identifying samples associated with a high infective risk was 106 TCID50/mL (0.94 sensitivity, 0.96 specificity and 95% diagnostic accuracy). Conclusion: The performance of this chemiluminescence immunoassay would not permit it to replace molecular testing for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, but may enable rapid and efficient detection of subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, who are responsible for the largest proportion of infectious clusters.","Salvagno, G.

The present study aimed to compare the level of anxiety and depression in postpartum women who gave birth before and during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Women were divided into two groups: The case group, which included Italian women who delivered during the pandemic period (from December 2019) and the control group, which included Italian women who delivered before the pandemic period (until November 2019). An ad-hoc questionnaire was created and administered online. Depressive disorder was evaluated with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and anxiety disorders were assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, version 7. The values obtained were then differentiated based on socio-demographic variables and the characteristics of childbirth and breastfeeding between the two groups and univariate regression analysis were performed to assess which factors influenced anxiety and depression disorders among the two groups considered. RESULTS: Atotal of 266 women participated in the study. Of these, 110 belonged to the control group and 156 women belonged to the case group. No statistically significant differences were recorded between the two groups as considering socio-demographic characteristics and characteristics of delivery. GAD values statistically differed considering the age groups (P0.001), the level of education (P=0.024), the type of birth (P=0.021). All factors related to the EPDTscores were not significantly influencing both in the case group and in the control group, except in the control group as the type of breastfeeding (P=0.037). Significantly influencing factors in the evaluation of generalized anxiety disorder were the age (P=0.045) and the number of weeks of gestation in the control group (P=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are desirable to understand which factors most influence the depressive and anxious state of women to better address all the numerous psychological support initiatives that may be the most appropriate, timely and effective, even in emergency situations.","Vitale, E.; Galatola, V.; Mea, R.",Minerva Psychiatry,,721

The study examined the moderating effect of a manager on this relationship and the connections between workaholism and technostress through conditional process analysis. Results pointed out that high authoritarian leadership had an enhancing effect, whereas low authoritarian leadership had a protective effect on the relationship between workaholism and technostress, only in the group of complete remote workers.

592110,Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: a narrative review,2020-04-22,"Comorbidities in COVID-19 patients often lead to more severe outcomes. The disease-specific molecular events, which may induce susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, are being investigated. To assess this, we retrieved array-based gene expression datasets from patients of 30 frequently occurring acute, chronic, or infectious diseases. Comparative analyses of the datasets were performed after quantile normalization and log2 transformation. Among the 78 host genes prominently implicated in COVID-19 infection, ACE2 (receptor for SARS-CoV-2) was positively regulated in several cases, namely, leukemia, psoriasis, lung cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), breast cancer, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). FURIN was positively regulated in some cases, such as leukemia, psoriasis, NAFLD, lung cancer, and type II diabetes (T2D), while TMPRSS2 was positively regulated in only 3 cases, namely, leukemia, lung cancer, and T2D. Genes encoding various interferons, cytokines, chemokines, and mediators of JAK-STAT pathway were positively regulated in leukemia, NAFLD, and T2D cases. Among the 161 genes that are positively regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients, 99–111 genes in leukemia (including various studied subtypes), 77 genes in NAFLD, and 48 genes in psoriasis were also positively regulated. Because of the high similarity in gene expression patterns, the patients of leukemia, NAFLD, T2D, psoriasis, and PAH may need additional preventive care against acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further, two genes CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 11 (CA11) and CLUSTERIN (CLU) were positively regulated in the lungs of patients infected with either SARS-CoV-2, or SARS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Singh, Manoj Kumar; Mobeen, Ahmed; Chandra, Amit; Joshi, Sweta; Ramachandran, Srinivasan",Comput Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33486379/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521000135; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521000135?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104219,721

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients hospitalized between March 13(th) and May 19(th), 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log(10) transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log(10) VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50(th) percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02–1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50(th) percentile. CONCLUSIONS: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI.

Our study aim was to explore mouthwash (MW) as an alternative diagnostic method, in light of the disadvantages of ONP swabs. METHODS: COVID-19 outpatients molecular-confirmed by ONP swab were repeatedly examined with ONP swab and MW with normal saline (0.9%). Other types of fluids were compared to normal saline. The Cq values obtained with each method were compared. RESULTS: Among 137 pairs of ONP swabs and MW samples, 84.6% (116/137) of ONP swabs were positive by at least one of the genes (N, E, R). However MW detected 70.8% (97/137) of samples as positive, which means 83.6% (97/116) out of positive ONP swabs, missing mainly Cq value > 30. In both methods, the N gene was the most sensitive one. Therefore, MW samples targeting N gene, which was positive in 95/137 (69.3%), are comparable to ONP swabs targeting E and R genes which gave equal results—95/137 (69.3%) and 90/137 (65.7%), respectively. Comparing saline MW to distilled water gave equal results, while commercial mouth-rinsing solutions were less sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: MW with normal saline, especially when tested by N gene, can effectively detect COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, this method was not inferior when compared to R and E genes of ONP swabs, which are common targets in many laboratories around the world.","Biber, Asaf; Lev, Dana; Mandelboim, Michal; Lustig, Yaniv; Harmelin, Geva; Shaham, Amit; Erster, Oran; Schwartz, Eli",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-021-04320-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342767/,721

The “Troubling Trichotomy” of what can be done technologically, what should be done ethically, and what must be done legally is a reality during these unusual circumstances. Recent ethical considerations regarding allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilators, have been proposed. These can apply to other disciplines such as nutrition support, although decisions regarding nutrition support have a diminished potential for devastating outcomes. The principal values and goals leading to an ethical framework for a uniform, fair, and objective approach are reviewed in this article, with a focus on nutrition support. Some historical aspects of shortages in nutrition supplies and products during normal circumstances, as well as others during national crises, are outlined. The development and implementation of protocols using a scoring system seems best addressed by multidisciplinary ethics and triage committees with synergistic but disparate functions. Triage committees should alleviate the burdens of unilateral decisions by the healthcare team caring for patients. The treating team should make every attempt to have patients and the public at large update or execute/develop advance directives. Legal considerations, as the third component of the Troubling Trichotomy, are of some concern when rationing care. The likelihood that criminal or civil charges could be brought against individual healthcare professionals or institutions can be minimized, if fair protocols are uniformly applied and deliberations well documented.","Barrocas, Albert; Schwartz, Denise Baird; Hasse, Jeanette M.; Seres, David S.; Mueller, Charles M.",Nutr Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32492759/,721

Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient.

Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization.

Considering the availability of the RSV vaccines in the coming years, molecular understanding in RSV is necessary. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to describe RSV epidemiology and genotype variability in Portugal during the 2014/15-2017/18 period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Epidemiological data and RSV-positive samples from patients with a respiratory infection were collected through the non-sentinel and sentinel influenza surveillance system (ISS). RSV detection, subtyping in A and B, and sequencing of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of G gene were performed by molecular methods. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and p-distance model on MEGA 7.0. RESULTS: RSV prevalence varied between the sentinel (2.5%, 97/3891) and the non-sentinel ISS (20.7%, 3138/16779), being higher (P < 0.0001) among children aged <5 years. Bronchiolitis (62.9%, 183/291) and influenza-like illness (24.6%, 14/57) were associated (P < 0.0001) with RSV laboratory confirmation among children aged <6 months and adults ≥65 years, respectively. The HVR2 was sequenced for 562 samples. RSV-A (46.4%, 261/562) and RSV-B (53.6%, 301/562) strains clustered mainly to ON1 (89.2%, 233/261) and BA9 (92%, 277/301) genotypes, respectively, although NA1 and BA10 were also present until 2015/2016. CONCLUSION: The sequence and phylogenetic analysis reflected the relatively high diversity of Portuguese RSV strains. BA9 and ON1 genotypes, which have been circulating in Portugal since 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 respectively, predominated during the whole study period.","Sáez-López, Emma; Cristóvão, Paula; Costa, Inês; Pechirra, Pedro; Conde, Patrícia; Guiomar, Raquel; Peres, Maria João; Viseu, Regina; Lopes, Paulo; Soares, Vânia; Vale, Fátima; Fonseca, Patricia; Freitas, Ludivina; Alves, Jose; Pessanha, Maria Ana; Toscano, Cristina; Mota-Vieira, Luísa; Veloso, Rita Cabral; Côrte-Real, Rita; Branquinho, Paula; Pereira‑Vaz, João; Rodrigues, Fernando; Cunha, Mário; Martins, Luís; Mota, Paula; Couto, Ana Rita; Bruges-Armas, Jácome; Almeida, Sofia; Rodrigues, Débora",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653219302185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31707201/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2019.104200; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653219302185,721

In a large-scale survey conducted from March to May 2020 and including 88,181 participants from 47 countries, we investigated how stress, concerns, and trust moderated the effect in the Disease problem, a prominent framing problem highly evocative of the COVID-19 pandemic. As predicted by the appraisal-tendency framework, risk aversion and the framing effect in our study were larger than under typical circumstances. Furthermore, perceived stress and concerns over coronavirus were positively associated with the framing effect. Contrary to predictions, however, they were not related to risk aversion. Trust in the government’s efforts to handle the coronavirus was associated with neither risk aversion nor the framing effect. The proportion of risky choices and the framing effect varied substantially across nations. Additional exploratory analyses showed that the framing effect was unrelated to reported compliance with safety measures, suggesting, along with similar findings during the pandemic and beyond, that the effectiveness of framing manipulations in public messages might be limited.

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the COVID-19 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 198.2 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao(2)/Fio(2) of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483).

Here, we evaluate 254 COVID-19 patients longitudinally up to eight months and find durable broad-based immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibit a bi-phasic decay with an extended half-life of >200 days suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection also boosts antibody titers to SARS-CoV-1 and common betacoronaviruses. In addition, spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells persist, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure or vaccination. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, CD4+ T cell responses equally target several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ T cell responses preferentially target the nucleoprotein, highlighting the potential importance of including the nucleoprotein in future vaccines. Taken together, these results suggest that broad and effective immunity may persist long-term in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Cohen, Kristen W.; Linderman, Susanne L.; Moodie, Zoe; Czartoski, Julie; Lai, Lilin; Mantus, Grace; Norwood, Carson; Nyhoff, Lindsay E.; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; De Rosa, Stephen C.; Ahmed, Hasan; Whaley, Rachael; Patel, Shivan N.; Prigmore, Brittany; Lemos, Maria P.; Davis, Carl W.; Furth, Sarah; O’Keefe, James; Gharpure, Mohini P.; Gunisetty, Sivaram; Stephens, Kathy A.; Antia, Rustom; Zarnitsyna, Veronika I.; Stephens, David S.; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Rouphael, Nadine; Anderson, Evan J.; Mehta, Aneesh K.; Wrammert, Jens; Suthar, Mehul S.; Ahmed, Rafi; McElrath, M.

600105,Do Ocular Fluids Represent a Transmission Route of SARS-CoV-2 Infection?,2021-01-05,"OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical experience with anakinra for preventing mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with COVID‐19, features of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF). METHODS: In this retrospective case series, patients must have had SARS‐CoV‐2, fever, ferritin >1,000 ng/mL with one additional laboratory marker of hyperinflammation, and AHRF. AHRF was defined as requiring 15L of supplemental oxygen via non‐rebreather mask combined with 6L nasal cannula or use of ≥95% oxygen by high flow nasal cannula. We excluded patients with suspicion for bacterial infection or on immunosuppressants. Subcutaneous anakinra was initiated at 100 mg q6 hours and gradually tapered off completely. Primary outcome was prevention of MV. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients meeting criteria received anakinra for a maximum of 19 days. Seven of those who initiated anakinra ≤36 hours after onset of AHRF did not require MV, and all were discharged home. Four patients who started anakinra ≥4 days after onset of AHRF required MV. Of those, 3 patients were extubated (2 discharged home, 1 remains hospitalized) and 1 died. All 3 patients who met criteria but did not receive anakinra required MV. Two were extubated (1 discharged and 1 remains hospitalized) and 1 remains on MV. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that anakinra could be beneficial in COVID‐19 patients with evidence of CSS when initiated early after onset of AHRF. Our patient selection and treatment approach should be considered for investigation in a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of anakinra in patients with COVID‐19 and features of CSS.","Navarro‐Millán, Iris; Sattui, Sebastian E.; Lakhanpal, Amit; Zisa, Diane; Siegel, Caroline H.; Crow, Mary K.",Arthritis Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602262/,721
600229,First Report on the Latvian SARS-CoV-2 Isolate Genetic Diversity,2021-04-06,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early recovery stage across their ages in Shenzhen. METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Demographic variables, sociopsychological variables, medical history, and overall parameters of COVID-19 were collected by telephone interviews and by checking medical records. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS and SAS were 45.5±18.9, 47.3±13.1 and 43.2±10.2 respectively, meanwhile, 9(31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48(38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and post-infection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, which may improve after the quarantine or may persist and even deteriorate with time as reported in SARS survivors, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. The current study also contributes to geriatric psychiatry by indicating that the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Xin; Hu, Xiaopeng; Otte, Ekumi Ivo; Wang, Jianchun; An, Yawen; Li, Zhiwen; Yuan, Bo",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753338/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748120304097?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748120304097,721
600251,Droplets and Aerosols in the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020-04-15,"In this paper, a BioMEMS sensor by using a surface-stress sensing approach, connected to a highly sensitive optical sensing system, is proposed to diagnose various types of biomolecules. The MEMS transducer is composed of a fixed–fixed beam with immobilized receptors on the surface which is connected to a Ring Resonator (RR) filter. The interaction between the target biomolecules and the receptors induces surface stresses on the beam. This stress results in the beam deformation which leads to changes in the coupling coefficient of the RR. Consequently, the transmission spectrum of the RR experiences changes, measured by using an optical photo-detector. Therefore, by analyzing the response of the photo-detector output, one can detect the number of target biomolecules in the sample and assign a level of contamination, infection or bioparticles, caused by the specific disease. Furthermore, the MEMS functional characteristics and the optical properties of the proposed biosensor are designed and analyzed respectively by using the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach. The obtained functional characteristics of the proposed device show that the present optical BioMEMS sensor can be used for highly sensitive diagnoses of various types of diseases and their progress level.","Khorsandifard, Mahdieh; Jafari, Kian; Sheikhaleh, Arash",Sens Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335120/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11220-021-00355-1,721

600882,Optimising SARS-CoV-2 vaccination schedules,2021-08-06,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a pandemic and continues to spread around the globe at an unprecedented rate. To date, no effective therapeutic is available to fight its associated disease, COVID-19. Our discovery of a novel insertion of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding motif at S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (681-686 (PRRARS)) and two other GAG-binding-like motifs within SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP) led us to hypothesize that host cell surface GAGs might be involved in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Using a surface plasmon resonance direct binding assay, we found that both monomeric and trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike more tightly bind to immobilized heparin (KD = 40 pM and 73 pM, respectively) than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV SGPs (500 nM and 1 nM, respectively). In competitive binding studies, the IC50 of heparin, tri-sulfated non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate, and non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin against SARS-CoV-2 SGP binding to immobilized heparin were 0.056 μM, 0.12 μM, and 26.4 μM, respectively. Finally, unbiased computational ligand docking indicates that heparan sulfate interacts with the GAG-binding motif at the S1/S2 site on each monomer interface in the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 SGP, and at another site (453-459 (YRLFRKS)) when the receptor-binding domain is in an open conformation. Our study augments our knowledge in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and advances carbohydrate-based COVID-19 therapeutic development.","Kim, So Young; Jin, Weihua; Sood, Amika; Montgomery, David W.; Grant, Oliver C.; Fuster, Mark M.; Fu, Li; Dordick, Jonathan S.; Woods, Robert J.; Zhang, Fuming; Linhardt, Robert J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.041459,721

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients’ clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients’ medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups. CONCLUSION: CT images of non-critical, critical and death groups with COVID-19 had definite characteristics. CT examination plays a vital role in managing the current COVID-19 outbreak, for early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, initial CT findings may be useful to stratify patients, which have a potentially important utility in the current global medical situation.","Ashtari, S.; Vahedian-Azimi, A.; Shojaee, S.; Pourhoseingholi, M.A.; Jafari, R.; Bashar, F.R.; Zali, M.R.",Radiologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836904/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rx.2021.03.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033833821000709?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033833821000709,721
601153,Intranasal exposure of African green monkeys to SARS-CoV-2 results in acute phase pneumonia with shedding and lung injury still present in the early convalescence phase,2020-08-18,"The coronavirus replicase gene encodes one or two papain‐like proteases (termed PL1pro and PL2pro) implicated in the N‐terminal processing of the replicase polyprotein and thus contributing to the formation of the viral replicase complex that mediates genome replication. Using consensus fold recognition with the 3D‐JURY meta‐predictor followed by model building and refinement, we developed a structural model for the single PLpro present in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) genome, based on significant structural relationships to the catalytic core domain of HAUSP, a ubiquitin‐specific protease (USP). By combining the SCoV PLpro model with comparative sequence analyses we show that all currently known coronaviral PLpros can be classified into two groups according to their binding site architectures. One group includes all PL2pros and some of the PL1pros, which are characterized by a restricted USP‐like binding site. This group is designated the R‐group. The remaining PL1pros from some of the coronaviruses form the other group, featuring a more open papain‐like binding site, and is referred to as the O‐group. This two‐group, binding site‐based classification is consistent with experimental data accumulated to date for the specificity of PLpro‐mediated polyprotein processing and PLpro inhibition. It also provides an independent evaluation of the similarity‐based annotation of PLpro‐mediated cleavage sites, as well as a basis for comparison with previous groupings based on phylogenetic analyses.

METHODS: We measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Between 14–28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of 97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset, respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days post-symptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43, and NL63. CONCLUSIONS: Among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a correlate of protective immunity.","Iyer, Anita S.; Jones, Forrest K.; Nodoushani, Ariana; Kelly, Meagan; Becker, Margaret; Slater, Damien; Mills, Rachel; Teng, Erica; Kamruzzaman, Mohammad; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Astudillo, Michael; Yang, Diane; Miller, Tyler E.; Oliver, Elizabeth; Fischinger, Stephanie; Atyeo, Caroline; Iafrate, A.

DESIGN: National cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire. SETTING: Online, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 1512 (75.3%) participants completed the survey and were included in the analysis. INTERVENTION: Data were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during 1–15 November 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scale. RESULTS: Among the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccine’s efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%) and the vaccine’s manufacturing country (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination.

In the past year, there have been reports of missed or delayed treatments for conditions that mimic COVID-19. The main symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as fever and cough, belong to different clinical conditions. It is of the utmost importance that the diagnostic thinking used to analyze data and information to reach a COVID-19 diagnosis does not overlook the plethora of different diagnoses related to these symptoms. CASE REPORT The aim of this work is to present the clinical case of a patient having unrecognized HIV infection with a 4-week history of fever, cough, and hypoxia. When tests were allowed to highlight HIV-related immunodeficiency status, a CMV assay was performed in order to evaluate opportunistic pneumonia. Through this, diagnosis of HIV combined with CMV pneumonia was made, thus excluding COVID-19 respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION The diagnosis of the two conditions in the COVID-19 era is challenging due to overlapping clinical and radiological features and limitations of current diagnostic assays. This causes clinical implications due to diagnostic delays.","Pontolillo, Michela; Falasca, Katia; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Ucciferri, Claudio",Current HIV research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468299/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1570162x19666210901134104,721

Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 directly neutralizes human spleens and LNs through infecting tissue- resident CD169+ macrophages.","chen, yongwen; Feng, Zeqing; Diao, Bo; Wang, Rongshuai; Wang, Gang; Wang, Chenhui; Tan, Yingjun; Liu, Liang; Wang, Changsong; Liu, Ying; Liu, Yueping; Yuan, Zilin; Ren, Liang; Wu, Yuzhang",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427,721

We have previously reported that viral infections induce partial lymphocyte activation, characterized by significant increases in the cell surface expression of CD69 and CD86, but not CD25. This systemic partial activation of lymphocytes, mediated by IFN‐I, is rapid and is followed by a period of IFN‐I unresponsiveness.

A plethora of studies globally have suggested the existence of a sex disparity in the severity and outcome of COVID-19 patients, mainly due to mechanisms of virus infection, immune response to the virus, development of systemic inflammation, and consequent systemic complications, particularly thromboembolism. Epidemiological data report a sex difference in the severity of COVID-19, with a more favorable course of the disease in women compared to men regardless of age, although the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be similar in both sexes. Sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, may not only impact virus entry and load, but also shape the clinical manifestations, complications, and ultimately the outcome of the disease. The current review comprehensively summarizes the current literature on sex disparities in susceptibility and outcome of COVID-19 as well as the literature underpinning the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, which may provide a rationale to a sex disparity. These mechanisms include sex hormone influence on factors that facilitate virus entry and priming, immune and inflammatory response, as well as coagulation and thrombosis diathesis. Based on present evidence, women appear to be relatively protected from COVID-19 because of a more effective immune response and a less pronounced systemic inflammation, with consequent moderate clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a lesser predisposition to thromboembolism. Conversely, men appear to be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 because of a less effective immune response with consequent severe clinical manifestations of the disease, together with a greater predisposition to thromboembolism. In the elderly, generally characterized by the phenomenon of inflammaging, sex disparities in overall mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection are even more palpable as elderly men appear to be more prone to severe COVID-19 because of a greater predisposition to infections, a weaker immune defense, and an enhanced thrombotic state compared to women. The information revealed from the review highlights potential novel therapeutic approaches employing the administration of hormonal or antihormonal therapy in combination with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients.","Pivonello, Rosario; Auriemma, Renata S.; Pivonello, Claudia; Isidori, Andrea M.; Corona, Giovanni; Colao, Annamaria; Millar, Robert P.",Neuroendocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242856/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000513346,721

This analysis also reveals that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 have infected mink populations in the Netherlands, Denmark, United States, and Canada. In these animals, a small set of mutations in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), often occurring in specific combinations, has transferred back into humans. The viral genomic mutations in minks observed in the Netherlands and Denmark show the potential for new mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD to be introduced into humans by zoonotic transfer. Our data suggests that close attention to viral transfer from humans to farm animals and pets will be required to prevent build-up of a viral reservoir for potential future zoonotic transfer.","Burkholz, Scott; Pokhrel, Suman; Kraemer, Benjamin R.; Mochly-Rosen, Daria; Carback, Richard T.; Hodge, Tom; Harris, Paul; Ciotlos, Serban; Wang, Lu; Herst, C.V.; Rubsamen, Reid",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104897; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821001945?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821001945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971305/,721

There is, therefore, an upsurge in marketing of air decontamination technologies, but with no proper validation of their claims. We addressed the gap through the construction and use of a versatile room‐sized (25 m(3)) chamber to study airborne pathogen survival and inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report on the quantitative recovery and detection of an enveloped (Phi6) and a non‐enveloped bacteriophage (MS2). The two phages, respectively, acted as surrogates for airborne human pathogenic enveloped (e.g., influenza, Ebola and coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2) and non‐enveloped (e.g., norovirus) viruses from indoor air deposited directly on the lawns of their respective host bacteria using a programmable slit‐to‐agar air sampler. Using this technique, two different devices based on HEPA filtration and UV light were tested for their ability to decontaminate indoor air. This safe, relatively simple and inexpensive procedure augments the use of phages as surrogates for the study of airborne human and animal pathogenic viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This simple, safe and relatively inexpensive method of direct recovery and quantitative detection of viable airborne phage particles can greatly enhance their applicattion as surrogates for the study of vertebrate virus survival in indoor air and assessment of technologies for their decontamination. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The safe, economical and simple technique reported here can be applied widely to investigate the role of indoor air for virus survival and transmission and also to assess the potential of air decontaminating technologies.","Zargar, Bahram; Sattar, Syed A.; Kibbee, Richard; Rubino, Joseph; Khalid Ijaz, M.",J Appl Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411388/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.15262,721

However, there are no effective preventive measures and the efficacy of hip-preserving surgery is unsatisfactory due to the unclear mechanism of collapse. This study aimed to identify and validate miRNAs differentially expressed in collapse and non-collapse areas of the osteonecrotic femoral head, and to predict the target genes and pathways of these miRNAs. RESULTS: Nine samples passed the quality control test. A total of 2085 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, among which 433 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T1 group compared to the W1 group; 344 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T2 group compared to the W2 group; 107 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T3 group compared to the W3 group. After combining data from all three patients, 10 miRNAs showed differential expression in the collapse area (T1+T2+T3) compared to the non-collapse area (W1+W2+W3). Compared to the normal area, has-miR-195-5p showed the most significant downregulation. Expression results from RT-PCR revealed that the expression of hsa-miR-195-5p in the collapse area (T1+T2+T3) was significantly lower than that in the non-collapse area (W1+W2+W3) and normal area (Z1+Z2+Z3). 157 genes were perdicted as the target gene of hsa-miR-195-5p. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Femoral heads of three patients (2 males and 1 female) treated by total hip arthroplasty surgery for steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bone tissue samples were obtained from the collapse area (T), non-collapse area (W), and normal area (Z) according to the anatomical structure of osteonecrotic femoral heads. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and the microarray chip was scanned. miRNAs showing differential expressions of more than 1.5-fold were selected and was validated by RT-PCR. TargetScan, mirBase and miRanda bioinformatics software was used to predict target genes and identify possible pathways involving these genes. CONCLUSIONS: miR-195-5p showed the most significant difference in the collapse area of osteonecrotic femoral heads, suggesting that collapse may be related to the downregulation of miR-195-5p.","Li, Pengfei; Zhai, Pei; Ye, Zengjie; Deng, Peng; Fan, Yueguang; Zeng, Yirong; Pang, Zhihui; Zeng, Jianchun; Li, Jie; Feng, Wenjun",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28498798/,721

The computed results of the pollutant diffusion around a typical Hong Kong high-rise building model (at a linear scale of 1:30), were found to show a similar trend to the outcomes of self-conducted experimental measurements that the pathways of pollutant migration for windward and leeward pollutant emission are different. For the case with windward pollutant emission at the 3rd floor within a re-entry, the pollutant migrated downwards due to the downwash created by the wind. In contrast, for the case with leeward pollution emission, dispersion is dominated by intense turbulent mixing in the near wake and characterized by the upward migration of the pollutant in the leeward re-entry. The simulated results of haze-fog (HF) studies confirm that the pathway of pollutant migration is dominated by wind–structure interaction and buoyancy effect only plays a minor role in the dispersion process.","Zhang, Y.; Kwok, K.C.S.; Liu, X.-P.; Niu, J.-L.",Environ Pollut,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749115002377; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.05.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989454/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749115002377,721
604886,Efficient prevalence estimation and infected sample identification with group testing for SARS-CoV-2,2020-05-06,"The National Academy of Medicine has long advocated for a “learning healthcare system” that produces constantly updated reference data during the care process. Moving toward a rapid learning system to solve intractable problems in health demands a balance between protecting patients and making data available to improve health and health care. Public concerns in the U.S. about privacy and the potential for unethical or harmful uses of this data, if not proactively addressed, could upset this balance. New federal laws prioritize sharing health data, including with patient digital tools. U.S. health privacy laws do not cover data collected by many consumer digital technologies and have not been updated to address concerns about the entry of large technology companies into health care. Further, there is increasing recognition that many classes of data not traditionally considered to be healthcare-related, for example consumer credit histories, are indeed predictive of health status and outcomes. We propose a multi-pronged approach to protecting health-relevant data while promoting and supporting beneficial uses and disclosures to improve health and health care for individuals and populations. Such protections should apply to entities collecting health-relevant data regardless of whether they are covered by federal health privacy laws. We focus largely on privacy but also address protections against harms as a critical component of a comprehensive approach to governing health-relevant data. U.S. policymakers and regulators should consider these recommendations in crafting privacy bills and rules.

Yet, blacks report higher cumulative stress exposure than whites but lower levels of common psychiatric disorders. In order to understand why blacks bear disproportionate stress exposure but similar or better mental health relative to whites, we need to consider race differences in not only stress exposure, but also stress appraisal—how upsetting stress exposures are perceived to be. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examine whether race differences in the number of reported chronic stressors across 5 domains (health, financial, residential, relationship, and caregiving) and their appraised stressfulness explain black–white differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data come from 6019 adults aged older than 52 from the 2006 Health and Retirement Study. RESULTS: Older blacks in this sample experience greater exposure to chronic stressors but appraise stressors as less upsetting relative to whites. In fully adjusted models, stress exposure is related to higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and perceiving stress as upsetting is associated with higher symptomology for whites and blacks. We also find that blacks report greater anxiety symptoms but fewer depressive symptoms with more stress exposure relative to whites. Stress appraisal partially explains race differences in the association between stress exposure and anxiety symptoms and fully explains race differences in the association between exposure and depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The relationship between race, chronic stress exposure, and mental health is mediated by stress appraisal. Stress appraisal provides insight on important pathways contributing to black–white mental health disparities in older adulthood.","Brown, Lauren L; Abrams, Leah R; Mitchell, Uchechi A; Ailshire, Jennifer A",Innov Aging,https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igaa040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123630/,721

Early disease is characterized by neutrophilic, exudative capillaritis with microthrombosis and high levels of IL-1beta and IL-6. Later stages are associated with diffuse alveolar damage and ongoing intravascular thrombosis in small to medium-sized pulmonary vessels, occasionally with areas of infarction equivalents, accompanied by laboratory features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In late stages, organizing pneumonia with extensive intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts and marked metaplasia of alveolar epithelium can be observed.

Because simulation is considered best practice for competency‐based education, emergency medicine (EM) residencies adapted and innovated to accommodate to the new pandemic normal. Our objectives were to identify the impact of the pandemic on EM residency simulation training, to identify unique simulation adaptations and innovations implemented during the pandemic, and to analyze successes and failures through existing educational frameworks to offer guidance on the use of simulation in the COVID‐19 era. METHODS: The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM)’s Simulation Academy formed the SimCOVID task force to examine the impact of COVID‐19 on simulation didactics. A mixed‐methods approach was employed. A literature search was conducted on the subject and used to develop an exploratory survey that was distributed on the Simulation Academy Listserv. The results were subjected to thematic analysis and examined through existing educational frameworks to better understand successes and failures and then used to generate suggestions on the use of simulation in the COVID‐19 era. RESULTS: Thirty programs responded to the survey. Strategies reported included adaptations to virtual teleconferencing and small‐group in situ training with a focus on procedural training and COVID‐19 preparedness. Successful continuation or relaunching of simulation programs was predicated on several factors including willingness for curricular pivots through rapid iterative prototyping, embracing teleconferencing software, technical know‐how, and organizational and human capacity. In specific instances the use of in situ simulation for COVID‐19 preparedness established the view of simulation as a “value add” to the organization. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas simulation educator's responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic can be better appreciated through the lens of iterative curricular prototyping, their successes and failures depended on existing expertise in technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge. That knowledge needed to exist and synergize within a system that had the human and organizational capacity to prioritize and invest in strategies to respond to the rapidly evolving crisis in a proactive manner. Going forward, administrators and educators will need to advocate for continued investment in human and organizational capacity to support simulation‐based efforts for the evolving clinical and educational landscape.","Nadir, Nur‐Ain; Kim, Jane; Cassara, Michael; Hrdy, Michael; Zaveri, Pavan; Wong, Ambrose H.; Ray, Jessica; Strother, Christopher; Falk, Michael",AEM Educ Train,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786408/; https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10586,721

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release immunomodulatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been suggested as an alternative therapeutic option for IBD treatment in veterinary medicine. Furthermore, although it is known that MSCs pre-treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines show enhanced anti-inflammatory properties via the secretion of soluble factors, the underlying mechanisms of IBD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the therapeutic effects and corresponding mechanisms of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α in mouse models of IBD. Mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)- or dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis were injected intraperitoneally with cAT-MSCs pre-treated with TNF-α. Colitis severity was assessed and colon tissues were collected for histopathological, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry analysis. cAT-MSCs stimulated with TNF-α secreted higher concentrations of immunomodulatory factors such as TSG-6 and PGE2, which play a key role in inducing phenotypic alterations in macrophages. Consequently, TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs further regulated colonic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, and ameliorated DSS- or DNBS-induced colitis in mice. Additionally, we demonstrated that M1 macrophages (F4/80(+)/iNOS(+) cells) were decreased in colon tissues from mice treated with TNF-α-pre-treated cAT-MSCs, whereas M2 macrophages (F4/80(+)/CD206(+) cells) were increased. These results may suggest a new cell-based therapeutic option for treating IBD.","Song, Woo-Jin; Li, Qiang; Ryu, Min-Ok; Nam, Aryung; An, Ju-Hyun; Jung, Yun Chan; Ahn, Jin-Ok; Youn, Hwa-Young",Res Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31247473/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528818353542; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528818353542,721

Additionally, the potential implications of these effects on COVID-19 are also addressed. The results published show that diet and obesity are two factors that effectively influence the expression of Ace2 gene in adipose tissue. However, the shifts in this gene do not always occur in the same direction, nor with the same intensity. Additionally, there is no consensus regarding the implications of increased adipose tissue ACE2 expression in health. Thus, while in some studies a protective role is attributed to ACE2 overexpression, other studies suggest otherwise. Similarly, there is much debate regarding the role played by ACE2 in COVID-19 in terms of degree of infection and disease outcomes. The greater risk of infection that may hypothetically derive from enhanced ACE2 expression is not clear since the functionality of the enzyme seems to be as important as the abundance. Thus, the greater abundance of ACE2 in adipose tissue of obese subjects may be counterbalanced by its lower activation. In addition, a protective role of ACE2 overexpression has also been suggested, associated with the increase in anti-inflammatory factors that it may produce.","Gómez-Zorita, Saioa; Milton-Laskibar, Iñaki; García-Arellano, Laura; González, Marcela; Portillo, María P.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22157975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360741/,721

In this study, we report the case of a nasopharyngeal cancer patient from Wuhan who contracted COVID-19 during radiochemotherapy and has since recovered from the infection. We hope that this report will provide valuable insight into the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected cancer patients through an account of our experience.","Qiu, Weiming; Yi, Fengtao; Ren, Xingfeng; Li, Zhaoxia; Wang, Deqiang; Wang, Ning",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194574/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01755,721
608671,"Rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during the 2020 pandemic year in the population of the city of Tirana, Albania",2021-02-20,"More than a year ago, the first case of infection by a new coronavirus was identified, which subsequently produced a pandemic causing human deaths throughout the world. Much research has been published on this virus, and discoveries indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the possibility of getting sick from the new SARS-CoV-2. It follows that free radical scavengers may be useful for the treatment of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). This report investigates the antioxidant properties of nine antivirals, two anticancer molecules, one antibiotic, one antioxidant found in orange juice (Hesperidin), one anthelmintic and one antiparasitic (Ivermectin). A molecule that is apt for scavenging free radicals can be either an electron donor or electron acceptor. The results I present here show Valrubicin as the best electron acceptor (an anticancer drug with three F atoms in its structure) and elbasvir as the best electron donor (antiviral for chronic hepatitis C). Most antiviral drugs are good electron donors, meaning that they are molecules capable of reduzing other molecules. Ivermectin and Molnupiravir are two powerful COVID-19 drugs that are not good electron acceptors, and the fact that they are not as effective oxidants as other molecules may be an advantage. Electron acceptor molecules oxidize other molecules and affect the conditions necessary for viral infection, such as the replication and spread of the virus, but they may also oxidize molecules that are essential for life. This means that the weapons used to defend us from COVID-19 may also harm us. This study posits the idea that oxide reduction balance may help explain the toxicity or efficacy of these drugs. These results represent a further advance on the road towards understanding the action mechanisms of drugs used as possible treatments for COVID-19. Looking ahead, clinical studies are needed to define the importance of antioxidants in treating COVID-19.","Martínez, Ana",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10060979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207391/,721

BACKGROUND: Health professionals caring for patients during infectious outbreaks such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome have reported negative psychological effects. However, little is known about how the experience influences their professional self‐image. DESIGN: An interpretive phenomenological approach was applied using individual in‐depth interviews. METHODS: Through purposeful and snowball sampling, 11 health professionals who had experienced hospital isolation due to suspicious symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome during the outbreak, participated in face‐to‐face interviews (50‐90 minutes). We adhered to the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guideline for reporting. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: (a) engulfed in chaos and exhaustion; (b) feeling hurt and constrained by the rejection and blame; (c) anxiety induced by the enclosed environment; (d) dread of this uncertain and critical disease; (e) sustained by family and colleagues; and (f) reflection at this turning point, expanding self‐understanding and seeking a balance. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized isolation was a “turning point” that appeared to change health professionals’ sense of identity and direction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Preparedness for infectious epidemics should ensure tangible assistance, protection, and clear communication with health professionals, with careful attention to their psychological needs and affirmation of their self‐image in the aftermath.","Kim, Sujin; Shin, Hyun A; Hong, Kieun; Kim, Sue",J Clin Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786157/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15455,721

We aimed to systematically search for, identify and synthesize qualitative research that explores what it is like to live with POP and make this knowledge available for healthcare improvement. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, PsychInfo, Embase and CINAHL, from inception to March 2020, for qualitative research exploring the experience of living with POP. We used meta-ethnography to synthesize findings. This is a conceptual approach to qualitative evidence synthesis. We used the recent guidelines for reporting meta-ethnography. RESULTS: We screened 3103 titles and 255 abstracts and included 37 primary studies. These incorporated the experience of 777 women, (aged 18 to 95 years) from a range of countries. We organized 162 ideas into 27 conceptual categories and 10 themes. We developed a conceptual model that helps us to understand the experience of pelvic organ prolapse. This model indicates that (1) the physical losses of POP are intricately linked to loss of identity; (2) women conceptualized POP as part of womanhood, yet also its thief; (3) there is a vicious cycle of taboo, silence and misunderstanding about POP and its treatment; (4) this silence is exacerbated by a feeling that POP is not taken seriously in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-ethnography helps us to understand the experience of living with a POP. Our model illustrates the complex process of healthcare decision making. Further studies to explore the complexity of decision making from the perspective of patient and health professional are timely.","Toye, Francine; Pearl, Jeannine; Vincent, Katy; Barker, Karen",Int Urogynecol J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04494-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870341/,721

In order to strengthen the health system response to such crisis, especially in low- to middle-income communities, this paper extends a novel multi-objective model for designing a health service network under uncertainty which simultaneously considers efficiency, social responsibility, and network cost. For efficiency, a modified data envelopment analysis model is introduced and inserted into the proposed model to decrease the inefficiency of healthcare facilities belonging to the different tiers of the health system. For social responsibility, two measures of job creation and balanced development are incorporated into the extended model. This is not only considered to cope with the increased numbers of patients and disaster victims to healthcare facilities but also to deal with the challenge of the economy and the livelihoods of people during the crisis. Moreover, a novel mixed possibilistic-flexible robust programming (MPFRP) approach is developed to protect the considered network against uncertainty. To show the applicability of the extended model, a real-world case study is presented. The results reveal that contrary to fuzzy programming models, the MPFRP performs well in terms of social responsibility (72%), cost (8%), and efficiency (28%) and is able to make a trade-off between these three measures. In this study, the resilience level of the designed network is not addressed while disregarding any short-term stoppage owing to internal or external sources of disruption in designing may bring about a considerable loss.","Haeri, Abdorrrahman; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Rezaei, Marziehsadat",Ann Oper Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04066-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024978/,721

In 2020, there were approximately 592 000 new cancer cases and 260 000 cancer deaths. Considering the heterogeneities across Brazil, this study aimed to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer-related hospital admissions at a national and regional level. METHODS: The national, regional, and state-specific monthly average of cancer-related hospital admission rates per 100 000 inhabitants and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from March to July (2019: pre-COVID-19; and 2020: COVID-19 period). Thematic maps were constructed to compare the rates between periods and regions. RESULTS: Cancer-related hospital admissions were reduced by 26% and 28% for clinical and surgical purposes, respectively. In Brazil, the average hospitalization rates decreased from 13.9 in 2019 to 10.2 in 2020 per 100,000 inhabitants, representing a rate difference of −3.7 (per 100,000 inhabitants; 95% CI: −3.9 to −3.5) for cancer-related (clinical) hospital admissions. Surgical hospital admissions showed a rate decline of −5.8 per 100,000 (95% CI: −6.0 to −5.5). The reduction in cancer-related admissions for the surgical procedure varies across regions ranging between −2.2 and −10.8 per 100 000 inhabitants, with the most significant decrease observed in the south and southeastern Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a substantial decrease in cancer-related hospital admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic with marked differences across regions. Delays in treatment may negatively impact cancer survival in the future; hence, cancer control strategies to mitigate the impact are needed.","Mafra da Costa, Allini; Ribeiro, Aline L.; Ribeiro, Adeylson G.; Gini, Andrea; Cabasag, Citadel; Reis, Rui M.; Fregnani, José Humberto T.

This study aimed to explore the anticipations and support needs of final year allied health profession students transitioning to practice during a pandemic. Final year university students across seven healthcare professions were asked to complete an online survey. Demographic data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and responses to open questions were explored using content analysis. Sixty participants completed the survey. Content analysis regarding students' anticipations, fears, and support needs identified the following themes: professional identity and growth; opportunities for improvement; preparedness for transition from university to the workplace, the workplace environment; COVID-19; support from lecturers; daily support within the workplace and innovative methods of support. Although the transition from student to practitioner continues to be a stressful period, only a minority of participants reported COVID-19 as an explicit stressor.

615176,Clinical status determines the efficacy of salivary and nasopharyngeal samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-12,"This work examines a high temperature latent heat storage system, which could find use in future concentrated solar power and other combined heat and power plants. In contrast to lab-based fully charged or totally discharged states, partial load states will be the principal operation states in real-world applications. Hence, a closer look on the partial load states and the effective power rates are worthwhile for a successful implementation of this storage type. A vertical finned shell and tube heat exchanger pipe with a combination of transversal and longitudinal fins is applied. Sodium nitrate with a melting temperature of 306 [Formula: see text] is used as phase change material and thermal oil serves as heat transfer fluid. Temperatures in the storage and the heat transfer fluid as well as the mass flow are measured for data analysis. The state of charge formulation is based on an enthalpy distribution function, where the latent heat of fusion is spread over a specific temperature range. The data show consistently high power rates for all partial load cycles at any state of charge. The mean power rate for charging is 6.78 kW with an 95.45 % confidence interval of [Formula: see text] 1.14 kW for all cycles. The discharging power rate is −5.72 kW with a 95.45 % confidence interval of [Formula: see text] 1.36 kW for all cycles. The lowest power rate is measured for the full cycle at the end of charging/discharging. It is caused by a narrow volume, which is not penetrated by fins, near the perimeter of the cylindrical heat exchanger. The state of charge formulation correlates with the storage capacity and enables state of charge based cycling. With the energy balance of the storage, the data validity is proven and further storage parameters are determined. The energy density is as high as 110 kW h m(−3) and a power rate of 2.28 kW m(−1) for the finned tube is confirmed. These values are highly promising for further development and application of latent heat storage systems.","Scharinger-Urschitz, Georg; Schwarzmayr, Paul; Walter, Heimo; Haider, Markus",Appl Energy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071435/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115893; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920313611; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261920313611,721
615365,Postmortem conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs in SARS‐CoV‐2 infected and uninfected patients,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: An alarming cerebro/cardiovascular collateral damage, reflected by a decline in admissions for acute stroke (AS) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), was observed during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby leading to a re-design of public campaigns. However, there are limited data regarding the AS and ACS hospitalization rates during the second wave of the pandemic, which was followed by re-imposition of lockdowns. METHODS: We calculated the rate of AS and ACS hospitalizations from three representative tertiary care hospitals in Greece during a 2-month period (November–December 2020) of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding control period in 2019 from three representative tertiary care hospitals in Greece. This was a follow-up study with identical design to our previous report evaluating AS and ACS hospitalizations during the first wave of the pandemic (March–April 2020). RESULTS: Compared with 2019, there was a 34% relative reduction of AS hospitalizations [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48–0.92, p = 0.013] and 33% relative reduction of ACS hospitalizations (IRR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54–0.83, p < 0.001) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative reduction was smaller and did not reach the level of statistical significance for the respective syndromes (haemorrhagic stroke: IRR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.41–1.82, p = 0.71; ST-elevation myocardial infarction: IRR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.57–1.14, p = 0.22). CONCLUSION: AS and ACS hospitalizations were persistently reduced during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019 in Greece. This decline was similar to the observations during the first wave despite the large differences in the epidemiological COVID-19 burden. Lockdowns, a common characteristic in both waves, appear to have a detrimental indirect impact on cerebro/cardiovascular diseases in the general population.","Katsouras, Christos; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Papafaklis, Michail; Karapanayiotides, Theodore; Alexopoulos, Dimitrios; Ntais, Evangelos; Papagiannopoulou, Georgia; Koutroulou, Ioanna; Ziakas, Antonios; Sianos, Georgios; Kouparanis, Antonios; Trivilou, Paraskevi; Ballas, Christos; Samara, Ioanna; Kosmidou, Maria; Palaiodimou, Lina; Grigoriadis, Nikolaos; Michalis, Lampros K.; Giannopoulos, Sotirios",Ther Adv Neurol Disord,https://doi.org/10.1177/17562864211029540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285718/,721

Genomic sequence analyses of PEDV variants have revealed important insights into the evolution of PEDV. However, the antigenic variations among different PEDV strains are less explored, although they may contribute to the failure of PEDV vaccines in Asian countries. In addition, the evolution of PEDV results in variants with distinct genetic features and virulence differences; thus PEDV can serve as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus evolution and pathogenesis.

Previous studies showing a correlation between certain laboratory tests and diagnosis suggest an alternative method based on an ensemble of tests. METHODS: We have trained a machine learning model to analyze the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 test results and 20 routine laboratory tests collected within a 2-day period around the SARS-CoV-2 test date. We used the model to compare SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. RESULTS: In a cohort of 75,991 veteran inpatients and outpatients who tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the months of March through July, 2020, 7,335 of whom were positive by RT-PCR or antigen testing, and who had at least 15 of 20 lab results within the window period, our model predicted the results of the SARS-CoV-2 test with a specificity of 86.8%, a sensitivity of 82.4%, and an overall accuracy of 86.4% (with a 95% confidence interval of [86.0%, 86.9%]). CONCLUSIONS: While molecular-based and antibody tests remain the reference standard method for confirming a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, their clinical sensitivity is not well known. The model described herein may provide a complementary method of determining SARS-CoV-2 infection status, based on a fully independent set of indicators, that can help confirm results from other tests as well as identify positive cases missed by molecular testing.","Bayat, Vafa; Phelps, Steven; Ryono, Russell; Lee, Chong; Parekh, Hemal; Mewton, Joel; Sedghi, Farshid; Etminani, Payam; Holodniy, Mark",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32785701/,721

617647,Robust correlations across six SARS‐CoV‐2 serology assays detecting distinct antibody features,2021-02-28,"OBJECTIVES: During the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, malnutrition may contribute to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. We conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of malnutrition with hospitalized duration in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective survey study. SETTING: Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 139 patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In total, 139 patients with COVID-19 from patients in the Infection Department of Taikang Tongji (Wuhan) hospital from February 2020 to April 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. We used the “Global leadership Initiative on Malnutrition(GLIM)” assessment standard published in 2019 to assess nutritional status. Prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (17 days) in this population. RESULTS: According to the assessment results of GLIM nutrition assessment, the patients were divided into malnutrition group and normal nutrition group. Compared with the patients in the normal nutrition group, the hospitalization time was longer(15.67±6.26 days versus 27.48±5.04 days, P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed patients with malnutrition were more likely to be hospitalized longer compared with those normal nutrition (mean with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.91[27.52–30.30] versus 22.78[21.76–23.79], P = 0.001). COX regression analysis showed that malnutrition (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.773, P for trend = 0.001) was proportional associated with being discharged from hospital delayed. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Present findings suggested that malnutrition contributed to predicting a probability of prolonged hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 infection, to whom extra attentions and precautions should be paid during clinical treatments. Based on the existing results, it is recommended that inpatients with nutritional risk or malnutrition start nutritional support treatment as soon as possible.","Yu, Y.; Ye, J.; Chen, M.; Jiang, C.; Lin, W.; Lu, Y.; Ye, H.; Li, Y.; Wang, Y.; Liao, Q.; Zhang, Dongmei; Li, Dongliang",J Nutr Health Aging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1541-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575730/,721

However, the dispersion of respiratory droplets in these places, featured by slopes and human motion, is not well understood yet. It is consequently unclear whether the commonly recommended social-distancing guidelines are still appropriate in these scenarios. In this work, we analyze the dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a passenger riding an escalator with numerical simulations, focusing on the effects of the slope and speed of the escalator on the droplet dispersion. In the simulations, a one-way coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian approach is adopted, with the air-flow solved using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method and the droplets modeled as passive Lagrangian particles. It is found that the slope alters the vertical concentration of the droplets in the passenger's wake significantly. The deflection of cough-generated jet and the wake flow behind the passenger drive the cough-generated droplets upwards when descending an escalator and downwards when ascending, resulting in both higher suspension height and larger spreading range of the viral droplets on a descending escalator than on an ascending one. These findings suggest that the present social-distancing guidelines may be inadequate on descending escalators and need further investigation.","Li, Zhaobin; Zhang, Xinlei; Wu, Ting; Zhu, Lixing; Qin, Jianhua; Yang, Xiaolei",Phys Fluids (1994),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897245/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0046870,721

Here, we introduce an in vitro booster vaccination approach that relies on antigen-dependent activation of human memory B cells in culture. This stimulation induces antigen-specific B cell proliferation, differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, and robust antibody secretion after a few days of culture. We validated this strategy using cells from healthy donors to retrieve human antibodies against tetanus toxoid and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from H1N1 and newly emergent subtypes such as H5N1 and H7N9. Anti-HA antibodies were cross-reactive against multiple subtypes, and some showed neutralizing activity. Although these antibodies may have arisen as a result of previous influenza infection, we also obtained gp120-reactive antibodies from non–HIV-infected donors, indicating that we can generate antibodies without prior antigenic exposure. Overall, our novel approach can be used to rapidly produce therapeutic antibodies and has the potential to assess the immunogenicity of candidate antigens, which could be exploited in future vaccine development.","Sanjuan Nandin, Irene; Fong, Carol; Deantonio, Cecilia; Torreno-Pina, Juan A.; Pecetta, Simone; Maldonado, Paula; Gasparrini, Francesca; Ordovas-Montanes, Jose; Kazer, Samuel W.; Kjaer, Svend; Borley, Daryl W.; Nair, Usha; Coleman, Julia A.; Lingwood, Daniel; Shalek, Alex K.; Meffre, Eric; Poignard, Pascal; Burton, Dennis R.; Batista, Facundo D.",J Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20170633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28739603/,721

As of November 2020, there have been over 64 million confirmed cases and approaching 2 million deaths globally. Despite the large number of positive cases, there are very limited established standards of care and therapeutic options available. To date, there is still no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine for COVID-19, although there are several options in various clinical trial stages. Herein, we have performed a global review evaluating the roles of age and sex on COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths in hospitals, and deaths in nursing homes. We have identified a trend in which elderly and male patients are significantly affected by adverse outcomes. There is evidence suggesting that sex hormone levels can influence immune system function against SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus reducing the adverse effects of COVID-19. Since older adults have lower levels of these sex hormones, we therefore speculate, within rational scientific context, that sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, needs further consideration for use as alternative therapeutic option for treating COVID-19 elderly patients. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive article evaluating the significance of sex hormones in COVID-19 outcomes in older adults.","Okpechi, Samuel C; Fong, Jordyn T; Gill, Shawn S; Harman, Jarrod C; Nguyen, Tina H; Chukwurah, Queendaleen C; Onor, IfeanyiChukwu O; Alahari, Suresh K",Aging Dis,https://doi.org/10.14336/ad.2020.1211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815890/,721

Within 28 days, infectious virus and hemagglutinin were being produced at high levels in both types of cells. Temperature sensitive plaque variants were recovered at 31 °C. In both cell types, the virus caused increased antigen synthesis and cell death, if the temperature was lowered to 31 °C. Infectious virus was lost if cells were treated with antiserum to whole virus or if the temperature was raised to 39.5 °C.

We found three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF encoded a 668-amino acid protein of 73,588 Da, which was presumably the capsid precursor protein of FCV and had significant amino acid sequence homology with the VP3 of picornaviruses. A small ORF at the extreme 3′-end was compared with that of the F9 strain of FCV, a vaccine strain originally from the U.S. Highly conserved amino acid sequences were shown, suggesting that this ORF might be functional and encode a putative 106-amino acid protein of 12,153 Da. The other ORF in the 5′-flanking region of the cDNA had consensus amino acid sequences conserved among the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.","Tohya, Yukinobu; Taniguchi, Yasuko; Takahashi, Eiji; Utagawa, Etsuko; Takeda, Naokazu; Miyamura, Kikuko; Yamazaki, Shudo; Mikami, Takeshi",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1853578/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229191016A; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229191016A,721

Here we test the suitability of different RNA extraction methods for integration into a diagnostic workflow for coronavirus testing. Methods: We applied six RNA extraction methods on the same 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples and quantified their results by subsequent reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of three viral genes. These methods included a) column-based extraction, b) phenol-chloroform extraction, as well as c) extraction using magnetic beads (i.e., one commercial kit as well as three different magnetic beads in combination with home-brewed buffers and solutions). Results: We achieved diagnostic-quality RT-PCR results with all methods, and there was no significant difference between the tested methods, except for one magnetic bead protocol with home-brewed buffers, in which the number of positive tested genes was significantly lower. Conclusions: Five of the six RNA extraction methods are interchangeable in a diagnostic workflow. Since some methods are more scalable than others, and have comparable results on RT-PCR quantitation, they may be more amenable to high-throughput sample processing pipelines.","Eichhoff, O.

Previous studies suggested that self-compassion contributes to life-satisfaction. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this relation. This study investigated the relationship between self-compassion and life-satisfaction among Chinese self-quarantined residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we examined the mediating effect of positive coping and the moderating role of gender in this relation. Participants consist of 337 self-quarantined residents (129 men, 208 women) from a community in China, who completed measures of demographic information, Self-Compassion Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. The results revealed that self-compassion was positively linked with life-satisfaction. Moreover, positive coping partially mediated the relationship between self-compassion and life-satisfaction for males and not females. In the female group, self-compassion was positively linked with positive coping and life-satisfaction; however, positive coping and life-satisfaction were not significantly linked. These findings indicated that intervention focus on self-compassion could increase life-satisfaction in self-quarantined people during the COVID-19, and self-compassion may contribute to life-satisfaction via positive coping only in the male.","Li, Angyang; Wang, Shuo; Cai, Minmin; Sun, Ruiqi; Liu, Xiangping",Pers Individ Dif,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100455/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920306486; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920306486,721

Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce. In case of immunity to the infectious agent this affect is mainly relevant at early stages of the pandemic. This effect is independent on infection rates and increases the overall workforce productivity under certain situations.","Sanchez-Taltavull, Daniel; Candinas, Daniel; Roldan, Edgar; Beldi, Guido",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041863,721

METHOD: Students enrolled in core clinical clerkships at the UC San Diego School of Medicine from March to April 2020 were sent an anonymous online survey, assessing components of remote learning curricula via quantitative rating and free-response questions. RESULTS: Of 132 students enrolled, 96 (73%) completed the survey. Online question banks, remote progress reviews, and telehealth sessions were rated as the most valuable resources, while textbooks were rated least valuable. Most students felt that the number of resources was adequate (69/94, 74%), the quantity of required content was appropriate (77/93, 83%), and there was a good balance of rigidity versus flexibility in the schedule (81/94, 86%). Most students felt “prepared” or “somewhat prepared” for the shelf examination (61/91, 67%) and for the next year of medical training (73/94, 78%). In narrative reflections, students valued the flexibility afforded by remote curricula but desired some weekly structure. Students enjoyed expanded access to learning resources and participating in interactive remote sessions. Students expressed anxiety about the pandemic and uncertainty regarding medical education, but transparent communication from clerkship directors helped assuage these concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Student participation in direct patient care is fundamental to medical school core clerkships and was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategic incorporation of select remote learning components into clinical clerkships may permit a favorable student experience even when opportunities for on-site participation are limited.

However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the terminology for this emerging chronic clinical syndrome, which includes long COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute COVID-19, and long-hauler COVID-19. In this review, I will use the term “long COVID”. A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in “brain fog”. Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918–1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the “brain fog” described in long COVID. During past viral epidemics and pandemics, a commonality of neural targets may have increased viral survival by conformational matching. The neurological and psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or long COVID, may have emerged from neural effects that have emerged from an invertebrate and vertebrate virosphere. This review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long COVID.","Stefano, George B.",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.931447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633106/,721

The NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to play a temporal role during severe IAV immune responses, with early protective and later detrimental responses. However, the specific contribution of IL‐1β in modulating IAV disease in vivo is currently not well defined. Here, we identified that activation of NLRP3‐dependent IL‐1β responses occurs rapidly following HKx31 H3N2 infection, prior to the onset of severe IAV disease. Mature IL‐1β was detectable in vivo in both hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells. Significantly, therapeutic inhibition of IL‐1β in the airways with intranasal anti‐IL‐1β antibody treatment from day 3 postinfection, corresponding to the onset of clinical signs of disease, significantly prolonged survival and reduced inflammation in the airways. Importantly, early targeting of IL‐1β from day 1 postinfection also improved survival. Together, these studies specifically define a role for IL‐1β in contributing to the development of hyperinflammation and disease and indicate that targeting IL‐1β is a potential therapeutic strategy for severe IAV infections.","Bawazeer, Abdulah OS; Rosli, Sarah; Harpur, Christopher M; Docherty, Callum AH; Mansell, Ashley; Tate, Michelle D",Immunol Cell Biol,https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834544/,721
623461,Comparison of immunogenicity and reactogenicity of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected health care workers,2021-07-29,"Background: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is controversial for treating COVID-19 patients. We aimed to estimate pooled risks of mortality, disease severity, and hospitalization associated with ACEI/ARB use and stratify them by country and country clusters. Methods: We conducted a search in various databases through 4 July 2020 and then applied random-effects models to estimate pooled risks (OR(p)) across stratifications by country cluster. Clusters were chosen to reflect outbreak times (China followed by Korea/Italy, others subsequently) and mobility restrictions (China and Denmark/France/Spain with stricter lockdowns than the UK/US). Results: Overall analysis showed no increase in mortality; however, a statistical increase in mortality was seen in the US/UK cluster with OR(p) = 1.28 [95% CI = 1.04; 1.56] and a decrease in China with OR(p) = 0.65 [95% CI = 0.43; 0.96] and France with OR = 0.31 [95% CI = 0.14; 0.69]. Severity and hospitalization were not statistically significant in the analysis; however, several associations were seen in specific countries but not in country clusters. Conclusion: The country-cluster meta-analysis provided a reasonable explanation for COVID-19 mortality among ACEI/ARB users. The analysis did not explain differences in severity and suggested the involvement of other factors. Hospitalization findings among ACEI/ARB users may be considered informative as they may have been subjected to clinical decisions and hospital-bed availability.","Alamer, Ahmad A.; Almulhim, Abdulaziz S.; Alrashed, Ahmed A.; Abraham, Ivo",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525596/,721
623529,SARS-CoV-2 Assays To Detect Functional Antibody Responses That Block ACE2 Recognition in Vaccinated Animals and Infected Patients,2020-10-21,"A multiplex real-time PCR assay for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP181), Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae (CP-Arg), Legionella spp. (Pan-Leg), and the human RNase P (RNase P) gene was developed for rapid testing of atypical bacterial respiratory pathogens in clinical specimens. This method uses 4 distinct hydrolysis probes to detect 3 leading causes of community-acquired pneumonia. The assay was evaluated for specificity and sensitivity by testing against 35 related organisms, a dilution series of each specific target and 197 clinical specimens. Specificity testing demonstrated no cross-reactivity. A comparison to previously validated singleplex real-time PCR assays for each agent was also performed. The analytical sensitivity for specific pathogen targets in both the singleplex and multiplex was identical (50 fg), while efficiencies ranged from 82% to 97% for the singleplex assays and from 90% to 100% for the multiplex assay. The clinical sensitivity of the multiplex assay was improved for the Pan-Leg and CP-Arg targets when compared to the singleplex. The MP181 assay displayed equivalent performance. This multiplex assay provides an overall improvement in the diagnostic capability for these agents by demonstrating a sensitive, high-throughput and rapid method. This procedure may allow for a practical and efficient means to test respiratory clinical specimens for atypical pneumonia agents in health care settings and facilitate an appropriate public health response to outbreaks.","Thurman, Kathleen A.; Warner, Agnes K.; Cowart, Kelley C.; Benitez, Alvaro J.; Winchell, Jonas M.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21397428/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889310005493; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.11.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889310005493,721
623598,Age-related heterogeneity in Neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following BNT162b2 vaccination,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Returning university students represent large-scale, transient demographic shifts and a potential source of transmission to adjacent communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a non-random cohort of residents living in Centre County prior to the Fall 2020 term at the Pennsylvania State University and following the conclusion of the Fall 2020 term. We also report the seroprevalence in a non-random cohort of students collected at the end of the Fall 2020 term. FINDINGS: Of 345 community participants, 19 (5·5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at their first visit between 7 August and 2 October. Of 625 student participants who returned to campus for fall instruction, 195 (31·2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between 26 October and 23 November. Twenty-eight (8·1%) community participants returned a positive IgG antibody result by 9 December. Only contact with known SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and attendance at small gatherings (20–50 individuals) were significant predictors of detecting IgG antibodies among returning students (aOR, 95% CI: 3·24, 2·14–4·91; 1·62, 1·08–2·44; respectively). INTERPRETATION: Despite high seroprevalence observed within the student population, seroprevalence in a longitudinal cohort of community residents was low and stable from before student arrival for the Fall 2020 term to after student departure. The study implies that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can occur in geographically coincident populations.

623967,Evaluation of three commercial and two non-commercial immunoassays for the detection of prior infection to SARS-CoV-2,2021-07-01,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has an unpredictable clinical course, so prognostic biomarkers would be invaluable when triaging patients on admission to hospital. Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were consented. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Krebs von den Lungen 6, troponin, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, B-type natriuretic peptide, procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (C reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, National Early Warning Score (NEWS2), CURB-65 and radiographic severity score on initial chest radiograph were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission or death, with area under the curve (AUC) (figures calculated). RESULTS: 187 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.78), lymphocyte count (AUC: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.72) and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.77, 0.65 to 0.88) and suPAR (AUC: 0.81, 0.72 to 0.88) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS2 score (AUC: 0.70, 0.60 to 0.79) or age (AUC: 0.70, 0.62 to 0.77) performed nearly as well. DISCUSSION: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS2 score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should focus on the additive value of these biomarkers to routine care.","Arnold, David T; Attwood, Marie; Barratt, Shaney; Morley, Anna; Elvers, Karen T; McKernon, Jorgen; Donald, Charmaine; Oates, Adrian; Noel, Alan; MacGowan, Alasdair; Maskell, Nick A; Hamilton, Fergus W",Emerg Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021028/; https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210380,721

Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all children from 0 to 18 years of age presenting with an injury at the level 1 trauma centre of the University Clinic of Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery in Vienna during the lockdown from 16 March to 29 May 2020 compared to records over the same timeframe from 2015 to 2019. Results: In total, 14,707 patients with injuries were included. The lockdown did not lead to a significant decrease in fractures but, instead, yielded a highly significant increase in mild traumatic brain injuries when compared to all injuries that occurred (p = 0.082 and p = 0.0001) as well as acute injuries (excluding contusions, distortions and miscellaneous non-acute injuries) (p = 0.309 and p = 0.034). Conclusions: The percentage of paediatric fractures did not decrease at the level 1 trauma centre, and a highly significant proportional increase in paediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injuries was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. Therefore, medical resources should be maintained to treat paediatric trauma patients and provide neurological monitoring during pandemic lockdowns.","Payr, Stephan; Schuller, Andrea; Dangl, Theresia; Scheider, Philipp; Sator, Thomas; Chocholka, Britta; Jaindl, Manuela; Schwendenwein, Elisabeth; Tiefenboeck, Thomas M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071610/,721

We analysed 85 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals at acute and/or convalescent timepoints, up to 102 days post-symptom onset, quantifying 184 immunological parameters. Acute COVID-19 presented with high levels of IL-6, IL-18 and IL-10 and broad activation marked by upregulation of CD38 on innate and adaptive lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Importantly, activated CXCR3+cTFH1 cells in acute COVID-19 significantly correlate with and predict antibody levels and their avidity at convalescence as well as acute neutralisation activity. Strikingly, intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of soluble IL-6, IL-6R, IL-18, and hyperactivation of innate, adaptive and myeloid compartments than patients with moderate disease.

In this study, we compared the synonymous codon usage patterns between the nucleocapsid and spike genes of CoVs, and C-type lectin domain (CTLD) genes of human and mouse on the codon basis. Findings indicate that the nucleocapsid genes of CoVs were affected from the synonymous codon usage bias than spike genes, and the CTLDs of human and mouse partially overlapped with the nucleocapsid genes of CoVs. In addition, we observed that CTLDs which showed the similar relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) patterns with CoVs were commonly derived from the human chromosome 12, and mouse chromosome 6 and 12, suggesting that there might be a specific genomic region or chromosomes which show a more similar synonymous codon usage pattern with viral genes.

A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests. Methods In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other virus. Results In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, four had a sensitivity and specificity above 90% and 98% respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no tests showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response, and that anti-nucleocapside (anti-N) antibodies appeared earlier than the anti-spike (anti-S) proteins. Conclusions The identified SARS-CoV-2 serology tests may be used for the diagnostic of CoviD-19 for negative RT-PCR patients presenting severe to mild suggestive symptoms or particular clinical presentation.

We describe the strategies adopted to cope with the limitations imposed by the pandemic to the access to health care by patients diagnosed with idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational analysis including IPF patients under antifibrotic drugs (nintedanib and pirfenidone) that accessed to the Outpatient clinic of the University of Palermo, Italy. Patients received a phone number and an email address in case of any urgency and a virtual meeting was settled up monthly. RESULTS: 40 patients (M/F: 30/10) were followed up, 33 under nintedanib treatment, 7 under pirfenidone. Among patients under nintedanib, 1 patient reported high fever (T max 39 °C) and purulent sputum with no sign of infections, 1 had hemoptysis that was spontaneously resolved. 2 patients accessed to the emergency department for the worsening of dyspnea; 5 patients had diarrhea that resolved with symptomatic drugs in few days. 3 patients had an increase of alkaline phosphatase levels, leading to the withdrawal of the antifibrotic drug for 15 days, and subsequent normalization of the plasmatic levels. Among patients under pirfenidone, one subject had an increase of ferritin serum levels with no symptoms. The remaining subjects were in stable clinical conditions. None of the patients reported hospitalization or exacerbations, and did not experience antifibrotic withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate that by implementing alternative ways to monitor the disease, patients did not incur in increased rates of acute exacerbations or higher frequency of side effects and antifibrotic treatment withdrawal.","Benfante, Alida; Messina, Riccardo; Piccionello, Ilaria; Di Liberti, Rosangela; Principe, Stefania; Scichilone, Nicola",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S109455392100050X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2021.102038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109455392100050X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965569/,721

In this study, we assessed the applicability of change point analysis (CPA) for signal detection in vaccine safety surveillance. The performances of three CPA methods, namely Bayesian change point analysis, Taylor’s change point analysis (Taylor-CPA), and environmental time series change point detection (EnvCpt), were assessed via simulated data with assumptions for the baseline number of events and degrees of change. The analysis was validated using the Korea Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) database.

Mathematical models are important tools for estimating the impact of these interventions, for monitoring the current evolution of the epidemic at a national level and for estimating the potential long-term consequences of relaxation of measures. In this paper, we model the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium with a deterministic age-structured extended compartmental model. Our model takes special consideration for nursing homes which are modelled as separate entities from the general population in order to capture the specific delay and dynamics within these entities. The model integrates social contact data and is fitted on hospitalisations data (admission and discharge), on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths (with a distinction between general population and nursing home related deaths) and results from serological studies, with a sensitivity analysis based on a Bayesian approach. We present the situation as in November 2020 with the estimation of some characteristics of the COVID-19 deduced from the model. We also present several mid-term and long-term projections based on scenarios of reinforcement or relaxation of social contacts for different general sectors, with a lot of uncertainties remaining.","Franco, Nicolas",Epidemics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000414?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100490; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436521000414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482186/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03450v4.pdf,721

Among possible transmission routes, air transfer of the virus is thought to be prominent. To investigate this further, measurements were conducted at Razi hospital in Ahvaz, Iran, which was selected to treat COVID-19 severe cases in the Khuzestan province. Passive and active sampling methods were employed and compared with regard to their efficiency for collection of airborne SARS-COV-2 virus particles. Fifty one indoor air samples were collected in two areas, with distances of less than or equal to 1 m (patient room) and more than 3 m away (hallway and nurse station) from patient beds. A simulation method was used to obtain the virus load released by a regularly breathing or coughing individual including a range of microdroplet emissions. Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 11.76% (N=6) of all indoor air samples (N=51) collected in the COVID-19 ward tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, including 4 cases in patient rooms and 2 cases in the hallway. Also, 5 of the 6 positive cases were confirmed using active sampling methods with only 1 based on passive sampling. The results support airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols in indoor air.

This study examines the relationships between attitudes to mental illness, symptoms of common mental disorder and seeking-help and receiving medication for a mental health problem. METHODS: We used data from the nationally representative Health Survey for England 2014 to design three logistic regression models to test for the effects of attitudes to mental illness (measured by a shortened version of the Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill, CAMI scale) on: recent contact with a doctor for a mental health problem; use of any type of mental health service in the last 12 months; and having antidepressants currently prescribed, while controlling for symptoms of common mental disorder (measured by the General Health Questionnaire, GHQ). We also tested for an interaction between attitudes to mental illness and symptoms of common mental disorder on the outcomes. RESULTS: A significant but very small effect of CAMI score was found on ‘antidepressants currently prescribed’ model (OR = 1.01(1.00, 1.02) but not on the two indicators of help-seeking. We also found a significant but very small interaction between CAMI and GHQ scores on recent contact with a doctor (OR = 0.99, 95% CI (0.990, 0.998); adjusted Wald test P = 0.01)). Knowing someone with a mental illness had a significant positive effect on help-seeking indicated by: (a) recent contact with a doctor (2.65 (1.01, 6.98)) and (b) currently prescribed antidepressant (2.67 (1.9, 3.75)) after controlling for attitudes to mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that knowing someone with a mental health problem seems to have a further positive effect on help-seeking, beyond improving attitudes to mental illness. Furthermore, multiple different types and aspects of stigma may contribute to help-seeking behaviours, consequently multi-faceted approaches are likely to be most efficient.","Manescu, Elena A.; Robinson, Emily J.; Henderson, Claire",BMC Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02971-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272233/,721

Basing on the theoretical framework proposed by the Job Demands-Resources model, the purpose of this paper was to explore the effect of work overload (workload and techno overload), on behavioral stress, meant as an outcome linked to the health impairment process. Furthermore, the aim of the study was to explore the mediating role of job crafting, considered as a second-order construct consisting of two dimensions (increasing structural resources and increasing challenging demands) in the abovementioned relation. Participants were 530 workers experiencing remote working or work-from-home during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Italy (March–May 2020). Hypotheses were explored by using three different latent variables, measured reflexively through indicators on a 5-point scale, extracted from validated questionnaires. Data analysis was performed through Structural Equation Modeling; to test the mediation, bootstrap validation was computed (n = 2,000). Results showed that the mediation of job crafting was partial. More specifically, the direct effect between work overload and behavioral stress was positive; moreover, the indirect, negative effect through the mediation of job crafting was also significant. Therefore, results showed that job crafting can play a crucial role as a protective factor supporting the activation and adjustment of suitable resources; these resources can be useful to deal with the negative effects of work overload, particularly under the condition of heavy remote working and use of technologies, on individual outcomes. Starting from the current global scenario of the pandemic that has not yet ceased its effects, the study suggested decisive theoretical and practical implications. Accordingly, findings extended the current trends in occupational health psychology research, with special reference to the mainstream topic “work and COVID-19” in the Italian context. Finally, results can give suggestions to companies engaged in managing change, recommending that they build a collaborative workplace at the individual and collective level to implement job crafting interventions and enrich the personal and organizational resources of workers, which is useful cope with the current demands.","Ingusci, Emanuela; Signore, Fulvio; Giancaspro, Maria Luisa; Manuti, Amelia; Molino, Monica; Russo, Vincenzo; Zito, Margherita; Cortese, Claudio Giovanni",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912116/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.655148,721

We have identified the most variant sites on the whole genome as well as the stable, conserved ones on the S and N proteins. We found four mutations, S:D614G, NSP12b:P314L, NSP3:F106F, to be the most frequent ones that dominate the SARS-CoV-2 population outside of China. We detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters, indicating community spread. We emphasize that while SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, and the number of mutations from the reference sequence is increasing, we observe only little diversity in the new variants as we enter the later stages of the pandemic. Our analyses suggest we have diverged away from the current SARS-CoV-2 reference enough that the reference should be re-evaluated to represent the current viral population more accurately. We assert our work provides valuable information on the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its local dynamics in the Netherlands, especially for DNA-based diagnostic, therapeutic or vaccine development against COVID-19. We suggest sequence-based analyses should opt for a consensus representation to adequately cover the genomic variation observed.","Urhan, A.; Abeel, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.02.20224352v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.20224352,721

Subsequent growth of transdermal science proved prominent utility of transdermal systems meant for passive diffusion of the drug. It was followed by the development of iontophoresis- and sonophoresis-based transdermal delivery systems. Microneedle array has now caught attention of the investigators owing to its immense utility in transdermal delivery of very large molecules with ionic and hydrophilic nature. In this technical note, we present the current scenario, applications, and recent advances in microneedle array-based delivery of the most critical molecules through the skin. The application of microneedle has widely been investigated, and these technologies are being developed for the delivery of bio-therapeutics, bio-macromolecules, insulin, growth hormones, immunobiologicals, proteins, siRNA, and peptides. Potential of microneedles to transform the global transdermal market is highlighted in terms of the success rate of the microneedle technologies in clinical trials reaching to the global market. The arrival of the commercial microneedle-based products in the market is highly anticipated as they have potential to portray remarkable impact on clinical medicine in near future.","Halder, Jitu; Gupta, Sudhanshu; Kumari, Rakhi; Gupta, Ghanshyam Das; Rai, Vineet Kumar",J Pharm Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837607/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12247-020-09460-2,721

We investigated if the association of diabetes and COVID‐19 severity may be mediated by inflammation. We also hypothesized that this increased risk may extend to prediabetes. Hospitalized patients in Singapore with COVID‐19 were subdivided into three groups in a retrospective cohort: normoglycemia (HbA1c: ≤5.6%), prediabetes (HbA1c: 5.7%–6.4%) and diabetes (HbA1c: ≥6.5%). The primary outcome of severe COVID‐19 was defined by respiratory rate ≥30, SpO2 ≤93% or intensive care unit admission. The association between clinical factors on severe COVID‐19 outcome was analyzed by cox regression. Adjusted mediation analysis of C‐reactive protein (CRP) on the relationship between diabetes and severe COVID‐19 was performed. Of 1042 hospitalized patients, mean age 39 ± 11 years, 13% had diabetes, 9% prediabetes and 78% normoglycemia. Severe COVID‐19 occurred in 4.9% of subjects. Compared to normoglycemia, diabetes was significantly associated with severe COVID‐19 on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54–17.84; p < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.92–8.31; p < .001), while prediabetes was not a risk factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.22–4.03; p = .929). CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, mediated 32.7% of the total association between diabetes and severe COVID‐19 outcome. In conclusion, CRP is a partial mediator of the association between diabetes and severe COVID‐19 infection, confirming that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID‐19 in diabetes.","Koh, Huilin; Moh, Angela Mei Chung; Yeoh, Ester; Lin, Yi; Low, Serena Kiat Mun; Ooi, Say Tat; Tan, Seng Kiong; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527464/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26837,721

The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the family cluster patients were analysed and compared with those of 43 contemporaneous sporadic cases. The three index cases transmitted the infection to 28 family members 2–10 days before illness onset. Overall, 28 of the 41 sporadic cases and three of 31 patients in the family clusters came back from Wuhan (65.12 vs. 9.68%, P< 0.001). In terms of epidemiological characters and clinical symptoms, no significant differences were observed between the family cluster and sporadic cases. However, the lymphocyte counts of sporadic cases were significantly lower than those of family cluster cases ((1.32 ± 0.55) × 10(9)/l vs. (1.63 ± 0.70) × 10(9)/l, P = 0.037), and the proportion of hypoalbuminaemia was higher in sporadic cases (18/43, 41.86%) than in the family clusters (6/31, 19.35%) (P < 0.05). Within the family cluster, the second- and third-generation cases had milder clinical manifestations, without severe conditions, compared with the index and first-generation cases, indicating that the virulence gradually decreased following passage through generations within the family clusters.

In Mexico, an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea, characterized by 100 % mortality in piglets, began in March 2014 in the State of Mexico. METHODS: The aim of this study was to confirm and identify porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in samples from piglets with suggestive clinical signs using virological, histological, and molecular techniques. Necropsy was performed on 13 piglets from two litters with initial and advanced clinical signs. Suggestive lesions of acute infection with PEDV were detected in histological sections of the small and large bowels; specifically, multiple virus particles with visible crown-shaped projections were observed using electron microscopy and negative staining. Viral isolation was performed in Vero cells with trypsin. Infection was monitored by observation of cytopathic effect, and titration was determined by TCID(50)/ml. The presence of the PEDV in cultures and clinical samples was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of a 651-bp segment of the S glycoprotein gene, as well as a 681-bp matrix protein gene. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence analysis of the Mexican isolates showed marked homology to viruses that circulated in 2013 in Colorado, USA.

After the Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014–2015, there was need to strengthen IDSR to ensure prompt detection and response to epidemic-prone diseases. We describe the processes, successes and challenges of revitalizing public health surveillance in a country recovering from a protracted Ebola virus disease outbreak. METHODS: The revitalization process began with adaptation of the revised IDSR guidelines and development of customized guidelines to suit the health care systems in Sierra Leone. Public health experts defined data flow, system operations, case definitions, frequency and channels of reporting and dissemination. Next, phased training of IDSR focal persons in each health facility and the distribution of data collection and reporting tools was done. Monitoring activities included periodic supportive supervision and data quality assessments. Rapid response teams were formed to investigate and respond to disease outbreak alerts in all districts. RESULTS: Submission of reports through the IDSR system began in mid-2015 and by the 35th epidemiologic week, all district health teams were submitting reports. The key performance indicators measuring the functionality of the IDSR system in 2016 and 2017 were achieved (WHO Africa Region target ≥80%); the annual average proportion of timely weekly health facility reports submitted to the next level was 93% in 2016 and 97% in 2017; the proportion of suspected outbreaks and public health events detected through the IDSR system was 96% (n = 87) in 2016 and 100% (n = 85) in 2017. CONCLUSION: With proper planning, phased implementation and adequate investment of resources, it is possible to establish a functional IDSR system in a country recovering from a public health crisis. A functional IDSR system requires well trained workforce, provision of the necessary tools and guidelines, information, communication and technology infrastructure to support data transmission, provision of timely feedback as well as logistical support.

From a theoretical standpoint, the recessions-total factor productivity (TFP) nexus is ambiguous à priori. This paper empirically examines the dynamic impact of recessions on TFP. We compute a new measure of utilization-adjusted productivity from a sample of 24 industries in 18 advanced economies between 1970 and 2014. Resorting to the local projection method we trace out the dynamic short to medium-term impact of such recessionary shocks. We find that deep recessions lead to a permanent deterioration in the level of total factor productivity.

The implications of the strategies implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission on other infectious diseases are unclear. We aimed to appraise trends in the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacteriosis in Israel during COVID-19 pandemic. Positive stool samples for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter are reported on a monthly basis to the Israel Center for Disease Control from sentinel laboratories, within the framework of a surveillance network of bacterial culture-proven enteric diseases. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 of shigellosis, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis were calculated. Mean rates before and after the local onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel were compared and Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) was calculated. Joinpoint was used to evaluate secular trends. The mean age-adjusted incidence rate of shigellosis in March–July 2020 was lower than the rate observed in March–July 2018–2019 (RRR = 86.6%), but also decreased for salmonellosis (RRR = 33.0%) and campylobacteriosis (RRR = 30.0%). Using Joinpoint we have shown that the decrease observed for shigellosis was significantly sharper (Annual Percent Change (APC) = −77.7) between February 2020 and May 2020 than for salmonellosis (APC = −14.0) between July 2019 and April 2020 and for campylobacteriosis (APC = −1.1) between January 2018 and July 2020. The preventive measures applied to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing and hand washing, were ecologically associated with a decreased risk of bacterial enteric diseases in Israel.

636826,SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization by South African COVID-19 donor plasma,2021-01-19,"Herd immunity is the most critical and essential prophylactic intervention that delivers protection against infectious diseases at both the individual and community level. This process of natural vaccination is immensely pertinent to the current context of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection around the globe. The conventional idea of herd immunity is based on efficient transmission of pathogens and developing natural immunity within a population. This is entirely encouraging while fighting against any disease in pandemic circumstances. A spatial community is occupied by people having variable resistance capacity against a pathogen. Protection efficacy against once very common diseases like smallpox, poliovirus or measles has been possible only because of either natural vaccination through contagious infections or expanded immunization programs among communities. This has led to achieving herd immunity in some cohorts. The microbiome plays an essential role in developing the body’s immune cells for the emerging competent vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. Frequency of interaction among microbiota, metabolic nutrients and individual immunity preserve the degree of vaccine effectiveness against several pathogens. Microbiome symbiosis regulates pathogen transmissibility and the success of vaccination among different age groups. Imbalance of nutrients perturbs microbiota and abrogates immunity. Thus, a particular population can become vulnerable to the infection. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to environmental enteropathy (EE). As a consequence, the generation of herd immunity can either be delayed or not start in a particular cohort. Moreover, disparities of the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries outside of developed countries are due to inconsistencies of healthy microbiota among the individuals.

However, there are no vaccines or specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, there is an urgent need for advancing novel therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene saponine, is valuable for its various biological functions and pharmacology effects. In this brief article, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of glycyrrhizin for COVID-19 from the perspective of its pharmacological action including binding angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular ROS, inhibiting thrombin, inhibiting the hyperproduction of airway exudates, and inducing endogenous interferon.","LuoLiu, PanDong; Li, Juan",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335281/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301539; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105995; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301539?v=s5,721

The rapid emergence of these viruses has demonstrated the need for good models to study severe CoV respiratory infection and pathogenesis. There are, currently, different methods and models for the study of CoV disease. The available genetic methods for the study and evaluation of CoV genetics are reviewed here. There are several animal models, both mouse and alternative animals, for the study of severe CoV respiratory disease that have been examined, each with different pros and cons relative to the actual pathogenesis of the disease in humans. A current limitation of these models is that no animal model perfectly recapitulates the disease seen in humans. Through the review and analysis of the available disease models, investigators can employ the most appropriate available model to study various aspects of CoV pathogenesis and evaluate possible antiviral treatments that may potentially be successful in future treatment and prevention of severe CoV respiratory infections.","McGruder, Brenna; Leibowitz, Julian L.",Journal of General Virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.069732-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252685/,721

637585,Age differences in the association of comorbid burden with adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2,2021-07-06,"IQOS, the leading heated tobacco product globally, recently received ‘reduced exposure’ authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Independent research focusing on IQOS marketing and potential impact on consumers’ perceptions and behavior, and ultimately public health, is critical. The literature to date has underscored several concerns. First, Philip Morris’s (PM’s) marketing distribution requires scrutiny, particularly given its innovative promotional strategies. For example, IQOS is distributed via unique points-of-sale (POS; e.g., specialty and pop-up stores, “corners” in convenience stores) and uses various other opportunities (e.g., social media, sponsored events, direct-to-consumer). Second, although PM claims that IQOS’ target market is current combustible tobacco users and not young people, the literature indicates that in some populations, IQOS use is equally prominent among smokers and nonsmokers, and that specific subgroups (e.g., young adults, women) are targeted. Third, the impact of IQOS’ use of ad content promoting IQOS health benefits must be studied (e.g., how consumers interpret modified exposure messages). In conclusion, surveillance of IQOS marketing, particularly following reduced exposure authorization, is critical for obtaining valuable data to estimate population impact, particularly among population subgroups (e.g., young adults), and inform future tobacco regulation. These considerations have implications beyond IQOS—to other products and companies.","Berg, Carla J.; Abroms, Lorien C.; Levine, Hagai; Romm, Katelyn F.; Khayat, Amal; Wysota, Christina N.; Duan, Zongshuan; Bar-Zeev, Yael",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639851/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910551,721
637676,Viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the predictive value of repeat testing,2020,"BACKGROUND Primary health care providers (PHCPs) are assumed to be at high risk of a COVID-19 infection, as they are exposed to patients with usually less personal protective equipment (PPE) than other frontline health care workers (HCWs). Nevertheless, current research efforts focussed on the assessment of COVID-19 seroprevalence rates in the general population or hospital HCWs. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine the seroprevalence in PHCPs during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave in Flanders (Belgium) and compared it to the seroprevalence in the general population. We also assessed risk factors, availability of PPE and attitudes towards the government guidelines over time. METHODS A prospective cohort of PHCPs (n = 698), mainly general practitioners, was asked to complete a questionnaire and self-sample capillary blood by finger-pricking at five distinct points in time (June-December 2020). We analysed the dried blood spots for IgG antibodies using a Luminex multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS The seroprevalence of PHCPs remained stable between June and September (4.6-5.0%), increased significantly from October to December (8.1-13.4%) and was significantly higher than the seroprevalence of the general population. The majority of PHCPs were concerned about becoming infected, had adequate PPE and showed increasing confidence in government guidelines. CONCLUSIONS The marked increase in seroprevalence during the second COVID-19 wave shows that PHCPs were more at risk during the second wave compared to the first wave in Flanders. This increase was only slightly higher in PHCPs than in the general population suggesting that the occupational health measures implemented provided sufficient protection when managing patients.","Mariën, Joachim; Ceulemans, Ann; Bakokimi, Diana; Lammens, Christine; Ieven, Margareta; Heytens, Stefan; De Sutter, An; Verbakel, Jan Y; Van den Bruel, Ann; Goossens, Herman; Van Damme, Pierre; Ariën, Kevin K; Coenen, Samuel",Family practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34448859/; https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab094,721

Due to the emergence of a large number of 3D printed face shield designs and community-led PPE printing initiatives, this case study examines the methods and design best optimized for community printers who may not have the resources or experience to conduct such a thorough analysis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the optimization of the production of 3D printed face shields by community 3D printers, as part of an initiative aimed at producing PPE for healthcare workers. The face shield frames were manufactured using the 3DVerkstan design and were coupled with an acetate sheet to assemble a complete face shield. Rigorous quality assurance and decontamination protocols ensured community-printed PPE was satisfactory for healthcare use. CONCLUSION: Additive manufacturing is a promising method of producing adequate face shields for frontline health workers because of its versatility and quick up-start time. The optimization of stacking and sanitization protocols allowed 3D printing to feasibly supplement formal public health responses in the face of a global pandemic.","Zhang, Peter Chengming; Ahmed, Yousuf; Hussein, Isra M.; Afenu, Edem; Feasson, Manon; Daud, Anser",3D Print Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230665/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41205-020-00089-y,721

The current study examined gender differences due to the pandemic-resultant-lockdown in psychiatric symptomatology (depression, anxiety, and somatization), coping strategies, levels of resilience, and belief in a just world (BJW). One-thousand-and-sixty-five Israeli adults (309 men and 756 women) were interviewed online during the time Israel was under its first mandatory lockdown (March 2020). Results indicated higher levels of anxiety, depression, and somatization among women (t (635.238) = -8.86, p < .001; t (606.414) = -5.31, p < .001; t (743.856) = -6.80; p < .001; respectively). More women stopped working due to the lockdown (Z = 2.08, p = .037), and fewer women reported their jobs being considered ""essential"" (Z = 2.76, p = .006). Women were more concerned than men regarding the health of others (t (1063) = -2.71, p = .007) and regarding finances (t (1062) = -2.99, p = .003), but no gender differences were found regarding concerns for one's own health. Women used more coping tactics, both emotion-focused (t (1062) = -8.20, p < .001) and problem-focused (t (1062) = -5.21, p < .001), than did men. Higher levels of resilience (t (1057) = 3.11, p = .002) and BJW (t (1047) = 5.19, p < .001) were found among men than among women. Being a woman, younger age, use of emotion-focused coping, lower levels of resilience, worries about the economic situation, and worries about family members' health explained 43% of the variance in psychological distress. No significant interactions between gender, study variables, and psychological distress were found. These findings indicate that gender differences in psychological reactions may be due to the heavier toll taken by the pandemic and lockdown on the lives of women rather than to gender differences in coping tactics or resilience.","Laufer, Avital; Bitton-Shechory, Mally",Women & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2021.1970083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445941/,721

TARGIT–intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may offer a viable alternative to improve radiation treatment efficiency and alleviate hospital patient loads. The Breast Care Unit in Johannesburg became the first facility in Africa to offer TARGIT-IORT, and the purpose of this study was to present a retrospective review of patients receiving IORT at this center between November 2017 and May 2020. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patient selection criteria were based mainly on the latest American Society of Radiation Oncology guidelines. Selection criteria included early-stage breast carcinoma (luminal A) and luminal B with negative upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy that negated external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Patient characteristics, reasons for choosing IORT, histology, and use of oncoplastic surgery that resulted in complications were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred seven patients successfully received IORT/TARGIT-IORT. Mean age was 60.8 years (standard deviation, 9.3 years). A total of 73.8% of patients presented with luminal A, 15.0% with luminal B, and 5.6% with triple-negative cancer. One patient who presented with locally advanced breast cancer (T4N2) opted for IORT as a boost in addition to planned EBRT. Eighty-seven patients underwent wide local excision (WLE) with mastopexy, and 12 underwent WLE with parenchymal. Primary reasons for selecting IORT/TARGIT-IORT were distance from the hospital (43.9%), choice (40.2%), and age (10.3%). CONCLUSION: This retrospective study of IORT/TARGIT-IORT performed in Africa confirms its viability, with low complication rates and no detrimental effects with breast conservation, resulting in positive acceptance and the potential to reduce Oncology Center patient loads. Limitations of the study include the fact that only short-term data on local recurrence were available.

Unregulated complement activation is likely to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by highly pathogenic virus including influenza A viruses H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. In highly pathogenic virus-induced acute lung diseases, high levels of chemotactic and anaphylatoxic C5a were produced as a result of excessive complement activaiton. Overproduced C5a displays powerful biological activities in activation of phagocytic cells, generation of oxidants, and inflammatory sequelae named “cytokine storm”, and so on.

We report here the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had received resveratrol and copper. Methods & Findings Our analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April 1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care, resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every 6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies, and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020. The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7/30 (23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI 1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267) were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death. There was a trend towards reduction in death in patients receiving resveratrol-copper (OR 0.413, 95% CI 0.164-1.039, P= 0.0604). Conclusions We provide preliminary results of a novel approach to the treatment of severe COVID-19 using a combination of small amounts of commonly used nutraceuticals, which is non-toxic and inexpensive, and therefore could be widely accessible globally. The nearly two-fold reduction in mortality with resveratrol-copper observed in our study needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.","Mittra, I.; de Souza, R.; Bhadade, R.; Madke, T.; Shankpal, P.

We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day).

Strained healthcare providers make difficult decisions on patient triage, treatment and care management on a daily basis. Policy makers have imposed social distancing measures to slow the disease, at a steep economic price. We design analytical tools to support these decisions and combat the pandemic. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to reallocate ventilators and alleviate shortages.

Despite their promising performance, these trackers are less effective in perceiving the target information in the following two aspects. First, existing regression models cannot take a global view of a large-scale target since the effective receptive field of a neuron is too small to cover the target with a large scale. Second, the neurons with a fixed receptive field (RF) size in these models cannot adapt to the scale and aspect ratio changes of the target. In this paper, we propose an adaptive ensemble perception tracking framework to address these issues. Specifically, we first construct a per-pixel prediction model, which predicts the target state at each pixel of the correlated feature. On top of the per-pixel prediction model, we then develop a confidence-guided ensemble prediction mechanism. The ensemble mechanism adaptively fuses the predictions of multiple pixels with the guidance of confidence maps, which enlarges the perception range and enhances the adaptive perception ability at the object-level. In addition, we introduce a receptive field adaption model to enhance the adaptive perception ability at the neuron-level, which adjusts the RF by adaptively integrating the features with different RFs. Extensive experimental results on the VOT2018, VOT2016, UAV123, LaSOT, and TC128 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.","Zhou, Zikun; Fan, Nana; Yang, Kai; Wang, Hongpeng; He, Zhenyu",Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082287/,721

We aimed to develop a risk score model for in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that was robust across hospitals and used clinical factors that are readily available and measured standardly across hospitals. In this retrospective observational study, we developed a risk score model using data collected by trained abstractors for patients in 20 diverse hospitals across the state of Michigan (Mi-COVID19) who were discharged between March 5, 2020 and August 14, 2020. Patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during hospitalization or were discharged with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) were included. We employed an iterative forward selection approach to consider the inclusion of 145 potential risk factors available at hospital presentation. Model performance was externally validated with patients from 19 hospitals in the Mi-COVID19 registry not used in model development. We shared the model in an easy-to-use online application that allows the user to predict in-hospital mortality risk for a patient if they have any subset of the variables in the final model. Two thousand one hundred and ninety-three patients in the Mi-COVID19 registry met our inclusion criteria.

While periodically, alternatives such as government prizes, direct purchases or development, and limits on certain incentives have been proposed, the basic approach has remained intact since the 1980s, with incremental provisions addressing specific gaps and priorities, and adding provisions for biosimilar entry. This paper reviews the main elements of the current US system to financing drug innovation and its approach to balancing multiple objectives. In addition, the system for financing drug innovation must be effective over a wide range of potential scientific approaches and economic conditions. It should be predictable for investors and payers making long-term development and coverage decisions, while also encompassing unanticipated new treatment modalities and scientific progress.

Nanomedicines have an advantage of providing enhanced permeability and retention and have been extensively studied as targeted drug delivery strategies for the treatment of different disease. The role of monocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and macrophages in diseases, including infectious and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and atherosclerosis, are better understood and have resulted in improved strategies for targeting and in some instances mimicking these cell types to improve therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, these primary cell types can be exploited for the purposes of serving as a “Trojan horse” for targeted delivery to identified organs and sites of inflammation.

Molecular detection methods were applied to identify a broad range of bacterial and viral pathogens in a large set of bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples. The patterns of detected pathogens were correlated to the clinical symptoms. METHODS: BAL fluid samples and clinical data were collected from 573 hospitalized children between 1 month and 14 years of age with LRTIs, enrolled from January to December 2018. Pathogens were detected using standardized clinical diagnostics, with a sensitive, high-throughput GeXP-based multiplex PCR and with multiplex qPCR. Data were analyzed to describe the correlation between the severity of respiratory tract disease and the pathogens identified. RESULTS: The pathogen detection rate with GeXP-based PCR and multiplex qPCR was significantly higher than by clinical routine diagnostics (76.09% VS 36.13%,χ(2) = 8.191, P = 0.004). The most frequently detected pathogens in the BAL fluid were human adenovirus (HADV)(21.82%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (20.24%), human rhinovirus (13.96%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.90%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.90%). In 16.4% of the cases co-detection with two or three different pathogens was found. Viral detection rates declined with age, while atypical pathogen detection rates increased with age. Oxygen supply in the HADV and Influenza H1N1 infected patients was more frequent (49.43%) than in patients infected with other pathogens. CONCLUSION: Broad range detection of viral and bacterial pathogens using molecular methods is a promising and implementable approach to improve clinical diagnosis and accurate treatment of LRTI in children.

For this reason, we aimed to collect data on intimate partner violence over the last year, comparing data reported by victims with data collected by help professionals. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, through keywords related to abuse, pandemic and containment measures, 3174 articles were identified for screening. After full-text reading and risk of bias analysis, 19 studies were included, and a thematic synthesis was conducted according to two categories: “studies with victims” and “studies with help professionals”. The results of the present review showed that there were significant differences between the data provided by victims and the data collected by health care facilities and police departments; additionally, differences among different forms and severity of victimization emerged. The results have been discussed according to the literature; in particular, we reflected on how containment measures have apparently made it more difficult for victims to report, thus making the existence of the dark figure of crime even more salient.","Lausi, Giulia; Pizzo, Alessandra; Cricenti, Clarissa; Baldi, Michela; Desiderio, Rita; Giannini, Anna Maria; Mari, Emanuela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201161/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126204,721

641808,"The isolation period should be longer: Lesson from a child infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 in Chongqing, China",2020-04-03,"Ribophorins I and II are type I transmembrane glycoproteins of the ER that are segregated to the rough domains of this organelle. Both ribophorins appear to be part of the translocation apparatus for nascent polypeptides that is associated with membrane-bound ribosomes and participate in the formation of a proteinaceous network within the ER membrane that also includes other components of the translocation apparatus. The ribophorins are both highly stable proteins that lack O- linked sugars but each contains one high mannose N-linked oligosaccharide that remains endo H sensitive throughout their lifetimes. We have previously shown (Tsao, Y. S., N. E. Ivessa, M. Adesnik, D. D. Sabatini, and G. Kreibich. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 116:57- 67) that a COOH-terminally truncated variant of ribophorin I that contains only the first 332 amino acids of the luminal domain (RI332), when synthesized in permanent transformants of HeLa cells, undergoes a rapid degradation with biphasic kinetics in the ER itself and in a second, as yet unidentified nonlysosomal pre-Golgi compartment. We now show that in cells treated with brefeldin A (BFA) RI332 molecules undergo rapid O-glycosylation in a multistep process that involves the sequential addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and terminal sialic acid residues. Addition of O-linked sugars affected all newly synthesized RI332 molecules and was completed soon after synthesis with a half time of about 10 min. In the same cells, intact ribophorins I and II also underwent O-linked glycosylation in the presence of BFA, but these molecules were modified only during a short time period immediately after their synthesis was completed, and the modification affected only a fraction of the newly synthesized polypeptides. More important, these molecules synthesized before the addition of BFA were not modified by O-glycosylation. The same is true for ribophorin I when overexpressed in HeLa cells although it is significantly less stable than the native polypeptide in control cells. We, therefore, conclude that soon after their synthesis, ribophorins lose their susceptibility to the relocated Golgi enzymes that effect the O-glycosylation, most likely as a consequence of a conformational change in the ribophorins that occurs during their maturation, although it cannot be excluded that rapid integration of these molecules into a supramolecular complex in the ER membrane leads to their inaccessibility to these enzymes.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1577870/,721

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 94 WP-serving venues surrounding Tehran and Ardabil metropolitans in Iran. Convenience sampling was applied to select 900 current WP smokers [508 (56%) FWT-only and 392 (44%) non-FWT-only smokers] aged 18 years and older. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the independent characteristics of FWT and non-FWT smokers. Compared to non-FWT smokers, FWT smokers were younger (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87–0.90) and more likely to have ≥ 1 sibling who smoked WP (AOR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.06–2.24), share WP with others (AOR=2.52, 95% CI: 1.68–3.77), report current cigarette smoking (AOR=2.05, 95% CI: 1.23–3.42), and report confidence in quitting at any time (AOR=3.64, 95% CI: 2.45–5.39). FWT smokers were less likely to have seen (AOR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.27–0.60) or read (AOR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.24–0.80) warning messages on WP tobacco packages relative to non-FTW smokers. The most common self-reported reason for smoking WP was entertainment for both groups, followed by stress relief for non-FWT smokers and the escape from loneliness for FWT smokers. FWT-only smokers differ from non-FWT-only smokers in several aspects including being younger, having more positive beliefs and perceptions regarding WP use, and having higher cigarette smoking prevalence. These findings will help in developing more effective and targeted policies and cessation interventions for WP smokers according to flavor type they use, especially in the Middle East.","Ebrahimi Kalan, Mohammad; Abazari, Malek; Ben Taleb, Ziyad; Adham, Davoud; Abbasi, Abbas; Bursac, Zoran; Ward, Kenneth D; Cobb, Caroline O; Behaleh, Raed; Wipfli, Heather Lynn; Fazlzadeh, Mehdi",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14706-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089452/,721

642380,Presepsin in risk stratification of SARS-CoV-2 patients,2020-04-22,"Since its introduction in December of 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, has rapidly spread across the world. Whilst vaccines are being rolled out, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain the most important tools for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Quantifying the impact of these measures as well as determining what settings are prone to instigating (super)spreading events is important for informed and safe reopening of spaces and the targeting of interventions. Mathematical models can help decipher the complex interactions that underlie virus transmission. Currently, most mathematical models developed during the COVID-19 epidemic evaluate interventions at national or subnational levels. Smaller scales of transmission, such as at the level of indoor spaces, have received less attention, despite the central role they play in both transmission and control. Models that do act on this scale use simplified descriptions of human behavior, impeding a valid quantitative analysis of the impact of interventions on transmission in indoor spaces, particularly those that aim for physical distancing. To more accurately predict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a pedestrian environment, we introduce a model that links pedestrian movement and choice dynamics with SARS-CoV-2 spreading models. The objective of this paper is to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor spaces as it arises from human interactions and assess the relative impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions thereon. We developed a world-wide unique combined Pedestrian Dynamics - Virus Spread model (PeDViS model), which combines insights from pedestrian modelling, epidemiology, and IT-design. In particular, an expert-driven activity assignment model is coupled with the microscopic simulation model (Nomad) and a virus spread model (QVEmod). We first describe the non-linear relationships between the risks of exposure to the virus and the duration, distance, and context of human interactions. We compared virus exposure relative to a benchmark contact (1.5meters for 15 minutes): a threshold often used by public health agencies to determine at risk contacts. We discuss circumstances under which individuals that adhere to common distancing measures may nevertheless be at risk. Specifically, we illustrate the stark increase in exposure at shorter distances, as well as longer contact durations. These risks increase when the infected individual was present in the space before the interaction occurred, as a result of buildup of virus in the environment. The latter is particularly true in poorly ventilated spaces and highlights the importance of good ventilation to prevent potential virus exposure through indirect transmission routes. Combining intervention tools that target different routes of transmission can aid in accumulating impact. We use face masks as an example, which are particularly effective at reducing virus spread that is not affected by ventilation. We then demonstrate the use of PeDViS using a simple restaurant case study, focussing on transmission between guests. In this setting the exposure risk to individuals that are not seated at the same table is limited, but guests seated at nearby tables are estimated to experience exposure risks that surpass that of the benchmark contact. These risks are larger in low ventilation scenarios. Lastly, we illustrate that the impact of intervention measures on the number of new infections heavily depends on the relative efficiency of the direct and indirect transmission routes considered. This uncertainty should be considered when assessing the risks of transmission upon different types of human interactions in indoor spaces. The PeDViS case study shows the multi-dimensionality of SARS-CoV-2 that emerges from the interplay of human behaviour and the spread of respiratory viruses in indoor spaces. A modelling strategy that incorporates this in risk assessments can be an important tool to inform policy makers and citizens. It can empower them to make better design and policy decisions pertaining to the most effective use of measures to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and safely open up indoor spaces.","Duives, D.; Chang, Y.; Sparnaaij, M.; Wouda, B.; Boschma, D.; Liu, Y.; Yuan, Y.; Daamen, W.; de Jong, M.

We aimed to analyze the risk factors and the incidence of thrombosis from patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL/METHODS: Eighty-eight inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were reported (31 critical cases, 33 severe cases, and 24 common cases). The thrombosis risk factor assessment, laboratory results, ultrasonographic findings, and prognoses of these patients were analyzed, and compared among groups with different severity. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 88 cases developed DVT (12 critical cases, 7 severe cases, and no common cases). In addition, among the 18 patients who died, 5 were diagnosed with DVT. Positive correlations were observed between the increase in D-dimer level (≥5 ≤g/mL) and the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia (r=0.679, P<0.01), and between the high Padua score (≥4) and the severity (r=0.799, P<0.01). In addition, the CRP and LDH levels on admission had positive correlations with the severity of illness (CRP: r=0.522, P<0.01; LDH: r=0.600, P<0.01). A negative correlation was observed between the lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of illness (r=−0.523, P<0.01). There was also a negative correlation between the lymphocyte count on admission and mortality in critical patients (r=−0.499, P<0.01). Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that the occurrence of DVT was positively correlated with disease severity (crude odds ratio: 3.643, 95% CI: 1.218–10.896, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our report illustrates that critically or severely ill patients have an associated high D-dimer value and high Padua score, and illustrates that a low threshold to screen for DVT may help improve detection of thromboembolism in these groups of patients, especially in asymptomatic patients. Our results suggest that early administration of prophylactic anticoagulant would benefit the prognosis of critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and would likely reduce thromboembolic rates.","Wang, Wenyu; Sun, Qingfeng; Bao, Yongxia; Liang, Ming; Meng, Qingwei; Chen, Hong; Li, Jianing; Wang, Hongliang; Li, Huiqing; Shi, Ying; Li, Zhaoguo; Wang, Xinyan; Zhao, Shuai; Wang, Hongwei; Xiao, Jinling; Chen, Liyan; Zheng, Yan; Wang, Di; Han, Kaiyu",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.929708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839733/,721

As symptoms are usually mild and seroconversion occurs at low frequencies, it remains unclear whether children significantly contribute to community transmission. Several hypotheses try to explain age-related differences in disease presentation and severity. Possible reasons for milder presentations in children as compared to adults include frequent contact to seasonal coronaviruses, presence of cross-reactive antibodies, and/or co-clearance with other viruses. Increased expression of ACE2 in young people may facilitate virus infection, while limiting inflammation and reducing the risk of severe disease.

CREST2 is comparing intensive medical management alone versus intensive medical management plus revascularization with endarterectomy or stenting. We performed a study to evaluate the feasibility of a home-based program for testing blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in CREST2. METHODS: This study involved 45 patients at 10 sites in the CREST2 trial. The initial patients were identified by the Medical Management Core (MMC) as high-risk patients defined by stage 2 hypertension, LDL > 90 mg/dl, or both. If a patient at the site declined participation, another was substituted. All patients who agreed to participate were sent a BP monitoring device and a commercially available at-home lipid test kit that uses a self-performed finger-stick blood sample that was resulted to the patient. Training on the use of the equipment and obtaining the risk factor results was done by the study coordinator by telephone. RESULTS: Ten of the 130 currently active CREST2 sites participated, 8 in the LDL portion and 5 in the BP portion (3 sites did both). Twenty-six BP devices and 23 lipid tests were sent to patients. Of the 26 patients who obtained BP readings with the devices, 9 were out of the study target and adjustments in BP medications were made in 3. Of the 23 patients sent LDL tests, 13 were able to perform the test showing 7 were out of target, leading to adjustments in lipid medications in 4. CONCLUSION: This study established the feasibility of at-home monitoring of BP and LDL in a clinical trial and identified implementation challenges prior to widespread use in the trial.

METHODS: The authors queried the New York University Langone Medical Center's records for hospitalized patients who were polymerase chain reaction–positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV‐2) and performed chart reviews on patients with cancer diagnoses to identify patients with active cancer and patients with a history of cancer. Descriptive statistics were calculated and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations between clinical, demographic, and laboratory characteristics with outcomes, including death and admission to the intensive care unit. RESULTS: A total of 4184 hospitalized SARS CoV‐2+ patients, including 233 with active cancer, were identified. Patients with active cancer were more likely to die than those with a history of cancer and those without any cancer history (34.3% vs 27.6% vs 20%, respectively; P < .01). In multivariable regression among all patients, active cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; CI, 1.34‐2.67; P < .01), older age (OR, 1.06; CI, 1.05‐1.06; P < .01), male sex (OR for female vs male, 0.70; CI, 0.58‐0.84; P < .01), diabetes (OR, 1.26; CI, 1.04‐1.53; P = .02), morbidly obese body mass index (OR, 1.87; CI, 1.24‐2.81; P < .01), and elevated D‐dimer (OR, 6.41 for value >2300; CI, 4.75‐8.66; P < .01) were associated with increased mortality. Recent cancer‐directed medical therapy was not associated with death in multivariable analysis. Among patients with active cancer, those with a hematologic malignancy had the highest mortality rate in comparison with other cancer types (47.83% vs 28.66%; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that patients with an active cancer diagnosis were more likely to die from COVID‐19. Those with hematologic malignancies were at the highest risk of death. Patients receiving cancer‐directed therapy within 3 months before hospitalization had no overall increased risk of death. LAY SUMMARY: Our investigators found that hospitalized patients with active cancer were more likely to die from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) than those with a history of cancer and those without any cancer history. Patients with hematologic cancers were the most likely among patients with cancer to die from COVID‐19. Patients who received cancer therapy within 3 months before hospitalization did not have an increased risk of death.","Fu, Chen; Stoeckle, James H.; Masri, Lena; Pandey, Abhishek; Cao, Meng; Littman, Dalia; Rybstein, Marissa; Saith, Sunil E.; Yarta, Kinan; Rohatgi, Abhinav; Makarov, Danil V.; Sherman, Scott E.; Morrissey, Christy; Jordan, Alexander C.; Razzo, Beatrice; Theprungsirikul, Poy; Tsai, Joseph; Becker, Daniel J.",Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096048/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33657,721
643972,Emergence and expansion of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.526 after identification in New York,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease patients show a high mortality in cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV‑2) infection. Thus, information on the sero-status of nephrology personnel might be crucial for patient protection; however, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV‑2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV‑2 IgG and IgM antibodies among healthcare workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the the first peak phase of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein-based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. RESULTS: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 20.4–31.5%) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about 2 weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9–8.8%) and IgM positivity in 6 (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1–5.6) in at least one assay. Of the healthcare workers 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8–5.0%) showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least 2 assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven COVID-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from healthcare workers did not show SARS-CoV‑2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. CONCLUSION: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV‑2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among COVID-19 patients.

644818,In depth analysis of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates distinct clinical and immunological profiles,2021-02-20,"ABSTRACT Background: The novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARs-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Hence, there is an urgency to find effective treatment. Of those patients afflicted in the United States, many have required treatment with ventilator secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Data are needed regarding the benefit of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with Tocilizumab. Methods: Clinical outcomes data for patients admitted to Orange Regional Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 from Mar 15, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020 were identified through electronic health record chart review. We conducted a retrospective case-control study in confirmed COVID 19 positive patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and compared outcome in terms of mortality and length of stay amongst those who received Tocilizumab as treatment modality opposed to those that did not. Results: A total of 94 patients with COVID-19 ARDS were analyzed. 44 were in the study group and 50 in the control group. We tried to match both group as close as possible in terms of age, sex, BMI and HS score- calculated using inflammatory markers- ferritin, triglycerides, AST and fibrinogen. The median age was 55.5 years in the study group and 66 in the control group, difference was not statistically significant. Average HS score was 114 in the Tocilizumab group and 92 in the control group, difference was statistically significant with P<0.0001. Also, the patients in the study group had elevated levels of IL-6, triglycerides, AST, ferritin which were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 when compared to the control group. Length of stay was longer, average 17.9 days in the Tocilizumab. Survival rate was much lower at 48 % in the control group and 61.36 % in patients who received Tocilizumab with significant P value of < 0.00001. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 7.48, if we treat 8 patients with Tocilizumab, 1 will not die. Conclusions: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) occurs in a large number of patients with severe COVID-19, which is also an important cause of death. IL- 6 is the key molecule of CRS, so IL-6R antagonist Tocilizumab may be of value in improving outcomes. In our study Tocilizumab group seemed to have improved survival outcome. Results have to be interpreted with caution since this is a retrospective study and mortality is affected by multiple, confounding factors. We await the results of ongoing randomized controlled trials to definitely answer the question of whether Tocilizumab improves survival in COVID-19 ARDS patients.","Wadud, N.; Ahmed, N.; Mannu Shergil, M.; Khan, M.; Krishna, M.

The analysis aimed to identify the factors situating this policy in the context of government action during the pandemic. The ethnographic artifacts used for the analysis included the videoconferences of the committee meetings and public hearings and the stenographic notes publicly available on the Chamber of Deputies website. The analysis showed that the debate on chloroquine was forged from scientific evidence used with a denialist perspective, prioritizing the search for uncertainty as a way of fomenting dissent and thus sustaining personal convictions and ideologies. By rejecting empirically backed proposals and scientific consensus itself, the attempt was to create a false appearance of debate. The objective was to convince the public that there were no sufficient grounds for rejecting the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Thus, the success achieved by the government was not based on verification of truths, but as the result of a temporary accommodation that stabilized this purported fact not through certainties, but through fear of doubt.","Penaforte, Thais Rodrigues",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00023021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406213/,721

Research has established that they are feasible, acceptable to persons with Parkinson’s disease and patient-centered. In the Unites States, the relaxation of licensure requirements, adoption of reimbursement parity and investment in telemedicine infrastructure has enabled the rapid growth of video-based visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, we must turn our attention to ensuring that progress made in expanding access to video-based care is not lost and expanded worldwide.

647350,Host Genetic Variants Potentially Associated With SARS-CoV-2: A Multi-Population Analysis,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND: To date computer models with multiple assumptions have focussed on predicting the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Given emerging vaccines, the aim of this study was to provide simple methods for estimating the hidden prevalence of asymptomatic cases and levels of herd immunity to aid future immunization policy and planning. We applied the method in Ireland. METHODS: For large scale epidemics, indirect models for estimating prevalence have been developed. One such method is the benchmark multiplier method. A further method is back-calculation, which has been used successfully to produce estimates of the scale of a HIV infected population. The methods were applied from March to October 2020 and are applicable globally. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the number of infected individuals was at least twice and possibly six times the number identified through testing. Our estimates ranged from ∼100 000 to 375 000 cases giving a ratio of 1–6 hidden cases for every known case within the study time frame. While both methods are subject to assumptions and limitations, it was interesting to observe that estimates corroborated government statements noting that 80% of people testing positive were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: As Europe has now endured several epidemic waves with the emergence globally of new variants, it essential that both policy makers and the public are aware of the scale of the hidden epidemic that may surround them.

Population-based incidence rates and comprehensive clinical characterizations of disease have not been established. METHODS: We conducted population-based prospective surveillance for HMPV in two U.S. counties among children <5 years hospitalized with ARI or fever for two years. Nasal/throat swabs were tested for HMPV by real-time RT-PCR and genotyped. RESULTS: Forty-two of 1104 (3.8%) children tested positive for HMPV. The overall annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations per 1000 children <5 years was 1.2 (95%CI 0.9–1.6). This rate was highest in infants 0–5 months (4.9/1000 [95%CI 2.9–7.2]), followed by children 6–11 months (2.9/1000 [95%CI 1.4–4.7]). The annual rate of HMPV-associated hospitalizations was less than respiratory syncytial virus, but similar to influenza and parainfluenzavirus (PIV) 3 in all age groups. The mean age of children hospitalized with HMPV was 6 months. Bronchiolitis, pneumonia and asthma were the most common diagnoses in children with HMPV. All four HMPV subgroups were detected during both years at both sites. HPMV was most prominent from March through May. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV was detected in 3.8% of children hospitalized with ARI or fever, with a population incidence similar to that of influenza and PIV3.","Williams, John V.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Weinberg, Geoffrey A.; Griffin, Marie R.; Hall, Caroline B.; Zhu, Yuwei; Szilagyi, Peter G.; Wang, Chiaoyin K.; Yang, Chin-Fen; Silva, David; Ye, Dan; Spaete, Richard R.; Crowe, James E.",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20446850/; https://doi.org/10.1086/652782; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/201/12/1890/18060368/201-12-1890.pdf,721

Pregnancy is a physiological state that predisposes women to viral infection. In this review, we aim to present advances in the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment in HCoV in pregnancy. We retrieved information from the Pubmed database up to June 2020, using various search terms and relevant words, including coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2019 coronavirus disease, and pregnancy. Both basic and clinical studies were selected. We found no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to HCoV infection or that those with HCoV infection are more prone to developing severe pneumonia. There is also no confirmed evidence of vertical mother-to-child transmission of HcoV infection during maternal HCoV infection. Those diagnosed with infection should be promptly admitted to a negative-pressure isolation ward, preferably in a designated hospital with adequate facilities and multi-disciplinary expertise to manage critically ill obstetric patients. Antiviral treatment has been routinely used to treat pregnant women with HCoV infection. The timing and mode of delivery should be individualized, depending mainly on the clinical status of the patient, gestational age, and fetal condition. Early cord clamping and temporary separation of the newborn for at least 2 weeks is recommended. All medical staff caring for patients with HCoV infection should use personal protective equipment. This review highlights the advances in pathogenesis, maternal-fetal outcome, maternal-fetal transmission, diagnosis and treatment in HCoV including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy.","Fan, Shangrong; Yan, Shaomei; Liu, Xiaoping; Liu, Ping; Huang, Lei; Wang, Suhua",Matern Fetal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192279/; https://doi.org/10.1097/fm9.0000000000000071,721

Modulation of the immune response is therefore a critical therapeutic target that enables us to approach some of the most vexing problems in medicine today such as obesity, cancer, viral infection, and autoimmunity. Methods of manipulating the immune system through therapeutic delivery centralize around two common themes: the local delivery of biomaterials to affect the surrounding tissue or the systemic delivery of soluble material systems, often aided by context-specific cell or tissue targeting strategies. In either case, supramolecular interactions enable control of biomaterial composition, structure, and behavior at the molecular-scale; through rational biomaterial design, the realization of next-generation immunotherapeutics and immunotheranostics is therefore made possible.

In this Perspective, we propose where PET can, and cannot, guide clinicians in their therapeutic approach. PET at diagnosis/pre-treatment is important for staging, with greater sensitivity compared to standard CT and consequent improved outcomes in truly limited stage FL. Small datasets suggesting a high baseline SUVmax identifies de-novo histologic transformation (HT) are not corroborated by data from GALLIUM, the largest prospective study using modern therapies for FL. Nonetheless, the role of baseline quantitative PET measures requires further clarification. The median survival of patients with newly diagnosed FL is now potentially beyond 20 years. Treatment of symptomatic FL aims to achieve remission and optimise quality of life for as long as possible, with many patients achieving a ""functional cure"" at the cost of unwanted treatment effects. Several studies have identified that end-of-induction (EOI) PET after initial chemoimmunotherapy for patients with high tumour burden is strongly predictive of both progression-free and overall survival, and EOI PET is being evaluated as a platform for response-adapted treatment. There remain unmet needs: improving the inferior survival for patients remaining PET-positive; and quantifying the PFS and time to next treatment advantage, and additional toxicity of anti-CD20 maintenance in patients achieving complete metabolic remission. In the absence of an overall survival advantage for frontline maintenance, the question of using PET to guide our therapeutic approach is more important than ever in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Trotman, Judith; Pettitt, Andrew R",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260714/; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020008243,721

Rapid advances in digital technology offer potential for developing innovative diagnostic pathways to support early diagnosis. Brief self-administered computerized cognitive tools in particular hold promise for clinical implementation by minimizing demands on staff time. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of self-administered computerized cognitive assessment measures designed for the detection of cognitive impairment in older adults. Studies were identified via a systematic search of published peer-reviewed literature across major scientific databases. All studies reporting on psychometric validation of brief (≤30 minutes) self-administered computerized measures for detection of MCI and all-cause dementia in older adults were included. Seventeen studies reporting on 10 cognitive tools met inclusion criteria and were subjected to systematic review. There was substantial variability in characteristics of validation samples and reliability and validity estimates. Only 2 measures evaluated feasibility and usability in the intended clinical settings. Similar to past reviews, we found variability across measures with regard to psychometric rigor and potential for widescale applicability in clinical settings. Despite the promise that self-administered cognitive tests hold for clinical implementation, important gaps in scientific rigor in development, validation, and feasibility studies of these measures remain.

Despite international calls for efforts to reduce weight stigma in the medical community, cross-country research is lacking in this field. This study provides the first multinational investigation of associations between weight stigma and healthcare experiences across six Western countries. METHODS: Participants were 13,996 adults residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US who were actively enrolled in an internationally available behavioral weight management program. Participants completed identical online surveys in the dominant language for their country that assessed experienced weight stigma, internalized weight bias, and healthcare behaviors and experiences including perceived quality of care, avoidance or delay of seeking care, experiences with providers, and perceived weight stigma from doctors. RESULTS: Among participants who reported a history of weight stigma (56–61%), two-thirds of participants in each country reported experiencing weight stigma from doctors. Across all six countries, after accounting for demographics, BMI, and experienced stigma, participants with higher internalized weight bias reported greater healthcare avoidance, increased perceived judgment from doctors due to body weight, lower frequency of obtaining routine checkups, less frequent listening and respect from providers, and lower quality of healthcare. Additionally, experienced weight stigma (from any source) was indirectly associated with poorer healthcare experiences through weight bias internalization, consistently across the six countries. CONCLUSIONS: Weight stigma in healthcare is prevalent among adults actively engaged in weight management across different Western countries, and internalized weight bias has negative implications for healthcare even after controlling for BMI. The similar findings across all six countries underscore the negative consequences of weight stigma on healthcare behaviors and experiences, and emphasize the need for collective international efforts to address this problem.","Puhl, Rebecca M.; Lessard, Leah M.; Himmelstein, Mary S.; Foster, Gary D.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061867/,721

The protein-protein interactions (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed based on the STRING database. The expression of hub genes was validated in GEPIA and GEO. The relationship of hub genes expression with tumor stage and overall survival and progression-free survival of EOC patients was investigated using the cancer genome atlas data. RESULTS: A total of 306 DEGs were identified, including 265 up-regulated and 41 down-regulated. Through PPI network analysis, the top 20 genes were screened out, among which 4 hub genes, which were not researched in depth so far, were selected after literature retrieval, including CDC45, CDCA5, KIF4A, ESPL1. The four genes were up-regulated in EOC tissues compared with normal tissues, but their expression decreased gradually with the continuous progression of EOC. Survival curves illustrated that patients with a lower level of CDCA5 and ESPL1 had better overall survival and progression-free survival statistically. CONCLUSION: Two hub genes, CDCA5 and ESPL1, identified as probably playing tumor-promotive roles, have great potential to be utilized as novel therapeutic targets for EOC treatment.","Gui, Ting; Yao, Chenhe; Jia, Binghan; Shen, Keng",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143800/,721

Ongoing work by NCBI and the GenomeTrakr project illustrates how open data platforms can help meet the needs of federal and state regulators, public health laboratories, departments of agriculture, and universities. Here we describe how microbial pathogen surveillance can be transformed by having an open access database along with Best Practices for contributors to follow. First, we describe the open pathogen surveillance framework, hosted on the NCBI platform. We cover the current community standards for WGS quality, provide an SOP for assessing your own sequence quality and recommend QC thresholds for all submitters to follow. We then provide an overview of NCBI data submission along with step by step details. And finally, we provide curation guidance and an SOP for keeping your public data current within the database. These Best Practices can be models for other open data projects, thereby advancing the One Health goals of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR) data.","Timme, Ruth E.; Wolfgang, William J.; Balkey, Maria; Venkata, Sai Laxmi Gubbala; Randolph, Robyn; Allard, Marc; Strain, Errol",One Health Outlook,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103064/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s42522-020-00026-3,721

652971,On the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as a proposed instrumental variable,2021-06-16,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought about the unprecedented expansion of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics as a primary infection control strategy. At the same time, many laboratories have shifted focus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research and diagnostic development, leading to large-scale production of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids that can interfere with these tests. We have identified multiple instances, in independent laboratories, in which nucleic acids generated in research settings are suspected to have caused researchers to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in surveillance testing. In some cases, the affected individuals did not work directly with these nucleic acids but were exposed via a contaminated surface or object. Though researchers have long been vigilant of DNA contaminants, the transfer of these contaminants to SARS-CoV-2 testing samples can result in anomalous test results. The impact of these incidents stretches into the public sphere, placing additional burdens on public health resources, placing affected researchers and their contacts in isolation and quarantine, removing them from the testing pool for 3 months, and carrying the potential to trigger shutdowns of classrooms and workplaces. We report our observations as a call for increased stewardship over nucleic acids with the potential to impact both the use and development of diagnostics. IMPORTANCE To meet the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, research laboratories shifted their focus and clinical diagnostic laboratories developed and utilized new assays. Nucleic acid-based testing became widespread and, for the first time, was used as a prophylactic measure. We report 15 cases of researchers at two institutes testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance tests, in the absence of any symptoms or transmission. These researchers were likely contaminated with nonhazardous nucleic acids generated in the laboratory in the course of developing new SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. These contaminating nucleic acids were persistent and widespread throughout the laboratory. We report these findings as a cautionary tale to those working with nucleic acids used in diagnostic testing and as a call for careful stewardship of diagnostically relevant molecules. Our conclusions are especially relevant as at-home COVID-19 testing gains traction in the marketplace and these amplicons may impact on the general public.","Robinson-McCarthy, Lindsey R; Mijalis, Alexander J; Filsinger, Gabriel T; de Puig, Helena; Donghia, Nina M; Schaus, Thomas E; Rasmussen, Robert A; Ferreira, Raphael; Lunshof, Jeantine E; Chao, George; Ter-Ovanesyan, Dmitry; Dodd, Oliver; Kuru, Erkin; Sesay, Adama M; Rainbow, Joshua; Pawlowski, Andrew C; Wannier, Timothy M; Angenent-Mari, Nicolaas M; Najjar, Devora; Yin, Peng; Ingber, Donald E; Tam, Jenny M; Church, George M",Microbiol Spectr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523989/; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00313-21,721

DESIGN Open-label controlled study SETTING A designated hospital for patients with refractory COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS 27 hospitalized adult patients ([≥]18 years of age) with radiologically confirmed pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 positive for more than 28 days despite standard care were assigned to receive standard of care (SOC, grp I) or leflunomide + SOC (grp 2). After 2 weeks, grp 1 and grp 2 patients who continued to be SARS-CoV-2-positive received leflunomide for 14 days while continuing SOC. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were the rate of and time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the 14-day and 30-day hospital discharge rate. RESULTS Twelve patients enrolled in grp 1 and 15 patients were in grp 2. The 14 days SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance rate was 80.0% (12/15) for grp 2 patients receiving leflunomide versus 16.7% for grp 1 patients (2/12) (P=0.002). By day 14, the median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 6.0 days (range 1-12; IQR 1-12) for grp 2 patients. In grp 1, two patients converted to viral negative on days 1 and 6 (P=0.002). The 14-day discharge rate was 73.3% (11/15) for the grp 2 versus 8.3% (1/12) for grp 1 (P=0.001). The 30-day discharge rate was 100% (15/15) for the grp 2 versus 66.7% (8/12) for grp 1. No severe adverse events or deaths were reported. CONCLUSION Leflunomide is effective in enhancing SARS-CoV-2 clearance and hospital discharge in refractory COVID-19 patients. The addition of leflunomide to SOC did not increase adverse events versus SOC. These preliminary observations underscore a need for a randomized clinical study of leflunomide in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Q.; Guo, H.; Li, Y.; Jian, X.; Hou, X.; Zhong, N.; Fei, J.; Su, D.; Bian, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Hu, Y.; Sun, Y.; Yu, X.; Jiang, B.; Qin, F.; Wu, Y.; Gao, Y.; Hu, Z.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.29.20114223v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.20114223,721

Patients and Methods Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, EBSCO, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies comparing thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 among severe/non-survivors and non-severe/survivors from January 1, 2020 through July 11, 2020. Inclusion criteria: (1) hospitalized patients ≥18 years comparing severe/non-survivors vs. non-severe/survivors; (2) biomarkers of inflammation and/or thrombosis. A random-effects model was used to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) between the two groups of COVID-19 severity. Results Seventy-five studies were included (17,052 patients). Patients with severe COVID-19/non-survivors were older, a greater proportion were men, had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, and COPD. The thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers were significantly higher in patients with severe disease including D-dimer (WMD 0.60, 0.49-0.71, I2=83.85%), fibrinogen (WMD 0.42, 0.18-0.67, I2=61.88%, p<0.001), CRP (WMD 35.74, 30.16-41.31, I2=85.27%), high sensitivity-CRP (WMD 62.68, 45.27-80.09, I2=0%), Interleukin-6 (WMD 22.81, 17.90-27.72, I2=90.42%) and, ferritin (WMD 506.15, 356.24-656.06, I2=52.02%). Moderate to significant heterogeneity was observed for all parameters. Sub-analysis based on disease severity, mortality, and geographic region of studies demonstrated similar inferences. Conclusions Thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, Fibrinogen, CRP, hs-CRP, ferritin, and IL-6) and marker of end-organ damage (hs-Troponin I) are associated with increased severity and mortality in COVID-19 infection.","Chaudhary, Rahul; Garg, Jalaj; Houghton, Damon E.; Murad, M.

654074,Multiplatform Assessment of Saliva for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection in Symptomatic Healthcare Personnel and Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department,2021-09-07,"“Atypical” pneumonia was described as a distinct and mild form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) already before Mycoplasma pneumoniae had been discovered and recognized as its cause. M. pneumoniae is detected in CAP patients most frequently among school-aged children from 5 to 15 years of age, with a decline after adolescence and tapering off in adulthood. Detection rates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology in children with CAP admitted to the hospital amount 4–39%. Although the infection is generally mild and self-limiting, patients of every age can develop severe or extrapulmonary disease. Recent studies indicate that high rates of healthy children carry M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract and that current diagnostic PCR or serology cannot discriminate between M. pneumoniae infection and carriage. Further, symptoms and radiologic features are not specific for M. pneumoniae infection. Thus, patients may be unnecessarily treated with antimicrobials against M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the first-line antibiotics for this entity in children younger than 8 years of age. Overall macrolides are extensively used worldwide, and this has led to the emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, which may be associated with severe clinical features and more extrapulmonary complications. This review focuses on the characteristics of M. pneumoniae infections in children, and exemplifies that simple clinical decision rules may help identifying children at high risk for CAP due to M. pneumoniae. This may aid physicians in prescribing appropriate first-line antibiotics, since current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection are not reliably predictive.","Meyer Sauteur, Patrick M.; Unger, Wendy W.

These procedures can be challenging when the subject is a wild canid, particularly in a field setting. In addition, reproductive hormone assays are unreliable as a diagnostic tool because the estrous profiles of pregnant and pseudopregnant canines are similar. However, research has demonstrated that the hormone relaxin can be detected in maternal blood after embryonic implantation, but remains negligible in non-pregnant females. We investigated the use of relaxin as a diagnostic marker of pregnancy in the coyote (C. latrans). A commercially available canine relaxin enzyme immunoassay (ReproCHEK™) was used to test plasma collected from 124 female coyotes over four consecutive breeding seasons. Mating activities of the captive females were observed; then peripheral blood samples were collected at intervals throughout pregnancy, as well as after parturition. Results demonstrated that relaxin could be detected in the plasma of pregnant coyotes after 28 days of gestation, and in some cases as early as 23 days, while non-pregnant females and male coyotes consistently tested negative. Relaxin also remained detectable in the plasma of the majority of females tested 10–12 weeks after parturition. This qualitative assay for relaxin proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for pregnancy in the coyote. In addition, blood sampling was relatively easy, could be accomplished with minimal handling, and did not require sedation or anesthesia.","Carlson, Debra A.; Gese, Eric M.",Anim Reprod Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432006004623; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378432006004623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069998/,721
655347,The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 associated polyradiculitis is broad,2021-06-30,"Supply chain finance is an effective way to solve the problem of capital turnover of construction enterprises and stabilize economic growth under epidemic situation. Blockchain technology can solve the problems in the current supply chain finance business, such as incorrect information between banks and enterprises, lack of visibility in transaction process, and possible joint fraud in the core enterprise model. However, it still has problems such as inconvenient information verification, data fraud, and difficulty to achieve a balance between efficiency, security and cost. This paper presents a hybrid chain model combining PANDA (a consensus algorithm based on public chain) and X-Alliance (a consensus algorithm based on alliance chain). Such proposed hybrid chain model can process the transaction of each account in parallel, asynchronize from other unrelated accounts in the network, provide more reliable data storage and authority management, and ensure the ownership of change tracking data, which has higher performance and lower protection cost while ensuring data security and privacy security. According to the data of network crawling, the experimental results show that the throughput can reach 1200tps when four nodes are deployed. The model serves for the supply chain financial data management of engineering projects, making trade authenticity review, risk assessment and credit transmission of core enterprises more efficient. On this basis, each participant can carry out analysis and give early warning of capital flow, timely analyze and calculate the authenticity of transaction background. The proposed method provides a reference for the normal operation of the project fund under the COVID-19 epidemic.","Liu, Jingkuang; Yan, Lemei; Wang, Dong",Wirel Pers Commun,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-021-08451-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850344/,721
655439,Incidence rate of MIS-C in paediatrics: A good reason to vaccinate children against SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Providing routine healthcare to patients with serious health illnesses represents a challenge to healthcare providers amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Treating cancer patients during this pandemic is even more complex due to their heightened vulnerability, as both cancer and cancer treatment weaken the immune system leading to a higher risk of both infections and severe complications. In addition to the need to protect cancer patients from unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection during their routine care, interruption, and discontinuation of cancer treatment can result in negative consequences on patients' health, in addition to the ghost of rationing healthcare resources in high demand during a global health crisis. This article aims to explore the ethical dilemmas faced by decision-makers and healthcare providers caring for cancer patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This includes setting triage criteria for non-infected cancer patients, fairly allocating limited healthcare resources between cancer patients and SARS-CoV-2 patients, prioritizing SARS-CoV-2 treatment or vaccine, once developed, for cancer patients and non-cancer patients, patient-physician communication on matters such as end-of-life and do-not-resuscitate (DNR), and lastly, shifting physicians' priorities from treating their own cancer patients to treating critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Ultimately, no straightforward decision can be easily made at such exceptionally difficult times. Applying different ethical principles can result in very different scenarios and consequences.

The HAV 3C cysteine protease (3C(pro)), an important nonstructural protein, is responsible for most cleavage within the viral polyprotein and is critical for the processes of viral replication. Our group has previously demonstrated that HAV 3C(pro) cleaves human NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), a kinase required in interferon signaling. Based on this finding, we generated four luciferase-based biosensors containing the NEMO sequence (PVLKAQ↓ADIYKA) that is cleaved by HAV 3C(pro) and/or the Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein, to monitor the activity of HAV 3C(pro) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T). Western blotting showed that HAV 3C(pro) recognized and cleaved the NEMO cleavage sequence incorporated in the four biosensors, whereas only one cyclized luciferase-based biosensor (233-DnaE-HAV, 233DH) showed a measurable and reliable increase in firefly luciferase activity, with very low background, in the presence of HAV 3C(pro). With this biosensor (233DH), we monitored HAV 3C(pro) activity in HEK-293T cells, and tested it against a catalytically deficient mutant HAV 3C(pro) and other virus-encoded proteases. The results showed that the activity of this luciferase biosensor is specifically dependent on HAV 3C(pro). Collectively, our data demonstrate that the luciferase biosensor developed here might provide a rapid, sensitive, and efficient evaluation of HAV 3C(pro) activity, and should extend our better understanding of the biological relevance of HAV 3C(pro).","Zhou, Junwei; Wang, Dang; Xi, Yongqiang; Zhu, Xinyu; Yang, Yuting; Lv, Mengting; Luo, Chuanzhen; Chen, Jiyao; Ye, Xu; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X17309257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28501618/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.05.063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X17309257,721
656371,Comment on: Preoperative SARS CoV-2 rapid antigen test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction: A conundrum in surgical decision making,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium is among the most common causes of severe diarrhea in African children 0–23 months old. It is associated with excess mortality, stunting and malnutrition. The most common manifestation of cryptosporidium is intestinal diarrheal disease. However, respiratory cryptosporidiosis has been documented in up to a third of children presenting with diarrhea. It is unclear whether respiratory involvement is a transient phenomenon or a reservoir for gastrointestinal (GI) disease. This study aims to evaluate the role of respiratory cryptosporidiosis in pediatric diarrheal disease. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational study conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. Young children aged 2–24 months hospitalized with diarrhea will be enrolled. Enrolled children will have induced sputum, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and stool samples collected. All participants positive for cryptosporidium on sputum/NP/stool PCR testing will be followed up fortnightly after discharge from the hospital up to 8 weeks post-discharge. Sputum/NP/stool sample collection will be done at each visit. The primary outcomes will be presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in sputum/NP/stool. The secondary outcome will be presence of respiratory and GI symptoms, mortality and stunting. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) research ethics committee. DISCUSSION: The study began recruitment activities at QECH in February 2019. The protocol allows for expansion of recruitment to secondary sites within Blantyre and Chikwawa districts in the event that targets are not met at QECH. Study recruitment is expected to continue until early 2020.","Nyangulu, Wongani; Van Voorhis, Wes; Iroh Tam, Pui-Ying",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426759/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4380-x,721

METHODS: The data of 39,693 Brazilian adults were collected through an online questionnaire between April 24th and May 24th, 2020. Information about physical activity (weekly frequency and daily duration), TV viewing, and computer/tablet use (daily duration) before and during the pandemic period were reported. The correlates adopted were sex, age group, highest academic achievement, skin color, per capita income, country macro region, working status during the quarantine, and adherence to the quarantine. Logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: The incidence of physical inactivity (<150 min/week), high TV viewing (≥4 h/d), and computer/tablet use (≥4 h/d), were, respectively, 70.4%, 31.4%, and 37.9% during the COVID-19 pandemic. The younger age group showed higher incidences of physical inactivity (78%) and high computer/tablet use (59%), while middle-age adults (30–59 years) showed a higher incidence of TV viewing (34%). People who adhered to stricter measures of quarantine presented a higher incidence of excessive screen time. CONCLUSION: High incidences of physical inactivity and excessive screen time were identified in specific population subgroups during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.","Silva, Danilo R.; Werneck, André O.; Malta, Deborah C.; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R.B.; Azevedo, Luiz O.; Barros, Marilisa B.A.; Szwarcwald, Célia L.",Ann Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029704/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047279721000843; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047279721000843,721

The unavailability of vaccines and proper antiviral drugs encourages the researchers to identify potential antiviral drugs to be used against the virus. The presence of RNA binding domain in the nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be a potential drug target, which serves multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle, especially the viral replication. Since vaccine development might take some time, the identification of a drug compound targeting viral replication might offer a solution for treatment. The study analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of N protein sequence divergence with other 49 coronavirus species and also identified the conserved regions according to protein families through conserved domain search. Good structural binding affinities of a few natural and/or synthetic phytocompounds or drugs against N protein were determined using the molecular docking approaches. The analyzed compounds presented the higher numbers of hydrogen bonds of selected chemicals supporting the drug-ability of these compounds.

Fungal infections, which are also a major public health threat, receive considerably less attention. Consequently, there is dearth of data regarding the burden of fungal diseases in the country. We estimated the burden of fungal diseases in Zimbabwe based on published literature and ‘at-risk’ populations (HIV/AIDS patients, survivors of pulmonary TB, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and patients receiving critical care) using previously described methods. Where there was no data for Zimbabwe, regional, or international data was used. Our study revealed that approximately 14.9% of Zimbabweans suffer from fungal infections annually, with 80% having tinea capitis. The annual incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV/AIDS were estimated at 41/100,000 and 63/100,000, respectively. The estimated prevalence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) was 2,739/100,000. The estimated burden of fungal diseases in Zimbabwe is high in comparison to other African countries, highlighting the urgent need for increased awareness and surveillance to improve diagnosis and management.","Pfavayi, Lorraine T.; Denning, David W.; Baker, Stephen; Sibanda, Elopy N.; Mutapi, Francisca",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92605-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168204/,721

However, expression of HIV-1 envelope genes using viral vectors has not been successful in the induction of potent neutralizing antibodies in vivo. We took advantage of the strong immunogenicity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vector and expressed HIV-1 HXB2 gp120 gene in the recombinant VSV. Our results showed that HIV-1 gp120 protein expressed by the recombinant VSV retained the native conformation of the protein to some degree and was recognized by two well-characterized broad anti-HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies b12, 2G12. We further showed that only one time intranasal immunization with the recombinant VSV led to production of anti-HIV-1 anti-sera in mice. In addition, we found that the anti-sera had the ability to neutralize not only HXB2 envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses but also HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses with JRFL envelopes. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 expressed by the recombinant VSV, in combination with the route of intranasal administration, is an effective strategy to evaluate the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope protein and its variants in mice.","Jiang, Pengfei; Liu, Yanxia; Yin, Xiaolei; Yuan, Fei; Nie, YuChun; Luo, Min; Aihua, Zheng; Liyin, Du; Ding, Mingxiao; Deng, Hongkui",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16313884/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X05026008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05026008,721

There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease. Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020. The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations. Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19.

It spread to several countries across continents and infected more than one million people within three months. While there is no consensus on the treatment of the disease yet, understanding the virus and its transmission is a cardinal priority. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through bodily fluid. Upon inoculation, the surface enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as a receptor protein for viral entry. The mean incubation period is 5.1 days, and infected individuals can exhibit a variety of symptoms from fever, cough, dyspnea, and respiratory failure to even multiorgan failure. Given the current situation, it is of paramount importance to understand the virus as thoroughly as possible. In this review, we discuss the background, epidemiology, possible pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic studies related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV2 differs from previous coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS) due to its high infectivity (reproduction value, R(0), typically 2–4) and pre- or asymptomatic transmission, properties that have contributed to the current global Covid-19 pandemic. Identified risk factors for disease severity and death from SARS-Cov2 infection include older age, male sex, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. The reasons for these associations are still largely obscure. Evidence is also emerging that SARS-CoV2 infection exacerbates the underlying pathophysiology of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms through which diabetes may affect the risk of more severe outcomes in Covid-19 and, additionally, how diabetic emergencies and longer term pathology may be aggravated by infection with the virus. We consider roles for the immune system, the observed phenomenon of microangiopathy in severe Covid-19 infection and the potential for direct viral toxicity on metabolically-relevant tissues including pancreatic beta cells and targets of insulin action.","Muniangi-Muhitu, Hermine; Akalestou, Elina; Salem, Victoria; Misra, Shivani; Oliver, Nicholas S.; Rutter, Guy A.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133024/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.582936,721

Next, we classify new case time series, demonstrate five characteristic classes of trajectories, and quantify discrepancy between them with respect to the behavior of waves of the disease. Finally, we show there is no relationship between countries’ equity market performance and their success in managing COVID-19.

661173,Insights into the virologic and immunologic features of SARS-COV-2,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and public policy have been crucial for minimizing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States. Publicly available, county-level time series data on mobility are derived from individual devices with global positioning systems, providing a variety of indices of social distancing behavior per day. Such indices allow a fine-grained approach to modeling public behavior during the pandemic. Previous studies of social distancing and policy have not accounted for the occurrence of pre-policy social distancing and other dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of public mobility data. OBJECTIVE: We propose a differential equation state-space model of county-level social distancing that accounts for distancing behavior leading up to the first official policies, equilibrium dynamics reflected in the long-term trajectories of mobility, and the specific impacts of four kinds of policy. The model is fit to each US county individually, producing a nationwide data set of novel estimated mobility indices. METHODS: A differential equation model was fit to three indicators of mobility for each of 3054 counties, with T=100 occasions per county of the following: distance traveled, visitations to key sites, and the log number of interpersonal encounters. The indicators were highly correlated and assumed to share common underlying latent trajectory, dynamics, and responses to policy. Maximum likelihood estimation with the Kalman-Bucy filter was used to estimate the model parameters. Bivariate distributional plots and descriptive statistics were used to examine the resulting county-level parameter estimates. The association of chronology with policy impact was also considered. RESULTS: Mobility dynamics show moderate correlations with two census covariates: population density (Spearman r ranging from 0.11 to 0.31) and median household income (Spearman r ranging from –0.03 to 0.39). Stay-at-home order effects were negatively correlated with both (r=–0.37 and r=–0.38, respectively), while the effects of the ban on all gatherings were positively correlated with both (r=0.51, r=0.39). Chronological ordering of policies was a moderate to strong determinant of their effect per county (Spearman r ranging from –0.12 to –0.56), with earlier policies accounting for most of the change in mobility, and later policies having little or no additional effect. CONCLUSIONS: Chronological ordering, population density, and median household income were all associated with policy impact. The stay-at-home order and the ban on gatherings had the largest impacts on mobility on average. The model is implemented in a graphical online app for exploring county-level statistics and running counterfactual simulations. Future studies can incorporate the model-derived indices of social distancing and policy impacts as important social determinants of COVID-19 health outcomes.","McKee, Kevin L; Crandell, Ian C; Hanlon, Alexandra L",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/23902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296866/,721

The underlying virus–host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, our data suggest autophagy-inducing drugs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating lyssavirus infection.","Laing, Eric D.; Sterling, Spencer L.; Weir, Dawn L.; Beauregard, Chelsi R.; Smith, Ina L.; Larsen, Sasha E.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Snow, Andrew L.; Schaefer, Brian C.; Broder, Christopher C.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11030260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875748/,721

In addition, some management programs for critically ill COVID-19 patients are also based on experience with bacterial sepsis. However, some differences may exist between these two types of sepsis. METHODS: This retrospective study investigated whether there are differences in the immune system status of these two types of sepsis. A total of 64 bacterial sepsis patients and 43 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sepsis were included in this study. Demographic data were obtained from medical records. Laboratory results within 24 h after the diagnosis of sepsis were provided by the clinical laboratory. RESULTS: The results of blood routine (neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts), infection biomarkers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin levels), lymphocyte subset counts (total T lymphocyte, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, and NK cell counts), and lymphocyte subset functions (the proportions of PMA/ionomycin-stimulated IFN-γ positive cells in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) were similar in bacterial sepsis patients and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. Cytokine storm was milder, and immunoglobulin and complement protein levels were higher in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are both similarities and differences in the immune system status of bacterial sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 sepsis.

Data on the interplay between metabolic comorbidities and the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 have been emerging and rapidly increasing. This implies a mechanistic link between metabolic diseases and COVID-19 resulting in the exacerbation of the condition. Nonetheless, new evidences are emerging to support insulin-mediated aggressive glucose-lowering treatment as a possible trigger of high mortality rate in diabetic COVID-19 patients, putting the clinician in a confounding and difficult dilemma for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the pathophysiological link among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), metabolic complications, and severe inflammation in COVID-19 development, especially in those with multi-organ injuries. We discuss the influence of several routinely used drugs in COVID-19 patients, including anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant drugs, antidiabetic drugs, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Especially, we provide a balanced overview on the clinical application of glucose-lowering drugs (insulin and metformin), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. Although there is insufficient evidence from clinical or basic research to comprehensively reveal the mechanistic link between adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and metabolic comorbidities, it is hoped that the update in the current review may help to better outline the optimal strategies for clinical management of COVID-19 patients with metabolic comorbidities.","Hua, Shuang; Yang, Yong; Zou, Danqi; Li, Jufei; Yan, Kaixuan; Xu, Ying; Jiang, Xue; Rong, Xianglu; Ye, Dewei",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111685; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221004674?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221004674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015585/,721

According to the current reports, a situation has arisen when people need to understand the importance of social distancing and take enough precautionary measures more seriously. Maintaining social distancing and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine strategy are some common habits which people should adopt to avoid from being infected. And the growing information regarding COVID-19, its symptoms and prevention strategies help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we have considered a SAIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission where people in the susceptible environment move into asymptotically exposed class after coming contact with asymptotically exposed, symptomatically infected and even hospitalised people. The numerical study indicates that if more people from asymptotically exposed class move into quarantine class to prevent further virus transmission, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease outbreak can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. But for COVID-19, we have to wait until a proper vaccine is developed and hence natural immunity and taking proper precautionary measures is very important to avoid from being infected. In the latter part, a corresponding optimal control problem has been set up by implementing control strategies to reduce the cost and count of overall infected individuals. Numerical figures show that the control strategy, which denotes the social distancing to reduce disease transmission, works with a higher intensity almost after one month of implementation and then decreases in the last few days. Further, the control strategy denoting the awareness of susceptible population regarding precautionary measures first increases up to one month after implementation and then slowly decreases with time. Therefore, implementing control policies may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current pandemic situation as these controls reduce the overall infected population and increase the recovered population.","Saha, Sangeeta; Samanta, G.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020. Blood and urine laboratory findings related to renal function were summarized, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) were also calculated to assess the renal function. Results: A total of 12 admitted hospital patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, included 3 severe cases, and 9 common cases. Serum creatinine (Scr) was not abnormally elevated in all of the patients, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was abnormally elevated in only 25.0% of the patients. However, compared with the recovery period, the patient's Scr and BUN increased significantly in peak of disease (p-scr = 0.002 & p-bun < 0.001). By observing the fluctuations in Scr and BUN from admission to recovery, it was found that the peak of Scr and BUN appeared within the first 14 day of the course of the disease. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the abnormally elevated rates of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), and urine transferring (TRU) standardized by urinary creatinine in peak of disease were 41.7, 41.7, 50.0, and 16.7%, respectively. The abnormal rates of the calculated eGFR and Ccr were 66.7 and 41.7%. Conclusion: Scr and BUN were generally increased during the course of COVID-19. Detection of urinary microproteins and application of multiple indicators assessment could be helpful for discovering abnormal renal function in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We aimed to detect the virus in formalin-fixed tissue blocks and document the liver injury patterns in patients with COVID-19 compared with a control group. RESULTS: We were able to detect viral RNA in the bronchioalveolar cell blocks (12/12, 100%) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the lung (8/8, 100%) and liver (4/9, 44%) of patients with COVID-19. Although the peak values of the main liver enzymes and bilirubin were higher in the patients with COVID-19 compared with the control group, the differences were not significant. The main histologic findings were minimal to focal mild portal tract chronic inflammation (7/8, 88%, P < .05) and mild focal lobular activity (6/8, 75%, P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: We found that most patients who died of COVID-19 had evidence of mild focal hepatitis clinically and histologically; however, the virus was detected in less than half of the cases.","Chornenkyy, Yevgen; Mejia-Bautista, Melissa; Brucal, Melanie; Blanke, Timothy; Dittmann, David; Yeldandi, Anjana; Boike, Justin R; Lomasney, Jon W; Nayar, Ritu; Jennings, Lawrence J; Pezhouh, Maryam Kherad",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914058/,721

The case presented here involves a 73-year-old man experiencing fever and respiratory distress, who was ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. During the course of his hospitalization, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), followed by being intubated due to his breathing difficulties. Because of variations in the patient’s clinical features, we decided to perform hemoperfusion to remove cytokines. Afterward, his clinical status improved significantly, and he was discharged in stable condition. However, 26 days later, fever and respiratory distress manifested again.

Cytokines imbalance in COVID-19 resembles cancer; exploration of anti-inflammatory agents, might reduce COVID-19 mortality. The current study investigates the effect of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar cells compared to the uninfected one from the GSE5147507 dataset. The protein-protein interaction network, biological process and functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes were studied using STRING App of the Cytoscape software and R programming tools. The present study indicated that ruxolitinib treatment elicited similar response equivalent to that of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected situation by inducing defense response in host against virus infection by RLR and NOD like receptor pathways. Further, the effect of ruxolitinib in SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly caused by significant suppression of IFIH1, IRF7 and MX1 genes as well as inhibition of DDX58/IFIH1-mediated induction of interferon- I and -II signalling.","Mandal, M.; Mandal, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.20248986v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.20248986,721
665942,SARS-CoV-2 infection: physiological and environmental gift factors at high altitude,2020-09-11,"Although vaccination has been an effective way of preventing infections ever since the eighteenth century, the generation of therapeutic vaccines and immunotherapies is still a work in progress. A number of challenges impede the development of these therapeutic approaches such as safety issues related to the administration of whole pathogens whether attenuated or inactivated. One safe alternative to classical vaccination methods gaining recognition is the use of nanoparticles, whether synthetic or naturally derived. We have recently demonstrated that the papaya mosaic virus (PapMV)-like nanoparticle can be used as a prophylactic vaccine against various viral and bacterial infections through the induction of protective humoral and cellular immune responses. Moreover, PapMV is also very efficient when used as an immune adjuvant in an immunotherapeutic setting at slowing down the growth of aggressive mouse melanoma tumors in a type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent manner. In the present study, we were interested in exploiting the capacity of PapMV of inducing robust IFN-I production as treatment for the chronic viral infection model lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13 (Cl13). Treatment of LCMV Cl13-infected mice with two systemic administrations of PapMV was ineffective, as shown by the lack of changes in viral titers and immune response to LCMV following treatment. Moreover, IFN-α production following PapMV administration was almost completely abolished in LCMV-infected mice. To better isolate the mechanisms at play, we determined the influence of a pretreatment with PapMV on secondary PapMV administration, therefore eliminating potential variables emanating from the infection. Pretreatment with PapMV led to the same outcome as an LCMV infection in that IFN-α production following secondary PapMV immunization was abrogated for up to 50 days while immune activation was also dramatically impaired. We showed that two distinct and overlapping mechanisms were responsible for this outcome. While short-term inhibition was partially the result of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 degradation, a crucial component of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway, long-term inhibition was mainly due to interference by PapMV-specific antibodies. Thus, we identified a possible pitfall in the use of virus-like particles for the systemic treatment of chronic viral infections and discuss mitigating alternatives to circumvent these potential problems.","Chartrand, Karine; Lebel, Marie-Ève; Tarrab, Esther; Savard, Pierre; Leclerc, Denis; Lamarre, Alain",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29354118/,721

Physical distancing, masks, personal protective equipment worn by the doctors created difficulties in effective doctor-patient communication. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess the difficulties faced by patients in communicating with their doctors due to the COVID 19 preventive measures, and its impact on the trust on their doctors. METHODS: A cross sectional study of 359 persons attending a tertiary care center in Chennai, sampled in a non-probabilistic manner selected from the outpatient department, wards, and isolation facilities, was conducted using a questionnaire containing items covering three dimensions namely difficulties faced in accessing the health facility, difficulties in doctor-patient communication and trust in the doctors. The data were collected using Google Forms and analyzed using GNU PSPP open-source statistical software version 1.4.0. RESULTS: More than 60% of the participants complained of difficulty in accessing the health facility. More than 60% had difficulties in communicating with the doctors. There was a high level of trust in doctors among more than 80% of the participants. Comparison of the mean scores revealed that accessibility was a problem across ages, sexes, education and occupation groups. Communication barriers decreased with age and increased with education, but trust increased with age, but reduced with increasing education. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that difficulties in communication had a negative impact on trust (β = -0.63, p<0.001) and increasing education had a negative impact on trust (β = -0.42, p = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID 19 pandemic and the preventive strategies such as lock-down, physical distancing, face mask and personal protective equipment created barriers to effective doctor patient communication and led to some compromise in trust in doctors during this time.","Gopichandran, Vijayaprasad; Sakthivel, Kalirajan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161383/,721

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2018 data submitted by health plans reporting 2 new Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures assessing receipt of clinically recommended vaccines among pregnant women and adults. We analyzed the number of plans reporting a valid performance rate and electronic data source used. We consulted expert panels and reviewed coverage rates from other sources to understand the results. RESULTS: We received 136 data submissions across commercial, Medicaid and Medicare plans and 87 submissions across commercial and Medicaid plans for the adult and prenatal immunization measures, respectively. These submissions represent approximately 15% of possible submissions. Plans used claims, registries and electronic health records. Mean performance rates for adult immunizations were 21.2 (commercial), 14.0 (Medicaid) and 19.5% (Medicare). Mean rates for prenatal immunizations were 33.1 (commercial) and 16.7% (Medicaid). DISCUSSION: Results from the first year of reporting 2 electronic clinical data measures suggest health plans can feasibly report these measures and are seeking electronic data to supplement claims. Comparison of rates to other national results showed lower than expected rates for the adult immunization measure. However, prenatal immunization rates were on par with those from a national survey, suggesting this measure is closer to use for quality improvement. CONCLUSION: Quality measure reporting that encourages connection to electronic data sources is a step forward in performance monitoring and improvement. The use of electronic sources may advance health information exchange for patient care.","Byron, Sepheen C; Roth, Lindsey; Acton, Ryan M; Shen, Angela",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279653/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab125,721

Before immunization of mice with saRNA LNPs, we saw high expression of S-protein at both mRNA and protein levels after transfection of HEK293T/17 cells with saRNA LNPs. After oral immunization of BALB/c mice with 0.1 – 10 µg saRNA LNPs , a high quantity of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies were seen with a dose-dependent pattern. Importantly, the ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 in serum of vaccinated mice showed Th1/Th2 skewing response. We also found that the secreted antibodies could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants delta (B.1.617 lineage) and alpha (B.1.1.7 lineage). Re-stimulated splenocytes of vaccinated mice showed high secretion of IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF- α .

In this work, predictive factors for survival in cancer patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 infection were investigated. METHODS: PRE-COVID-19 is a retrospective study of all 302 cancer patients presenting to this institute with a suspicion of COVID-19 from March 1st to April 25th 2020. Data were collected using a web-based tool within electronic patient record approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patient characteristics symptoms and survival were collected and compared in SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positive and negative patients. RESULTS: 55 of the 302 (18.2%) patients with suspected COVID-19 had detectable SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples. RT-PCR+ patients were older, had more frequently haematological malignancies, respiratory symptoms and suspected COVID-19 pneumonia of CTscan. However, respectively 38% and 20% of SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR negative patients presented similar respiratory symptoms and CT scan images. Thirty of the 302 (9.9%) patients died during the observation period, including 24 (80%) with advanced disease. At the median follow-up of 25 days after first symptoms, the death rate in RT-PCR+ and RT-PCR-patients were 21% and 10% respectively. In both groups, independent risk factors for death were male gender, KPS<60, cancer in relapse, and respiratory symptoms. Detection of SARS-COV-2 on RT-PCR was not associated with an increased death rate (p=0.10). None of the treatment given in the previous month (including cytotoxics, PD1 Ab, anti-CD20, VEGFR2…) correlated with survival. The survival of RT-PCR positive and negative patients with respiratory symptoms and/or COVID-19 type pneumonia on CTscan was similar with a 18.4% and 19.7% death-rate at day-25.

Since early March, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by an acute and often severe form of pneumonia, has been declared a pandemic. This has led to a boom in biomedical research studies at all stages of the pipeline, from the in vitro to the clinical phase. In line with this global effort, known drugs, currently used for the treatment of other pathologies, including antivirals, immunomodulating compounds and antibodies, are currently used off-label for the treatment of COVID-19, in association with the supportive standard care. Yet, no effective treatments have been identified. A new hope stems from medical oncology and relies on the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In particular, amongst the ICIs, antibodies able to block the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway have revealed a hidden potential. In fact, patients with severe and critical COVID-19, even prior to the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome, exhibit lymphocytopenia and suffer from T-cell exhaustion, which may lead to viral sepsis and an increased mortality rate. It has been observed that cancer patients, who usually are immunocompromised, may restore their anti-tumoral immune response when treated with ICIs. Moreover, viral-infected mice and humans, exhibit a T-cell exhaustion, which is also observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, when treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, they restore their T-cell competence and efficiently counteract the viral infection. Based on these observations, four clinical trials are currently open, to examine the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody administration to both cancer and non-cancer individuals affected by COVID-19. The results may prove the hypothesis that restoring exhausted T-cells may be a winning strategy to beat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Luca; Torino, Francesco; Scandurra, Giuseppa; Russo, Giulia; Bordonaro, Roberto; Pappalardo, Francesco; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Raciti, Giuseppina; Libra, Massimo",Int J Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2020.5159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491759/,721

The ongoing Ebola virus (EBOV) disease epidemic in Western Africa claimed more than 11,300 lives and was associated with secondary cases outside Africa, demonstrating that filoviruses pose a global health threat. Bats constitute an important natural reservoir of filoviruses, including viruses of the recently identified Cuevavirus genus within the Filoviridae family. However, the interactions of filoviruses with bat cells are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether filoviruses employ different strategies to enter human and bat cells. For this, we examined host cell entry driven by glycoproteins (GP) from all filovirus species into cell lines of human and fruit bat origin. We show that all GPs were able to mediate entry into human and most fruit bat cell lines with roughly comparable efficiency. In contrast, the efficiency of entry into the cell line EidNi/41 derived from a straw-colored fruit bat varied markedly between the GPs of different filovirus species. Furthermore, inhibition studies demonstrated that filoviruses employ the same host cell factors for entry into human, non-human primate and fruit bat cell lines, including cysteine proteases, two pore channels and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick C1 molecule). Finally, processing of GP by furin and the presence of the mucin-like domain in GP were dispensable for entry into both human and bat cell lines. Collectively, these results show that filoviruses rely on the same host cell factors for entry into human and fruit bat cells, although the efficiency of the usage of these factors might differ between filovirus species.","Hoffmann, Markus; González Hernández, Mariana; Berger, Elisabeth; Marzi, Andrea; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901159/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149651,721

The Pearson and Poisson regression models were used accordingly to understand the association between COVID-19 deaths and each risk factor. The daily COVID-19 deaths were positively correlated with AQI (slope = 0.4 ± 0.09, R(2) = 0.24, p < 0.01). Detailedly, PM(2.5) was the only pollutant exhibiting a positive association (relative risk (RR) = 1.079, 95%CI 1.071–1.086, p < 0.01) with COVID-19 deaths. The PM(10), SO(2), and CO were all also significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths, but in negative pattern (p < 0.01). Among them, PM(10) and CO had the highest and lowest RR, which equaled to 0.952 (95%CI 0.945–0.959) and 0.177 (95%CI 0.131–0.24), respectively. Additionally, temperature was inversely associated with COVID-19 deaths (RR = 0.861, 95%CI 0.851–0.872, p < 0.01). Contrarily, diurnal temperature range was positively associated with COVID-19 deaths (RR = 1.014, 95%CI 1.003–1.025, p < 0.05).

The PVA/AgNPs/BPTA membrane showed higher antibacterial activity than the other membranes, and it produced inhibition zones with diameters of 18.12 ± 0.08 and 16.41 ± 0.05 mm against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The PVA/AgNPs/BPTA membrane was found to be capable of promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation under both light and dark conditions. Cycling experiments performed following ROS quenching showed that the best-performing composite membrane retained >70% of its original OH• radical and H2O2 charging capacity after seven cycles. In the filtration test, the electrospun nanofibrous membranes showed high filtration efficiencies of 99.98% for sodium chloride (NaCl). In addition, these membranes maintained a relatively low pressure drop of 168 Pa with a basis weight of 2.1 g m−2. Thus, the PVA/AgNPs/BPTA membrane was concluded to be a promising medical protective material offering the benefits of structural stability and reusability.","Li, Siying; Zhang, Rong; Xie, Junlan; Sameen, Dur E.; Ahmed, Saeed; Dai, Jianwu; Qin, Wen; Li, Suqing; Liu, Yaowen",Applied Surface Science,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016943322032273X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834268/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016943322032273X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147516,721

In this paper, we employ a common-feature-based, multivariate trend-cycle decomposition approach to examine common trends and common cycles amongst the demand for New Zealand tourism originating in Australia, China, the US, the UK, as well as other tourism-importing countries considered as one group: Others. Upon isolating trends and cycles in tourism demand from these countries, we find evidence of strong long-term comovement: they share one common trend. We also find evidence of short-term comovement, albeit to a lesser extent: four common cycles emerge; the cyclical patterns in tourism demand from Australia, China, the US, and Others are strongly correlated.","Vatsa, Puneet",Ann Tour Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2020.102965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508372/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160738320301092; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738320301092,721
671797,Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among clinic staff and patients,2020-07-04,"The role of non-invasive respiratory support (high-flow nasal oxygen and noninvasive ventilation) in the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome is debated. The oxygenation improvement coupled with lung and diaphragm protection produced by non-invasive support may help to avoid endotracheal intubation, which prevents the complications of sedation and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, spontaneous breathing in patients with lung injury carries the risk that vigorous inspiratory effort, combined or not with mechanical increases in inspiratory airway pressure, produces high transpulmonary pressure swings and local lung overstretch. This ultimately results in additional lung damage (patient self-inflicted lung injury), so that patients intubated after a trial of noninvasive support are burdened by increased mortality. Reducing inspiratory effort by high-flow nasal oxygen or delivery of sustained positive end-expiratory pressure through the helmet interface may reduce these risks. In this physiology-to-bedside review, we provide an updated overview about the role of noninvasive respiratory support strategies as early treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit. Noninvasive strategies appear safe and effective in mild-to-moderate hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 150 mmHg), while they can yield delayed intubation with increased mortality in a significant proportion of moderate-to-severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 150 mmHg) cases. High-flow nasal oxygen and helmet noninvasive ventilation represent the most promising techniques for first-line treatment of severe patients. However, no conclusive evidence allows to recommend a single approach over the others in case of moderate-to-severe hypoxemia. During any treatment, strict physiological monitoring remains of paramount importance to promptly detect the need for endotracheal intubation and not delay protective ventilation.","Grieco, Domenico Luca; Maggiore, Salvatore Maurizio; Roca, Oriol; Spinelli, Elena; Patel, Bhakti K.; Thille, Arnaud W.; Barbas, Carmen Sílvia V.; de Acilu, Marina Garcia; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Bongiovanni, Filippo; Amato, Marcelo; Frat, Jean-Pierre; Mauri, Tommaso; Kress, John P.; Mancebo, Jordi; Antonelli, Massimo",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232336/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-021-06459-2,721

Design: Prospective national population-based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). Setting: All 194 obstetric units in the UK Participants: 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection between 01/03/2020 and 14/04/2020. 694 comparison women who gave birth between 01/11/2017 and 31/10/2018. Main outcome measures: Incidence of maternal hospitalisation, infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, perinatal death; odds ratios for infected versus comparison women. Results: Estimated incidence of hospitalisation with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy 4.9 per 1000 maternities (95%CI 4.5-5.4). The median gestation at symptom onset was 34 weeks (IQR 29-38). Black or other minority ethnicity (aOR 4.49, 95%CI 3.37-6.00), older maternal age (aOR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.81 comparing women aged 35+ with those aged 30-34), overweight and obesity (aORs 1.91, 95%CI 1.37-2.68 and 2.20, 95%CI 1.56-3.10 respectively compared to women with a BMI<25kg/m2) and pre-existing comorbidities (aOR 1.52, 95%CI 1.12-2.06) were associated with admission with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. 247 women (58%) gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 180 (73%) gave birth at term. 40 (9%) hospitalised women required respiratory support. Twelve infants (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of these infants within the first 12 hours after birth. Conclusions: The majority of pregnant women hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The strong association between admission with infection and black or minority ethnicity requires urgent investigation and explanation.

AIM: This study evaluated the psychosocial and behavioural changes related to oral health in adolescents immediately before and during the pandemic period of COVID‐19, enabling a longitudinal assessment of the perceived changes. DESIGN: This cohort study evaluated 290 adolescents from November 2019 to February 2020 (T1—before the pandemic in Brazil) and from June to July 2020 (T2) in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychosocial variables were measured before and during the pandemic. Issues related to social distancing and job loss were also collected. The differences between the variables in T1 and T2, as well as the effect of social distancing, were assessed using a multilevel‐adjusted logistic regression model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 207 adolescents were re‐evaluated at T2 (a response rate of 71.3%). During the pandemic, the frequency of toothbrushing, the use of dental services, and the self‐perceived need for dental treatment significantly decreased. Sugar consumption, bruxism, and quality of sleep did not change significantly.

673196,"Low-cost devices to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection during open, laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery",2020-07-23,"Background: Wellness is an important concept for medical students to learn, both for their own health and for their patients. Since nutrition is an essential part of one’s wellness that can positively or negatively impact one’s health, it is important for medical students to learn approaches to nutritional wellness. Studies have shown that physicians’ nutrition attitudes and clinical practices are positively correlated with their dietary practices. Objective: Here, we describe a brief nutrition-based education experience for first-year students offered at the start of the medical school curriculum that is designed to increase their nutrition awareness. Design: The nutrition experience involved five components: 1) having students complete three 24-hour food recalls; 2) comparing their recalls to nutrient standards; 3) emphasizing strategies that include simple, nutritionally sound food choices and preparation; 4) surveying students on their implementation of personal healthy nutritional strategies; and 5) requesting future recommendations for modifying the educational experience. Results: Most students’ diets did not meet the recommended dietary levels for several nutrients, and these deficiencies corresponded to specific food group inadequacies. Forty percent of the students responded to a three-month follow-up survey. Of these students, 46% implemented one of the presented strategies to improve their food intake. Most changes included the addition or deletion of a particular food. Seventy-three percent recommended repeating the program in the future. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a brief 2.5-hour nutrition wellness experience can increase nutrition awareness and promote dietary change in incoming medical students. Many felt that the experience was valuable and recommended offering a similar experience to future classes.","Coleman, Mary Thoesen; Brantley, Paula Rhode; Wiseman, Pamela Markiewicz; English, M.

In this questionnaire study, we aimed to analyze potential barriers and patients’ health beliefs during and after the lockdown early 2020 in a tertiary referral center in Kiel, Germany. METHODS: Patients admitted for the treatment of urgent ophthalmic diseases between March 1st, 2020, and June 3rd, 2020, were asked to participate in a questionnaire study. After informed consent was obtained, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire which addressed aspects of their medical history, their health beliefs concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and barriers on their way to the treatment center. The study group was subdivided into two subgroups, depending on the occurrence of their symptoms, before and after the lockdown was ended on April 20th, 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included, 43 in subgroup A (before April 20th) and 50 in subgroup B (April 20th or later). Retinal disorders were the most common causes for admission (approximately 60%).. Only 8 patients (8.6%) experienced a delay between their decision to visit a doctor until the actual examination. Every fourth patient was afraid of a COVID-19 infection, and expected a higher likelihood for an infection at the hospital. Patients with comorbidities tended to be more likely to be afraid of an infection (correlation coefficient 0.183, p = 0.0785) and were significantly more likely to be concerned about problems with organizing follow-up care (corr. Coefficient 0.222, p = 0.0328). Higher age was negatively correlated with fear of infection (corr. Coefficient − 0.218, p-value 0.034). CONCLUSION: In this questionnaire study, only a minority of patients indicated a delay in treatment, regardless of whether symptoms occurred before or after the lockdown before April 20th, 2020. While patients with comorbidities were more concerned about infection and problems during follow-up care, patients of higher age – who have a higher mortality – were less afraid. Protection of high-risk groups should be prioritized during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Exacerbations of asthma not only accelerate the progression of the disease but also increase the incidence of hospitalization and death. Studies have shown that air pollution is a high-risk factor for asthma exacerbations. However, few treatment strategies have been recommended to reduce the risk of severe air pollution-related asthma exacerbations. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-centre, prospective, randomized and standard treatment parallel control clinical trial. Seventy-two asthma patients in the nonexacerbation stage according to GINA guidelines 2017 will be recruited and randomized into the rescue intervention strategy (RIS) group and control group. Original treatments for the participants will include no use of inhaled medicine, the use of short-acting β-agonists (SABA) on demand or the use of budesonide/formoterol (160 μg/4.5 μg/dose, 1–2 dose/time, b.i.d.). The rescue intervention strategy for the RIS group will be budesonide/formoterol plus the original treatment until the severe pollution ends (air quality index, AQI < 200). The control group will maintain the original treatment. The follow-up observation period will last 1 year. The primary outcome is the frequency of asthma exacerbations per year. Secondary outcomes include the mean number of unplanned outpatient visits, emergency visits, hospitalizations, medical costs and mortality caused by asthma exacerbations per patient per year. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide a novel strategy to guide clinical practice in decreasing the risk of asthma exacerbations under severe air pollution.

674396,An Initial Evaluation of the Agreement Between Two SARS-CoV-2 Serologic Assays,2020-07-02,"In this paper, we consider a fuzzy portfolio selection problem with systematic risk and non-systematic risk simultaneously. These two kinds of risks are measured by beta coefficient and random error variance obtained by Sharp Single Index Model. The total risk as the objective of portfolio decision is obtained by weighting the two kinds of risk. Among them, the weight of systematic risk [Formula: see text] is regarded as the degree of investors' attention to system risk in economic sense. In addition, the fuzzy return and the degree of diversification are measured by triangular fuzzy number and entropy, respectively. And they are also considered the goal of investment decisions. Hence, a tri-objective portfolio is proposed in this paper. For the fuzzy objectives in the model, a goal programming method based on fuzzy dominance is proposed, which can help investors better capture the ideal point of fuzzy returns according to their risk preference. Finally, combined with the systematic impact of COVID-19 on the financial market, we make an empirical analysis based on our proposed model. The results show that the total risk will be on the high side when [Formula: see text] value is too large or too small. That means paying too much or little attention to the systematic risk will lead investors to bear more risk. In addition, when investors ignore the systematic risk; that is, the [Formula: see text] value is low, and investors will concentrate their funds in the same industry.","Deng, Xue; Yuan, Yongkang",Soft comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566487/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06226-x,721

This study used the Survey of Income and Program Participation 1996, 2001, and 2004 panels (1996–2007) and a difference-in-difference-in-difference design to follow low-skilled single mothers’ trajectories of welfare use, labor supply, and income for 10 years after the welfare reform and compare how these trajectories differ by stringencies of state work sanction and time limit policies. The findings indicate that welfare reform had sustained impacts on reducing welfare use (TANF and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] program) and increasing employment. Stringent work sanction and time limit policies were associated with lower TANF participation rates in the long term, but only short time limit policies were associated with reduced SNAP participation. Neither stringent policy feature increased employment nor income.

STUDY DESIGN: 12 anonymised CTG traces from 2 hospitals in Spain were retrospectively analysed by 2 independent assessors. CTG parameters were studied based on fetal pathophysiological responses to inflammation and hypoxia that would be expected based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Correlation was made with perinatal outcomes (Apgar score at 5 min and umbilical cord pH). RESULTS: All fetuses showed an increased baseline FHR > 10 percent compared to the initial recording, in addition to absence of accelerations. 10 out of 12 CTG traces (83.3 percent) demonstrated late or prolonged decelerations and 7 out of 12 fetuses (58.3 percent) showed absence of cycling. Not a single case of sinusoidal pattern was observed. ZigZag pattern was found in 4 CTG traces (33 percent). Excessive uterine activity was observed in all CTG traces where uterine activity was monitored (10 out of 12). Apgar scores at 5 min were normal (>7) and absence of metabolic acidosis was found in the umbilical cord arterial pH (pH > 7.0) in the cases that were available (11 and 9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Fetuses of COVID-19 patients showed a raised baseline FHR (>10 percent), loss of accelerations, late decelerations, ZigZag pattern and absence of cycling probably due to the effects of maternal pyrexia, maternal inflammatory response and the “cytokine storm”. However, the perinatal outcomes appear to be favourable. Therefore, healthcare providers should optimise the maternal environment first to rectify the reactive CTG changes instead of performing an urgent operative intervention.","Gracia-Perez-Bonfils, Anna; Martinez-Perez, Oscar; Llurba, Elisa; Chandraharan, Edwin",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.06.049; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211520304243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645644/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211520304243?v=s5,721
676750,Successful vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after maternal vaccination,2021,"Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as key host cell factor for viral entry and pathogenesis of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Specifically, TMPRSS2 proteolytically processes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Protein, enabling virus-host membrane fusion and infection of the lungs. We present here an efficient recombinant production strategy for enzymatically active TMPRSS2 ectodomain enabling enzymatic characterization, and the 1.95 Å X-ray crystal structure. To stabilize the enzyme for co-crystallization, we pre-treated TMPRSS2 with the synthetic protease inhibitor nafamosat to form a stable but slowly reversible (15 hour half-life) phenylguanidino acyl-enzyme complex. Our study provides a structural basis for the potent but non-specific inhibition by nafamostat and identifies distinguishing features of the TMPRSS2 substrate binding pocket that will guide future generations of inhibitors to improve selectivity. TMPRSS2 cleaved recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain at the canonical S1/S2 cleavage site and at least two additional minor sites previously uncharacterized. We established enzymatic activity and inhibition assays that enabled ranking of clinical protease inhibitors with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.7 nM to 120 μM and determination of inhibitor mechanisms of action. These results provide a body of data and reagents to support future drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other type 2 transmembrane serine proteases involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats. SUMMARY PARAGRAPH Viruses hijack the biochemical activity of host proteins for viral invasion and replication. Transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS2) is a surface-expressed protease implicated in the activation of influenza A, influenza B, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to drive efficient infection of the lungs1–5. TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for antiviral therapies, as inhibiting its proteolytic activity blocks efficient viral entry5,6. However, a structural and biochemical understanding of the protease has remained elusive and no selective inhibitors are available. We engineered on-demand activatable TMPRSS2 ectodomain and determined the 1.95 Å X-ray crystal structure of the stabilized acyl-enzyme after treatment with nafamostat, a protease inhibitor under investigation as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The structure reveals unique features of the TMPRSS2 substrate recognition pocket and domain architecture, and explains the potent, but nonselective inhibition by nafamostat. TMPRSS2 efficiently cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the canonical S1/S2 site as well as two minor sites previously uncharacterized. We further established a robust enzymatic assay system and characterized inhibition by two additional clinical protease inhibitors under study for COVID-19, camostat and bromhexine. Our results provide a body of data and reagents to enable ongoing drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2 and other TTSPs involved in viral glycoprotein processing, in order to combat current and future viral threats.","Fraser, Bryan J.; Beldar, Serap; Seitova, Almagul; Hutchinson, Ashley; Mannar, Dhiraj; Li, Yanjun; Kwon, Daniel; Tan, Ruiyan; Wilson, Ryan P.; Leopold, Karoline; Subramaniam, Sriram; Halabelian, Levon; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.; Bénard, François",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.23.449282,721

Similarly, while reopening directly increased mobility by 2 to 3%, all other states’ reopening increased mobility in the focal state by 12 to 21%. Our analysis also suggests geographic spillovers: Travel from locked down origins to open destinations increased by 12 to 29%. In contrast, travel from reopened origins to locked down destinations decreased by 6 to 7% for nearby counties and by 14 to 18% for distant counties.

Subsequent examination of tissues reveal the detection of the virus genome in the intestine and liver, while no detection in the kidney and lung. These results signify the genome stability and implicate the virus survival in decomposed swab samples and in tissues and thereafter in storage solution. Further results also indicate spatial distribution of the virus in tissues during the early stage of infection in the subject with no respiratory distress. Considering the presence of cool, humid, and moist location surrounded by the paddy fields, the presence of virus genome might also indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can persist for more than seven days on the surface of dead bodies similar to the Ebola virus, confirming that transmission from deceased subjects is possible for an extended period after death. These results further reaffirm the robustness of the RT-PCR aiding in the detection of viruses or their genome in decomposed samples when other methods of detection could not be useful. Key Words: SARS-CoV-2, Virus survival, Genome stability, Autolysis, RT-PCR.","Prasad, M.; Ajjamada Nachappa, S.; Anand, N.; Udayawara Rudresh, D.; Singh, Y.; Gangani, S. P.; Bhansali, F.

677201,The Wuhan SARS‐CoV‐2—What's next for China,2020-03-18,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Viral infections have been described to increase the risk of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and to compare the performance of different prognostic models for predicting mortality. PATIENTS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 2211 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through October 1, 2020 in 38 Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with and without cirrhosis. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We evaluated the prognostic performance of different scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis using ROC curves. RESULTS: Overall, 4.6%(CI 3.7-5.6) subjects had cirrhosis (n = 96). Baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class was assessed: CTP-A (23%), CTP-B (45%) and CTP-C (32%); median MELD-Na score was 19 (IQR 14-25). Mortality was 47% in patients with cirrhosis and 16% in patients without cirrhosis (P < .0001). Cirrhosis was independently associated with death [OR 3.1(CI 1.9-4.8); P < .0001], adjusted by age, gender, and body mass index >30. The areas under the ROC curves for performance evaluation in predicting 28-days mortality for Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C), North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD), CTP score and MELD-Na were 0.85, 0.75, 0.69, 0.67; respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis. CLIF-C had better performance in predicting mortality than NACSELD, CTP and MELD-Na in patients with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

677546,Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 virus invading the human placenta using electron microscopy,2020-05-13,"PURPOSE: To summarize the clinical features and effective therapy of severe COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, from January 21, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 350 COVID-19 patients, 13.7% were severe cases. On admission, compared with non-severe patients, more severe patients had a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 3 (58.3% vs 33.8%, P=0.001), D-dimer > 1 mg/L (41.7% vs 13.6%, P<0.0001), higher level of CRP (39.1 mg/L, IQR18.1–75.9 vs 13.4 mg/L, IQR5.0–32.8, P<0.0001), and multiple pneumonia on CT (77.1% vs 18.2%, P<0.0001). All severe patients received oxygen support. 95.8% of them received antivirals, and the most frequent therapy was lopinavir and ritonavir plus human interferon-α2b. Moxifloxacin was used in 70.8% severe patients. The total dosage of methylprednisolone sodium succinate was 640 mg (IQR 360–960) in severe patients, and the duration of use was 8.5 days (IQR 6.8–11.3). The total dosage of immunoglobulin was 80 g (IQR, 60–140) in severe patients, and the duration was 8.0 days (IQR, 6.0–11.5). As of March 15, 2020, 95.8% of the severe patients had been discharged and only two deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: The rate of severe cases and mortality of COVID-19 in Hunan are lower than those in Wuhan. In addition to antivirals and oxygen support, timely interventions including corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and antibiotics, contribute to improving the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Zhou, Zhiguo; Li, Jinhua; Guo, Wei; He, Wenlong; Wang, Yunnian; Xiang, Zhi; Huang, Peng; Zeng, Nanyang; Qin, Qingwu; Chen, Ping; Luo, Hong; Peng, Hong",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s279255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154656/,721

677909,Viral transmission in asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-08-29,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify and describe urologic adverse events and symptoms after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We queried the FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for all reported symptoms following the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as of February 12th, 2021. All urologic symptoms were isolated and the reported adverse events associated with each symptom were reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 15,785 adverse event reports, only 0.7% (113) described urologic symptoms. A total of 156 urologic symptoms were described amongst the 113 adverse event reports. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was responsible for 61% of these reports and the Moderna vaccine was responsible for 39%. These symptoms were grouped into five different categories: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (n=34, 22%), Hematuria (n=22, 14%), Urinary Infection (n=41, 26%), Skin/Soft Tissue (n=16, 10%), and Other (n=43, 28%). The median age of the patients reporting urologic symptoms was 63 years (IQR 44-79, Range: 19-96) and 54% of the patients were female. CONCLUSION: Urologic symptoms reported after COVID-19 vaccination are extremely rare. Given the common prevalence of many of these reported symptoms in the general population, there does not appear to be a correlation between vaccination and urologic symptoms, but as the vaccination criteria expands, further monitoring of the VAERS is needed.","Zhao, Hanson; Souders, Colby; Carmel, Maude; Anger, Jennifer T.",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2021.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429521003253?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864857/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090429521003253,721

This study aimed to explore whether early coagulation tests can predict risk stratification and prognosis. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched electronically for relevant research studies published up to March 24, 2020, producing 24 articles for the final inclusion. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of coagulation parameters at admission were calculated to determine severe and composite endpoint conditions (ICU or death) in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses revealed that platelet count was not statistically related to disease severity and composite endpoint; elevated D-dimer correlated positively with disease severity (SMD 0.787 (0.277-1.298), P= 0.003, I(2)= 96.7%) but had no significant statistical relationship with composite endpoints. Similarly, patients with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) had an increased risk of ICU and increased risk of death (SMD 1.338 (0.551-2.125), P = 0.001, I(2) = 92.7%). Besides, increased fibrin degradation products (FDP) and decreased antithrombin might also mean the disease is worsening. Therefore, early coagulation tests followed by dynamic monitoring is useful for recognizing coagulation disorders accompanied by COVID-19 and guiding timely therapy to improve prognosis.","Luo, Lili; Xu, Min; Du, Mengyi; Kou, Haiming; Liao, Danying; Cheng, Zhipeng; Mei, Heng; Hu, Yu",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860672/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103581,721

However, little is known about the pathogenesis and biomarkers of COVID-19. Herein, we profiled host responses to COVID-19 by performing plasma proteomics of a cohort of COVID-19 patients including non-survivors and survivors recovered from mild or severe symptoms, and uncovered numerous COVID-19-associated alterations of plasma proteins. We developed a machine learning-based pipeline to identify 11 proteins as biomarkers and a set of biomarker combinations, which were validated by an independent cohort and accurately distinguished and predicted COVID-19 outcomes. Some of the biomarkers were further validated by ELISA using a larger cohort. These markedly altered proteins, including the biomarkers mediate pathophysiological pathways such as immune or inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation and coagulation, and metabolism, that likely contribute to the pathogenesis.

Lack of interest and training are considerable barriers preventing code use levels improvement. Tailored training could be the way forward, to break barriers in the uptake of coding; to do so it is paramount to understand coding use of the particular clinicians, to recognise their needs. It should be possible to easily assess text quantity and quality in medical consultations. A tool to measure these parameters, which could be used to tailor training needs and assess change, is demonstrated. The tool is presented and a preliminary study using a randomised sample of five recent consultations from thirteen different clinicians is used as an example. The tool, based on using a word processor and a spread-sheet, allowed quantitative analysis among clinicians while word clouds permitted a qualitative comparison between coded and free text. The average amount of free text per consultation was 68.2 words, (ranging from 25.4 and 130.2 among clinicians); an average of 6% of the text was coded (ranging from 0 to 13%). Patterns among clinicians could be identified. Using Word cloud, a different text use was demonstrated depending on its purpose. Some free text could be turned into code but nomenclature probably prevented some of the codings, like the expression of time. This proof of concept demonstrated that it is possible to calculate what percentage of consultations are coded and what codes are used. This allowed understanding clinicians’ preferences; training needs and gaps in nomenclature.","Millares Martin, Pablo",Health Technol (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520588/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12553-020-00517-3,721

General surgery chief residents were most concerned about the potential delay in the date of board exams, followed by not feeling adequately prepared for the board exams, and a possible delay in the graduation date. While not having enough cases to feel ready for fellowship or job, and not achieving a sufficient number of cases to meet the requirements for graduation were only moderately concerning to chief residents, attending surgeons stressed a greater importance on the loss of the operative experience as nearly all (93.3%) of them suggested a personalized approach for additional general surgery training during fellowship or job onboarding.

Marketing of unhealthy food and beverages has long been identified as a factor in children’s preferences, purchase requests and consumption. Rising global obesity mandates States to craft environments that protect children and young people’s health, as recommended by the World Health Organization, among others. However, assessing the impact of marketing restrictions is particularly challenging: the complexity of digital advertising markets means that measurement challenges are profound. In 2019, the UK Department of Health published an Impact Assessment that applied a novel method aiming to calculate costs and benefits of restricting unhealthy food and beverage advertising on digital devices (planned for implementation by 2022). It estimated UK digital unhealthy marketing to children at 0.73 billion advertising impressions annually, compared to television impacts of 3.6 billion. Aim and Method: We assessed this conclusion by reviewing the UK Department of Health/Kantar Consulting’s Online Baseline Methodology (the “Government Model”). We examined the model’s underlying premise and specified the seven analytic steps undertaken. For each step, we reviewed industry and academic evidence to test its assumptions and the validity of data applied. Results: We found that, in each step, the Government Model’s assumptions, and the data sources selected, result in underestimates of the scale of digital advertising of unhealthy foods—at least tenfold, if not substantially more. The model’s underlying premise is also problematic, as digital advertising spend data relate poorly to digital advertising exposure, leading to further underestimation of market scale. Conclusion: We conclude that the Government Model very substantially underestimates the impact of digital unhealthy food advertising restrictions on health.

Such support should be informed by patient preferences and needs. The objective of this study was to gather information from individuals with tinnitus living in Europe to inform stakeholders of the (a) support they needed in relation to changes associated with the COVID‐19 pandemic and (b) suggestions regarding tinnitus care for the future. METHODS: A cross‐sectional mixed method study design was used using closed and open‐ended questions via an online survey. Data were gathered from 710 adults experiencing tinnitus in Western Europe, with the majority living in The Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Those with tinnitus indicated the following support needs during the pandemic (a) support for tinnitus, (b) support for hearing‐related difficulties, (c) social support and (d) pandemic‐related support. Five directions for future tinnitus care were provided, namely, (a) need for understanding professional support and access to multidisciplinary experts, (b) greater range of therapies and resources, (c) access to more information about tinnitus, (d) prioritising tinnitus research and (e) more support for hearing protection and hearing loss prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for accessible (remote), patient‐centred, suitable and evidence‐based tinnitus care.

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has caused alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests, which also might lead to inefficacy of the available drugs. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. We have performed Molecular Dynamic simulations of three different Spike-ACE2 complexes, namely Wildtype (WT), B.1.1.7 variant (N501Y Spike mutant) and B.1.617 variant (L452R, E484Q Spike mutant) and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our result shows that mutation has caused the increase in the binding energy between the Spike and hACE2. In the case of B.1.617 variant, the mutations at L452R and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the Spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of human antibodies to this Spike variant. Further, we found that the B.1.1.7 variant had increased hydrogen interaction with LYS353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Vipul; Singh, Jasdeep; Hasnain, Seyed E.; Sundar, Durai",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.441933,721

This paper investigates the impact of perceived privacy on cognitive irritation and sleep problems among employees who worked from home during the pandemic. Additionally, we analyzed the role of cognitive irritation as a mediator between privacy and sleep problems. We created a cross-sectional questionnaire, which was completed by 293 employees who performed home-based telework in German-speaking Switzerland. A mediation analysis was then conducted using a multiple regression analysis. A test of the indirect effect showed a significant mediation path from perceived privacy via cognitive irritation to sleep problems. Hence, the negative indirect effect indicates that perceived privacy is an important job resource that may prevent sleep problems. Further research is needed regarding home-based telework and recovery strategies to prevent sleep problems.","Wütschert, Milena Sina; Pereira, Diana; Schulze, Hartmut; Elfering, Achim",Ind Health,https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2021-0119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421105/,721

We here developed a new tool for analyzing virus-transcribed mRNAs, not virus copy numbers, in the data of conventional and single-cell RNA-sequencing of human cells. Our pipeline, named VIRTUS (VIRal Transcript Usage Sensor), was able to detect 763 viruses including herpesviruses, retroviruses, and even SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data. This tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells, the composition of multiple viruses within the cell, and the endogenous host gene expression profile of the cell. This bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses.

Smart homes have the potential to help older adults to live independently and healthy, improving their quality of life, and relieving the pressure on the healthcare and social care systems. For that, we need to understand how older adults live and their needs. Thus, this study aims to analyze the residentially-based lifestyles (RBL) of older adults and segment them to compare and analyze the real needs of smart home functions for each group. To identify a person’s RBL, a questionnaire was designed to include questions about activities at home, social events, quality of life, etc. This study surveyed 271 older Koreans. As a result of the survey on RBL, five groups with different characteristics were clustered. Finally, each groups’ features and the differences in their needs for smart home functions were compared and analyzed. The priority of needed functions for each group was found to be significantly different. In a total of 26 smart home functions, there were meaningful differences in the needs for 16 functions among the groups.

Many questions have been raised about its origin and adaptation to humans. In the present work we performed a genetic analysis of the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses (CoVs) isolated from different hosts in order to trace the evolutionary history of this protein and the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. RESULTS: Based on the sequence analysis of the S gene, we suggest that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is the result of recombination events between bat and pangolin CoVs. The hybrid SARS-CoV-2 ancestor jumped to humans and has been maintained by natural selection. Although the S protein of RaTG13 bat CoV has a high nucleotide identity with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, the phylogenetic tree and the haplotype network suggest a non-direct parental relationship between these CoVs. Moreover, it is likely that the basic function of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein was acquired by the SARS-CoV-2 from the MP789 pangolin CoV by recombination and it has been highly conserved.","Flores-Alanis, Alejandro; Sandner-Miranda, Luisa; Delgado, Gabriela; Cravioto, Alejandro; Morales-Espinosa, Rosario",BMC Res Notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-020-05242-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854762/,721

However, the prevalence of ongoing care needs among those experiencing severe COVID-19 illness is unclear. AIM: This pilot study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining GP attendance trends among patients attending a post-COVID-19 hospital follow-up clinic, 3–6 months after an initial clinic visit. DESIGN & SETTING: Data were collected from adult patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH), Dublin, Ireland. METHOD: Participants completed questionnaires outlining their demographics; medical histories; emergency hospital admissions and readmissions where applicable; and, where relevant, GP attendances following hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Participants’ (n = 153) median age was 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 30.9–52.1 years). There were 105 females (68.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.3% to 75.9%). Various medical histories were reported among participants. Sixty-seven (43.2%, 95% CI = 35.9% to 51.6%) received emergency COVID-19 hospital care. Older adults, males, intensive care unit [ICU] admissions, and readmissions were common among hospital attendees. Of the hospital attendees, 16 (24%, 95% CI = 13.7% to 34.2%) attended GPs within 7 days of hospital discharge, and 26 (39%, 95% CI = 27.3% to 50.7%) within 30 days. Older adults, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and individuals admitted to ICU and/or readmitted to hospital were common among general practice attendees. CONCLUSION: Persistent health issues appear to be common among patients with severe COVID-19, particularly those who are older adults, have pre-existing health problems, and who had been in ICU and/or readmission care.

Objective We aim to discuss clinical, immunological features and breast feeding advices among mother-infant pairs. Study design This observational analysis was conducted in a tertiary center located in Wuhan, China. Pregnant patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who delivered during hospitalization were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and serial specimens of the mother-infant pairs were examined, supplemented with follow-ups regarding recovery and breast feeding. Results 14 pregnant patients had live birth and achieved good recovery, four patients continued breast feeding with precautions, no neonatal infection was found. No infants observed developed COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Common maternal symptoms were fever (11/14, 78.1%) and cough (6/14, 42.9%), a pregnancy specific symptom was abnormal fetal movement, noticed in three (21.4%) patients. The mean viral shedding time was nine days (SD 6, range 1-22), SARS- CoV- 2 genome was non-detected in breast milk or maternal vaginal secretions. Immunological assay showed seroconversion of IgM on day eight of onset, IgG on day 28. Both IgM and IgM antibodies to SARS- CoV- 2 are detected in breast milk, cord blood and neonatal serum. Conclusion The study suggested passive acquisition of antibody against SARS- CoV- 2 through breast milk ingestion. Breast feeding role is low risk in transmission of SARS- CoV- 2 or cause maternal disease escalation, continue breast feeding with prudent precautions is encouraged.","Gao, Xuan; Wang, Shaoshuai; Zeng, Wanjiang; Chen, Suhua; Wu, Jianli; Lin, Xingguang; Liu, Yanyan; Sun, Ziyong; Feng, Ling",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520301049?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520301049; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904990/,721
685835,SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing for an entire rural community: methods and feasibility of high-throughput testing procedures,2021-07-07,"BACKGROUND: We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China—where the outbreak started—seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known. METHODS: To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work referred initially to the situation in Spain as of February 28, 2020, where a few dozens of cases had been detected, but has been updated to match the current situation as of 13 April. We implemented an SEIR metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. RESULTS: Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which, although might not be sufficient for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many quantitative aspects of the natural history of the disease are still unknown, such as the amount of possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. However, preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be ready for quick and efficacious deployment globally. The scenarios evaluated here through data-driven simulations indicate that measures aimed at reducing individuals’ flow are much less effective than others intended for early case identification and isolation. Therefore, resources should be directed towards detecting as many and as fast as possible the new cases and isolate them.","Aleta, Alberto; Moreno, Yamir",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01619-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456689/,721

However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing. METHODS: During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidel’s Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks. RESULTS: In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and distinct from viruses circulating in Team 1’s community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition in Team 2’s community. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlight the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.","Moreno, Gage K; Braun, Katarina M; Pray, Ian W; Segaloff, Hannah E; Lim, Ailam; Poulsen, Keith; Meiman, Jonathan; Borcher, James; Westergaard, Ryan P; Moll, Michael K; Friedrich, Thomas C; O’Connor, David H",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977295/,721

Unfortunately, false negative test results are often reported. In this study, we attempted to determine the principal causes leading to false negative results of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in respiratory tract specimens. Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%–95.26%) and specificity (83.72%–98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality. In addition, our results demonstrated that false negativity accounted for a vast majority of contradicting results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA test by RT-PCR.

We examined the pathogenic effects of the viruses in chicken embryos and the size and morphology of the virus particles, performed phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene and complete genomic sequences, and examined the antibody responses against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis by studying the complete genomic sequences of PhCoVs from different outbreaks and the pathogenicity of IBVs in pheasants to compare and clarify the relationships between PhCoVs and IBVs.","Han, Zongxi; Liwen, Xu; Ren, Mengting; Sheng, Jie; Ma, Tianxin; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519309253; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519309253; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31902509/,721

Results and Discussion: We got a total of 177 responses and all the answers were analysed on per question basis. 60% of those who participated were doctors, followed by nurses (32%) and rest were lab personnel and other health care workers. 66% of participants belonged to the age group 31-45 years, followed by 22% belonging to 20-30 years, 11% belonged to 46-60 years and none were above 60 years of age.56% were males and rest were females. 73% were married and rest were single. Among all those who participated in this survey two thirds were not diverted to frontline Covid 19 patient care. Only one third (33.9%) were actually redirected to direct care of Covid 19 patients in their respective set-ups. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 being minimal to 10 being extremely high needing help, anxiety was scored. 48% of all scored themselves with an anxiety level of 4-6. 15% each scored for 1-3 and 7-9. 5% faced extreme anxiety needing help. 36% had moderate fear of infecting their family members. 30% and 18% had mild and severe fear, respectively. When enquired about the type of symptoms experienced by them, the most common reply was that they felt low and were depressed. Many experience sleep disturbances with increase in irritability, restlessness and health anxiety for Covid. Surprisingly, 40% denied any such symptoms at all. Adjustment and adaptability with the changing environment are a deciding factor on the mental well-being of everyone. Most popular method was avoiding frequent news updates (52.5%), followed by learning new skills and connecting with family and friends (47.5%). Least popular modality was resorting to healthy distraction (28%). 17% of all participants felt a need for psychological consultation for themselves, 3.4% wanted consultation for their family members and 3.4% wanted such consultation for both themselves and their family members too. Among those who wanted professional help 58% preferred tele-consultation and rest aspired for personal consultation. Conclusion: The above responses show that work place stress has increased among hematology health care workers in the current pandemic situation which in broad terms is true for any specialty. A mental burnout and fatigue is setting among healthcare workers in this part of the country as COVID19 seems like a chronic story now. It is advisable to keep psychological help ready for all those involved in frontline Covid 19 health care. Its high time hospital administrators start taking notice this aspect of healthcare workers and start working on creating a positive work environment.

688311,First case of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2,2020-05-05,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one third of human patients. In recent years, several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prophylaxis in prospective human epidemics. In the current study, eight human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing and non-neutralizing capabilities, directed against different epitopes of the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (MERS-S) protein, were investigated with regard to their ability to immunohistochemically detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV experimentally infected alpacas. The most intense immunoreaction was detected using a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain S1B of the MERS-S protein, which produced an immunosignal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and along the apical membranous region. A similar staining was obtained by two other mAbs which recognize the sialic acid-binding domain and the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2, respectively. Five mAbs lacked immunoreactivity for MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue, even though they belong, at least in part, to the same epitope group. In summary, three tested human mAbs demonstrated capacity for detection of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE samples and may be implemented in double or triple immunohistochemical methods.","Haverkamp, Ann-Kathrin; Bosch, Berend J.; Spitzbarth, Ingo; Lehmbecker, Annika; Te, Nigeer; Bensaid, Albert; Segalés, Joaquim; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31526954/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242719301710; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242719301710; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2019.109939,721
688792,Update on Functional Inhibitors of Acid Sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-07-18,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a structural reorganization was imposed on public health systems. Psychiatry services were also affected with the imposed reduction of non-urgent consultations. We aim to explore the effect of these changes on a Psychiatry Emergency Service during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients admitted to our Psychiatric Emergency Service 90 days before and after March 14(th), 2020, the first day of lockdown in Spain. Extracted data were compared between the two periods. Poisson regression analysis was performed to analyze changes in admission rates. Results: 1,958 psychiatric emergency admissions were analyzed. Although the number of admissions decreased by 37.9%, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of acute psychiatric hospitalization during the lockdown. Anxiety spectrum disorders accumulated the greatest significant decrease in admission rates during the lockdown. On the other hand, a significant increase in admissions rates was found in patients with dementia, autism spectrum disorders, and substance use disorders during the lockdown. Limitations: This study was conducted in a single psychiatric emergency service, preventing a generalization of our results. The comparison time period might have biased our results due to the influence of external factors. Conclusion: Mental health consequences of COVID-19 are becoming apparent. A reduction of admission rates for anxiety disorders might be related telepsychiatry implementation during the lockdown. Other conditions particularly vulnerable to the routine changes and lack of social support have suffered the most, and efforts should be placed to treat these situations.","Gómez-Ramiro, Marta; Fico, Giovanna; Anmella, Gerard; Vázquez, Mireia; Sagué-Vilavella, Maria; Hidalgo-Mazzei, Diego; Pacchiarotti, Isabella; Garriga, Marina; Murru, Andrea; Parellada, Eduard; Vieta, Eduard",J Affect Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387743/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720331475; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720331475?v=s5,721

689477,Fecal Shedding of SARS CoV-2: Implications for Disease Spread and Quarantine,2020-04-11,"BACKGROUND: The sudden shift into distance learning during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown might have impacted university students' well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate undergraduate healthcare university students' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its predictors during COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire. The study targeted undergraduate medical, dental, pharmacy, and nursing students at Jordanian universities. Data collected included demographics,12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12), students' evaluation of distance learning, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize primary outcome measures data. Predictors of HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable regression analysis. RESULTS: In total, 485 university students successfully completed this study with a mean age of 20.6 (±2.0). Participants' HRQoL level measured by SF-12 mean scores were 66.5 (±20.2) for physical health component and 44.8 (±21.2) for mental health component. The regression model explained 65.5% of the variation (r2â=â0.655, Fâ=â127.8, Pâ<â0.001) in participants' HRQoL. Factors significantly associated with HRQoL included depression, neck disability index score, stress, health self-evaluation, average of satisfaction with distance learning, IPAQ score, and weekly studying hours. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that healthcare students had a relatively low level of HRQoL during COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. Academic and non-academic factors associated with HRQoL were identified and should be considered by healthcare educational institutions for better academic planning in future similar pandemics.","Almhdawi, Khader A; Alazrai, Alza; Obeidat, Donia; Altarifi, Ahmad A; Oteir, Alaa O; Aljammal, Ashraf H; Arabiat, Alaa A; Alrabbaie, Hassan; Jaber, Hanan; Almousa, Khaled M",Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487002/; https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205309,721
689612,HIV and the Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected utilization of preventative health care, including vaccines. We aimed to assess HPV vaccination rates during the pandemic, and conduct a simulation model-based analysis to estimate the impact of current coverage and future pandemic recovery scenarios on disease outcomes. The model population included females and males of all ages in the US. The model compares pre-COVID vaccine uptake to 3 reduced coverage scenarios with varying recovery speed. Vaccine coverage was obtained from Truven Marketscan™. Substantially reduced coverage between March-August 2020 was observed compared to 2018–2019. The model predicted that 130,853 to 213,926 additional cases of genital warts; 22,503 to 48,157 cases of CIN1; 48,682 to 110,192 cases of CIN2/3; and 2,882 to 6,487 cases of cervical cancer will occur over the next 100 years, compared to status quo.

689751,Review of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen and Antibody Testing in Diagnosis and Community Surveillance,2021-06-23,"AIMS: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of fasting hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were performed up until February 18, 2021. Fasting hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose level above the reference value. The outcome of interest was poor outcome, which was a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. The effect estimate was in odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 9045 patients from 12 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The prevalence of fasting hyperglycemia was 29%. The incidence of poor outcome was 15%. Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 4.72 [3.32, 6.72], p < 0.001; I(2): 69.8%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis in patients without prior history of diabetes showed that fasting hyperglycemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 (OR 3.387 [2.433, 4.714], p < 0.001; I(2): 0, p = 0.90). Fasting hyperglycemia has a sensitivity of 0.57 [0.45, 0.68], specificity of 0.78 [0.70, 0.84], PLR of 2.6 [2.0, 3.3], NLR of 0.55 [0.44, 0.69], DOR of 5 [3, 7], and AUC of 0.74 [0.70, 0.78] for predicting poor outcome. In this pooled analysis, fasting hyperglycemia has a 32% post-test probability for poor outcome, and absence of fasting hyperglycemia confers to a 9% post-test probability. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity varies by chronic kidney disease but not by age, male (gender), hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients, with or without diabetes.
