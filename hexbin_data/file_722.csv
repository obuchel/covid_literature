10425,Regulation of Tobamovirus Gene Expression,2008-04-11,The influence of the pH of urine on the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) by the shell vial assay was evaluated. The pH values of 295 urine specimens ranged from 4.7 to 8.5 (mean 6.3) and were not significantly different in culture-positive versus culture-negative samples. None of the urine specimens appeared to be toxic for the cells used in the shell vial assay. We recommend inoculation of urine specimens into shell vials without adjustment of pH.,"Gray, Larry D.; Ilstrup, Duane M.; Smith, Thomas F.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172990/,722

22892,Antibodies for Middle East virus,2014-05-07,"As simple organisms with a parasite nature, viruses have become masters in manipulating and subvert cellular components, including host proteins and organelles, to improve viral replication. Therefore, the understanding of viral strategies to manipulate cell function disrupting plant defenses and enhancing viral infection cycles is fundamental to the production of virus-resistant plant lines. After invading susceptible plants, viruses create conditions that favor local and systemic infections by suppressing multiple layers of innate host defenses while use cellular machinery to own benefit. Viral interference in interlinked essential cellular functions results in phenotypic changes and disease symptoms, which debilitates plants favoring infection establishment. Herein in this review, the novelty it will be the discussion about the strategies used by (+) single strand RNA viruses to affect cellular processes and components to improve viral replication, in parallel to overcome plant defenses, favoring disease establishment by applying in one action using the same viral protein to coordinate viral replication and breaking down plant defense. This focus on plant-virus interaction was never done before, and this knowledge has the potential to help in the development of new strategies to produce resistant plants.","Souza, Pedro Filho Noronha; Carvalho, Fabricio Eulálio Leite",J Plant Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090608/,722

60740,Development and validation of a rapid immunochromatographic assay for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antigen in dromedary camels.,2015,"Movement ecology as an integrative discipline has advanced associated fields because it presents not only a conceptual framework for understanding movement principles but also helps formulate predictions about the consequences of movements for animals and their environments. Here, we synthesize recent studies on principles and patterns of bat movements in context of the movement ecology paradigm. The motion capacity of bats is defined by their highly articulated, flexible wings. Power production during flight follows a U-shaped curve in relation to speed in bats yet, in contrast to birds, bats use mostly exogenous nutrients for sustained flight. The navigation capacity of most bats is dominated by the echolocation system, yet other sensory modalities, including an iron-based magnetic sense, may contribute to navigation depending on a bat's familiarity with the terrain. Patterns derived from these capacities relate to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions with food items. The navigation capacity of bats may influence their sociality, in particular, the extent of group foraging based on eavesdropping on conspecifics' echolocation calls. We infer that understanding the movement ecology of bats within the framework of the movement ecology paradigm provides new insights into ecological processes mediated by bats, from ecosystem services to diseases.","Voigt, Christian C; Frick, Winifred F; Holderied, Marc W; Holland, Richard; Kerth, Gerald; Mello, Marco A R; Plowright, Raina K; Swartz, Sharon; Yovel, Yossi",The Quarterly review of biology,https://doi.org/10.1086/693847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861509/,722

The highest-price physicians were paid more than twice as much per service, on average, as the lowest-price physicians were. Total annual costs for patients of the highest-price physicians were $996 (20 percent) higher than costs for patients of the lowest-price physicians were, and this variation was not explained by differences in use. Physician prices were not associated with quality: Among physicians in the same hospital referral region, we did not find significant differences between patients of the highest-price physicians and patients of lowest-price physicians in the likelihood of experiencing an ambulatory care-sensitive hospitalization or being readmitted within thirty days of hospital discharge. There were also no differences between the highest- and lowest-price physicians for these quality outcomes for high-need patients.

80241,Increased Pathogenicity and Virulence of Virus in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Clade B in Vitro and in Vivo.,2020-05-20,"We investigated recurrence pattern and oncologic outcomes after treatment of metachronous isolated liver metastases from colorectal cancer according to treatment modality.We retrospectively analyzed 123 patients treated with hepatic resection and 82 patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for metachronous isolated hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (HMCRC). We compared clinicopathological data, recurrence pattern, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after the treatment of hepatic metastasis between patients treated with RFA and resection.The patients in the 2 groups were similar in gender, location of primary tumor, disease-free interval to hepatic metastasis, pathologic stage of primary tumor, and number of hepatic metastasis. The age was older in RFA group but it was not statistically different. The mean diameter of the largest hepatic mass was greater in the resection group than in the RFA group (3.1 vs 1.9 cm, P < 0.001). Chemotherapy after the treatment of hepatic metastasis was more commonly given in hepatic resection group (76.4% vs 62.2%, P = 0.04). Recurrence after the treatment of hepatic metastasis was not significantly different between the 2 groups (54.5% vs 65.9% in the resection and RFA groups). However, intrahepatic recurrence without extra-hepatic metastases was more common in the RFA group than in the resection group (47.5% vs 12.1%, P < 0.001). The RFS rate after the treatment of hepatic metastasis was significantly higher in resection group (48.6% vs 33.7%, P = 0.015). The size and number of hepatic metastasis, primary tumor stage, disease-free interval to hepatic metastasis, and the modality of treatment (RFA vs resection) for hepatic metastasis were confirmed as associated factors with re-recurrence after the treatment of hepatic metastasis. Among patients with solitary hepatic metastases of ≤3 cm, marginal recurrence was higher in the RFA group (3% vs 17.2%) and re-RFA was performed to achieve comparable recurrence rate (3% vs 5.2%, P = 0.662), the RFS rate was not different between the resection and RFA group (52.4% vs 53.4%, P = 0.491).Surgical resection for HMCRC showed higher RFS. However, the RFS rate in patients with a solitary hepatic metastasis of ≤3 cm was similar between the resection and RFA groups.","Lee, Byoung Chul; Lee, Hyun Gu; Park, In Ja; Kim, So Yeon; Kim, Ki-Hun; Lee, Jae Hoon; Kim, Chan Wook; Lee, Jong Lyul; Yoon, Yong Sik; Lim, Seok-Byung; Yu, Chang Sik; Kim, Jin Cheon",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000004999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27684857/,722

To better understand technology access among residents of affordable senior housing, we surveyed members of a national association of resident service coordinators to assess their experiences working with residents during the pandemic (n = 1,440). While nearly all service coordinators report that most or all residents have reliable phone access, under a quarter report that most or all have reliable internet access; they also report limited access to technology for video calls. Lack of internet access and technology literacy are perceived as barriers to medical visits and food procurement for low-income older adult residents of affordable housing.

RESULTS Including only those papers that focused on children or adolescent's mental health in association with respiratory infectious outbreaks, 11 articles were identified. The majority of research utilized qualitative or retrospective hospital record data. Children and adolescents reported fear and anxiety, as well as disruptions to their day to day routines as a result of outbreaks. However, children were also able to demonstrate resilience during outbreaks with the right support. CONCLUSIONS Children's psychological response to the outbreak appeared to be largely attributed to how their parents, healthcare providers and the media communicated the event.

109758,The receptor binding domain of the new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus maps to a 231-residue region in the spike protein that efficiently elicits neutralizing antibodies.,2013,"Coronavirus (CoV) 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), located in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), processes the replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab) at 11 specific sites to produce 12 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp5 to nsp16). Structural and biochemical studies suggest that a conserved Gln residue at the P1 position is absolutely required for efficient cleavage. Here, we investigate the effects of amino acid substitution at the P1 position of 3CLpro cleavage sites of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) on the cleavage efficiency and viral replication by in vitro cleavage assays and reverse genetic approaches. Our results demonstrated that a P1-Asn substitution at the nsp4-5/Q2779, nsp5-6/Q3086, nsp7-8/Q3462, nsp8-9/Q3672, and nsp9-10/Q3783 sites, a P1-Glu substitution at the nsp8-9/Q3672 site, and a P1-His substitution at the nsp15-16/Q6327 site were tolerated and allowed recovery of infectious mutant viruses, albeit with variable degrees of growth defects. In contrast, a P1-Asn substitution at the nsp6-7/Q3379, nsp12-13/Q4868, nsp13-14/Q5468, and nsp14-15/Q5989 sites, as well as a P1-Pro substitution at the nsp15-16/Q6327 site, abolished 3CLpro-mediated cleavage at the corresponding position and blocked the recovery of infectious viruses. Analysis of the effects of these lethal mutations on RNA synthesis suggested that processing intermediates, such as the nsp6-7, nsp12-13, nsp13-14, nsp14-15, and nsp15-16 precursors, may function in negative-stranded genomic RNA replication, whereas mature proteins may be required for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcription. More interestingly, a mutant 3CLpro with either a P166S or P166L mutation was selected when an IBV infectious cDNA clone carrying the Q6327N mutation at the nsp15-16 site was introduced into cells. Either of the two mutations was proved to enhance significantly the 3CLpro-mediated cleavage efficiency at the nsp15-16 site with a P1-Asn substitution and compensate for the detrimental effects on recovery of infectious virus.","Fang, Shouguo; Shen, Hongyuan; Wang, Jibin; Tay, Felicia P L; Liu, Ding Xiang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02490-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444893/,722
110835,Influence of intraoperative neuromonitoring on surgeons' technique during thyroidectomy.,2011,"It is postulated that intraoperative injury to the cavernosal nerves results in hemodynamic and histologic changes within the penis, which manifest clinically as ED. We hypothesize that non-neuronal cause, such as vascular insults due to intraoperative tissue handling, may also have a minor but definite role in penile ischemia and consequent postoperative sexual dysfunction. Between May 2008 and July 2008, 64 patients were enrolled in the study (group 1). Following sterilization, the Odissey Tissue Oximeter probe was placed on the shaft of the penis, 2 cm from its base. The patient underwent continuous penile tissue saturation monitoring. Surgical dissection was altered whenever the oxygen saturation alarm went off until it was restored to 85%. In addition, 192 patients, matched for age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, baseline sexual function, Charlson comorbidity index and nerve-sparing status operated between October 2007 and July 2008, formed the control group (group 2). These patients did not have any intraoperative tissue oxygenation monitoring. Opening of the endopelvic fascia and steps of nerve sparing were associated with significant drops in oxygen levels, especially if done using torque. Drop in oxygen levels were also noted whenever excessive traction was applied on the Foley catheter, seminal vesicles or prostate during apical dissection. We deliberately modified our surgical steps to make surgery more traction free. A significantly higher percentage of group 1 patients with bilateral nerve sparing had no ED compared with group 2 patients at 6 weeks (24.5% vs 10.4%; P=0.014) and 52 weeks (83.7% vs 68%; P=0.029). Overall, 93.9% of patients in study group had Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score of 17 (mild to no ED) at 1 year compared with 78.4% of patients in the control group. We demonstrated that avoidance of ischemic stress, aided by intraoperative penile oxygenation monitoring, may help surgeons improve their technique and thus functional outcomes in patients.","Tewari, A; Srivastava, A; Sooriakumaran, P; Grover, S; Dorsey, P; Leung, R",International journal of impotence research,https://doi.org/10.1038/ijir.2011.40; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21850014/,722
130809,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection mediated by the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2.,2013,"BACKGROUND Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics suggest that DETECTR, a combination of reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and subsequent Cas12 bystander nuclease activation by amplicon-targeting ribonucleoprotein complexes, could be a faster and cheaper alternative to quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) without sacrificing sensitivity and/or specificity. METHODS In this study, we compare DETECTR with qRT-PCR to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 on 378 patient samples. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared with qRT-PCR; however, this was not confirmed in this large patient cohort, where we report 95% reproducibility between the 2 tests. RESULTS These data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) providing additional value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different guide ribonucleic acids can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point-of-care test, showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. More importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 relative to other human coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS Because there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR platforms for routine non-SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","Brandsma, Eelke; Verhagen, Han J M P; van de Laar, Thijs J W; Claas, Eric C J; Cornelissen, Marion; van den Akker, Emile",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535237/,722
132555,Clinical characteristics of two human-to-human transmitted coronaviruses: Corona Virus Disease 2019 vs. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,2020-05-01,"AIM The scar of cesarean section (CS) is the most common site of abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE), whose tumor degeneration has been reported in an increasing number of cases; the most frequent histological type is clear cell carcinoma (CCC). METHODS We conducted a systematic research of the literature, collecting data regarding the evidence on tumor degeneration from AWE after CS. Moreover, we reported a case of clear cell borderline tumor (CCBT) originating from AWE. RESULTS We included data of 37 patients with diagnosis of CCC. The average time between the last CS and the diagnosis of CCC was around 15 years. Overall, 26.0% and 73.9% patients received exclusive local abdominal resection of the lesion and additional surgery, respectively. Lymph nodes involvement was detected in 26.0 % patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 52.0 % cases. During follow-up period, 15.2% patients died of disease, 32.6% had no evidence of disease, and 17.4% recurred. We diagnosed a CCBT arose in a patients with AWE and a personal history of several surgical procedures for endometriosis, a CS and a subsequent transverse laparotomy. We performed an open bilateral ovariectomy and a large excision of the endometriotic abdominal lesion. CONCLUSION Tumor degeneration from AWE seems to be a real occurrence with an increasing number of events. Considering the lack of risk factors and diagnostic instruments for tumor degeneration, the removal of AWE localization could be advisable, even though there was long average time between the trigger surgery and the tumor finding.","Ferrari, Federico; Valenti, Gaetano; Forte, Sara; Ardighieri, Laura; Iraci Sareri, Marco; Barra, Fabio; Sartori, Enrico; Odicino, Franco",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442929/,722
140215,"Proteolytic processing, deubiquitinase and interferon antagonist activities of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease.",2014,"BACKGROUND In 2015, five randomised trials showed efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy over standard medical care in patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. In this meta-analysis we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool individual patient data from these trials to address remaining questions about whether the therapy is efficacious across the diverse populations included. METHODS We formed the HERMES collaboration to pool patient-level data from five trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA) done between December, 2010, and December, 2014. In these trials, patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior artery circulation were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular thrombectomy within 12 h of symptom onset or standard care (control), with a primary outcome of reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. By direct access to the study databases, we extracted individual patient data that we used to assess the primary outcome of reduced disability on mRS at 90 days in the pooled population and examine heterogeneity of this treatment effect across prespecified subgroups. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with random effects for parameters of interest. We then used mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to calculate common odds ratios (cOR) for the primary outcome in the whole population (shift analysis) and in subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), site of occlusion (internal carotid artery vs M1 segment of middle cerebral artery vs M2 segment of middle cerebral artery), intravenous alteplase (yes vs no), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, and time from stroke onset to randomisation. FINDINGS We analysed individual data for 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascular thrombectomy, 653 assigned to control). Endovascular thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability at 90 days compared with control (adjusted cOR 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53; p<0.0001). The number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on mRS for one patient was 2.6. Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups for reduced disability (pinteraction=0.43). Effect sizes favouring endovascular thrombectomy over control were present in several strata of special interest, including in patients aged 80 years or older (cOR 3.68, 95% CI 1.95-6.92), those randomised more than 300 min after symptom onset (1.76, 1.05-2.97), and those not eligible for intravenous alteplase (2.43, 1.30-4.55). Mortality at 90 days and risk of parenchymal haematoma and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ between populations. INTERPRETATION Endovascular thrombectomy is of benefit to most patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation, irrespective of patient characteristics or geographical location. These findings will have global implications on structuring systems of care to provide timely treatment to patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion.

We evaluated 3 traditional health services metrics of hospital performance: time from consult request to consult completion, inpatient length of stay (LOS), and the rate of patients transferred for tertiary care. Methods Medical records (n = 899) from 3 community hospitals and our TN consultation database were retrospectively reviewed during the 2 years before (n = 703, 3 hospitals) and 4 months (n = 2 hospitals) to 2 years (n = 1 hospital) after implementation (n = 196) of a TN program for routine and urgent consult requests. Consult order time, consult completion time, total length of stay and discharge disposition were compared across the pre-TN implementation group, which consisted of in-person consultations and the post-TN implementation group, which consisted of TN consultations only. Results After TN implementation, median length of stay decreased 28% (3.9 vs. 2.8 days, p < 0.0001) and median time from consult order to consult completion decreased by 74% across all diagnoses (5.8 vs. 1.5 hours, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients discharged home (52.3% vs. 56.1%, p = 0.10) or transferred to tertiary care (6.1% to 9.2%, p = 0.10). Conclusions Implementation of TN program was associated with significant reductions in LOS and time to consultation completion without an increase in shunting of patients to more advanced facilities. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings in independent cohorts and other models of teleneurology delivery.","McCormick, Robert; Estrada, Juan; Whitney, Cynthia; Hinrichsen, Mona; Lee, Patrick T; Cohen, Adam B; Schwamm, Lee; Matiello, Marcelo",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/19418744211000951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163548/,722

OBJECTIVES To describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Iraq, the government's response to the pandemic, and provide recommendations for further action. METHODS A desk review of secondary data using the available reports on the epidemiological situation in Iraq as well as official governmental sources was conducted. RESULTS The major surge in the number of COVID-19 cases occurred in the first week of June and continued to increase dramatically until mid-October when a significant decrease happened. With a few exceptions, the reproductive number R has been consistently above 1. Patients aged 30-39 years (25.6%) were the most affected, while those aged 60-69 years (26.7%) had the highest deaths rates. Iraq tried to contain the pandemic through several regulations: border control, enforcing curfew, mask-wearing, and social distancing, COVID-19 isolation centers, expanding lab capacity, contact tracing, as well as several supportive economic measures.

Despite variations in residency size, hospital setting, and patient population, PDs from eight residencies in ""the epicenter"" found uniformity in many of the lessons learned. Here we present those lessons and suggestions for high-yield preparation for running a residency during a surge. Of particular importance were frequent, transparent communication and stepwise staffing plans. Illness of residents and other staff occurred early and were substantially reduced as personal protective equipment protocols tightened. Wellness was compromised by anxiety and illness, with varying timelines. New, rich educational opportunities emerged. All programs declared ACGME pandemic status but remained able to maintain some educational offerings. Planning ahead for future surges can significantly reduce the real-time burden for residency leadership, which is particularly important as clinical demands on leadership may also increase with a surge.","Rabin, Elaine; Willis, James; Alexander, Dorian; Steinberg, Eric; Chung, Arlene; Kulkarni, Miriam; He, Chen; Parikh, Saumil",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150276/,722

This article discusses how to locate people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases quickly and determine the risk of infection. From the perspective of the government, this work proposes a multi-snapshot multi-stage minority K-means (3M K-means) algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data and considerably improves the speed of clustering by quickly ignoring the excluded risk classes and points in the process in the early stages, whereas traditional algorithms involve with O(N2) computational complexity which needs several days, impracticably for the COVID-19 urgent situations. The 3M algorithm greatly cuts down the computational time, thereof making the rapid warning of close contacts practicable. The methods are simple, yet efficient and practicable for the COVID-19 urgent situations The use of this algorithm can help control the COVID-19 epidemic, achieve significant cost savings, and provide the psychological guarantee of people for work resumption.","Liang, X.; Feng, Z.

In the part of estimation, we obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates and approximate confidence intervals of the model parameters using dgos, in particular, based on order statistics and lower record values. The Bayes estimate is derived with respect to a squared error loss function using gamma priors. The highest posterior density credible interval is computed based on the MH algorithm. Furthermore, the explicit expressions for single and product moments of dgos from this distribution are also derived. Based on order statistics and lower records, a simulation study is carried out to check the efficiency of these estimators. Two real life data sets, one is for order statistics and another is for lower record values have been analyzed to demonstrate how the proposed methods may work in practice. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Birds receiving in ovo DNA followed by live virus vaccination at 2 wk of age were 100% protected from clinical disease. Birds receiving only live virus vaccine or only in ovo DNA vaccination were < or = 80% protected. IBV was detected up to 10 days postchallenge in unvaccinated control groups, whereas birds receiving in ovo DNA and live virus vaccination cleared IBV from tracheal samples before day 5 postchallenge. Transcription of the S1 gene was confirmed in lung tissue after in ovo vaccination by an antisense riboprobe, and the S1 protein was detected by immunohistology in the heart and bursa. In a separate experiment, birds were injected intramuscularly with either 50, 100, or 150 microg of the DNA vaccine at 1 day of age and then again with either 100, 200, or 300 microg of the DNA vaccine, respectively, at 14 days of age. At 10 days postchallenge, no clinical signs were observed and no challenge virus was reisolated from the birds vaccinated with 150 microg and 300 microg of DNA. Between DNA-vaccinated birds and nonvaccinated control birds, no statistical differences were observed for IBV-specific serum antibodies as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or the virus neutralization test. These data indicate that DNA vaccination with the S1 gene either in ovo or intramuscularly can provide birds with some protection against clinical disease after homologous IBV challenge.","Kapczynski, Darrell R; Hilt, Deborah A; Shapiro, David; Sellers, Holly S; Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12887187/,722

Translation products, identified by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against recombinant C-terminal ORF-1a fragments, include the full-length 101 kDa (p101) protein and a 38 kDa band (p38). In addition, a 64 kDa protein (p64) was immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG antibody when a FLAG epitope was inserted at the N terminus of the ORF-1a product. Mutation of the amino acids predicted to form the catalytic triad of the HAstV-1 3C-like serine protease (Ser-551, Asp-489, His-461) resulted in undetectable levels of p38, supporting the involvement of the HAstV-1 3C-like serine protease and the importance of these amino acids in the processing of p101 into p38 and p64. N-terminal deletions of up to 420 aa of p101 that did not involve the predicted 3C-like serine protease motif did not alter levels of p38 compared to wild-type. C-terminal deletion analysis localized p38 to the C terminus of ORF-1a. Mutation of the P1 residue of the predicted cleavage site, which is conserved among known human and sheep astrovirus sequences, resulted in no detectable p38, supporting cleavage at the Gln-567/Thr-568 dipeptide. These results suggest that p101 is cleaved into an N-terminal p64 fragment and a C-terminal p38 product at Gln-567/Thr-568 in a process that is dependent on the viral 3C-like serine protease.","Kiang, David; Matsui, Suzanne M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752697/,722

Several sigma-1 receptor (Sig1R) ligands have been demonstrated to regulate the seizure threshold in acute and chronic seizure models. However, the mechanism by which Sig1R modulates the excitatory and inhibitory pathways in the brain has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility to seizures of wild type (WT) and Sig1R knockout (Sig1R-/-) mice in intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and (+)-bicuculline (BIC) infusion-induced acute seizure and Sig1R antagonist NE-100-induced seizure models. To determine possible molecular mechanisms, we used quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to assess the possible involvement of several seizure-related genes and proteins. Peripheral tissue contractile response of WT and Sig1R-/- mice was studied in an isolated vasa deferentia model. The most important finding was the significantly decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor in the hippocampus and habenula of Sig1R-/- mice. Our results demonstrated that Sig1R-/- mice have decreased thresholds for PTZ- and BIC-induced tonic seizures. In the NE-100-induced seizure model, Sig1R-/- animals demonstrated lower seizure scores, shorter durations and increased latency times of seizures compared to WT mice. Sig1R-independent activities of NE-100 included downregulation of the gene expression of iNOS and GABA-A Î³2 and inhibition of KCl-induced depolarization in both WT and Sig1R-/- animals. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the lack of Sig1R resulted in decreased expression of the R2 subunit of the GABA-B receptor and increased susceptibility to seizures. Our results confirm that Sig1R is a significant molecular target for seizure modulation and warrants further investigation for the development of novel anti-seizure drugs.","Vavers, Edijs; Zvejniece, Baiba; Stelfa, Gundega; Svalbe, Baiba; Vilks, Karlis; Kupats, Einars; Mezapuke, Rudolfs; Lauberte, Lasma; Dambrova, Maija; Zvejniece, Liga",Neurobiol Dis,,722

Main outcome was defined as the cumulative number of cases of Covid-19 in the 14 days following the date when > 10 cumulative cases were reported. Negative binomial mixed effect models were applied to estimate the associations between the outcome and long-term exposure to air pollution at the regional level (PM10, PM2.5), after adjusting for relevant regional and country level covariates and spatial correlation.

Within that population, healthcare workers are at a high risk of back pain. Though they often demonstrate awkward postures and impaired balance in comparison with healthy workers, there is no clear relationship between compensatory postural responses to unpredictable stimuli and the strength of related muscle groups, in particular in individuals with mild to moderate back pain. This paper presents a study protocol that aims to evaluate the relationship between peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the center of pressure (CoP) and corresponding time from peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the CoP after sudden external perturbations and peak force during a maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the back and hamstring muscles in physiotherapists with non-specific back pain in its early stages. Participants will complete the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Those that rate their back pain on the 0-10 Low Back Pain Scale in the ranges 1-3 (mild pain) and 4-6 (moderate pain) will be considered. They will undergo a perturbation-based balance test and a test of the maximal isometric strength of back muscles and hip extensors. We assume that by adding tests of reactive balance and strength of related muscle groups in the functional testing of physiotherapists, we would be able to identify back problems earlier and more efficiently and therefore address them well before chronic back disorders occur.","Zemková, Erika; Durinová, Eva; Dzubera, Andrej; Horníková, Henrieta; Chochol, Juraj; Koisová, Jana; Simonová, Michaela; Zapletalová, Ludmila",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,722

It originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and spread like a wild fire to the entire globe and was declared as global pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. With no available cure and vaccine, this disease has taken a mammoth toll on the human life; therefore, SMS (‘Social Distancing’, use of ‘Mask’ and regular hand washing with ‘Soap’) has emerged as a sole tool to prevent its spread. The Indian government declared the first lockdown from March 25th 2020 with subsequent second, third and fourth lockdowns up to 31st March 2020 to decrease the disease transmission and flatten the disease transmission curve. Aligarh Muslim University is one of the prestigious central and residential universities in India. It is located in Aligarh district adjoining national capital region. The university has an attached tertiary care ‘Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital’. This narrative review discusses the various steps and procedures taken up by the university and hospital administration, other functionaries, faculty members and doctors in tackling the serious pandemic until 22nd June 2020. The proactive role of administration, dedication and hard work of health care professionals and innovation of some academicians has given a new vista of opportunities to tackle this global health pandemic.

METHODS: We undertook an additional follow-up of two existing UK registers involving people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and participants in a trial in the UK who had regional pain and were identified at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. Participants completed the study questionnaire between July and December 2020, throughout which time there were public health restrictions in place. RESULTS: 1054 people took part in the study (596 axSpA, 162 PsA, 296 regional pain). In comparison to their previous (pre-pandemic) assessment, there was an age-adjusted significant, small, decrease in quality of life measured by EQ-5D (-0.020 95% CI (-0.030, -0.009)) overall and across all population groups examined. This was primarily related to poorer mental health and pain. There was a small increase in fibromyalgia symptoms, but a small decrease in sleep problems. There was a small deterioration in axSpA disease activity, and disease-specific quality of life and anxiety in PsA participants. Predictors of poor quality of life were similar pre- and during the pandemic. The effect of lockdown on activity differed according to age, gender, and deprivation. CONCLUSION: Important lessons include focussing on addressing anxiety and providing enhanced support for self-management in the absence of normal health care being available, and awareness that all population groups are likely to be affected.","Macfarlane, Gary J; Hollick, Rosemary J; Morton, LaKrista; Heddle, Maureen; Bachmair, Eva-Maria; Anderson, R Stuart; Whibley, Daniel; Keenan, Karen Forrest; Murchie, Peter; Stelfox, Kevin; Beasley, Marcus J; Jones, Gareth T",Rheumatology (Oxford),,722

Improving public knowledge of COVID-19 is critical to controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to determine China's public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over 48 h from 22:30 29 February 2020 to 22:30 2 March 2020 based on a self-administered web-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted on the WeChat network. Exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling was applied. The questionnaire was voluntarily completed by WeChat users. The questionnaire covered basic demographic information, public knowledge of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, psychological state, and attitudes towards the overall control measures. The primary outcome was the China's public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures and secondary outcome was the psychological state of the public during this pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 10,905 participants and 10,399 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. Participants with tertiary education, younger participants and healthcare workers had better overall knowledge than other participants (all P < 0.05). Approximately 91.9% of the participants believed in person-to-person transmission and 39.1% believed in animal-to-person transmission.

METHODS: The methodology adopted for this study comprises three phases: systemizing control measures adopted by different countries, identifying structural breaks in the growth of the number of cases for those countries, and analyzing Brazilian data in particular. RESULTS: We noted that China (excluding Hubei Province), Hubei Province, and South Korea have been effective in their deceleration of the growth rates of COVID-19 cases. The effectiveness of the measures taken by these countries could be seen after 1 to 2 weeks of their application. In Italy and Spain, control measures at the national level were taken at a late stage of the epidemic, which could have contributed to the high propagation of COVID-19. In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo adopted measures that could be effective in slowing the propagation of the virus. However, we only expect to see their effects on the growth of the curve in the coming days. CONCLUSION: Our results may help decisionmakers in countries in relatively early stages of the epidemic, especially Brazil, understand the importance of control measures in decelerating the growth curve of confirmed cases.","Antunes, Bianca Brandão de Paula; Peres, Igor Tona; Baião, Fernanda Araújo; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Bastos, Leonardo Dos Santos Lourenço; Silva, Amanda de Araújo Batista da; Souza, Guilherme Faveret Garcia de; Marchesi, Janaina Figueira; Dantas, Leila Figueiredo; Vargas, Soraida Aguilar; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando Augusto",Rev. bras. ter. intensiva,,722

325318,Academician Cong Bin: Autopsy of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed to be strengthened,2020,"Mislocalization and abnormal deposition of TDP-43 into the cytoplasm (TDP-43 proteinopathy) is a hallmark in neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases linked to TDP-43 is largely unknown. We hypothesized that the failure of mRNA transport to neuronal axons by TDP-43 may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD, and sought to examine the function of TDP-43 by identifying its target mRNA for axonal transport. We found that mRNAs related to translational function including ribosomal proteins (RPs) were decreased by shRNA-based TDP-43 knock-down in neurites of cortical neurons. TDP-43 binds to and transports the RP mRNAs through their 5' untranslated region, which contains a common 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif and a downstream GC-rich region. We showed by employing in vitro and in vivo models that the RP mRNAs were translated and incorporated into native ribosomes locally in axons to maintain functionality of axonal ribosomes, which is required for local protein synthesis in response to stimulation and stress to axons.

Our results elucidated a novel function of TDP-43 to control transport of RP mRNAs and local translation by ribosomes to maintain morphological integrity of neuronal axons, and proved the influence of this function of TDP-43 on neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","Nagano, Seiichi; Jinno, Junki; Abdelhamid, Rehab F; Jin, Yinshi; Shibata, Megumi; Watanabe, Shohei; Hirokawa, Sachiko; Nishizawa, Masatoyo; Sakimura, Kenji; Onodera, Osamu; Okada, Hironori; Okada, Takashi; Saito, Yuko; Takahashi-Fujigasaki, Junko; Murayama, Shigeo; Wakatsuki, Shuji; Mochizuki, Hideki; Araki, Toshiyuki",,,722

Among the many lessons learned for the medical community is the potential for transmissibility and host infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, it has become clear that the virus can affect any organ including the circulatory system, directly via either tissue tropism or indirectly stemming from inflammatory responses in the form of innate immunity, leukocyte debris such as cell-free DNA and histones and RNA viral particles. The following review considers COVID-19-associated vasculitis and vasculopathy as a defining feature of a virus-induced systemic disease with acute, subacute and potential chronic health implications.","Becker, Richard C",J Thromb Thrombolysis,,722

339227,SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing among disadvantaged populations during epidemic intervals should be a priority strategy: results from a pilot experiment in Barcelona,2021,"With the development of deep encoder-decoder architectures and large-scale annotated medical datasets, great progress has been achieved in the development of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the stacking of convolution layers and the consecutive sampling operations, existing standard models inevitably encounter the information recession problem of feature representations, which fails to fully model the global contextual feature dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, this paper proposes a novel Transformer based medical image semantic segmentation framework called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided attention and multi-scale skip connection are jointly designed to effectively enhance the functionality and flexibility of traditional U-shaped architecture. Inspired by Transformer, a novel self-aware attention (SAA) module with both Transformer Self Attention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into TransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions between encoder features. In particular, we also establish additional multi-scale skip connections between decoder blocks to aggregate the different semantic-scale upsampling features. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context information is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting from these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively alleviate the loss of fine details caused by the information recession problem, improving the diagnostic sensitivity and segmentation quality of medical image analysis. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image segmentation datasets of different imaging demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.","Chen, Bingzhi; Liu, Yishu; Zhang, Zheng; Lu, Guangming; Zhang, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05274v1.pdf,722
348649,Novel rapid identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time RT-PCR using BD Max Open System in Taiwan,2020,"A newly emerged strain of SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.1.7 lineage has caused a significant surge in the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK. In this study, changes in the epitopes of spike and orf8 proteins in SARS-CoV-2 of B.1.1.7 lineage were investigated. Genomic alignment of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 with SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan showed the presence of several mutations in orf1a/b, spike, orf8, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Molecular models of spike and orf8 proteins were constructed by homology modeling. Superimposition between the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 showed noticeable variations in the spatial orientation in Val70-Asn74 and Thr250-Ser255 regions. This may have also resulted in the extension of the epitopic region at Ser244-Gly249 in the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein. Superimposition of the SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 spike protein over Fab-spike protein complexes of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan also showed subtle variations in the antibody binding affinity targeting the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Epitopic variations were also observed between the corresponding orf8 regions of SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7. Moreover, the presence of a stop codon at position 27 in orf8 connotes the emergence of two frames (orf8a and orf8b) in SARS-CoV-2, which further hampers its extracellular secretion, and in turn, immunogenicity. The findings of the present study could further be used to develop targeted immunotherapeutics.","Hussain, Mushtaq; Shabbir, Sanya; Amanullah, Anusha; Raza, Fozia; Imdad, Muhammad J; Zahid, Sahar",J. med. virol,,722

The data, called Ties data, included students' demographic and support network information. The support network data comprised of information that highlighted the type of support, (i.e. emotional or educational; routine or intense). Using this data set, models for predicting students' academic achievement, quantified by their self-reported GPA, were created using Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), a decision tree algorithm, and cforest, a random forest algorithm that uses conditional inference trees. We compare the methods' accuracy and variation in the set of important variables suggested by each algorithm. Each algorithm found different variables important for different student demographics with some overlap. For White students, different types of educational support were important in predicting academic achievement, while for non-White students, different types of emotional support were important in predicting academic achievement. The presence of differing types of routine support were important in predicting academic achievement for cisgender women, while differing types of intense support were important in predicting academic achievement for cisgender men.","Frazier, Anthony; Silva, Joethi; Meilak, Rachel; Sahoo, Indranil; Chan, David; Broda, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13947v1.pdf,722

476097,SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing for departing passengers at Vancouver international airport,2021,"One limitation to engaging K-12 students and the public with microorganisms is the inability to cultivate and dispose of bacterial and fungal samples safely without expensive equipment or services. This barrier has been amplified with remote learning modalities and laboratory closures driven by safety precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At-home lab kits are being used to bring hands-on experience in microorganism cultivation to students learning remotely, but these kits often fail to take into full consideration the safety aspects or the costs associated with microorganism disposal, limiting which experiments can be performed at home. Here, we outline a method that makes cultivating and deactivating microorganisms accessible to the public through low-cost and readily available equipment. This method reduces exposure to microorganisms by forgoing the need to open petri plates for chemical deactivation with sanitizing reagents. This technique may benefit remote K-12 and postsecondary students, students wishing to get hands-on microbiology research experience, and members of the public interested in cultivating microorganisms to contribute to citizen science efforts or for creative art applications.","Madden, A.

SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard but requires a certified laboratory infrastructure with high-cost equipment and trained personnel. However, for large-scale testing, diagnostics should be fast, cost-effective, widely available, and deployed for the community, such as serological tests based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for IgM/IgG detection. We evaluated three different commercial point-of-care (POC) LFIAs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in capillary whole blood of 100 healthcare workers (HCW) from São Paulo university hospital previously tested by RT-PCR: (1) COVID-19 IgG/IgM BIO (Bioclin, Brazil), (2) Diagnostic Kit for IgM/IgG Antibody to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Livzon, China), and (3) SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo, China). A total of 84 positives and 16 negatives HCW were tested. The data was also analyzed by the number of days post symptoms (DPS) in three groups: <30 (n=26), 30-59 (n=42), and >59 (n=16). The observed sensibility was 85.71%, 47.62%, and 44.05% for Bioclin, Wondfo, and Livzon, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for all LFIA. Bioclin was more sensitive (p<0.01), regardless of the DPS. Thus, the Bioclin may be used as a POC test to monitor SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in HCW.","Conte, Danielle Dias; Carvalho, Joseane Mayara Almeida; de Souza Luna, Luciano Kleber; Faíco-Filho, Klinger Soares; Perosa, Ana Helena; Bellei, Nancy",Braz. j. microbiol,,722

592275,Taiwan Can Help- Community Protection Net: Preventive Effects of the Northern Taiwan Centralized Quarantine Center against SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-27,"Background The crisis induced by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of life. Fear and anxiety about the infections, social isolation derived from the virus-containment measures, and the resulting economic disruption could deteriorate psychological health and exacerbate the suicidal risk. However, evidence linking the COVID-19 pandemic to suicide is limited. Methods We use suicide records from July 2016 to June 2020 covering the entire Japanese population (126 million) in 1,861 administrative units. We used difference-in-differences estimation to assess if the suicide rate changed during the pandemic, comparing suicide rates between 2016-2019 (control group) and 2020 (treatment group). Findings We found that the overall suicide rate declined by 13.5% after the outbreak and subsequent measures (i.e., school closure and the state of emergency). While it is evident that suicide rate dropped across all gender and age groups, the decline is more substantial among males (-11.9%) than females (-6.7%) and among those aged 20-69 years (-12.6%) than those aged below 20 years (-1.6%) and those aged over 70 years (-4.8%). Interpretation The government's generous subsidies and benefits for both households and enterprises and reduced distress from overwork potentially account for the sizable decline in the suicide rate, particularly among male adults. A smaller drop in the suicide rate among the elderly and females suggests that they might be more vulnerable to this pandemic. Fewer school sessions among students might have reduced suicide among children and adolescents.","Tanaka, T.; Okamoto, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.30.20184168v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.30.20184168,722

Use of psychotropic medications (PMs) indicates the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in COVID‐19 patients. So far, potential clinical predictors of use of PMs have not been much investigated. In order to extend research in this area, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM prescription among a sample of inpatients with COVID‐19 and to find potential predictors of initiation of PMs in these individuals. METHODS: This is a cross‐sectional single‐center study, conducted during the first outbreak peak in a hospital of northern Italy. Information on socio‐demographic characteristics, comorbidities, routine blood test, use of potential COVID‐19 treatments, and length of stay were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: Data were available for 151 inpatients. Forty‐seven of them (31.1%) started at least one prescription of a PM. PM prescription was significantly inversely associated with lymphocyte and platelet counts. A significant association was also found for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the initiation of PMs could be common among COVID‐19 inpatients.

The pandemic has also disrupted healthcare quality improvement (QI) training and education for healthcare professionals and there is a need to rethink the way QI training and education is delivered. The purpose of this rapid evidence review is to quickly, but comprehensively collate studies to identify what works and what does not in delivering QI training and education using distance learning modalities. METHODS: Three healthcare databases were searched along with grey literature sources for studies published between 2015 and 2020. Studies with QI training programmes or courses targeting healthcare professionals and students with at least one component of the programme being delivered online were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included in the review. Most studies had a mixed methods design and used blended learning methods, combining online and in-person delivery modes. Most of the included studies reported achieving desired outcomes, including improved QI knowledge, skills and attitudes of participants and improved clinical outcomes for patients. Some benefits of online QI training delivery include fewer required resources, reduced need for on-site instructors, increased programme reach, and more control and flexibility over learning time for participants. Some limitations of online delivery modes include limited learning and networking opportunities, functional and technical problems and long lead time for content adaptation and customisation. DISCUSSION: The review highlights that distance learning approaches to QI help in overcoming barriers to traditional QI training. Some important considerations for those looking to adapt traditional programmes to virtual environments include balancing virtual and non-virtual methods, using suitable technological solutions, customising coaching support, and using multiple criteria for programme evaluation. CONCLUSION: Virtual QI and training of healthcare professionals and students is a viable, efficient, and effective alternative to traditional QI education that will play a vital role in building their competence and confidence to improve the healthcare system in post-COVID environment.","Khurshid, Zuneera; De Brún, Aoife; Moore, Gemma; McAuliffe, Eilish",Hum Resour Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115494/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-020-00527-2,722

To evaluate if tea and tea catechin consumption has the same protective effects as gargling with tea, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Ichu-shi Web databases. The search provided six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four prospective cohort studies (n = 3748). The quality of each trial or study was evaluated according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool or Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. We collected data from publications meeting the search criteria and conducted a meta-analysis of the effect of tea gargling and tea catechin consumption for preventing URTI using a random effects model. RESULTS: Tea gargling and tea catechin consumption had significant preventive effects against URTI (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.87). In sub-analyses, a significant preventive effect was observed by study type (prospective cohort study: RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50–0.91; RCT: RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.94) and disease type (influenza: RR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.58–0.84; acute URTI: RR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.98). Both gargling with tea and consuming tea catechins effectively protected against URTI (tea and tea catechins consumption: RR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.52–0.87; tea gargling: RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.96). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that tea gargling and tea catechin consumption may have preventive effects against influenza infection and URTI.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional baseline data on 51 338 community-living women and men aged 45–85 years from the population-based Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (collected from September 2011 to May 2015) were used in this study. PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A Frailty Index (FI) was constructed using self-reported chronic conditions, psychological function and cognitive status and physical functioning variables. Social stratifiers were chosen based on the Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Reporting Initiative, reflecting key health inequalities in Canada. Unadjusted and adjusted FIs and domain-specific FIs (based on chronic conditions, physical function, psychological/cognitive deficits) were examined across population strata. RESULTS: The overall mean FI was 0.13±0.08. It increased with age and was higher in women than men. Higher mean FIs were found among study participants with low income (0.20±0.10), who did not complete secondary education (0.17±0.09) or had low perceived social standing (0.18±0.10). Values did not differ by Canadian province of residence or urban/rural status. After simultaneously adjusting for population characteristics and other covariates, income explained the most heterogeneity in frailty, especially in younger age groups; similar patterns were found for men and women. The average frailty for people aged 45–54 in the lowest income group was greater than that for those aged 75–85 years. The heterogeneity in the FI among income groups was greatest for the psychological/cognitive domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that especially in the younger age groups, psychological/cognitive deficits are most highly associated with both overall frailty levels and the gradient in frailty associated with income. If this is predictive of later increases in the other two domains (and overall frailty), it raises the question whether targeting mental health factors earlier in life might be an effective approach to mitigating frailty.","Griffith, Lauren E; Raina, Parminder; Kanters, David; Hogan, David; Patterson, Christopher; Papaioannou, Alexandra; Richardson, Julie; Gilsing, Anne; Thompson, Mary; van den Heuvel, Edwin",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281924/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047945,722

Coronaviruses are a group of well-known respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory infections. At the current state, the 2019 novel coronavirus is cited as the most worldwide problematic agent for the respiratory system. According to investigations, people with old age and underlying diseases are at higher risk of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Indeed, they may show a severe form of the disease (with severe acute respiratory infections). Based on the promising role of cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases, it seems that applying cell-based approaches can also be a hopeful strategy for improving subjects with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. Herein, due to the amazing effects of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of various diseases, this review focuses on the auxiliary role of mesenchymal stem cells to reduce inflammatory processes of acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus.","Parhizkar Roudsari, Peyvand; Alavi-Moghadam, Sepideh; Payab, Moloud; Sayahpour, Forough Azam; Aghayan, Hamid Reza; Goodarzi, Parisa; Mohamadi-jahani, Fereshteh; Larijani, Bagher; Arjmand, Babak",Cell Tissue Bank,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588163/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10561-020-09842-3,722
624647,Considerations from the College of American Pathologists for Implementation of an Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Testing after a Change in Regulatory Status,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has increasingly been used for an accurate assumption-free virological diagnosis. However, the systematic workflow evaluation on clinical respiratory samples and implementation of quality controls (QCs) is still lacking. METHODS: A total of 3 QCs were implemented and processed through the whole mNGS workflow: a no-template-control to evaluate contamination issues during the process; an internal and an external QC to check the integrity of the reagents, equipment, the presence of inhibitors, and to allow the validation of results for each sample. The workflow was then evaluated on 37 clinical respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory infections previously tested for a broad panel of viruses using semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays (28 positive samples including 6 multiple viral infections; 9 negative samples). Selected specimens included nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 20), aspirates (n = 10), or sputums (n = 7). RESULTS: The optimal spiking level of the internal QC was first determined in order to be sufficiently detected without overconsumption of sequencing reads. According to QC validation criteria, mNGS results were validated for 34/37 selected samples. For valid samples, viral genotypes were accurately determined for 36/36 viruses detected with PCR (viral genome coverage ranged from 0.6 to 100%, median = 67.7%). This mNGS workflow allowed the detection of DNA and RNA viruses up to a semi-quantitative PCR Ct value of 36. The six multiple viral infections involving 2 to 4 viruses were also fully characterized. A strong correlation between results of mNGS and real-time PCR was obtained for each type of viral genome (R(2) ranged from 0.72 for linear single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses to 0.98 for linear ssDNA viruses). CONCLUSIONS: Although the potential of mNGS technology is very promising, further evaluation studies are urgently needed for its routine clinical use within a reasonable timeframe. The approach described herein is crucial to bring standardization and to ensure the quality of the generated sequences in clinical setting. We provide an easy-to-use single protocol successfully evaluated for the characterization of a broad and representative panel of DNA and RNA respiratory viruses in various types of clinical samples.

We used a mixed-methods digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID-19 (January 1, 2020–February 29, 2020) and COVID-19 (March 1, 2020–June 1, 2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, “r/KidneyStones,” which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. Results: We extracted n = 649 posts (250 pre-COVID-19, 399 COVID-19); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID-19, 239 COVID-19) that described stone-related decision making before intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID-19 focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID-19, based on sentiment analysis (p < 0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (p < 0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting emergency room (ER) increased from 5.1 to 10.5 mm (p < 0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones ≥10 mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID-19 vs 26% during COVID-19, p = 0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (p < 0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. Conclusions: Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.","Jiang, Tommy; Osadchiy, Vadim; Weinberger, James M.; Zheng, Michael H.; Owen, Michael H.; Leonard, Sarah A.; Mills, Jesse N.; Kachroo, Naveen; Eleswarapu, Sriram V.",J Endourol,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478351/,722
625903,"Emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East: Origins, Transmission, Treatment, and Perspectives",2014-12-04,"This study aimed to critically review pediatric swallowing assessment data to determine the future need for standardized procedures. A retrospective analysis of 152 swallowing examinations in 128 children aged 21 days to 18 years was performed. The children were presented at a university dysphagia center between January 2015 and June 2020 for flexible-endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Descriptive analysis was conducted for the sample, swallowing pathologies, diagnosis, and missing values. Using binary logistic regression, the relationship between dysphagia and underlying diseases was investigated. The largest group with a common diagnosis in the cohort were children with genetic syndromes (n = 43). Sixty-nine children were diagnosed with dysphagia and 59 without dysphagia. The non-dysphagic group included 15 patients with a behavioral feeding disorder. The presence of an underlying disease significantly increased the chance of a swallowing problem (OR 13.08, 95% CI 3.66 to 46.65, p = .00). In particular, the categories genetic syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 5.88) and neurologic disorder (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.31 to 13.69) were associated with higher odds for dysphagia. All pediatric FEES were performed without complications, with a completion rate of 96.7%, and with a broad variability of implementation. Several charts lacked information concerning swallowing pathologies, though. Generally, a more standardized protocol and documentation for pediatric FEES is needed to enable better comparability of studies on epidemiology, assessment, and treatment outcomes in future.

Following the calculation of the ADMET properties, molecular docking was carried out. Moreover, the de novo ligand design was performed. MD simulation was then applied to survey the behavior of the ligand-protein complexes. Furthermore, MMPBSA has utilized to re-estimate the binding affinities. Then, a free energy landscape was used to find the most stable conformation of the complexes. Finally, the hybrid QM-MM method was carried out for the precise calculation of the energies. The Hypo1 pharmacophore model was selected as the best model. Our docking results indicate that the compounds ZINC12562757 and 112,260,215 were the best potential inhibitors of the ACE2 and MPro, respectively. Furthermore, the Evo_1 compound enjoys the highest docking energy among the designed de novo ligands. Results of RMSD, RMSF, H-bond, and DSSP analyses have demonstrated that the lead compounds preserve the stability of the complexes’ conformation during the MD simulation.

(2) Methods: The host entry machinery required for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was examined for the gene expression profiles and polymorphism. (3) Results: Lung, kidney, small intestine, and salivary glands were among the tissues which expressed the entry machinery coding genes Ace2, Tmprss2, CtsB, and CtsL. The genes had no significant expression changes between males and females. The four human population groups of Europeans, Africans, Asians, and Americans had specific and also a common pool of rare variants for the X-linked locus of ACE2 receptor. Several specific and common ACE2 variants including S19P, I21T/V, E23K, A25T, K26R, T27A, E35D/K, E37K, Y50F, N51D/S, M62V, N64K, K68E, F72V, E75G, M82I, T92I, Q102P, G220S, H239Q, G326E, E329G, G352V, D355N, H378R, Q388L, P389H, E467K, H505R, R514G/*, and Y515C were of the utmost importance to the viral entry and infection.

Most interestingly, the analyses revealed that more than half of the variants can exist in males, i.e., as hemizygous. (4) Conclusions: The rare variants of human ACE2 seem to be one of the determinant factors associated with fitness in the battle against SARS viruses. The hemizygous viral-entry booster variants of ACE2 describe the higher SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate in males. This is also supported by the lack of gender bias for the gene expression profiles of entry machinery.

Herein, we compare the performance of four NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 WGS. Twenty four clinical respiratory samples with a large scale of Ct values (from 10.7 to 33.9) were sequenced with four methods. Three used Illumina sequencing: an in-house metagenomic NGS (mNGS) protocol and two newly commercialized kits including a hybridization capture method developed by Illumina (DNA Prep with Enrichment kit and Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel, RVOP) and an amplicon sequencing method developed by Paragon Genomics (CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 kit). We also evaluated the widely used amplicon sequencing protocol developed by ARTIC Network and combined with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing. All four methods yielded near-complete genomes (>99%) for high viral loads samples (n = 8), with mNGS and RVOP producing the most complete genomes. For mid viral loads (Ct 20-25), amplicon-based enrichment methods led to genome coverage >99% for all samples while 1/8 sample sequenced with RVOP and 2/8 samples sequenced with mNGS had a genome coverage below 99%. For low viral loads (Ct ≥ 25), amplicon-based enrichment methods were the most sensitive techniques. All methods were highly concordant in terms of identity in complete consensus sequence. Just one mismatch in three samples was observed in CleanPlex vs the other methods, due to the dedicated bioinformatics pipeline setting a high threshold to call SNP compared to reference sequence. Importantly, all methods correctly identified a newly observed 34-nt deletion in ORF6 but required specific bioinformatic validation for RVOP. Finally, as a major warning for targeted techniques, a loss of coverage in any given region of the genome should alert to a potential rearrangement or a SNP in primer annealing or probe-hybridizing regions and would require further validation using unbiased metagenomic sequencing.","Charre, Caroline; Ginevra, Christophe; Sabatier, Marina; Regue, Hadrien; Destras, Grégory; Brun, Solenne; Burfin, Gwendolyne; Scholtes, Caroline; Morfin, Florence; Valette, Martine; Lina, Bruno; Bal, Antonin; Josset, Laurence",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318859/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa075,722

Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults are vital to the demography of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and Methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education, and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, strong intervention by the government to keep people at home and distant from each other and continued lockdown for several more days are probable immediate solutions. At the same time, the economic burden on lower-income people should be addressed.","Imtiaz, Asif; Hossain, Md.
