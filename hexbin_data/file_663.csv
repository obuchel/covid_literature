This study addressed the previously reported antiangiogenic potential of beta-2-glycoprotein I (β(2)GPI) in vivo in the chick embryo model of angiogenesis. The effects of two naturally occurring β(2)GPI forms on the development of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vessels and the chicken embryo were investigated. β(2)GPI monomers and dimers were obtained by fractioned purification and characterized using SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and ELISA. The egg exposure was performed by injection of small volumes of 2.5 µg/mL solutions of the β(2)GPI subfractions. Angiogenesis was evaluated through quantitative measurements of vascular architecture parameters in the captured CAM images, using computational analysis of texture contrasts and computer vision techniques. Quantitative information was assigned to the CAM vasculature modifications. In vivo, the β(2)GPI dimer completely halted the formation of CAM vessels and led to embryo death after 48 h of exposure. The β(2)GPI monomer allowed the embryo to develop up to the 10th day, despite early changes of CAM vessels. The impaired normal vessel growth proceeded as a self-limited effect. The β(2)GPI monomer-exposed eggs showed reduced vascularization on the 6th day of incubation, but embryos were viable on the 10th day of incubation, with ingurgitated CAM vessels implying sequelae of the angiogenesis inhibition. Both subfractions impaired CAM vasculature development. The β(2)GPI dimer proved to be largely more harmful than the β(2)GPI monomer. β(2)GPI modification by cleavage or dimerization may play a role in angiogenesis control in vivo.","Baldavira, C.M.; Gomes, L.F.; Cruz, L.T.

Without the necessary mobility, vertebrae can not be safely re-positioned and fused. The current clinical workflow consists of radiologists or surgeons estimating angular differences of neighbouring vertebrae from different x-ray images. This procedure is time consuming and prone to inaccuracy. The proposed method automates this quantification by deforming a CT image in a physiologically reasonable way and matching it to the x-ray images of interest.

These less invasive techniques can fail due to hypercapnia and require transitioning patients to invasive mechanical ventilation. Extracorporeal CO(2) removal devices remove CO(2) independent of the lungs thereby controlling the hypercapnia and permitting non-invasive or lung-protective ventilation techniques. We are developing the Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System as a platform technology capable of providing three levels of respiratory assist: adult and pediatric full respiratory support and adult low-flow CO(2) removal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo performance of our device to achieve low-flow CO(2) removal. METHODS: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System was connected to 6 healthy sheep via a 15.5 Fr dual-lumen catheter placed in the external jugular vein. The animals were recovered and tethered within a pen while supported by the device for 7 days. The pump speed was set to achieve a targeted blood flow of 500 mL/min. The extracorporeal CO(2) removal rate was measured daily at a sweep gas independent regime. Hematological parameters were measured pre-operatively and regularly throughout the study. Histopathological samples of the end organs were taken at the end of each study. RESULTS: All animals survived the surgery and generally tolerated the device well. One animal required early termination due to a pulmonary embolism. Intra-device thrombus formation occurred in a single animal due to improper anticoagulation. The average CO(2) removal rate (normalized to an inlet pCO(2) of 45 mmHg) was 75.6 ± 4.7 mL/min and did not significantly change over the course of the study (p > 0.05). No signs of consistent hemolysis or end organ damage were observed. CONCLUSION: These in vivo results indicate positive performance of the Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System as a low-flow CO(2) removal device.,"May, Alexandra G.; Orizondo, Ryan A.; Frankowski, Brian J.; Ye, Sang-Ho; Kocyildirim, Ergin; Wagner, William R.; D’Cunha, Jonathan; Federspiel, William J.",Intensive Care Med Exp,663,1

These severely ill patients may also present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and several studies have suggested that TSH, thyroxin (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) play a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. Aim: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in severly ill patients with bacterial sepsis or COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts and circulating TSH, T4, FT4, T3, albumin and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in two independent cohorts of bacterial sepsis (n=224) and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=35). Results: Only T3 correlated (rho=0.252, p-value: <0.001) with lymphocyte counts in the bacterial sepsis population and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to non-lympopenic patients (p-value: <0.001; n=56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (n=17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4 and T3 (p-value: 0.026, <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, respectively) compared to patients withouth lymphopenia (n=18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory parameters IL-6, C-reactive protein and ferritin (p-value: <0.001, 0.023, and 0.008, respectively). Remarkable, after one week follow-up, the majority of (12/15) COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, while TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed. Conclusions: Abnormal thyroid function correlates with low lymphocyte counts in severe sepsis and COVID-19 patients, but future studies need to establish whether a causal relationship is involved.","Grondman, Inge; de Nooijer, Aline H; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Janssen, Nico A F; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Medici, Marco; Smit, Johannes W A; Van Herwaarden, Antonius E; Jaeger, Martin; Netea, Mihai G; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Netea-Maier, Romana T",J Endocr Soc,663,16

Immunological phenotypes are embedded within a mechanistic pathway leading from genotype through physiology to shape higher-order biological phenomena. As such, ""mechanisms"" in ecoimmunology can refer to both the within-host processes that shape immunological phenotypes, or it can refer the ways in which different immunological phenotypes alter between-organism processes at ecological and evolutionary scales. The mechanistic questions ecoimmunologists can ask, both within-organisms and between-organisms, however, often have been limited by techniques that do not easily transfer to wild, non-model systems. Thus, a major focus in ecoimmunology has been developing and refining the available toolkit. Recently, this toolkit has been expanding at an unprecedented rate, bringing new challenges to choosing techniques and standardizing protocols across studies. By confronting these challenges, we will be able to enhance ecoimmunological inquiries into the physiological basis of life-history trade-offs; the development of low-cost biomarkers for susceptibility to disease; and the investigation of the ecophysiological underpinnings of disease ecology, behavior, and the coevolution of host-parasite systems. The technical advances in, and crossover technologies from, disciplines associated with ecoimmunology and how these advances can help us understand the mechanistic basis of immunological variability in wild species were the focus of the symposium, Methods and Mechanisms in Ecoimmunology.","Downs, C J; Adelman, J S; Demas, G E",Integrative and comparative biology,663,1

Using Alkbh8 deficient (Alkbh8def) mice, we have investigated the importance of epitranscriptomic systems in the response to naphthalene, an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and environmental toxicant. We performed basal lung analysis and naphthalene exposure studies using wild type (WT), Alkbh8def and Cyp2abfgs-null mice, the latter of which lack the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for naphthalene bioactivation. Under basal conditions, lungs from Alkbh8def mice have increased markers of oxidative stress and decreased thioredoxin reductase protein levels, and have reprogrammed gene expression to differentially regulate stress response transcripts. Alkbh8def mice are more sensitive to naphthalene induced death than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage at the cellular and molecular levels. Further, WT mice develop a tolerance to naphthalene after 3 days, defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures, which is absent in Alkbh8def mice. We conclude that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 plays a protective role against naphthalene-induced lung dysfunction and promotes naphthalene tolerance. Our work provides an early example of how epitranscriptomic systems can regulate the response to environmental stress in vivo.","Leonardi, Andrea; Kovalchuk, Nataliia; Yin, Lei; Endres, Lauren; Evke, Sara; Nevins, Steven; Martin, Samuel; Dedon, Peter C; Melendez, J Andres; Van Winkle, Laura; Zhang, Qing-Yu; Ding, Xinxin; Begley, Thomas J",Epigenetics,663,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. SETTING: Academic sleep labs. PARTICIPANTS: Iranian adults &#8805; 18 years old with confirmed OSA. RESULTS: Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (n = 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (n = 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index &#8805; 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-value = .04). Similarly, sleep efficiency (SE) scores were 75.7, 74.2, and 67.9% for the healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively (P-value = .005); Beck Depression scores were 13.8, 13.0, and 17.7, respectively (P-value = .056).

DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING: Community based (pillar 2) covid-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection). PARTICIPANTS: 54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between 1 October 2020 and 29 January 2021, followed-up until 12 February 2021. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death within 28 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for covid-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases. CONCLUSIONS: The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.","Challen, Robert; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Read, Jonathan M; Dyson, Louise; Tsaneva-Atanasova, Krasimira; Danon, Leon",BMJ,663,1

We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these systems.","Blessing, Jenny; Gomez, Julian; Patino, McCoy; Nguyen, Tran",,663,16

The existing frameworks/mechanisms and proposals for COVID-19 vaccine allocation have shortcomings from a human rights perspective that could be remedied by adopting an intersectional allocative approach.

Since the RAAS can induce and modulate pro-inflammatory responses, it could play a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Thus, we aimed to determine the levels of plasma renin and aldosterone as indicators of RAAS activation in a series of consecutively admitted patients for Covid-19 in our clinic. METHODS: Plasma renin and aldosterone levels were measured, among the miscellaneous investigations needed for Covid-19 management, early after admission in our clinic. Disease severity was assessed using a seven-category ordinal scale. Primary outcome of interest was the severity of patients' clinical courses. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. At inclusion, 12 patients had mild clinical status, 25 moderate clinical status and 7 severe clinical status. In univariate analyses, aldosterone and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at inclusion were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical course as compared to those with mild or moderate course (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only aldosterone and CRP levels remained positively associated with severity. We also observed a positive significant correlation between aldosterone and CRP levels among patients with an aldosterone level greater than 102.5 pmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Both plasmatic aldosterone and CRP levels at inclusion are associated with the clinical course of Covid-19.

Analysis of a total of 117 ED patients with STEMI (pre-intervention group, n = 57; post-intervention group, n = 60) showed significant overall improvements in median door-to-ECG time from 5 to 4 min (p = 0.02), achievement rate of door-to-ECG time < 10 min from 45 to 57% (p = 0.01), median door-to-balloon time from 81 to 70 min (p < 0.01). Significant trends of increase in achievement rates for door-to-ECG and door-to-balloon times (p = 0.032 and p = 0.002, respectively) was noted after strategy implementation. The incidences of door-to-ECG time > 10 min for those with initially underestimated disease severity (from 90 to 10%, p < 0.01) and walk-in (from 29.2 to 8.8%, p = 0.04) were both reduced. In conclusion, a chief complaint-based ""cardiac triage"" strategy successfully improved the quality of emergency care for STEMI patients through reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment.","Su, Hung-Yuan; Tsai, Jen-Long; Hsu, Yin-Chou; Lee, Kuo-Hsin; Chang, Chao-Sheng; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan; Wang, Yu-Han; Chi, Shu-Ching; Hsu, Chih-Wei",Sci Rep,663,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible adults residing in the area under study were chosen by simple random sampling and interviewed using a predesigned and pretested data collection schedule to assess awareness and perception. Based on their total awareness score, the participants were classified as having good awareness or poor awareness toward eye donation. RESULTS: Among 423 participants, 52.0% were male, 34.0% were 18 to 30 years old, 38.3% were educated up to secondary level, and 85.6% had eye disease in their family. Of total participants, 70.2% had heard about eye donation, with 59.9% of this group having knowledge of eye donation only after death and 57.9% having knowledge that donation must occur within 6 hours of death. In addition, 52.9% were aware about donation from home, 30.6% said only the cornea is transplantable, and 52.2% knew it can be preserved. Participants with higher education, higher socioeconomic status, and outside of the house occupational engagement had significantly higher chance of good eye donation awareness. Of total participants, 32.0% said that COVID-19 could be transmitted through eye donation, with 58.2% of participants opining that the pandemic was not a suitable time to consider donation of eyes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on eye donation perceptions. Although most of our participants had heard about eye donation, their awareness regarding important aspects about eye donation were still lacking, thus calling for a more focused action plan and implementation of the same.","Gupta, Shibaji; Bhattacharya, Saikat; Kole, Seshadri; Guchhait, Debjani; Sinha Gupta, Sharmistha",Exp Clin Transplant,663,16

Coronavirus is the agent that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and emergent infections such as the present pandemic of COVID-19. Understanding its genome pattern is important for developing new and faster ways of testing for identifying the genome of the virus and also for better understanding of its origin and evolution. Methods: For that, it was calculated the alpha coefficient by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for the sequences of these genomes converted to binary numbers in order to determine if it is a chaotic or a random series of data. Also, it applied the random walking for obtaining a fractal map of the whole genome and calculated the fractal dimension (FD) by box-counting of this map by two different software. Results: With this, it was found that the alpha coefficient of the first SARS viruses was &gt; 0.5, indicating that the series is chaotic or fractal, and has a persistent long-range memory or self-similarity along its sequence. This is not the case for MERS virus, which showed to have a completely random sequence (α &lt; 0.5). For the fractal dimension, SARS viruses presented a FD around 1.5, and for MERS the fractal dimension decreases (FD &lt; 1.5). Conclusion: The images generated by random walking of the entire RNA genome are by itself a fractal signature of the virus, which may be applied for studying its origin and for faster diagnostic of COVID-19.","de Salazar e Fernandes, Thiago; de Oliveira Filho, Jonas Sérgio; da Silva Lopes, Isvania Maria Serafim",Res.

Several e-learning modules have been developed by Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC). With distance learners and technological challenges such as poor internet bandwidth to be considered, UMC opted for the microlearning approach based on small learning units connected to specific learning objectives. The aim of this study was to evaluate how this e-learning course was received. METHODS: The course was evaluated through usage data and the results of two user surveys, one for modules 1-4, signal detection and causality assessment, and the other for module 5, statistical reasoning and algorithms in pharmacovigilance. The evaluation model used was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A questionnaire was developed, divided into demographic profile, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, educational compatibility and behavioural intention. The two surveys were disseminated to 2067 learners for modules 1-4 and 1685 learners for module 5. RESULTS: Learners from 137 countries participated, predominantly from industry (36.6%), national pharmacovigilance centres (22.6%) and academia (16.3%). The overall satisfaction level was very high for all modules, with over 90% of the learners rating it as either 'excellent' or 'good'. The majority were satisfied with the learning platform, the course content and the lesson duration. Most learners thought they would be able to apply the knowledge in practice. Almost 100% of the learners would recommend the modules to others and would also study future modules. Suggested improvements were an interactive forum, more practical examples in the lessons and practical exercises. CONCLUSION: This e-learning course in pharmacovigilance based on microlearning was well received with a global coverage among relevant professional disciplines.","Hegerius, Anna; Caduff-Janosa, Pia; Savage, Ruth; Ellenius, Johan",Drug Saf,663,26

As the current epicenter, the United States has the largest number of confirmed and death cases of COVID-19. Meteorological factors have been found associated with many respiratory diseases in the past studies. In order to understand that how and during which period of time do the meteorological factors have the strongest association with the transmission and fatality of COVID-19, we analyze the correlation between each meteorological factor during different time periods within the incubation window and the confirmation and fatality rate, and develop statistic models to quantify the effects at county level. Results show that meteorological variables except maximum wind speed during the day 13 - 0 before current day shows the most significant correlation (P<0.05) with the daily confirmed rate, while temperature during the day 13 - 8 before are most significantly correlated (P<0.05) with the daily fatality rate. Temperature is the only meteorological factor showing dramatic positive association nationally, particularly in the southeast US where the current outbreak most intensive. The influence of temperature is remarkable on the confirmed rate with an increase of over 5 pmp in many counties, but not as much on the fatality rate (mostly within 0.01%).

For this, we use a dataset covering 125 European regions in 12 countries.

The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","Obi, Andrea T.; Barnes, Geoffrey D.; Napolitano, Lena M.; Henke, Peter K.; Wakefield, Thomas W.",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,663,20

Serological antibody test is one important diagnostic method increasingly used in the clinic, although its clinical application is still under investigation. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performances of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 specific antibody tests in COVID-19 patients. Test results analyzed included (1) IgM-positive but IgG-negative (IgM(+)IgG-), (2) IgG-positive but IgM-negative (IgG(+)IgM-), (3) both IgM and IgG-positive (IgM(+)IgG(+)), (4) IgM-positive without IgG information (IgM(+)IgG(+/-)), (5) IgG-positive without IgM information (IgG(+)IgM(+/-)), (6) either IgM or IgG-positive (IgM(+) or IgG(+)), and (7) IgA-positive (IgA(+)). RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies were included. The pooled sensitivities of IgM(+)IgG-, IgG(+)IgM-, IgM(+)IgG(+), IgM(+)IgG(+/-), IgG(+)IgM(+/-), and IgM(+) or IgG(+) were 6%, 7%, 53%, 68%, 73%, and 79% respectively. The pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The IgA(+) had a pooled sensitivity of 78%, but a relatively low specificity of 88%. Tests conducted two weeks after symptom onset provided improved diagnostic accuracy. Chemiluminescence immunoassay and detection of S protein as the antigen could offer a more accurate diagnostic result. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the supplemental role of serological antibody tests in COVID-19 diagnosis. However, their capacity to diagnose COVID-19 early in the disease course could be limited.","Chen, Mengyu; Qin, Rundong; Mei, Jiang; Yang, Zhaowei; Wen, Weiping; Li, Jing",Int J Infect Dis,663,17

This manuscript reports the identification of two unique cDNA clones of calnexin in rainbow trout. Both encode putative mature proteins of 579 and 592 aa respectively in addition to a 24 aa signal peptide. Sequence analysis revealed that only one of the two cDNA clones encodes a putative ER retention signal, K/QEDDL, followed by a serine phosphorylation site conserved with mammalian homologs. Amino acid sequence alignment illustrated conservation of the calnexin luminal domain, which consists of a globular and a P domain, in both copies. Southern blotting revealed that there are at least two copies of the calnexin gene in the trout genome and northern blotting showed a wide tissue distribution of an estimated 3 kbp calnexin transcript with an additional minor transcript of 2.3 kbp expressed only in head kidney, spleen PBLs and strongly in RTS11. Importantly, the smaller transcript was predominantly upregulated in RTS11 after a 24 h treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. In western blots, calnexin was detected primarily as a 120 kDa protein and upon A23187 treatment; a 100 kDa band was most prominently expressed. These results suggest that in salmonids there are two differentiated versions of the calnexin gene which encode proteins that may have diverged to perform unique biological functions.","Sever, Lital; Vo, Nguyen T.K.; Bols, Niels C.; Dixon, Brian",Dev Comp Immunol,663,1

The disease is now quickly spreading around the world, resulting in ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Healthcare workers are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population due to frequent contact with infected individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among health care workers. METHODS: Facility-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among health care workers in Silte Zone. A total of 379 health professionals were selected using multistage stratified sampling technique. Self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Binary logistic regression model was used to see association between outcome and independent variables. RESULTS: This study found 74.9%, 84.2% and 68.9% prevalence of adequate knowledge, positive attitude and good practice respectively. Working in comprehensive specialized hospital (AOR = 4.46, 95% CI = 1.46–13.62).having MSC degree (AOR = 10.26, 95% CI = 2.27–46.44), and training on COVID-19 (AOR = 6.59, 95% CI = 2.97–14.65) were strongly associated with knowledge of health care workers. On the other hand, older age (AOR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.07–10.50), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.82–7.63), Work experience (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.46–9.80) and Knowledge (AOR = 5.45, 95% CI = 2.60–11.43) were significantly associated with attitude, whereas source of information from friends or colleagues (AOR = 3.13, 95% CI = 1.28–7.66), working in primary hospital (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.21–0.620) and having good knowledge (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.03–3.14) were strongly associated with good practice of health care workers. CONCLUSION: This study found majority of health care workers had good level of knowledge and positive attitude toward COVID-19, but lower proportion of health care workers practices sufficiently in the study area. Type of health facilities, level of education, training on COVID-19, work experience, type of source of information were significantly associated with knowledge, attitude and practice of health care workers. Stakeholders need to focus on interventions that increase preventive practices of health care workers.","Yesse, Mubarek; Muze, Mohammed; Kedir, Shemsu; Argaw, Bedru; Dengo, Mohammed; Nesre, Tajudin; Hamdalla, Faris; Saliha, Awol; Mussa, Tofik; Kasim, India; Kedir, Abdulfeta; Delebo, Tofik; Sunkemo, Awol; Badeg, Yesuf; Ensarmu, Dureti; Abebe, Dereje; Dessalegn, Amara; Ayelign, Henok",PLoS One,663,16

Symptoms of mild acute respiratory infections are commonly treated with over-the-counter products like ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts today. Because the direct antiviral activity of these over-the-counter products has not been studied in a systematic way, the current study aimed to compare their inhibitory effect against rhinovirus and influenza virus replication in an in vitro setting. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine, as well as of thyme and pelargonium extracts was analyzed in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and HeLa Ohio cells. The antiviral effect of these over-the-counter products was compared by analyzing the dose-dependent inhibition (i) of rhinovirus A2- and B14-induced cytopathic effect in HeLa Ohio cells and (ii) of influenza virus A/Hong Kong/68 (subtype H3N2)- and A/Jena/8178/09 (subtype H1N1, pandemic)-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations. To get insights into the mechanism of action of pelargonium extract against influenza virus, we performed time-of-addition assays as well as hemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition assays. RESULTS: N-acetyl cysteine, thyme and pelargonium extract showed no or only marginal cytotoxicity in MDCK and HeLa Ohio cells in the tested concentration range. The 50% cytotoxic concentration of ambroxol and bromhexine was 51.85 and 61.24 μM, respectively. No anti-rhinoviral activity was detected at non-cytotoxic concentrations in this in vitro study setting. Ambroxol, bromhexine, and N-acetyl cysteine inhibited the influenza virus-induced cytopathic effect in MDCK cells no or less than 50%. In contrast, a dose-dependent anti-influenza virus activity of thyme and pelargonium extracts was demonstrated. The time-of addition assays revealed an inhibition of early and late steps of influenza virus replication by pelargonium extract whereas zanamivir acted on late steps only. The proven block of viral neuraminidase activity might explain the inhibition of influenza virus replication when added after viral adsorption. CONCLUSION: The study results indicate a distinct inhibition of influenza A virus replication by thyme and pelargonium extract which might contribute to the beneficial effects of these plant extracts on acute respiratory infections symptoms.","Walther, Christin; Döring, Kristin; Schmidtke, Michaela",BMC Complement Med Ther,663,20

The SARS-CoV-2 are newly emerged β coronaviruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive viral RNA genome expressing open reading frames that code for structural and non-structural proteins. The spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope proteins are structural proteins. The S1 subunit of spike protein facilitates ACE2 mediated virus attachment and S2 subunit for membrane fusion. The presence of glutamine, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine and serine amino in SARS-CoV-2 enhanced ACE2 binding. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between N terminal (NTD) and C terminal (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. The linker region contains phosphorylation sites that regulate its functioning. The CTD promotes nucleocapsid formation. Envelope proteins contain an NTD, hydrophobic domain and C terminal which form viroporins needed for viral assembly. Membrane proteins hydrophilic C terminal and amphipathic N terminal. Its long-form promotes spike incorporations and interaction with E facilitate virion production. As each protein is essential in viral functioning, this review describes the insights of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins that would help in developing therapeutic strategies by targeting each protein to curb the rapidly growing pandemic.","Satarker, Sairaj; Nampoothiri, Madhavan",Arch Med Res,663,24

METHODS: This cross-sectional study sample comprised 68 older adults (74.24 ± 5.67 years) from a community-based exercise program conducted in Porto, Portugal. After home confinement, participants were assessed in person for lower-body strength (30-s chair stand test), cardiorespiratory fitness (6-min walking test), agility/dynamic balance (8-ft up-and-go test), handgrip strength, and anthropometry. Telephone interviews were performed to evaluate depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale – 15 items (GDS-15) and physical activity levels through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SV). Individuals were also asked to self-report changes in their physical activity levels and time spent sitting. RESULTS: Ninety percent of older adults self-reported a decrease in overall physical activity levels, and nearly 65% increased daily sitting time during the home confinement. However, previously active older adults still presented high levels of physical fitness (scores above 50th compared with Portuguese normative values) after 11 weeks of home confinement. Overall, 52.9% of participants scored 5 or more points on GDS-15, which is suggestive of depression. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiorespiratory fitness were found in the non-depressed group compared with the depressed group. Finally, results from multiple regression analysis revealed that MVPA was negatively associated with depression. This model explained 16.4% of the variability seen in depression score, controlled for age, gender, and education. CONCLUSION: Even reporting a decline in physical activity, older adults who previously participated in a formal exercise program, still presented high levels of physical fitness after 11 weeks of home confinement. However, MVPA, but not physical fitness, seems to be an associated depression score in previously active older adults. These results reinforce the importance of older adults to remain physically active, since higher levels of MVPA may have a protective effect on depressive symptoms and, therefore, mitigate the negative impact of home confinement on mental health. Future longitudinal research studies are needed to ascertain these results.","Carvalho, Joana; Borges-Machado, Flávia; Pizarro, Andreia N.; Bohn, Lucimere; Barros, Duarte",Front Psychol,663,10
