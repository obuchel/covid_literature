66,66,66,Electrochemical Molecular Analysis Without Nucleic Acid Amplification,11.541001,7.754218,2005-09-01,"Electrochemical biosensors have revolutionized glucose monitoring but have not yet fulfilled their promise of a low cost, direct detection replacement for genetic amplification tests such as PCR [K. Kerman, M. Kobayashi, E. Tamiya, Recent trends in electro-chemical DNA biosensor technology, Meas. Sci. Technol. 15 (2004) R1-R11; A. Chaubey, B.D. Malhotra, Mediated biosensors. Biosens. Bioelectron. 17 (6-7) (2002) 441-456]. It has been anticipated that the integration of nanoscale chemical structures such as self-assembled monolayers with electrochemical biosensors would increase sensitivity by decreasing inherent system noise. We have designed a novel biosensing approach incorporating such integration and achieved rapid, ultra-low concentration sensitivities without target amplification. Raw samples are mixed with lysis buffer to allow hybridization of nucleic acid targets with anchor and signal probes before immobilizing a signaling enzyme proximate to the biosensor surface. A bias potential is subsequently applied and the secondary byproduct of a cyclic peroxidase reaction measured. Further studies have demonstrated the application of our approach in protein, clinical chemistry, and ionic assays.","Gau, Vincent; Ma, Shu-Ching; Wang, Hua; Tsukuda, Joni; Kibler, John; Haake, David A.",Methods,51,1
110,110,110,The Restriction of Zoonotic PERV Transmission by Human APOBEC3G,11.739259,7.3503857,2007-09-12,"The human APOBEC3G protein is an innate anti-viral factor that can dominantly inhibit the replication of some endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. The prospects of purposefully harnessing such an anti-viral defense are under investigation. Here, long-term co-culture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human APOBEC3G in virus-producing pig kidney cells. Inhibition occurred by a deamination-independent mechanism, likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic DNA. PERV inhibition did not require the DNA cytosine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G and, correspondingly, APOBEC3G-attributable hypermutations were not detected. In contrast, over-expression of the sole endogenous APOBEC3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with PERV transmission. Together, these data constitute the first proof-of-principle demonstration that APOBEC3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate anti-viral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirus. These studies suggest that human APOBEC3G-transgenic pigs will provide safer, PERV-less xenotransplantation resources and that analogous cross-species APOBEC3-dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections.","Jónsson, Stefán R.; LaRue, Rebecca S.; Stenglein, Mark D.; Fahrenkrug, Scott C.; Andrésdóttir, Valgerdur; Harris, Reuben S.",PLoS One,51,11
136,136,136,Amino Acid Similarity Accounts for T Cell Cross-Reactivity and for “Holes” in the T Cell Repertoire,11.650587,7.6075063,2008-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity remain largely unknown. Several studies suggest that CTL clones can recognize highly diverse peptides, some sharing no obvious sequence identity. The emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors (TcR) recognize multiple distinct ligands. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, we analyzed peptide scans of the HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9) and found that TCR specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition. Inspired by this, we developed a general model of TCR peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of CTL epitopes. With this model, we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct T cell epitopes, i.e., ones with low sequence identity, are in fact more biochemically similar than expected. Additionally, an analysis of HIV immunogenicity data with our model showed that CTLs have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self-antigens. CONCLUSIONS: T cell cross-reactivity can thus, to an extent greater than earlier appreciated, be explained by amino acid similarity. The results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long-lasting discussions in the field of T cell cross-reactivity.","Frankild, Sune; de Boer, Rob J.; Lund, Ole; Nielsen, Morten; Kesmir, Can",PLoS One,51,8
147,147,147,Improved production of human type II procollagen in the yeast Pichia pastoris in shake flasks by a wireless-controlled fed-batch system,11.691103,7.46469,2008-03-27,"BACKGROUND: Here we describe a new technical solution for optimization of Pichia pastoris shake flask cultures with the example of production of stable human type II collagen. Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control. RESULTS: By applying on-line pO(2 )monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of AOX1 controlled genes. Furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks. The presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer-controlled feeding profiles. By using the human collagen II as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen II. Moreover, the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase as monitored by mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: The recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation. The problem can be solved by applying the fed-batch technology. The presented wireless feeding unit, together with an on-line monitoring system offers a flexible, simple, and low-cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel. By this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems.","Ruottinen, Maria; Bollok, Monika; Kögler, Martin; Neubauer, Antje; Krause, Mirja; Hämäläinen, Eija-Riitta; Myllyharju, Johanna; Vasala, Antti; Neubauer, Peter",BMC Biotechnol,51,11
184,184,184,Prevention of Cytotoxic T Cell Escape Using a Heteroclitic Subdominant Viral T Cell Determinant,11.582413,7.7647696,2008-10-24,"High affinity antigen-specific T cells play a critical role during protective immune responses. Epitope enhancement can elicit more potent T cell responses and can subsequently lead to a stronger memory pool; however, the molecular basis of such enhancement is unclear. We used the consensus peptide-binding motif for the Major Histocompatibility Complex molecule H-2K(b) to design a heteroclitic version of the mouse hepatitis virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant. We demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution at a secondary anchor residue (Q to Y at position 3) increased the stability of the engineered determinant in complex with H-2K(b). The structural basis for this enhanced stability was associated with local alterations in the pMHC conformation as a result of the Q to Y substitution. Recombinant viruses encoding this engineered determinant primed CTL responses that also reacted to the wildtype epitope with significantly higher functional avidity, and protected against selection of virus mutated at a second CTL determinant and consequent disease progression in persistently infected mice. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of an engineered determinant that will serve as a template for guiding the development of heteroclitic T cell determinants with applications in prevention of CTL escape in chronic viral infections as well as in tumor immunity.","Butler, Noah S.; Theodossis, Alex; Webb, Andrew I.; Nastovska, Roza; Ramarathinam, Sri Harsha; Dunstone, Michelle A.; Rossjohn, Jamie; Purcell, Anthony W.; Perlman, Stanley",PLoS Pathog,51,8
280,280,280,Differential Regulation of Type I Interferon and Epidermal Growth Factor Pathways by a Human Respirovirus Virulence Factor,11.419652,7.547706,2009-09-18,"A number of paramyxoviruses are responsible for acute respiratory infections in children, elderly and immuno-compromised individuals, resulting in airway inflammation and exacerbation of chronic diseases like asthma. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections, we searched for cellular targets of the virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3-C). We found that hPIV3-C interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas C proteins from measles or Nipah viruses failed to do so. Binding to STAT1 explains the previously reported capacity of hPIV3-C to block type I interferon signaling, but the interaction with GRB2 was unexpected. This adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor to MAPK/ERK pathway, a signaling cascade recently found to be involved in airway inflammatory response. We report that either hPIV3 infection or transient expression of hPIV3-C both increase cellular response to EGF, as assessed by Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 prevented viral protein expression in infected cells. Altogether, our data provide molecular basis to explain the role of hPIV3-C as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis and demonstrate that Paramyxoviridae have evolved a single virulence factor to block type I interferon signaling and to boost simultaneous cellular response to growth factors.","Caignard, Grégory; Komarova, Anastassia V.; Bouraï, Mehdi; Mourez, Thomas; Jacob, Yves; Jones, Louis M.; Rozenberg, Flore; Vabret, Astrid; Freymuth, François; Tangy, Frédéric; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier",PLoS Pathog,51,11
282,282,282,Gene Expression Profiling in Cells with Enhanced γ-Secretase Activity,11.649955,7.679982,2009-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Processing by γ-secretase of many type-I membrane protein substrates triggers signaling cascades by releasing intracellular domains (ICDs) that, following nuclear translocation, modulate the transcription of different genes regulating a diverse array of cellular and biological processes. Because the list of γ-secretase substrates is growing quickly and this enzyme is a cancer and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic target, the mapping of γ-secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes and molecular functions transcriptionally affected by γ-secretase activity, the cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced and inhibited γ-secretase activity were analyzed and compared by cDNA microarray. The functional clustering by FatiGO of the 1,981 identified genes revealed over- and under-represented groups with multiple activities and functions. Single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to γ-secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the 21 validated genes, the strikingly decreased transcription of PTPRG and AMN1 and increased transcription of UPP1 potentially support data on cell cycle disturbances relevant to cancer, stem cell and neurodegenerative diseases' research. The mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data and revealed broad effects on Wnt pathway members, including WNT3A and DVL3. Intriguingly, the transcription of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is affected by γ-secretase activity and was significantly altered in the analyzed human Alzheimer's disease brain cortices. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Investigating the effects of γ-secretase activity on gene transcription has revealed several affected clusters of molecular functions and, more specifically, 21 genes that hold significant potential for a better understanding of the biology of γ-secretase and its roles in cancer and Alzheimer's disease pathology.","Magold, Alexandra I.; Cacquevel, Matthias; Fraering, Patrick C.",PLoS One,51,1
331,331,331,A novel anti-mycobacterial function of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1,11.462836,7.4049134,2009-12-17,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-α via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-α inducible by BCG. CONCLUSIONS: Since TNF-α is pivotal in granuloma formation, the results indicated an unexpected positive function of MKP-1 against mycobacterial infection as opposed to its usual phosphatase activity.","Cheung, Benny KW; Yim, Howard CH; Lee, Norris CM; Lau, Allan SY",BMC Immunol,51,1
354,354,354,"Triple Combination of Amantadine, Ribavirin, and Oseltamivir Is Highly Active and Synergistic against Drug Resistant Influenza Virus Strains In Vitro",11.541419,7.753946,2010-02-22,"The rapid emergence and subsequent spread of the novel 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) has prompted the World Health Organization to declare the first pandemic of the 21(st) century, highlighting the threat of influenza to public health and healthcare systems. Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1. The TCAD regimen overcomes baseline drug resistance to both classes of approved influenza antivirals, and thus may represent a highly active antiviral therapy for seasonal and pandemic influenza.","Nguyen, Jack T.; Hoopes, Justin D.; Le, Minh H.; Smee, Donald F.; Patick, Amy K.; Faix, Dennis J.; Blair, Patrick J.; de Jong, Menno D.; Prichard, Mark N.; Went, Gregory T.",PLoS One,51,28

445,445,445,Human Anti-Plague Monoclonal Antibodies Protect Mice from Yersinia pestis in a Bubonic Plague Model,11.412562,7.58367,2010-10-13,"Yersinia pestis is the etiologic agent of plague that has killed more than 200 million people throughout the recorded history of mankind. Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a naïve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge. These antibodies can be further studied to determine their potential as therapeutics or prophylactics in Y. pestis infection in humans.","Xiao, Xiaodong; Zhu, Zhongyu; Dankmeyer, Jennifer L.; Wormald, Michael M.; Fast, Randy L.; Worsham, Patricia L.; Cote, Christopher K.; Amemiya, Kei; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.",PLoS One,51,11

This study evaluates immune responses and protection following vaccination with a replication-incompetent porcine adenovirus 3 (PAV3) vector as an alternative vaccine to AdHu5 using an avian influenza H5N1 disease model. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in BALB/c mice following vaccination with different doses of the PAV3 vector expressing an optimized A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin antigen (PAV3-HA) and compared with an AdHu5-HA control. PAV3-HA rapidly generated antibody responses, with significant neutralizing antibody titers on day 21, and stronger cellular immune responses detected on day 8, compared to AdHu5-HA. The PAV3-HA vaccine, administered 8 days before challenge, demonstrated improved survival and lower virus load. Evaluation of long-term vaccine efficacy at 12 months post-vaccination showed better protection with the PAV3-HA than with the AdHu5-HA vaccine. Importantly, as opposed to AdHu5, PAV3 vector was not significantly neutralized by human antibodies pooled from over 10,000 individuals.

665,665,665,Evaluation of Approaches to Identify the Targets of Cellular Immunity on a Proteome-Wide Scale,11.649597,7.4368443,2011-11-11,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine development against malaria and other complex diseases remains a challenge for the scientific community. The recent elucidation of the genome, proteome and transcriptome of many of these complex pathogens provides the basis for rational vaccine design by identifying, on a proteome-wide scale, novel target antigens that are recognized by T cells and antibodies from exposed individuals. However, there is currently no algorithm to effectively identify important target antigens from genome sequence data; this is especially challenging for T cell targets. Furthermore, for some of these pathogens, such as Plasmodium, protein expression using conventional platforms has been problematic but cell-free in vitro transcription translation (IVTT) strategies have recently proved successful. Herein, we report a novel approach for proteome-wide scale identification of the antigenic targets of T cell responses using IVTT products. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using IVTT proteins either unpurified, absorbed to carboxylated polybeads, or affinity purified through nickel resin or magnetic beads. In vitro studies in humans using CMV, EBV, and Influenza A virus proteins showed antigen-specific cytokine production in ELIspot and Cytometric Bead Array assays with cells stimulated with purified or unpurified IVTT antigens. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice immunized with the Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite DNA vaccine with or without IVTT protein boost showed antigen-specific cytokine production using purified IVTT antigens only. Overall, the nickel resin method of IVTT antigen purification proved optimal in both human and murine systems. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides proof of concept for the potential of high-throughput approaches to identify T cell targets of complex parasitic, viral or bacterial pathogens from genomic sequence data, for rational vaccine development against emerging and re-emerging diseases that pose a threat to public health.","Cardoso, Fernanda C.; Roddick, Joanne S.; Groves, Penny; Doolan, Denise L.",PLoS One,51,1

There are two pathways for viral infection to “right next door”: one is the virus transmission through cell-cell fusion by forming syncytium without production of progeny virions, and the other is mediated by virions without virus diffusion, generally designated cell-to-cell transmission. Influenza viruses are believed to be transmitted as cell-free virus from infected cells to uninfected cells. Here, we demonstrated that influenza virus can utilize cell-to-cell transmission pathway through apical membranes, by handover of virions on the surface of an infected cell to adjacent host cells. Live cell imaging techniques showed that a recombinant influenza virus, in which the neuraminidase gene was replaced with the green fluorescence protein gene, spreads from an infected cell to adjacent cells forming infected cell clusters. This type of virus spreading requires HA activation by protease treatment. The cell-to-cell transmission was also blocked by amantadine, which inhibits the acidification of endosomes required for uncoating of influenza virus particles in endosomes, indicating that functional hemagglutinin and endosome acidification by M2 ion channel were essential for the cell-to-cell influenza virus transmission. Furthermore, in the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza virus, progeny virions could remain associated with the surface of infected cell even after budding, for the progeny virions to be passed on to adjacent uninfected cells. The evidence that cell-to-cell transmission occurs in influenza virus lead to the caution that local infection proceeds even when treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.","Mori, Kotaro; Haruyama, Takahiro; Nagata, Kyosuke",PLoS One,51,8

One important precursor currently used for the production of Relenza, an antiviral product from GlaxoSmithKline, is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc). This substance has a considerably high market price despite efforts to develop cost-reducing (biotechnological) production processes. Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) is a saprophyte noted for its abundant secretion of hydrolytic enzymes and its potential to degrade chitin to its monomer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). Chitin is considered the second most abundant biomass available on earth and therefore an attractive raw material. RESULTS: In this study, we introduced two enzymes from bacterial origin into Hypocrea, which convert GlcNAc into NeuNAc via N-acetylmannosamine. This enabled the fungus to produce NeuNAc from the cheap starting material chitin in liquid culture. Furthermore, we expressed the two recombinant enzymes as GST-fusion proteins and developed an enzyme assay for monitoring their enzymatic functionality. Finally, we demonstrated that Hypocrea does not metabolize NeuNAc and that no NeuNAc-uptake by the fungus occurs, which are important prerequisites for a potential production strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a proof of concept for the possibility to engineer in a filamentous fungus a bacterial enzyme cascade, which is fully functional. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the development of a process for NeuNAc production as well as a general prospective design for production processes that use saprophytes as whole-cell catalysts.","Steiger, Matthias G; Mach-Aigner, Astrid R; Gorsche, Rita; Rosenberg, Erwin E; Mihovilovic, Marko D; Mach, Robert L",Microb Cell Fact,51,8

Structural data on the arrangement, stoichiometry and organisation of the component molecules of filoviruses has until now been lacking, partially due to the need to work under level 4 biological containment. The present study provides unique insights into the structure of this deadly pathogen. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have investigated the structure of Ebola virus using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, and single particle image processing. Here we report the three-dimensional structure and architecture of Ebola virus and establish that multiple copies of the RNA genome can be packaged to produce polyploid virus particles, through an extreme degree of length polymorphism. We show that the helical Ebola virus inner nucleocapsid containing RNA and nucleoprotein is stabilized by an outer layer of VP24-VP35 bridges. Elucidation of the structure of the membrane-associated glycoprotein in its native state indicates that the putative receptor-binding site is occluded within the molecule, while a major neutralizing epitope is exposed on its surface proximal to the viral envelope. The matrix protein VP40 forms a regular lattice within the envelope, although its contacts with the nucleocapsid are irregular. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate a modular organization in Ebola virus that accommodates a well-ordered, symmetrical nucleocapsid within a flexible, tubular membrane envelope.","Beniac, Daniel R.; Melito, Pasquale L.; deVarennes, Shauna L.; Hiebert, Shannon L.; Rabb, Melissa J.; Lamboo, Lindsey L.; Jones, Steven M.; Booth, Timothy F.",PLoS One,51,28
731,731,731,Development and Applications of VSV Vectors Based on Cell Tropism,11.436704,7.390402,2012-01-18,"Viral vectors have been available in various fields such as medical and biological research or gene therapy applications. Targeting vectors pseudotyped with distinct viral envelope proteins that influence cell tropism and transfection efficiency are useful tools not only for examining entry mechanisms or cell tropisms but also for vaccine vector development. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an excellent candidate for development as a pseudotype vector. A recombinant VSV lacking its own envelope (G) gene has been used to produce a pseudotype or recombinant VSV possessing the envelope proteins of heterologous viruses. These viruses possess a reporter gene instead of a VSV G gene in their genome, and therefore it is easy to evaluate their infectivity in the study of viral entry, including identification of viral receptors. Furthermore, advantage can be taken of a property of the pseudotype VSV, which is competence for single-round infection, in handling many different viruses that are either difficult to amplify in cultured cells or animals or that require specialized containment facilities. Here we describe procedures for producing pseudotype or recombinant VSVs and a few of the more prominent examples from envelope viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, baculovirus, and hemorrhagic fever viruses.","Tani, Hideki; Morikawa, Shigeru; Matsuura, Yoshiharu",Front Microbiol,51,8

Current genome annotation programs do not identify all of the functional elements of the genome, especially small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whole genome transcriptome analysis is a complementary method to identify “novel” genes, small RNAs, regulatory regions, and operon structures, thus improving the structural annotation in bacteria. In particular, the identification of non-coding RNAs has revealed their widespread occurrence and functional importance in gene regulation, stress and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in Histophilus somni, one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) as well as bovine infertility, abortion, septicemia, arthritis, myocarditis, and thrombotic meningoencephalitis. In this study, we report a single nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of H. somni strain 2336 using RNA-Seq method. The RNA-Seq based transcriptome map identified 94 sRNAs in the H. somni genome of which 82 sRNAs were never predicted or reported in earlier studies. We also identified 38 novel potential protein coding open reading frames that were absent in the current genome annotation. The transcriptome map allowed the identification of 278 operon (total 730 genes) structures in the genome. When compared with the genome sequence of a non-virulent strain 129Pt, a disproportionate number of sRNAs (∼30%) were located in genomic region unique to strain 2336 (∼18% of the total genome). This observation suggests that a number of the newly identified sRNAs in strain 2336 may be involved in strain-specific adaptations.","Kumar, Ranjit; Lawrence, Mark L.; Watt, James; Cooksey, Amanda M.; Burgess, Shane C.; Nanduri, Bindu",PLoS One,51,17
804,804,804,A Human PrM Antibody That Recognizes a Novel Cryptic Epitope on Dengue E Glycoprotein,11.417689,7.6411643,2012-04-03,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a major mosquito-borne pathogen infecting up to 100 million people each year; so far no effective treatment or vaccines are available. Recently, highly cross-reactive and infection-enhancing pre-membrane (prM)-specific antibodies were found to dominate the anti-DENV immune response in humans, raising concern over vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prM sequences. In this study, we have isolated a broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibody, D29, during a screen with a non-immunized human Fab-phage library against the four serotypes of DENV. The antibody is capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) in FcγR-bearing K562 cells. Remarkably, D29 also cross-reacted with a cryptic epitope on the envelope (E) protein located to the DI/DII junction as evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis. This cryptic epitope, while inaccessible to antibody binding in a native virus particle, may become exposed if E is not properly folded. These findings suggest that generation of anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection may not be completely avoided even with immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins.","Chan, Annie Hoi Yi; Tan, Hwee Cheng; Chow, Angelia Yee; Lim, Angeline Pei Chiew; Lok, Shee Mei; Moreland, Nicole J.; Vasudevan, Subhash G.; MacAry, Paul A.; Ooi, Eng Eong; Hanson, Brendon J.",PLoS One,51,11
839,839,839,Immunogenetic Mechanisms Driving Norovirus GII.4 Antigenic Variation,11.625436,7.526185,2012-05-17,"Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide with GII.4 strains accounting for 80% of infections. The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials. To test if antigenic drift may contribute to GII.4 persistence, human memory B cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral (1987–1997), contemporary (2004–2009), and broad (1987–2009). NVB 114 reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4-specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294–298 and 368–372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393–395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","Lindesmith, Lisa C.; Beltramello, Martina; Donaldson, Eric F.; Corti, Davide; Swanstrom, Jesica; Debbink, Kari; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Baric, Ralph S.",PLoS Pathog,51,1

Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in orchestrating immune responses by either mediating protective immune responses or inducing antigen specific tolerance. Previous studies demonstrated that the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) and its ligand (Flt3L) play an essential role in the regulation of DC commitment and development. Here, we report a synergic effect between Flt3L and low-dose rapamycin (Rapa) in the protection of allograft rejction. It was found that Flt3L combined with Rapa significantly prolonged murine cardiac allograft survival time as compared with that of untreated recipients or recipients treated with Rapa or Flt3L alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that Flt3L combined with low-dose of Rapa induced the generation of tolerogenic DCs along with the production of CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and IL-10 secretion. We also observed enhanced autophagy in the cardiac allograft, which could be another asset contributing to the enhanced allograft survival. All together, these data suggest that Flt3L combined with low-dose of Rapa could be an effective therapeutic approach to induce tolerance in clinical setting of transplantation.","Xiong, Ali; Duan, Lihua; Chen, Jie; Fan, Zhigang; Zheng, Fang; Tan, Zheng; Gong, Feili; Fang, Min",PLoS One,51,1

In this study, we used African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and Ixodes scapularis tick cells (ISE6) to compare virus-induced changes in mammalian and arthropod cells. Using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron tomography (ET), we examined viral protein distribution and the ultrastructural changes that occur during TBFV infection. Within host cells, flaviviruses cause complex rearrangement of cellular membranes for the purpose of virus replication. Virus infection was accompanied by a marked expansion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and markers for TBFV replication were localized mainly to the ER in both cell lines. TEM of Vero cells showed membrane-bound vesicles enclosed in a network of dilated, anastomosing ER cisternae. Virions were seen within the ER and were sometimes in paracrystalline arrays. Tubular structures or elongated vesicles were occasionally noted. In acutely and persistently infected ISE6 cells, membrane proliferation and vesicles were also noted; however, the extent of membrane expansion and the abundance of vesicles were lower and no viral particles were observed. Tubular profiles were far more prevalent in persistently infected ISE6 cells than in acutely infected cells. By ET, tubular profiles, in persistently infected tick cells, had a cross-sectional diameter of 60–100 nm, reached up to 800 nm in length, were closed at the ends, and were often arranged in fascicle-like bundles, shrouded with ER membrane. Our experiments provide analysis of viral protein localization within the context of both mammalian and arthropod cell lines as well as both acute and persistent arthropod cell infection. Additionally, we show for the first time 3D flavivirus infection in a vector cell line and the first ET of persistent flavivirus infection.","Offerdahl, Danielle K.; Dorward, David W.; Hansen, Bryan T.; Bloom, Marshall E.",PLoS One,51,8

In addition, retroviruses are widely used as tools to transfer genes of interest to target cells. Understanding the entry mechanism of retroviruses contributes to developments of novel therapeutic approaches against retrovirus-induced diseases and efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors. Entry of enveloped viruses into host cell cytoplasm is achieved by fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes at either the cell surface or intracellular vesicles. Many animal retroviruses enter host cells through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry requires cathepsin proteases activated by the endosome acidification. CD4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to occur via endosomes, but endosome acidification is not necessary for the entry whereas entry of CD4-independent HIVs, which are thought to be prototypes of CD4-dependent viruses, is low pH dependent. There are several controversial results on the retroviral entry pathways. Because endocytosis and endosome acidification are complicatedly controlled by cellular mechanisms, the retrovirus entry pathways may be different in different cell lines.","Kubo, Yoshinao; Hayashi, Hideki; Matsuyama, Toshifumi; Sato, Hironori; Yamamoto, Naoki",Adv Virol,51,1

Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread very rapidly to many European countries. Here, we developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions. Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV. We showed that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and “synthetic” SBV replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus. We developed an experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex. These virus-induced acute lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases. Indeed, we detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves, suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is mostly secondary to central nervous system damage. Finally, we investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence. Interestingly, we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture displays increased virulence in mice. We also found that a SBV deletion mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBVΔNSs) is less virulent in mice than wild type SBV. Attenuation of SBV virulence depends on the inability of SBVΔNSs to block IFN synthesis in virus infected cells. In conclusion, this work provides a useful experimental framework to study the biology and pathogenesis of SBV.","Varela, Mariana; Schnettler, Esther; Caporale, Marco; Murgia, Claudio; Barry, Gerald; McFarlane, Melanie; McGregor, Eva; Piras, Ilaria M.; Shaw, Andrew; Lamm, Catherine; Janowicz, Anna; Beer, Martin; Glass, Mandy; Herder, Vanessa; Hahn, Kerstin; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Kohl, Alain; Palmarini, Massimo",PLoS Pathog,51,28
1057,1057,1057,Binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN Promotes ASK-1-Dependent Activation-Induced Apoptosis of Human Dendritic Cells,11.380323,7.7036147,2013-01-31,"During disease progression to AIDS, HIV-1 infected individuals become increasingly immunosuppressed and susceptible to opportunistic infections. It has also been demonstrated that multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DC), including DC-SIGN(+) cells, become significantly depleted in the blood and lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients, which may contribute to the failure in initiating effective host immune responses. The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(+) blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV(+) serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN(+) DC that were isolated directly from HIV-1(+) individuals had actually been pre-sensitized by serum gp120 for activation-induced exorbitant apoptosis. In all cases the DC apoptosis was substantially inhibited by DC-SIGN blockade. Finally, we showed that accelerated DC apoptosis was a direct consequence of excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule ASK-1 and transfection of siRNA against ASK-1 significantly prevented the activation-induced excessive DC death. Our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism of immune modulation by envelope protein gp120, provides new insights into HIV immunopathogenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic approaches to prevent DC depletion in chronic HIV infection.","Chen, Yongxiong; Hwang, Shiuh-Lin; Chan, Vera S.

RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.","Law, John; Jovel, Juan; Patterson, Jordan; Ford, Glenn; O’keefe, Sandra; Wang, Weiwei; Meng, Bo; Song, Deyong; Zhang, Yong; Tian, Zhijian; Wasilenko, Shawn T.; Rahbari, Mandana; Mitchell, Troy; Jordan, Tracy; Carpenter, Eric; Mason, Andrew L.; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu",PLoS One,51,1

These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCε/JNK/c-Jun and PKCα/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-α signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.","Chen, Yanni; Chen, Junbo; Wang, Hui; Shi, Jingjing; Wu, Kailang; Liu, Shi; Liu, Yingle; Wu, Jianguo",PLoS Pathog,51,1

Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging ‘footprint’ of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors.","Smith, Craig; Skelly, Chris; Kung, Nina; Roberts, Billie; Field, Hume",PLoS One,51,28

Although TTF-1 inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in lung adenocarcinoma cells, the mechanism through which TTF-1 inhibits the functions of TGF-β is unknown. Here we show that TTF-1 disrupts the nuclear Smad3-Smad4 complex without affecting the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad3. Genome-wide analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that TTF-1 colocalizes with Smad3 on chromatin and alters Smad3-binding patterns throughout the genome, while TTF-1 generally inhibits Smad4 binding to chromatin. Moreover, Smad3 binds to chromatin together with TTF-1, but not with Smad4, at some Smad3-binding regions when TGF-β signaling is absent, and knockdown of Smad4 expression does not attenuate Smad3 binding in these regions. Thus, TTF-1 may compete with Smad4 for interaction with Smad3, and in the presence of TTF-1, Smad3 regulates the transcription of certain genes independently of Smad4. These findings provide a new model of regulation of TGF-β-Smad signaling by TTF-1.","Isogaya, Kazunobu; Koinuma, Daizo; Tsutsumi, Shuichi; Saito, Roy-Akira; Miyazawa, Keiji; Aburatani, Hiroyuki; Miyazono, Kohei",Cell Research,51,8

Active prophylaxis by vaccination against influenza virus is currently the main countermeasure supplemented with antivirals. However, disadvantages of this strategy include the impact of antigenic drift, necessitating constant updating of vaccine strain composition, and emerging antiviral drug resistance. The development of other options for influenza prophylaxis, particularly with broad acting agents able to provide protection in the period between the onset of a pandemic and the development of a strain specific vaccine, is of great interest. Exploitation of broad-spectrum mediators could provide barricade protection in the early critical phase of influenza virus outbreaks. Passive immunity has the potential to provide immediate antiviral effects, inhibiting virus replication, reducing virus shedding, and thereby protecting vulnerable populations in the event of an impending influenza pandemic. Here, we review passive broad-spectrum influenza prophylaxis options with a focus on harnessing natural host defenses, including interferons and antibodies.","Berry, Cassandra M.; Penhale, William J.; Sangster, Mark Y.",Influenza Res Treat,51,1

Nevertheless there are currently no publicly available transcriptome reference sequences or genome for this species. RESULTS: A cDNA library derived from mRNA and snRNA isolated and pooled from the brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, and hearts of three adult female Syrian hamsters was sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled into 62,482 contigs and 111,796 reads remained unassembled (singletons). This combined contig/singleton dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, represents a total of 60,117,204 nucleotides. Our Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome mapped to 11,648 mouse transcripts representing 9,562 distinct genes, and mapped to a similar number of transcripts and genes in the rat. We identified 214 quasi-complete transcripts based on mouse annotations. Canonical pathways involved in a broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes were significantly represented in the library. The Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned to the current release of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transcriptome and genome to improve the genomic annotation of this species. Finally, our Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned against 14 other rodents, primate and laurasiatheria species to gain insights about the genetic relatedness and placement of this species. CONCLUSIONS: This Syrian hamster transcriptome dataset significantly improves our knowledge of the Syrian hamster's transcriptome, especially towards its future use in infectious disease research. Moreover, this library is an important resource for the wider scientific community to help improve genome annotation of the Syrian hamster and other closely related species. Furthermore, these data provide the basis for development of expression microarrays that can be used in functional genomics studies.","Tchitchek, Nicolas; Safronetz, David; Rasmussen, Angela L.; Martens, Craig; Virtaneva, Kimmo; Porcella, Stephen F.; Feldmann, Heinz; Ebihara, Hideki; Katze, Michael G.",PLoS One,51,1

On February 21, 2014, a poultry farmer infected with H7N9 virus was identified in Jilin, China, and H7N9 and H9N2 viruses were isolated from the patient's farm. Reassortment between these subtype viruses generated five genotypes, one of which caused the human infection. The date of H7N9 virus introduction to the farm is estimated to be between August 21, 2013 (95% confidence interval [CI] June 6, 2013-October 6, 2013) and September 25, 2013 (95% CI May 28, 2013-January 4, 2014), suggesting that the most likely source of virus introduction was the first batch of poultry purchased in August 2013. The reassortment event that led to the human virus may have occurred between January 2, 2014 (95% CI November 8, 2013-February 12, 2014) and February 12, 2014 (95% CI January 19, 2014-February 18, 2014).

Resveratrol could effectively inhibit the synthesis of EV71/VP1 and the phosphorylation of IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, IKBα, NF-κB p50 and NF-κB p65, respectively. Meanwhile, the remarkably increased secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α in EV71-infected rhabdosarcoma (RD) cells could be blocked by resveratrol.

To combat HCC effectively research is directed towards its early detection and the development of targeted therapies. Given the fact that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we searched for disease regulated proteins to improve an understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of EGF induced HCC. Disease regulated proteins were studied by 2DE MALDI-TOF/TOF and a transcriptomic approach, by immunohistochemistry and advanced bioinformatics. RESULTS: Mapping of EGF induced liver cancer in a transgenic mouse model identified n = 96 (p < 0.05) significantly regulated proteins of which n = 54 were tumour-specific. To unravel molecular circuits linked to aberrant EGFR signalling diverse computational approaches were employed and this defined n = 7 key nodes using n = 82 disease regulated proteins for network construction. STRING analysis revealed protein-protein interactions of > 70% disease regulated proteins with individual proteins being validated by immunohistochemistry. The disease regulated network proteins were mapped to distinct pathways and bioinformatics provided novel insight into molecular circuits associated with significant changes in either glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, argine and proline metabolism, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, Hif- and MAPK signalling, lipoprotein metabolism, platelet activation and hemostatic control as a result of aberrant EGF signalling. The biological significance of the findings was corroborated with gene expression data derived from tumour tissues to evntually define a rationale by which tumours embark on intriguing changes in metabolism that is of utility for an understanding of tumour growth. Moreover, among the EGF tumour specific proteins n = 11 were likewise uniquely expressed in human HCC and for n = 49 proteins regulation in human HCC was confirmed using the publically available Human Protein Atlas depository, therefore demonstrating clinical significance. CONCLUSION: Novel insight into the molecular pathogenesis of EGF induced liver cancer was obtained and among the 37 newly identified proteins several are likely candidates for the development of molecularly targeted therapies and include the nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, bifunctional ATP-dependent dihydroyacetone kinase and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein1, the latter being an inhibitor of the Raf-1 kinase.

We investigated the role of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament, in this process using three well-characterized murine models of ALI known to require NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We demonstrate that central pathophysiologic events in ALI (inflammation, IL-1β levels, endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier permeability, remodelling and fibrosis) are attenuated in the lungs of Vim(−/−) mice challenged with LPS, bleomycin and asbestos. Bone marrow chimeric mice lacking vimentin have reduced IL-1β levels and attenuated lung injury and fibrosis following bleomycin exposure. Furthermore, decreased active caspase-1 and IL-1β levels are observed in vitro in Vim(−/−) and vimentin-knockdown macrophages. Importantly, we show direct protein–protein interaction between NLRP3 and vimentin.

An assessment was made of the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of paeonol (PA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (PGG) from Paeonia lactiflora root toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in MRC5 cells using a tetrazolium method and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 μM) and HRV-4 (17.33 μM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin. The constituents had relatively high selective index values (3.3–>8.5). The 100 μg/mL PA and 20 μg/mL PGG did not interact with the HRV-4 particles. These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1β), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV. Global efforts to reduce the level of synthetic drugs justify further studies on P. lactiflora root-derived materials as potential anti-HRV products or lead molecules for the prevention or treatment of HRV.","Ngan, Luong Thi My; Jang, Myeong Jin; Kwon, Min Jung; Ahn, Young Joon",PLoS One,51,11

We sought to establish an optimized method for high yielding and long maintenance of characteristics of primary human AEII cells to facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms of lung diseases at the cellular and molecular levels. Adult human peripheral normal lung tissues of oncologic patients undergoing lung resection were collected. The AEII cells were isolated and identified by the expression of pro-surfactant protein (SP)C, epithelial sodium channel (αENaC) and cytokeratin (CK)-8, the lamellar bodies specific for AEII cells, and confirmed by the histology using electron microscopy. The phenotype of AEII cells was characterized by the expression of surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D), CK-8, KL-6, αENaC, and aquaporin (AQP)-3, which was maintained over 20 days. The biological activity of the primary human AEII cells producing SP-C, cytokines, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was vigorous in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α. We have modified previous methods and optimized a method for isolation of high purity and long maintenance of the human AEII cell phenotype in primary culture.

1818,1818,1818,Drak2 Does Not Regulate TGF-β Signaling in T Cells,11.811135,7.6142735,2015-05-07,"Drak2 is a serine/threonine kinase expressed highest in T cells and B cells. Drak2(-/-) mice are resistant to autoimmunity in mouse models of type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Resistance to these diseases occurs, in part, because Drak2 is required for the survival of autoreactive T cells that induce disease. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 affects T cell survival and autoimmunity are not known. A recent report demonstrated that Drak2 negatively regulated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in tumor cell lines. Thus, increased TGF-β signaling in the absence of Drak2 may contribute to the resistance to autoimmunity in Drak2(-/-) mice. Therefore, we examined if Drak2 functioned as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling in T cells, and whether the enhanced susceptibility to death of Drak2(-/-) T cells was due to augmented TGF-β signaling. Using several in vitro assays to test TGF-β signaling and T cell function, we found that activation of Smad2 and Smad3, which are downstream of the TGF-β receptor, was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Furthermore, TGF-β-mediated effects on naïve T cell proliferation, activated CD8(+) T cell survival, and regulatory T cell induction was similar between wildtype and Drak2(-/-) T cells. Finally, the increased susceptibility to death in the absence of Drak2 was not due to enhanced TGF-β signaling. Together, these data suggest that Drak2 does not function as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling in primary T cells stimulated in vitro. It is important to investigate and discern potential molecular mechanisms by which Drak2 functions in order to better understand the etiology of autoimmune diseases, as well as to validate the use of Drak2 as a target for therapeutic treatment of these diseases.","Harris, Tarsha L.; McGargill, Maureen A.",PLoS One,51,1

Often, the pandemic potential of newly emerging IAV is only fully recognized once the virus starts to spread efficiently causing serious disease in humans. Here, we used a novel phylogenetic algorithm based on the informational spectrum method (ISM) to identify potential CPIV by predicting mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (HA) gene that are likely to (differentially) affect critical interactions between the HA protein and target cells from bird and human origin, respectively. Predictions were subsequently validated by generating pseudotyped retrovirus particles and genetically engineered IAV containing these mutations and characterizing potential effects on virus entry and replication in cells expressing human and avian IAV receptors, respectively. Our data suggest that the ISM-based algorithm is suitable to identify CPIV among IAV strains that are circulating in animal hosts and thus may be a new tool for assessing pandemic risks associated with specific strains.","Schmier, Sonja; Mostafa, Ahmed; Haarmann, Thomas; Bannert, Norbert; Ziebuhr, John; Veljkovic, Veljko; Dietrich, Ursula; Pleschka, Stephan",Sci Rep,51,11

We report here the role of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)- and Δggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than Δggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that Δggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P<0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P<0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of Δggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of Δggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation. Our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as an important virulence factor and a promising target in the management of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.","Ling, Samantha Shi Min; Khoo, Lawrence Han Boon; Hwang, Le-Ann; Yeoh, Khay Guan; Ho, Bow",PLoS One,51,1

However, this involvement has not been well-studied in the paradigm of macrophage polarization, which typically has been categorized by the dichotomy of classical (M1) and alternative (M2) statuses.

Here, through examination of viral infections targeting macrophages/monocytic cells, we focus on the direct involvement of macrophage polarization during viral infections. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are critical in regulation of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral infection; thus, we propose to incorporate IFN-mediated antiviral states into the framework of macrophage polarization. This view is supported by the multifunctional properties of type I IFNs, which potentially elicit and regulate both M1- and M2-polarization in addition to inducing the antiviral state, and by the discoveries of viral mechanisms to adapt and modulate macrophage polarization. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated effective prevention of viral diseases through manipulation of macrophage immune statuses.","Sang, Yongming; Miller, Laura C; Blecha, Frank",J Clin Cell Immunol,51,8

However, its clinical application is limited because of short half-life, drug resistance and cross-reactivity with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients. Using an artificial peptide strategy, we designed a peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, which exhibited potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20, and had remarkably longer in vivo half-life than T20. While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20’s antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices. Therefore, AP3 has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor with improved antiviral efficacy, resistance profile and pharmacological properties over enfuvirtide.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction are major complications in patients with severe influenza infection. This may be explained by the recent studies which highlighted the role of the pulmonary endothelium as the center of innate immune cells recruitment and excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In this report, we examined the potential immunomodulatory effects of two indirubin derivatives, indirubin-3′-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804) and indirubin-3′-oxime (E231), on IAV (H9N2) infected-human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Infection of H9N2 on HPMECs induced a high level of chemokines and cytokines production including IP-10, RANTES, IL-6, IFN-β and IFN-γ1. Post-treatment of E804 or E231 could significantly suppress the production of these cytokines. H9N2 infection rapidly triggered the activation of innate immunity through phosphorylation of signaling molecules including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Using specific inhibitors or small-interfering RNA, we confirmed that indirubin derivatives can suppress H9N2-induced cytokines production through MAPKs and STAT3 signaling pathways.

A lack of intense research over the last decades and increasing resistances to the recommended antibiotics call for a better understanding of gonococcal infection, fast diagnostics and therapeutic measures against N. gonorrhoeae. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify novel immunogenic proteins as a first step to advance those unresolved problems. For the identification of immunogenic proteins, pHORF oligopeptide phage display libraries of the entire N. gonorrhoeae genome were constructed. Several immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae. Corresponding full-length proteins of the identified oligopeptides were expressed and their immunogenic character was verified by ELISA. The immunogenic character of six proteins was identified for the first time. Additional 13 proteins were verified as immunogenic proteins in N. gonorrhoeae.","Connor, Daniel O.; Zantow, Jonas; Hust, Michael; Bier, Frank F.; von Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus",PLoS One,51,1
2125,2125,2125,Direct Visualization of Ebola Virus Fusion Triggering in the Endocytic Pathway,11.496956,7.5096483,2016-02-09,"Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion—triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing—by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.","Spence, Jennifer S.; Krause, Tyler B.; Mittler, Eva; Jangra, Rohit K.; Chandran, Kartik",mBio,51,28

Recent studies demonstrated that influenza NP is a valid target for antiviral drug development. The surface of the groove, covered with numerous conserved residues between the head and body domains of influenza A NP, plays a crucial role in RNA binding. To explore the mechanism by which NP binds RNA, we performed a series of site-directed mutagenesis in the RNA-binding groove, followed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to characterize the interactions between RNA and NP. Furthermore, a role of Y148 in NP stability and NP-RNA binding was evaluated. The aromatic residue of Y148 was found to stack with a nucleotide base. By interrupting the stacking interaction between Y148 and an RNA base, we identified an influenza virus NP inhibitor, (E, E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione; this inhibitor reduced the NP’s RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. Our findings will be useful for the development of new drugs that disrupt the interaction between RNA and viral NP in the influenza virus.","Liu, Chia-Lin; Hung, Hui-Chen; Lo, Shou-Chen; Chiang, Ching-Hui; Chen, I-Jung; Hsu, John T.-A.; Hou, Ming-Hon",Sci Rep,51,28

Pre-infection with PRRSV leads to exacerbated disease caused by S. suis infection. Very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility. Since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response, the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and monocytes in the context of PRRSV and S. suis co-infection was investigated. BMDCs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to PRRSV infection; S. suis phagocytosis by PRRSV-infected BMDCs was found to be impaired, whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival. Transcription profile analysis, with a major focus on inflammatory genes, following S. suis infection, with and without pre-infection with PRRSV, was then performed. While PRRSV pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to S. suis infection, a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV after a subsequent infection with S. suis. While an additive effect could be observed for CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15, a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-α after co-infection. This increased pro-inflammatory response by DCs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during PRRSV and S. suis co-infection.","Auray, Gaël; Lachance, Claude; Wang, Yingchao; Gagnon, Carl A.; Segura, Mariela; Gottschalk, Marcelo",PLoS One,51,8

The geographic range of human CCHF cases largely reflects the presence of ticks. However, highly similar CCHFV lineages occur in geographically distant regions. Tick-infested migratory birds have been suggested, but not confirmed, to contribute to the dispersal. Bats have recently been shown to carry nairoviruses distinct from CCHFV. In order to assess the presence of CCHFV in a wide range of bat species over a wide geographic range, we analyzed 1,135 sera from 16 different bat species collected in Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Germany, and Panama. Using a CCHFV glycoprotein-based indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT), we identified reactive antibodies in 10.0% (114/1,135) of tested bats, pertaining to 12/16 tested species. Depending on the species, 3.6%–42.9% of cave-dwelling bats and 0.6%–7.1% of foliage-living bats were seropositive (two-tailed t-test, p = 0.0447 cave versus foliage). 11/30 IIFT-reactive sera from 10 different African bat species had neutralizing activity in a virus-like particle assay.

Feline kidney F81 cells are sensitive to CPV infection and show disparate growing statuses at different time points post-infection. This study analysed the response of F81 cells to CPV infection at successive infection time points by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during 60 h of infection and at selected time points post-infection were identified by an analysis of variance test and a two-tailed unpaired t test, respectively. DEPs with similar quantitative changes were clustered by hierarchical clustering and analysed by gene ontology enrichment, revealing that 12 h and 60 h post-infection were the optimal times to analyse the autonomous parvovirus replication and apoptosis processes, respectively. Using the Metacore(TM) database, 29 DEPs were enriched in a network involved in p53 regulation. Besides, a significantly enriched pathway suggests that the CPV-induced cytopathic effect was probably due to the deficiency of functional CFTR caused by CPV infection. This study uncovered the systemic changes in key cellular factors involved in CPV infection and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of CPV and the cytopathic effects induced by CPV infection.","Zhao, Hang; Cheng, Yuening; Wang, Jianke; Lin, Peng; Yi, Li; Sun, Yaru; Ren, Jingqiang; Tong, Mingwei; Cao, Zhigang; Li, Jiawei; Deng, Jinliang; Cheng, Shipeng",Sci Rep,51,8

Here, we developed a workflow that uses sensitive methods to quantitatively and qualitatively assess immune responses against foreign antigens with regard to antibody binding affinity and epitope diversity. The application of such detailed assessments throughout an immunization campaign can significantly reduce the resources required to generate highly specific antibodies. Our workflow consists of the following two steps: 1) the use of surface plasmon resonance to quantify antigen-specific antibodies and evaluate their apparent binding affinities, and 2) the recovery of serum IgGs using an automated small scale purification system, followed by the determination of their epitope diversity using hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry. We showed that these methods were sensitive enough to detect antigen-specific IgGs in the nanogram/μl range and that they provided information for differentiating the antibody responses of the various immunized animals that could not be obtained by conventional methods. We also showed that this workflow can guide the selection of an animal that produces high affinity antibodies with a desired epitope coverage profile, resulting in the generation of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibody clones with desirable functional profiles. We postulate that this workflow will be an important tool in the development of effective vaccines to combat the highly sophisticated evasion mechanisms of pathogens.","Yang, Danlin; Frego, Lee; Lasaro, Marcio; Truncali, Kristopher; Kroe-Barrett, Rachel; Singh, Sanjaya",J Biol Chem,51,1

We previously reported that FcRn is expressed in a model of normal porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). Transmissible gastroenteritis is an acute enteric disease of swine that is caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). How porcine FcRn (pFcRn) expression is regulated by pathogenic infection remains unknown. Our research shows that IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV had up-regulated pFcRn expression. In addition, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated in IPEC-J2 cells by TGEV infection. Furthermore, treatment of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-κB-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 resulted in down-regulation of pFcRn expression. Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-κB p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids. We identified four NF-κB transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of this gene using luciferase reporter system, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and supershift analysis.

Clomiphene is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that blocks EBOV entry and infection in cells and significantly protects EBOV-challenged mice. As provided, clomiphene is, approximately, a 60:40 mixture of two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and zuclomiphene. The pharmacokinetic properties of the two isomers vary, but both accumulate in the eye and male reproductive tract, tissues in which EBOV can persist. Here we compared the ability of clomiphene and its isomers to inhibit EBOV using viral-like particle (VLP) entry and transcription/replication-competent VLP (trVLP) assays. Clomiphene and its isomers inhibited the entry and infection of VLPs and trVLPs with similar potencies. This was demonstrated with VLPs bearing the glycoproteins from three filoviruses (EBOV Mayinga, EBOV Makona, and Marburg virus) and in two cell lines (293T/17 and Vero E6). Visual problems have been noted in EBOV survivors, and viral RNA has been isolated from semen up to nine months post-infection. Since the clomiphene isomers accumulate in these affected tissues, clomiphene or one of its isomers warrants consideration as an anti-EBOV agent, for example, to potentially help ameliorate symptoms in EBOV survivors.","Nelson, Elizabeth A.; Barnes, Alyson B.; Wiehle, Ronald D.; Fontenot, Gregory K.; Hoenen, Thomas; White, Judith M.",Viruses,51,28

With a focus on Th1 immunity, we developed a DNA vaccine containing the native RSV fusion (RSV F) protein and studied its immune response in BALB/c mice. High levels of RSV specific antibodies were induced during subsequent immunizations. The serum antibodies were able to neutralize RSV in vitro. The RSV inhibition by sera was also shown by immunofluorescence analyses. Antibody response of the RSV F DNA vaccine showed a strong Th1 response. Also, sera from RSV F immunized and RSV infected mice reduced the RSV infection by 50% and 80%, respectively. Our data evidently showed that the RSV F DNA vaccine activated the Th1 biased immune response and led to the production of neutralizing antibodies, which is the desired immune response required for protection from RSV infections.","Eroglu, Erdal; Singh, Ankur; Bawage, Swapnil; Tiwari, Pooja M.; Vig, Komal; Pillai, Shreekumar R.; Dennis, Vida A.; Singh, Shree R.",Adv Virol,51,1

However, few studies have compared different reassortant combinations in pseudoparticle systems, or compared entry kinetics of native viruses and their pseudotyped analogs. Here, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions displaying distinct influenza virus envelope proteins were tested for fusion activity. We produced VSV pseudotypes containing the prototypical X-31 (H3) HA, either alone or with strain-matched or mismatched N2 NAs. We performed single-particle fusion assays using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to compare hemifusion kinetics among these pairings. Results illustrate that matching pseudoparticles behaved very similarly to native virus. Pseudoparticles harboring mismatched HA-NA pairings fuse at significantly slower rates than native virus, and NA-lacking pseudoparticles exhibiting the slowest fusion rates. Relative viral membrane HA density of matching pseudoparticles was higher than in mismatching or NA-lacking pseudoparticles. An equivalent trend of HA expression level on cell membranes of HA/NA co-transfected cells was observed and intracellular trafficking of HA was affected by NA co-expression. Overall, we show that specific influenza HA-NA combinations can profoundly affect the critical role played by HA during entry, which may factor into viral fitness and the emergence of new pandemic influenza viruses.","Hsu, Hung-Lun; Millet, Jean K.; Costello, Deirdre A.; Whittaker, Gary R.; Daniel, Susan",Sci Rep,51,28

Sequence and structure conservation provides valuable information to tackle these questions. It is, however, limited by the incomplete sampling of sequence space in natural evolution. Moreover, proteins often have multiple functions, with overlapping sequences that present challenges to accurate annotation of the exact functions of individual residues by conservation-based methods. Using the influenza A virus PB1 protein as an example, we developed a method to systematically identify and annotate functional residues. We used saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput sequencing to measure the replication capacity of single nucleotide mutations across the entire PB1 protein. After predicting protein stability upon mutations, we identified functional PB1 residues that are essential for viral replication. To further annotate the functional residues important to the canonical or noncanonical functions of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp), we performed a homologous-structure analysis with 16 different vRdRp structures. We achieved high sensitivity in annotating the known canonical polymerase functional residues. Moreover, we identified a cluster of noncanonical functional residues located in the loop region of the PB1 β-ribbon. We further demonstrated that these residues were important for PB1 protein nuclear import through the interaction with Ran-binding protein 5. In summary, we developed a systematic and sensitive method to identify and annotate functional residues that are not restrained by sequence conservation.

Mint3-deficient mice exhibited improved influenza pneumonia with reduced inflammatory cytokines/chemokine levels and neutrophil infiltration in the IFV-infected lungs without alteration in viral burden, type-I interferon production, or acquired immunity. In macrophages, Mint3 depletion attenuated NF-κB signalling and the resultant cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV infection by increasing IκBα and activating the cellular energy sensor AMPK, respectively.

Over time, and aided by further introductions from nonswine hosts, swine H1 viruses have diversified into three genetic lineages. Due to limited global data, these H1 lineages were named based on colloquial context, leading to a proliferation of inconsistent regional naming conventions. In this study, we propose rigorous phylogenetic criteria to establish a globally consistent nomenclature of swine H1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) evolution. These criteria applied to a data set of 7,070 H1 HA sequences led to 28 distinct clades as the basis for the nomenclature. We developed and implemented a web-accessible annotation tool that can assign these biologically informative categories to new sequence data. The annotation tool assigned the combined data set of 7,070 H1 sequences to the correct clade more than 99% of the time. Our analyses indicated that 87% of the swine H1 viruses from 2010 to the present had HAs that belonged to 7 contemporary cocirculating clades. Our nomenclature and web-accessible classification tool provide an accurate method for researchers, diagnosticians, and health officials to assign clade designations to HA sequences. The tool can be updated readily to track evolving nomenclature as new clades emerge, ensuring continued relevance. A common global nomenclature facilitates comparisons of IAVs infecting humans and pigs, within and between regions, and can provide insight into the diversity of swine H1 influenza virus and its impact on vaccine strain selection, diagnostic reagents, and test performance, thereby simplifying communication of such data. IMPORTANCE A fundamental goal in the biological sciences is the definition of groups of organisms based on evolutionary history and the naming of those groups. For influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, understanding the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic lineage of a circulating strain aids in vaccine antigen selection and allows for inferences about vaccine efficacy. Previous reporting of H1 virus HA in swine relied on colloquial names, frequently with incriminating and stigmatizing geographic toponyms, making comparisons between studies challenging. To overcome this, we developed an adaptable nomenclature using measurable criteria for historical and contemporary evolutionary patterns of H1 global swine IAVs. We also developed a web-accessible tool that classifies viruses according to this nomenclature. This classification system will aid agricultural production and pandemic preparedness through the identification of important changes in swine IAVs and provides terminology enabling discussion of swine IAVs in a common context among animal and human health initiatives.","Anderson, Tavis K.; Macken, Catherine A.; Lewis, Nicola S.; Scheuermann, Richard H.; Van Reeth, Kristien; Brown, Ian H.; Swenson, Sabrina L.; Simon, Gaëlle; Saito, Takehiko; Berhane, Yohannes; Ciacci-Zanella, Janice; Pereda, Ariel; Davis, C.

In raw sewage human waste is mixed with household, industrial and drainage water, and virus particles are, therefore, only found in low concentrations. This necessitates a step of sample concentration to allow for sensitive virus detection. Additionally, viruses harbor a large diversity of both surface and genome structures, which makes universal viral genomic extraction difficult. Current studies have tackled these challenges in many different ways employing a wide range of viral concentration and extraction procedures. However, there is limited knowledge of the efficacy and inherent biases associated with these methods in respect to viral sewage metagenomics, hampering the development of this field. By the use of next generation sequencing this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of four commonly applied viral concentrations techniques (precipitation with polyethylene glycol, organic flocculation with skim milk, monolithic adsorption filtration and glass wool filtration) and extraction methods (Nucleospin RNA XS, QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, NucliSENS(®) miniMAG(®), or PowerViral(®) Environmental RNA/DNA Isolation Kit) to determine the viriome in a sewage sample. We found a significant influence of concentration and extraction protocols on the detected viriome.

Highest viral specificity were found in samples concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol or extracted with Nucleospin RNA XS. Detection of viral pathogens depended on the method used.

2584,2584,2584,The Role of Type III Interferons in Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Therapy,11.352383,7.4190764,2017-02-01,"The human interferon (IFN) response is a key innate immune mechanism to fight virus infection. IFNs are host-encoded secreted proteins, which induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral properties. Among the three classes of IFNs, type III IFNs, also called IFN lambdas (IFNLs), are an essential component of the innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV). In particular, human polymorphisms in IFNL gene loci correlate with hepatitis C disease progression and with treatment response. To date, the underlying mechanisms remain mostly elusive; however it seems clear that viral infection of the liver induces IFNL responses. As IFNL receptors show a more restricted tissue expression than receptors for other classes of IFNs, IFNL treatment has reduced side effects compared to the classical type I IFN treatment. In HCV therapy, however, IFNL will likely not play an important role as highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) exist. Here, we will review our current knowledge on IFNL gene expression, protein properties, signaling, ISG induction, and its implications on HCV infection and treatment. Finally, we will discuss the lessons learnt from the HCV and IFNL field for virus infections beyond hepatitis C.","Bruening, Janina; Weigel, Bettina; Gerold, Gisa",J Immunol Res,51,28

Rotavirus is a major etiological agent of childhood diarrhea in developing countries, where malnutrition is prevalent. However, the interactions between the two and their combined effects on immune and intestinal functions are poorly understood. In this study, we used neonatal gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs transplanted with the fecal microbiota of a healthy 2-month-old infant (HIFM) and fed protein-deficient or -sufficient bovine milk diets. Protein deficiency induced hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, stunting, and generalized edema in Gn pigs, as observed in protein-malnourished children. Irrespective of the diet, human rotavirus (HRV) infection early, at HIFM posttransplantation day 3 (PTD3), resulted in adverse health effects and higher mortality rates (45 to 75%) than later HRV infection (PTD10). Protein malnutrition exacerbated HRV infection and affected the morphology and function of the small intestinal epithelial barrier. In pigs infected with HRV at PTD10, there was a uniform decrease in the function and/or frequencies of natural killer cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and CD103(+) and apoptotic mononuclear cells and altered gene expression profiles of intestinal epithelial cells (chromogranin A, mucin 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, SRY-Box 9, and villin). Thus, we have established the first HIFM-transplanted neonatal pig model that recapitulates major aspects of protein malnutrition in children and can be used to evaluate physiologically relevant interventions. Our findings provide an explanation of why nutrient-rich diets alone may lack efficacy in malnourished children.

Infection is initiated by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion between viral and host cell membranes. Paramyxovirus viral fusion proteins (F) insert into the target cell membrane, and form a transient intermediate that pulls the viral and cell membranes together as two heptad-repeat regions refold to form a six-helix bundle structure that can be specifically targeted by fusion-inhibitory peptides. Antiviral potency can be improved by sequence modification and lipid conjugation, and by adding linkers between the protein and lipid components. We exploit the uniquely broad spectrum antiviral activity of a parainfluenza F-derived peptide sequence that inhibits both parainfluenza and Nipah viruses, to investigate the influence of peptide orientation and intervening linker length on the peptides’ interaction with transitional states of F, solubility, membrane insertion kinetics, and protease sensitivity. We assessed the impact of these features on biodistribution and antiviral efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The engineering approach based on biophysical parameters resulted in a peptide that is a highly effective inhibitor of both paramyxoviruses and a set of criteria to be used for engineering broad spectrum antivirals for emerging paramyxoviruses.","Mathieu, Cyrille; Augusto, Marcelo T.; Niewiesk, Stefan; Horvat, Branka; Palermo, Laura M.; Sanna, Giuseppina; Madeddu, Silvia; Huey, Devra; Castanho, Miguel A.

Disclosing this, the present study described an epitope-based peptide vaccine against EBOV, using a combination of B-cell and T-cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approach. Here, protein sequences of all glycoproteins of EBOV were collected and examined via in silico methods to determine the most immunogenic protein. From the identified antigenic protein, the peptide region ranging from 186 to 220 and the sequence HKEGAFFLY from the positions of 154–162 were considered the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, correspondingly. Moreover, this peptide (HKEGAFFLY) interacted with HLA-A*32:15 with the highest binding energy and stability, and also a good conservancy of 83.85% with maximum population coverage.

We aimed to investigate whether HRV infection induces a specific gene expression pattern in airway epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial cell monolayers were infected with HRV species B (HRV-B). RNA was extracted from both supernatants and infected monolayer cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) and transcriptional profile was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip and the results were subsequently validated using quantitative Real-time PCR method. HRV-B infects alveolar epithelial cells which supports implication of the virus with LRTIs. In total 991 genes were found differentially expressed during the course of infection. Of these, 459 genes were up-regulated whereas 532 genes were down-regulated. Differential gene expression at 6 hpi (187 genes up-regulated vs. 156 down-regulated) were significantly represented by gene ontologies related to the chemokines and inflammatory molecules indicating characteristic of viral infection. The 75 up-regulated genes surpassed the down-regulated genes (35) at 12 hpi and their enriched ontologies fell into discrete functional entities such as regulation of apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, and wound healing. At later time points of 24 and 48 hpi, predominated down-regulated genes were enriched for extracellular matrix proteins and airway remodeling events. Our data provides a comprehensive image of host response to HRV infection. The study suggests the underlying molecular regulatory networks genes which might be involved in pathogenicity of the HRV-B and potential targets for further validations and development of effective treatment.","Reza Etemadi, Mohammad; Ling, King-Hwa; Zainal Abidin, Shahidee; Chee, Hui-Yee; Sekawi, Zamberi",PLoS One,51,11

Although free-grazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers.","Meyer, Anne; Dinh, Tung Xuan; Nhu, Thu Van; Pham, Long Thanh; Newman, Scott; Nguyen, Thuy Thi Thanh; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo; Vergne, Timothée",PLoS One,51,1

Recently, evidence has emerged for the opposite strategy. Some viruses have developed the ability to co-opt apoptotic caspase activity to facilitate their own proliferation. In these strategies, viral proteins are cleaved by host caspases to create cleavage products with novel activities which facilitate viral replication. This represents a novel and interesting class of viral–host interactions, and also represents a new group of non-apoptotic roles for caspases. Here we review the evidence for such strategies, and discuss their origins and their implications for our understanding of the relationship between viral pathogenesis and programmed cell death.","Connolly, Patrick F; Fearnhead, Howard O",Cell Death & Differentiation,51,8

Here, we investigated the role of endophilin B2 (B2) in susceptibility to severe influenza infection. WT and B2-deficient mice were infected with H1N1 PR8 by intranasal administration and course of influenza pneumonia, inflammatory, and tissue responses were monitored over time. Disruption of B2 enhanced recovery from severe influenza infection as indicated by swift body weight recovery and significantly better survival of endophilin B2-deficient mice compared to WT mice. Compared to WT mice, the B2-deficient lungs exhibited induction of genes that express surfactant proteins, ABCA3, GM-CSF, podoplanin, and caveolin mRNA after 7 days, temporal induction of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein CEBPα, β, and δ mRNAs 3–14 days after infection, and differences in alveolar extracellular matrix integrity and respiratory mechanics. Flow cytometry and gene expression studies demonstrated robust recovery of alveolar macrophages and recruitment of CD4+ lymphocytes in B2-deficient lungs.

Although much is known about its bone-restricted gene expression pattern and protein biochemical and topological features, little information is available for BRIL physiological function. Two autosomal dominant forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are caused by distinct, but recurrent mutations in the BRIL gene. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which those mutations lead to OI are still poorly understood. A previous report indicated that BRIL knockout (KO) mice had bone deformities, shortened long bones, and reproductive problems. Here we generated and systematically analyzed the skeletal phenotype of a new global Bril KO/LacZ knockin mouse model. KO mice reproduced and thrived normally up to 12 month of age. The skeletal phenotype of KO and WT littermates was assessed at embryonic (E13.5 to E18.5) and postnatal (2 days, 3 weeks, 3 months and 8 months) time-points. Embryos from E13.5 through to E18.5 showed significant X-Gal staining in all skeletal elements without any apparent patterning anomalies. Although bone deformities were never observed at any postnatal ages, minor and transient differences were noted in terms of bone length and static uCT parameters, but not systematically across all ages and genders. These changes, however, were not accompanied by significant alteration in bone material properties as assessed by a 3-point bending test. In addition, no changes were detected in circulating serum markers of bone turnover (P1NP, CTX-I, and osteocalcin). Gene expression monitoring also revealed no major impact of the loss of BRIL. Further, when mice were challenged with a surgically-induced fracture in tibia, bones repaired equally well in the KO mice as compared to WT. Finally, we showed that BRIL C-terminus is not a bona fide binding site for calcium. In conclusion, our in depth analysis suggest that skeletal patterning, bone mass accrual and remodeling in mice proceeded independent of BRIL.","Patoine, Alexa; Husseini, Abdallah; Kasaai, Bahar; Gaumond, Marie-Hélène; Moffatt, Pierre",PLoS One,51,8

Methods: In this work, we developed the Multiplexed Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (M-NAPPA), which significantly increases the number of displayed proteins by multiplexing as many as five different gene plasmids within a printed spot. Results: Even when proteins of different sizes were displayed within the same feature, they were readily detected using protein-specific antibodies. Protein-protein interactions and serological antibody assays using human viral proteome microarrays demonstrated that comparable hits were detected by M-NAPPA and non-multiplexed NAPPA arrays. An ultra-high density proteome microarray displaying > 16k proteins on a single microscope slide was produced by combining M-NAPPA with a photolithography-based silicon nano-well platform. Finally, four new tuberculosis-related antigens in guinea pigs vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were identified with M-NAPPA and validated with ELISA.

Using an unbiased search, we analyzed the epigenetic changes at DNA methylation and post-translational histone modification levels induced by the infection. DNA methylation was unaltered, while we found a general decrease on histone acetylation, which correlates with transcriptional inactivation and may cooperate with the impairment of cellular transcription that causes influenza virus infection. A particular increase in H3K79 methylation was observed and the use of an inhibitor of the specific H3K79 methylase, Dot1L enzyme, or its silencing, increased influenza virus replication. The antiviral response was reduced in conditions of Dot1L downregulation, since decreased nuclear translocation of NF-kB complex, and IFN-β, Mx1 and ISG56 expression was detected. The data suggested a control of antiviral signaling by methylation of H3K79 and consequently, influenza virus replication was unaffected in IFN pathway-compromised, Dot1L-inhibited cells. H3K79 methylation also controlled replication of another potent interferon-inducing virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus, but did not modify amplification of respiratory syncytial virus that poorly induces interferon signaling. Epigenetic methylation of H3K79 might have an important role in controlling interferon-induced signaling against viral pathogens.","Marcos-Villar, Laura; Díaz-Colunga, Juan; Sandoval, Juan; Zamarreño, Noelia; Landeras-Bueno, Sara; Esteller, Manel; Falcón, Ana; Nieto, Amelia",Sci Rep,51,28

To date the mechanism for how MxA exerts its antiviral activity is unclear, however, additional cellular factors are believed to be essential for this activity. To identify MxA cofactors we performed a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human airway epithelial cells (A549) constitutively expressing MxA using an H5N1 reporter virus. These data were complemented with a proteomic screen to identify MxA-interacting proteins. The combined data identified SMARCA2, the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as a crucial factor required for the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that although SMARCA2 is essential for expression of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the establishment of an antiviral state, it is not required for expression of MxA, suggesting an indirect effect on MxA activity. Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a small set of SMARCA2-regulated factors required for activity of MxA, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is the pathogen that causes Zika viral disease, and it is a mosquito-borne virus. However, its pathogenesis, especially the interaction between ZIKV and target cells during the early stages of infection, is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that infecting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with ZIKV triggers cellular autophagy. We observed both an increase in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and increased accumulation of fluorescent cells with LC3 dots, which are considered to be the two key indicators of autophagy. The ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH in each group was significantly increased at different times after ZIKV infection at different MOIs, indicating that the production of lipidated LC3-II increased. Moreover, both the ratio of LC3-II/GAPDH and the expression of viral NS3 protein increased with increasing time of viral infection. The expression level of p62 decreased gradually from 12 h post-infection. Expression profile of double fluorescent protein labelling LC3 indicated that the autophagy induced by ZIKV infection was a complete process. We further investigated the role of autophagy in ZIKV replication. We demonstrated that either the treatment with inhibitors of autophagosomes formation or short hairpin RNA targeting the Beclin-1 gene, which is critical for the formation of autophagosomes, significantly reduced viral production. Taken together, our results indicate that ZIKV infection induces autophagy of HUVEC, and inhibition of ZIKV-induced autophagy restrains viral replication.","Peng, Haoran; Liu, Bin; Yves, Toure Doueu; He, Yanhua; Wang, Shijie; Tang, Hailin; Ren, Hao; Zhao, Ping; Qi, Zhongtian; Qin, Zhaoling",Viruses,51,11

We describe the functional significance of the PGRS domain of Rv0297, a member of this family. In silico analyses revealed the presence of intrinsically disordered stretches and putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signals in the PGRS domain of Rv0297 (Rv0297PGRS). The PGRS domain aids in ER localization, which was shown by infecting macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis and by overexpressing the protein by transfection in macrophage cells followed by activation of the unfolded protein response, as evident from increased expression of GRP78/GRP94 and CHOP/ATF4, leading to disruption of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The consequent activation of the effector caspase-8 resulted in apoptosis of macrophages, which was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Administration of recombinant Rv0297PGRS (rRv0297PGRS) also exhibited similar effects. These results implicate a hitherto-unknown role of the PGRS domain of the PE_PGRS protein family in ER stress-mediated cell death through TLR4.

However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.","Caron, Alexandre; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Cappelle, Julien; Liégeois, Florian; De Nys, Hélène M.; Roger, François",Viruses,51,28
3501,3501,3501,Inhibitory Effect and Possible Mechanism of Action of Patchouli Alcohol against Influenza A (H2N2) Virus,11.540415,7.2107997,2011-08-03,"In the present study, the anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus activity of patchouli alcohol was studied in vitro, in vivo and in silico. The CC(50) of patchouli alcohol was above 20 µM. Patchouli alcohol could inhibit influenza virus with an IC(50) of 4.03 ± 0.23 µM. MTT assay showed that the inhibition by patchouli alcohol appears strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. In the influenza mouse model, patchouli alcohol showed obvious protection against the viral infection at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Flexible docking and molecular dynamic simulations indicated that patchouli alcohol was bound to the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus, with an interaction energy of –40.38 kcal mol(–1). The invariant key active-site residues Asp151, Arg152, Glu119, Glu276 and Tyr406 played important roles during the binding process. Based on spatial and energetic criteria, patchouli alcohol interfered with the NA functions. Results presented here suggest that patchouli alcohol possesses anti-influenza A (H2N2) virus properties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-influenza agents for the pharmaceutical industry.","Wu, Huaxing; Li, Beili; Wang, Xue; Jin, Mingyuan; Wang, Guonian",Molecules,51,28

In comparison with its economic importance, available genomic information of the olive flounder is very limited. The mass mortality caused by variety of pathogens (virus, bacteria and parasites) is main problem in aquaculture industry, including in olive flounder culture. In this study, we carried out transcriptome analysis using the olive flounder gill tissues after infection of three types of pathogens (Virus; Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, Bacteria; Streptococcus parauberis, and Parasite; Miamiensis avidus), respectively. As a result, we identified total 12,415 differentially expressed genes (DEG) from viral infection, 1,754 from bacterial infection, and 795 from parasite infection, respectively. To investigate the effects of pathogenic infection on immune response, we analyzed Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis with DEGs and sorted immune-related GO terms per three pathogen groups. Especially, we verified various GO terms, and genes in these terms showed down-regulated expression pattern. In addition, we identified 67 common genes (10 up-regulated and 57 down-regulated) present in three pathogen infection groups. Our goals are to provide plenty of genomic knowledge about olive flounder transcripts for further research and report genes, which were changed in their expression after specific pathogen infection.","Nam, Gyu-Hwi; Mishra, Anshuman; Gim, Jeong-An; Lee, Hee-Eun; Jo, Ara; Yoon, Dahye; Kim, Ahran; Kim, Woo-Jin; Ahn, Kung; Kim, Do-Hyung; Kim, Suhkmann; Cha, Hee-Jae; Choi, Yung Hyun; Park, Chan-Il; Kim, Heui-Soo",Sci Rep,51,28

It came as no surprise when viruses were also revealed to transcribe their own lncRNAs. Among them, gammaherpesviruses, one of the three subfamilies of the Herpesviridae, code their largest number. These structurally and functionally intricate non-coding (nc) transcripts modulate cellular and viral gene expression to maintain viral latency or prompt lytic reactivation. These lncRNAs allow for the virus to escape cytosolic surveillance, sequester, and re-localize essential cellular factors and modulate the cell cycle and proliferation. Some viral lncRNAs act as “messenger molecules”, transferring information about viral infection to neighboring cells. This broad range of lncRNA functions is achieved through lncRNA structure-mediated interactions with effector molecules of viral and host origin, including other RNAs, proteins and DNAs. In this review, we discuss examples of gammaherpesvirus-encoded lncRNAs, emphasize their unique structural attributes, and link them to viral life cycle, pathogenesis, and disease progression. We will address their potential as novel targets for drug discovery and propose future directions to explore lncRNA structure and function relationship.","Chavez-Calvillo, Gabriela; Martin, Sarah; Hamm, Chad; Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna",Noncoding RNA,51,1

Here, we have analyzed the role of the soluble PRR Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a key component of the humoral arm of innate immunity. Mice that had been intranasally infected with S. flexneri were rescued from death by treatment with recombinant PTX3. In vitro PTX3 exerts the antibacterial activity against Shigella, impairing epithelial cell invasion and contributing to the bactericidal activity of serum. PTX3 is produced upon LPS-TLR4 stimulation in accordance with the lipid A structure of Shigella. In the plasma of infected patients, the level of PTX3 amount only correlates strongly with symptom severity. These results signal PTX3 as a novel player in Shigella pathogenesis and its potential role in fighting shigellosis. Finally, we suggest that the plasma level of PTX3 in shigellosis patients could act as a biomarker for infection severity.","Ciancarella, Valeria; Lembo-Fazio, Luigi; Paciello, Ida; Bruno, Anna-Karin; Jaillon, Sébastien; Berardi, Sara; Barbagallo, Marialuisa; Meron-Sudai, Shiri; Cohen, Dani; Molinaro, Antonio; Rossi, Giacomo; Garlanda, Cecilia; Bernardini, Maria Lina",PLoS Pathog,51,1

Hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target in the therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection of the influenza virus. Influenza A virus encompasses several different HA subtypes with different strains, which are constantly changing. In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172–177 and 206–213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer. This study provides important information on the strain specificity of 32D6 for the therapeutic treatment and detection of viral infection.","Lee, Cheng-Chung; Yang, Chih-Ya; Lin, Li-Ling; Ko, Tzu-Ping; Chang, Alarng Hsun-Lang; Chang, Stanley Shi-Chung; Wang, Andrew H.-J.",Sci Rep,51,28

We demonstrate intratracheal delivery of fully modified siRNA for RNAi-mediated target knockdown in lung CD11c(+) cells (dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages) and alveolar epithelial cells.

To identify therapeutic agents for SMA, we established a versatile SMN2-GFP reporter line by targeting the human SMN2 gene. We then screened a compound library and identified Z-FA-FMK as a potent candidate. Z-FA-FMK, a cysteine protease inhibitor, increased functional SMN through inhibiting the protease-mediated degradation of both full-length and exon 7–deleted forms of SMN. Further studies reveal that CAPN1, CAPN7, CTSB, and CTSL mediate the degradation of SMN proteins, providing novel targets for SMA. Notably, Z-FA-FMK mitigated mitochondriopathy and neuropathy in SMA patient–derived motor neurons and showed protective effects in SMA animal model after intracerebroventricular injection. E64d, another cysteine protease inhibitor which can pass through the blood–brain barrier, showed even more potent therapeutic effects after subcutaneous delivery to SMA mice. Taken together, we have successfully established a human SMN2 reporter for future drug discovery and identified the potential therapeutic value of cysteine protease inhibitors in treating SMA via stabilizing SMN proteins.","Wang, Yiran; Xu, Chongchong; Ma, Lin; Mou, Yongchao; Zhang, Bowen; Zhou, Shanshan; Tian, Yue; Trinh, Jessica; Zhang, Xiaoqing; Li, Xue-Jun",Life Sci Alliance,51,11

Targeting S1PR1, which is known to modulate the immune response, provides protection against pathogenic influenza virus. The functional role and molecular mechanism of S1PR1 were analysed by generating inducible endothelial cell-specific S1PR1 knockout mice and assessing the therapeutic efficacy of the selective S1PR1 agonist CYM5442 against acute lung injury (ALI) induced by the 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus. Immune-mediated pulmonary injury is aggravated by the absence of endothelial S1PR1 and alleviated by treatment with CYM-5442, suggesting a protective function of S1PR1 signaling during H1N1 infection. S1PR1 signaling does not affect viral clearance in mice infected with influenza. Mechanistically, the MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways are involved in the ALI mediated by S1PR1 in infected mice. Combined administration of the S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 and the antiviral drug oseltamivir provides maximum protection from ALI. Our current study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of S1PR1 mediating the ALI induced by H1N1 infection and indicates that the combination of S1PR1 agonist with antiviral drug could potentially be used as a therapeutic remedy for future H1N1 virus pandemics.","Zhao, Jiangnan; Zhu, Meiying; Jiang, Hao; Shen, Simen; Su, Xin; Shi, Yi",Sci Rep,51,28

However, the mechanisms that govern the AVS are poorly defined. Using a BEAS-2B respiratory epithelial cell line deficient in IRF1, we demonstrate higher susceptibility to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza virus. IRF1-mediated restriction of VSV is IFN-independent, as blockade of types I and III IFNs and JAK-STAT signaling before infection did not affect VSV infection of either parent or IRF1 KO cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that IRF1 regulates constitutive expression of ~300 genes, including antiviral ISGs: OAS2, BST2, and RNASEL and knockdown of any of these IRF1-dependent genes increased VSV infection. Additionally, IRF1 enhances rapid expression of IFNβ and IFNλ after stimulation with poly I:C and also regulates ISG expression. Mechanistically, IRF1 enhances recruitment of BRD4 to promotor-enhancer regions of ISGs for rapid expression and maintains levels of histone H3K4me1 for optimal constitutive expression. Finally, IRF1 also regulates constitutive expression of TLR2 and TLR3 and promotes signaling through these pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These data reveal multiple roles for IRF1 toward effective anti-viral responses by maintaining IFN-independent constitutive expression of anti-viral ISGs and supporting early IFN-dependent responses to PRR stimulation.","Panda, Debasis; Gjinaj, Erisa; Bachu, Mahesh; Squire, Erica; Novatt, Hilary; Ozato, Keiko; Rabin, Ronald L.",Front Immunol,51,1
3883,3883,3883,Junín virus induces autophagy in human A549 cells,11.512801,7.2375197,2019-06-19,"Autophagy, a highly regulated degradative process that promotes cellular homeostasis, is increasingly recognised as a fundamental component of the cellular response against viral infection. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy during Junín virus (JUNV) multiplication using human A549 cells. We found that JUNV infection induces an increment of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, an accumulation of punctate pattern in RFP-LC3-transfected cells and the colocalisation of viral nucleoprotein and LC3 protein, suggesting autophagosome formation. JUNV infection also induced the degradation of the autophagy receptor p62, suggesting that complete autophagic flux was triggered. In addition, we showed that inhibition of autophagy with bafilomycin A1 or 3-methyladenine significantly reduces viral multiplication. Moreover, viral yield was increased when autophagy was induced using rapamycin. Furthermore, JUNV infection induced the colocalisation of p62, ATG16, RAB5, RAB7A and LAMP1 with the autophagosomal LC3 protein. That suggests that phagosomes undergo the maturation process during viral infection. Finally, we demonstrated that siRNA experiments targeting essential autophagy genes (ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin 1) reduce viral protein synthesis and viral yield. Overall, our results indicate that JUNV activates host autophagy machinery enhancing its multiplication.","Perez Vidakovics, Maria Laura A.; Ure, Agustín E.; Arrías, Paula N.; Romanowski, Víctor; Gómez, Ricardo M.",PLoS One,51,11

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies with keratinocyte extracts indicated α-catenin as the putative antigen, then confirmed by immunoblotting on the recombinant protein. Four of ten PV sera reacted with recombinant α-catenin. Although the isolated human monoclonal antibody was per se unable to dissociate keratinocyte monolayers and also to synergize with a pathogenic antibody in vitro, further studies are warranted to assess its possible in vivo contribution in the multifactorial pathogenesis and heterogeneous manifestations of PV disease.","Di Lullo, Giulia; Calabresi, Valentina; Mariotti, Feliciana; Zambruno, Giovanna; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Di Zenzo, Giovanni",Front Immunol,51,1

The SASP is important in influencing the behavior of neighboring cells and altering the microenvironment; yet, this role has been mainly attributed to soluble factors. Here, we show that both the soluble factors and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are capable of transmitting paracrine senescence to nearby cells. Analysis of individual cells internalizing sEVs, using a Cre-reporter system, show a positive correlation between sEV uptake and senescence activation. We find an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies during senescence in vivo. sEV protein characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a functional siRNA screen identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as being partially responsible for transmitting senescence to normal cells.

Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is one of the major viral pathogens of human myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Because of its small genome, CVB depends on cellular machineries for productive replication. However, how the structural and non-structural components of CVB would manipulate cell cycle is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB type 3 (CVB3) induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. G1 arrest was the result of the decrease level of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27(Kip1). Study on the gene expression profile of the cells expressing VP1 showed that the expression of both heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) and Hsp70-2 was significantly up-regulated. Knockdown of Hsp70 resulted in the increased level of cyclin E and the reduction of p27(Kip1). We further demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the heat shock factor 1, which directly promotes the expression of Hsp70, was also increased in the cell expressing VP1. Moreover, we show that CVB3 infection also induced G1 arrest, likely due to dysregulating Hsp70, cyclin E, and p27, while knockdown of Hsp70 dramatically inhibited viral replication. Cell cycle arrest at G1 phase facilitated CVB3 infection, since viral replication in the cells synchronized at G1 phase dramatically increased. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the VP1 of CVB3 induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase through up-regulating Hsp70. Our findings suggest that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB is capable of manipulating cellular activities during viral infection.","Wang, Yao; Zhao, Shuoxuan; Chen, Yang; Wang, Tianying; Dong, Chaorun; Wo, Xiaoman; Zhang, Jian; Dong, Yanyan; Xu, Weizhen; Feng, Xiaofeng; Qu, Cong; Wang, Yan; Zhong, Zhaohua; Zhao, Wenran",Front Microbiol,51,8

The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 µM morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times).

Inhibitor of ERK pathway SCH772984 further promoted the influence of MEG3 silence on morphine-caused Beclin-1 (1.97 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (1.92 times) expressions decreases. Conclusions: Up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be through elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation.

In the current work, the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria from different genera on the structural and functional characteristics of cells and the development of adenoviral infection in vitro was studied. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxicity of six EPSs of lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus was determined by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. The influence of the EPSs on the infectivity of human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) and on the cell cycle under a condition of adenovirus infection was studied using plaque reduction assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Results: It was shown that exopolysaccharides were non-toxic to Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (MDBK) as they reduced their viability by 3–17%. A change in the distribution of the cell cycle phases in the non-infected cell population treated with EPSs was observed. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of cells in the S phase by 47% when using EPSs 15a and a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase by 20–27% when treated with the EPSs 15a, 33a, and 19s. The use of EPSs did not led to the normalization of the life cycle of HAdV-5 infected cells to the level of non-infected cells. The EPSs showed low virucidal activity and reduced the HAdV-5 infectivity to 85%. Among the studied exopolysaccharides, anti-adenovirus activity was found for EPS 26a that is produced by Lactobacillus spp. strain. The treatment of cells with the EPS following virus adsorption completely (100%) suppressed the formation and release of HAdV-5 infectious. Conclusions: EPS 26a possessed distinct anti-HAdV-5 activity and the obtained data demonstrate the potential of using exopolysaccharides as anti-adenoviral agents.","Biliavska, Liubov; Pankivska, Yulia; Povnitsa, Olga; Zagorodnya, Svitlana",Medicina (Kaunas),51,11

In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals.

Currently available drugs and vaccines only partially reduce deaths and hospitalizations. Some of the reasons for this disturbing situation stem from the sophistication of the viral machinery, but another reason is the lack of a complete understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of viral infections and host–pathogen interactions. Even the functions of the influenza proteins, their mechanisms of action and interaction with host proteins have not been fully revealed. These questions have traditionally been studied in mammalian animal models, mainly ferrets and mice (as well as pigs and non-human primates) and in cell lines. Although obviously relevant as models to humans, these experimental systems are very complex and are not conveniently accessible to various genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches. The fact that influenza remains an unsolved problem, in combination with the limitations of the conventional experimental models, motivated increasing attempts to use the power of other models, such as low eukaryotes, including invertebrate, and primary cell cultures. In this review, we summarized the efforts to study influenza in yeast, Drosophila, zebrafish and primary human tissue cultures and the major contributions these studies have made toward a better understanding of the disease.

However, these systemic infections are presumed to be a “dead-end” for P. aeruginosa and to have no impact on transmission. Here, we use a mouse infection model to show that P. aeruginosa can spread from the bloodstream to the gallbladder, where it replicates to extremely high numbers. Bacteria in the gallbladder can then seed the intestines and feces, leading to transmission to uninfected cage-mate mice. Our work shows that the gallbladder is crucial for spread of P. aeruginosa from the bloodstream to the feces during bacteremia, a process that promotes transmission in this experimental system. Further research is needed to test to what extent these findings are relevant to infections in patients.","Bachta, Kelly E.

4412,4412,4412,Potential Genes Related to Levofloxacin Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Based on Transcriptome and Methylome Overlap Analysis,11.366961,7.352151,2020-01-09,"Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) has become an increasingly serious public health problem and has complicated tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Levofloxacin (LOF) is an ideal anti-tuberculosis drug in clinical applications. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis in TB treatment have not been revealed. Our study performed transcriptome and methylome sequencing to investigate the potential biological characteristics of LOF resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the transcriptome analysis, 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; 514 and 439 DEGs were significantly downregulated and upregulated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 97 pathways were enriched in this study. In the methylome analysis, 239 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified; 150 and 89 DMGs were hypomethylated and hypermethylated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 74 pathways were enriched in this study. The overlap study suggested that 25 genes were obtained. It was notable that nine genes expressed downregulated mRNA and upregulated methylated levels, including pgi, fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF, especially cyp132, pckA, and pfkB, which were vital in LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The overlapping genes between transcriptome and methylome could be essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. These results may provide informative evidence for TB treatment with LOF.

In 2017–18, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018–19. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (τ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated Rs for 2017–18 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016–17 (1.23 with 95% CI: (1.22, 1.24)) and 2018–19 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%)) rise in R. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We report clear evidence of rainfall impacts on LF epidemics in Nigeria and quantify the impact.","Zhao, Shi; Musa, Salihu S.; Fu, Hao; He, Daihai; Qin, Jing",,51,8

Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a promising candidate due to its oncolytic features reported in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells). Interestingly, the underlying mechanism might include a dysregulation of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-infection on oxidative stress mediated changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and its angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82 cells in vitro. Microarray data analysis, immunofluorescence for 8-hydroxyguanosine, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and flow cytometry for oxidative burst displayed an increased oxidative stress in persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells (DH82Ond pi) compared to controls. The HIF-1α expression in DH82Ond pi increased, as demonstrated by Western blot, and showed an unexpected, often sub-membranous distribution, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, microarray data analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed a reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi compared to controls. In summary, these results suggest a reduced activation of the HIF-1α angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82Ond pi cells in vitro, most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1α triggered by a CDV-induced increased oxidative stress.","Armando, Federico; Gambini, Matteo; Corradi, Attilio; Giudice, Chiara; Pfankuche, Vanessa Maria; Brogden, Graham; Attig, Friederike; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Puff, Christina",Viruses,51,28

In particular, recent works have highlighted the acquisition of a Th1-like phenotype by Tregs in several pathological environments.

5040,5040,5040,MouseV(k) gene classification by nucleic acid sequence similarity,11.45473,7.60802,1989,"LDV contradicts all commonly held views about mechanisms of virus persistence, namely that persistence is primarily associated with noncytopathic viruses, or the selection of immune escape variants or other mutants, or a decrease in expression of certain viral proteins by infected cells, or replication in “immune-privileged sites”, or a general suppression of the host immune system, etc. [1, 2, 5, 54, 77, 78]. LDV is a highly cytocidal virus that invariably establishes a life-long, viremic, persistence in mice, in spite of normal anti-viral immune responses. One secret of LDV's success in persistence is its specificity for a renewable, nonessential population of cells that is continuously regenerated, namely a subpopulation of macrophages. Since the continuous destruction of these cells is not associated with any obvious health effects, this macrophage population seems nonessential to the well-being of its host. The only function identified for this subpopulation of macrophages is clearance of the muscle type of LDH and some other enzymes [59, 67, 68]. Furthermore, the effects of LDV infection on the host immune system, namely the polyclonal activation of B cells and its associated production of autoantibodies, and the slight impairment of primary and secondary antibody responses also do not seem to be severe enough to cause any clinical consequences. But how does LDV replication in macrophages escape all host defenses? Persistence is not dependent on the seletion of immune escape variants or other mutants ([58] and Palmer, Even and Plagemann, unpublished results). Also, LDV replication is not restricted to immune-privileged sites [5]. LDV replication persists in the liver, lymphoidal tissues and testis [66]. Only the latter could be considered a site not readily accessible to immune surveillance. Most likely, resistance of LDV replication to antiviral immune responses is related to the unique structure of its envelope proteins and the production of large quantities of viral antigens. High titers of anti-LDV antibodies are generated in infected mice but they neutralize LDV infectivity only very inefficiently and, even though the antiviral antibodies are mainly of the IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes, they do not mediate complement lyses of virions [31]. Interaction of the antibodies and complement with the VP-3/VP-2 heterodimers in the viral envelope may be impeded by the exposure of only very short peptide segments of these proteins at the envelope surface and the presence of large oligosaccharide side chains. Furthermore, since LDV maturation is restricted to intracytoplasmic cisternae [59, 71], the question arises of whether any of the viral proteins are available on the surface of infected cells for ADCC. CTLs also fail to control LDV replication. Altough CTLs specific for N/VP-1 are rapidly generated, these have disappeared by 30 days p.i. [26]. The reasons for this loss are unknown, but high-dose clonal exhaustion [41, 51, 77, 78] is a reasonable possibility since, regardless of the infectious dose, large amounts of LDV proteins are present in all the lymphoidal tissues at the time of the induction of the CTL response. Furthermore, after exhaustion of CTLs in the periphery, continuous replication of LDV in the thymus [65] assures that the mice become permanently immunologically tolerant with respect to LDV antigen-specific CTLs as a result of negative selection in the thymus. LDV might be a primary example for the effectiveness of a permanent clonal CTL deletion in adult animals under natural conditions of infection. The presumed modes of transmission of LDV in nature and the events associated with its infection of mice are strikingly similar to those observed during the acute and asymptomatic phases of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [24, 29, 74, 78]. These include: (1) primary inefficient transmission via sexual and transplacental routes but effective transmission via blood; (2) primary replication in renewable populations of lymphoidal cells with production of large amounts of virus after the initial infection of the host followed by persistent low level of viremia in spite of antiviral immune responses; (3) persistence, reflecting continuous rounds of productive, cytocidal infection of permissive cells [59, 74] and the rate of generation of permissive cells which may be the main factor in determining the level of virus production (in the case of HIV, the rate of activation of CD4(+) T cells to support a productive HIV replication might be the factor determining the rate of virus production and the progression of the disease); (4) rapid antibody formation but delayed production of neutralizing antibodies with limited neutralizing capacity; (5) rapid but transient generation of virus-specific CTLs; and (6) accumulation of large amounts of virus in newly formed germinal centers in the spleen and lymph nodes concomitant with an initiation of a permanent polyclonal activation of B cells resulting in an elevation of plasma IgG2a. The events described under points 2–6 might be generally associated with natural viremic persistent virus infections. Such persistent viruses, by necessity, have evolved properties that allow them to escape all host defenses and control of their infection by immunological processes is, therefore, difficult, if not impossible. Prevention of infection and chemotherapy may be the only approaches available to combat such virus infections.","Plagemann, Peter G. W.; Rowland, Raymond R.

Although there have been extensive studies of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, animal models and the immunobiology of infection, there is not yet a convincing and safe vaccine available. The major histopathologic characteristics of RSV infection are acute bronchiolitis, mucosal and submucosal edema, and luminal occlusion by cellular debris of sloughed epithelial cells mixed with macrophages, strands of fibrin, and some mucin. There is a single RSV serotype with two major antigenic subgroups, A and B. Strains of both subtypes often co-circulate, but usually one subtype predominates. In temperate climates, RSV infections reflect a distinct seasonality with onset in late fall or early winter. It is believed that most children will experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. There are several key animal models of RSV. These include a model in mice and, more importantly, a bovine model; the latter reflects distinct similarity to the human disease. Importantly, the prevalence of asthma is significantly higher amongst children who are hospitalized with RSV in infancy or early childhood. However, there have been only limited investigations of candidate genes that have the potential to explain this increase in susceptibility. An atopic predisposition appears to predispose to subsequent development of asthma and it is likely that subsequent development of asthma is secondary to the pathogenic inflammatory response involving cytokines, chemokines and their cognate receptors. Numerous approaches to the development of RSV vaccines are being evaluated, as are the use of newer antiviral agents to mitigate disease. There is also significant attention being placed on the potential impact of co-infection and defining the natural history of RSV. Clearly, more research is required to define the relationships between RSV bronchiolitis, other viral induced inflammatory responses, and asthma.","Borchers, Andrea T.; Chang, Christopher; Gershwin, M.

Similarly, analysis on 63 antigenic peptides through NetMHC, NetCTL and IEDB MHC-I binding peptide prediction tool led to identification of 14 CTL epitopes. Seven T-cell epitopes, C:44-66, M:135-149, NS2A:124-144, NS3:421-453, NS3:540-554, NS4B:90-134 and NS4B:171-188, are observed to share overlapping MHC-I and MHC-II binding motifs and hence, are being proposed to constitute minimum T-cell antigens to elicit protective T-cell immune response against Zika. Three of them, C:44-66, NS3:421-453 and NS3:540-554 are identified to be conserved across all the selected strains of Zika virus.

METHODS: The experiments were conducted in a hospital isolation room with a pressure of − 5 Pa. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. The jet nebulizer was driven by air at a constant flow rate of 6 L/min, with the mask reservoir filled with sterile water and attached to the HPS via a nebulizer mask. The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. FINDINGS: The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mL/min; lung compliance, 70 mL/cm H(2)O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H(2)O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mL/min; lung compliance, 10 mL/cm H(2)O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury.

Early and appropriate treatment with antimicrobials positively affects mortality and significantly reduces the time spent in both intensive care and the hospital.

Bactericidal drugs should be given in combination, delivered by intravenous bolus and directed towards broad cover of all likely pathogens.

It is accepted that in an ecological system, pressure will cause evolution; this is also the case with antimicrobials, the result being the development of resistance and the therapeutic failure of drugs. To an extent, this can be ameliorated through advances by the pharmaceutical industry, but that should not stop us from critically appraising our use and modifying our behavior to slow this process down. Up to 50% of prescribing in human medicine and 80% in veterinary medicine and farming has been considered questionable. The Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials (APUA) was approached by the WHO to review the situation. Their recommendations include decreasing the prescribing of antibacterials for nonbacterial infections. In the UK, there has been an initiative called ‘the path of least resistance’. This encourages general practitioners to avoid prescribing or reduce the duration of prescriptions for conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated urinary tract infections; this approach has been successful. Another recommendation is to reduce the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials. In UK hospitals, the problems identified with the inappropriate use of antibacterials are insufficient training in infectious disease, difficulty in selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, poor use of available microbiological information, the fear of litigation and the fact that the majority of antibacterials are prescribed by the least experienced doctors. With close liaison between the laboratories and clinicians, and the development of local protocols, this can be addressed. Another recommendation is to tighten the use of antibacterial prophylaxis and to improve patient compliance. Through a combination of improved education for doctors and patients, and improved communication skills, these problems can be addressed. A further recommendation is to encourage teaching methods that modify prescribing habits. It has been shown that workshops have led to a significant reduction in the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibacterials in the community. Auditing the prescribing of antibacterials has also been recommended. Surveillance systems around the world monitor trends in resistance: the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Progamme (EARSS) monitors antibacterial resistance; the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease collaborate to monitor tuberculosis; the WHO and the International AIDS Society monitor HIV. In the third world, a bigger problem than resistance is whether drugs are even effective, as they are often spoiled by climactic conditions, and poor quality generics and counterfeit drugs are common. Also, patients may not be able to complete a course for financial reasons. Facts about Antimicrobial resistance in Animals (and agriculture) and Impact on Resistance (FAAIR) was commissioned by APUA. They conclude that the nonhuman use of antibacterials can lead to the development of antibacterial resistance in human pathogens. The European commission banned the use of antibacterials as growth promoters in 1999. In the Western world, we should improve our diagnosis of sepsis, access local guidelines and consider withholding treatment pending investigations, decide if treatment can be stopped earlier and treat the patient not the result. Many developing countries need improved access to more antimicrobials, preferably in the controlled environment of appropriate medical advice.","Sarkar, Paul; Gould, Ian M.",Drugs,51,11

An otogenic variant of Lemierre’s syndrome was seen in 5 children with dissemination to nearby regions, and other variants of Lemierre’s syndrome, e.g. from the sinuses and teeth, were seen in 16 adults. Patients often had metastatic infections already on admission and needed prolonged hospitalisation. The overall mortality of Lemierre’s syndrome was 9%. Forty-two elderly patients had disseminated F. necrophorum infections originating from foci in lower parts of the body. They frequently had predisposing diseases, e.g. abdominal or urogenital cancers, which contributed to the high mortality of 26%. This study shows that the incidence of Lemierre’s syndrome is higher than that previously found and has a characteristic age distribution. Early suspicion of the diagnosis, several weeks of antibiotic therapy, often combined with surgical drainage, is mandatory to lower the mortality. In disseminated non-head-and-neck-associated F. necrophorum infections, underlying cancers must be considered.","Hagelskjær Kristensen, L.; Prag, J.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,51,8

They can be divided into agents with relatively broad, non-targeted specificity and targeted drugs developed on the basis of a more refined understanding of individual cancers and directed at specific molecular targets on different cancer cells. Individual drugs in both groups have been classified on the basis of their mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. The targeted drugs include proteasome inhibitors, toxic chimeric proteins and signal transduction inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase (non-receptor and receptor), serine/threonine kinase, histone deacetylase and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Increasingly used targeted vascular (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade can provoke a range of pathological consequences. Many of the non-targeted drugs are cytotoxic, suppressing haematopoiesis as well as provoking cutaneous eruptions and vascular, lung and liver injury. Cytotoxic side effects of the targeted drugs occur less often and usually with less severity, but they show their own unusual adverse effects including, for example, a lengthened QT interval, a characteristic papulopustular rash, nail disorders and a hand–foot skin reaction variant. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines but not always with the same definition in mind, and the terminology needs to be standardised. This is particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy where anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as many dermatological manifestations sometimes have an immune basis. The most insidious of all adverse consequences of targeted therapies, however, are tumour adaptation, increased malignancy and the invasive metastatic switch seen with anti-angiogenic drugs that inhibit the VEGF-A pathway. Adverse reactions to 44 non-targeted and 33 targeted, frequently used, chemotherapeutic drugs are presented together with discussions of diagnosis, premedications, desensitizations and importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the various drug-induced reactions. There is need for wide-ranging acceptance of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction and for allergists to be more involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of chemotherapeutic drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.","Baldo, Brian A.; Pham, Nghia H.",Cancer Metastasis Rev,51,28

However, upon cultivation in vitro, astrocytes begin to express class I molecules, increasing with time after plating. This spontaneous expression was examined in the present study to characterize inducible expression on astrocytes among various strains of mice. Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard γ-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2(a) and H-2(d) class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2(b) and H-2(s) products. This difference in expression is not seen on spleen cells indicating tissue specificity. Moreover, levels of expression at the cell surface are reflected by the steady-state level of RNA message within astrocytes of the different strains.","Massa, Paul T.; Cowan, Elliot P.; Levi, Ben-Zion; Ozato, Keiko; McFarlin, Dale E.",J Neuroimmunol,51,1

Especially, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are ubiquitously detected in surface water and soil, mainly in the aquatic compartment, where they do affect the living systems. Unfortunately, there is a huge gap in the availability of ecotoxicological data on pharmaceuticals’ environmental behavior and ecotoxicity which force EMEA (European Medicines Agency) to release guidelines for their risk assessment. In silico modeling approaches are vital tools to exploit the existing information to rapidly emphasize the potentially most hazardous and toxic pharmaceuticals and prioritize the most environmentally hazardous ones for focusing further on their experimental studies. The quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models are capable of predicting missing properties for toxic end-points required to prioritize existing, or newly synthesized chemicals for their potential hazard. This chapter reviews the information regarding occurrence and impact of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the environment along with their persistence, environmental fate, risk assessment, and risk management. A bird’s eye view about the necessity of in silico methods for fate prediction of pharmaceuticals in the environment as well as existing successful models regarding ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals are discussed. Available toxicity endpoints, ecotoxicity databases, and expert systems frequently used for ecotoxicity predictions of pharmaceuticals are also reported. The overall discussion justifies the requirement to build up additional in silico models for quick prediction of ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals economically, without or involving only limited animal testing.","Kar, Supratik; Roy, Kunal; Leszczynski, Jerzy",Computational Toxicology,51,11

These regimens, as well as other treatments before and after HSCT such as immunosuppressive drugs to prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD) (see Chap. 11), may affect the patient’s organs and tissues and may cause both acute and long-term complications. In the evolving field of stem cell therapies, some complications that traditionally have been regarded as early complications are now, due to changes in preparative regimens and choice of stem cell source, sometimes seen later in the post-transplant out-patient setting. The complications covered in this chapter generally occur within 100 days post HSCT and are thus classified as early complications. Two of the most common early complications are oral complications/mucositis and sepsis. Some other relatively rare complications are also covered here: haemorrhagic cystitis (HC), endothelial damage (ED) syndromes including engraftment syndrome (ES), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH), transplant-associated microangiopathy (TAM) and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD). For all complications, recommendations for prevention and principles for nursing care are presented since careful nursing monitoring, prompt intervention and care may have an influence on patients’ morbidity and mortality.","Wallhult, Elisabeth; Quinn, Barry",The European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Textbook for Nurses,51,1

The prescription of enterosorbents is appropriate as a primary measure for the treatment of the acute diarrhea for effective prevention of the fluid and electrolyte loss, as well as method for symptom relief of the attack of the disease. Aim of the study - the antidiarrheal efficacy and safety study of high-dispersion silicon dioxide enterosorbent in tablet dosage form in patients with acute diarrhea. This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently. It has been postulated that symptoms and signs of acute diarrhea have to be caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract and did not associated with moderate-to-severe systemic states. 144 patients with established acute diarrhea were randomized into treatment group (enterosorbent “Carbowhite”, n = 120) or placebo group. Date collection including severity diarrhea, systemic symptoms was performed at baseline and daily during 7 days. Stool examination and serological assay were performed at baseline. The primary end points were declared as time to complete recovery from acute diarrhea. It has been found that the use of the siliceous enterosorbent (“Carbowhite”) allowed to reduce (p < 0.001) the treatment period averagely for 0.9 days (95% confidence interval 0.5–1.2 days) in comparison with placebo. Data of safety monitoring has revealed that both patient groups had negative stool culture, while initiation of antibiotic treatment was run more frequently in placebo group (8.3%) compared to investigational product group (4.1%, P = 0.044).

Five species of psyllid occurred on seven species of Salix at Meade River, Alaska. Studies were made on the two common species Psylla pclmeni Löw and P.phlebophyllae Hodkinson. The former feeds on the phanerophy tes Salix pulchra, S.lanata, S.alaxensis and S.glauca, the latter on the chamaephytes S.phlebophylla and S.reticulata. 2. Both P.palmeni and P.phlebophyllae had a 1‐year life cycle and nymphal development took place on the female Salix catkin. The life cycle was generally closely synchronized with the period of catkin development. However, only a few eggs were laid on S.glauca 3. Seasonal perturbation of the host plant by flooding, ice movement and blown sand prevented psyllids breeding in certain areas colonized by the host plant. 4. In P.palmenidensities and ‘feeding pressure’, measured as biomass of psyllids per gram of catkin, on the different host plants followed the sequence S.pulchra>S.lanata> S.alaxensis > S.glauca. In P.phlebophyllae densities and feeding intensities were similar onS.phlebophyllaandS.reticulataand grazing intensity was comparable withP.palmenion S.pulchra. 5. A highly significant negative correlation was found between psyllid density and catkin dry weight in S.pulchra, S.phlebophylla and S.reticulata, suggesting that psyllid feeding is affecting catkin growth. 6. Predation of psyllid nymphs by syrphid larvae was heavy but there was no evidence of parasitism. 7. The life history strategies of the five psyllid species are discussed within the context of the constraints imposed by the arctic environment.","HODKINSON, I. D.; JENSEN, T. S.; MacLEAN, S.

We have studied the cell tropisms of two virulent strains (CDV‐SH and CDV A75–17) and an attenuated strain, Rockborn (CDV‐RO), in cultured canine brain cells. Infected cell types were identified by double immunofluorescent labeling of specific cell markers and viral antigens. All viral strains studied produced infection in astrocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Neurons were not infected by CDV A75–17 but were rapidly infected by CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO. Multipolar oligodendrocytes were very rarely infected by any of the virus strains. In contrast, a morphologically distinct subset of bipolar oligodendrocytes were commonly infected by CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO. The kinetics of infection in the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons, and macrophages varied between strains. Both CDV‐SH and CDV‐RO rapidly infected bipolar oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages by 14 days post infection while infection by CDV A75–17 was delayed until after 28–35 days post infection.

Only the 2-year-old rats reacted adversely. Two doses of endotoxin produced death, with focal myocardial necrosis, haemorrhage and pulmonary and hepatic intravascular coagulation. The increased susceptibility of aged rats to the toxic effects of endotoxin explains some of the changes found in the tissues of old rats. The sporadic nature of both cardiac failure and dyspnoea as a cause of morbidity and mortality in ageing rats may be related to the need for two endotoxin episodes in a period of 24 h to provoke a generalized Shwartzman reaction, an occurrence likely to be relatively uncommon under natural conditions.","Carthew, P.; Dorman, B.M.; Edwards, R.E.",J Comp Pathol,51,1

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 key informants at two time points to understand organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change. We identified strategies important to successful implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. PURPOSE: Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) is effective for secondary fracture prevention. Two hospital sites implemented FLS for hip fracture patients, 50 + years, in Alberta, Canada. We assessed organizational readiness, facilitators, and barriers to change to better understand the context in which the FLS was implemented to inform its potential spread provincially. METHODS: We recruited individuals involved in FLS implementation at provincial and site levels to participate in telephone interviews at baseline and 16 months post-implementation. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. In addition, site-level participants were invited to complete the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change tool at baseline. RESULTS: We conducted 33 semi-structured interviews (20 at baseline; 13 at post-implementation) with 21 key informants. Participants included managers (24%), FLS physicians/clinical nurses (19%), operational/leadership roles (19%), physicians/surgeons (14%), pharmacists (10%), nurse practitioners (10%), and social work (5%). Seventeen site-level participants completed the ORIC tool at baseline; all participants scored high (71%) or neutral (29%). We found that the use of several strategies, including demonstrating value, providing resources, and selecting appropriate sites, were important to implementation, particularly in the context of change fatigue. Participants perceived the FLS as acceptable and there was evidence of facilitated learning rather than simply monitoring implementation as intended. CONCLUSIONS: An effective change management approach neutralized change fatigue. This approach, if maintained, bodes well for the potential spread of the FLS provincially if proven effective and cost effective. Change readiness assessment tools could be used strategically to inform the spread of the FLS to early adopter sites.

Although it has re-emerged as an epidemic threat, so far there are neither vaccines nor pharmacotherapy available to prevent or treat an infection. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structure–activity relationship studies of a class of novel small molecule inhibitors against CHIKV and the discovery of a new potent inhibitor (compound 6a). The starting point of the optimization process was N-ethyl-6-methyl-2-(4-(4-fluorophenylsulfonyl)piperazine-1-yl)pyrimidine-4-amine (1) with an EC(50) of 8.68 μM, a CC(50) of 122 μM, and therefore a resulting selectivity index (SI) of 14.2. The optimized compound 6a, however, displays a much lower micromolar antiviral activity (EC(50) value of 3.95 μM), considerably better cytotoxic liability (CC(50) value of 260 μM) and consequently an improved SI of greater than 61. Therefore, we report the identification of a promising novel compound class that has the potential for further development of antiviral drugs against the CHIKV.","Moesslacher, Julia; Battisti, Verena; Delang, Leen; Neyts, Johan; Abdelnabi, Rana; Pürstinger, Gerhard; Urban, Ernst; Langer, Thierry",ACS Med Chem Lett,51,1

However, little is known about average gastric volumes comprising food, fluids and air. Although literature suggests a relevant risk of gastric insufflation when endotracheal intubation (ETI) is required in the pre-hospital setting, this assumption is still unproven. METHODS: Primary whole body computed tomographic (CT) studies of 315 major trauma patients admitted to our Level 1 Trauma Centre Salzburg during a 7-year period were retrospectively assessed. Gastric volumes were calculated employing a CT volume rendering software. Patients intubated in the pre-hospital setting by emergency physicians (PHI, N = 245) were compared with spontaneously breathing patients requiring ETI immediately after arrival in the emergency room (ERI, N = 70). RESULTS: The median (range) total gastric content and air volume was 402 (26–2401) and 94 (0–1902) mL in PHI vs. 466 (59–1915) and 120 (1–997) mL in ERI patients (p = .59 and p = .35). PHI patients were more severely injured when compared with the ERI group (injury severity score (ISS) 33 (9–75) vs. 25 (9–75); p = .004). Mortality was higher in the PHI vs. ERI group (26.8% vs. 8.6%, p = .001). When PHI and ERI patients were matched for sex, age, body mass index and ISS (N = 50 per group), total gastric content and air volume was 496 (59–1915) and 119 (0–997) mL in the PHI vs. 429 (36–1726) and 121 (4–1191) mL in the ERI group (p = .85 and p = .98). Radiologic findings indicative for aspiration were observed in 8.1% of PHI vs. 4.3% of ERI patients (p = .31). Gastric air volume in patients who showed signs of aspiration was 194 (0–1355) mL vs. 98 (1–1902) mL in those without pulmonary CT findings (p = .08). CONCLUSION: In major trauma patients, overall stomach volume deriving from food, fluids and air must be expected to be around 400–500 mL. Gastric dilation caused by air is common but not typically associated with pre-hospital airway management. The amount of air in the stomach seems to be associated with the risk of aspiration. Further studies, specifically addressing patients after difficult airway management situations are warranted.","Mitteregger, Thomas; Schwaiger, Philipp; Kreutziger, Janett; Schöchl, Herbert; Oberladstätter, Daniel; Trimmel, Helmut; Voelckel, Wolfgang G.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,51,1

In this study, we examined possible utility of BiSCaO Water for that purpose. BiSCaO Water was prepared by adding 10 wt% BiSCaO to clean water and gently collecting the supernatant in a bottle. The same volume of clean water was gently poured onto the BiSCaO precipitate and the supernatant was gently collected in a bottle; this process was repeated fifty times. The produced BiSCaO Water contained nanoparticles (about 400–800 nm) composed of smaller nanoparticles (100–200 nm), and was colorless and transparent, with a pH > 12.7. In vitro assays demonstrated that BiSCaO Water eliminated more than 99.9% of influenza A (H1N1) and Feline calicivirus, Escherichia coli such as NBRC 3972 and O-157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus within 15 min.

To protect its active component from biological stress and increase its drug efficacy as well as drug bioavailability, nanoemulsion was prepared. Dendropanax morbifera zinc oxide nanoparticles (DM-ZnO NPs) were synthesized using the plant extract via the co-precipitation method and loaded with active indole-3-carbinol for nanoemulsion formulation using the ultrasonication process. Field emission transmission electron microscope revealed the flower shape of the Dendropanax morbifera indole-3-carbinol zinc oxide nanoemulsion (DM-ZnO-I3C-NE). In contrast, DM-ZnO NPs showed a spheroid shape that coincides agreeably with field emission electron scanning microscope. The hydrodynamic sizes by dynamic light scattering are about 65 ± 3 nm and 239.6 ± 6 nm and the crystallite sizes from X-ray diffraction are 11.52 nm and 16.07 nm for DM-ZnO NPs and DM-ZnO-I3C-NE, respectively. In vitro analysis revealed the cytotoxicity of DM-ZnO-I3C-NE against a human lung cancer cell line (A549) at 12.5 µg/mL as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The DM-ZnO-I3C-NE-induced ROS generation level was higher than that of DM-ZnO NPs and free indole-3-carbinol.

With the widespread use of CVADs, the incidence of catheter-related thrombus (CRT) has increased. Catheter-related thrombus is a common complication in patients who use CVADs and is mainly caused by endothelial injury, blood stasis, and hypercoagulability. In recent years, the correlations between oxidative stress (OS) and microRNA (miRNA) and CRT have become a hot topic in clinical research. When a catheter punctures the vessel wall, it causes OS damage to the vascular endothelial cells, leading to a series of CRT diseases. MicroRNAs can regulate the mechanism of thrombus and play an important role in the formation of anti-thrombus. Numerous studies have shown that resistance exercise can reduce the level of OS in vascular endothelial cells, inhibit vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, and maintain the stability of hemodynamics and biochemical state. In the current work, the recent studies on the effects of resistance exercise on OS and miRNA in vascular endothelial cells were reviewed.","Wen, Cui; Ying, Yanping; Yu, Fu; Zhou, Jianpeng",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,51,11

This study analyzed the patterns and extent of inequality of opportunity in health and nutrition among children under-five across three countries sub-Saharan Africa with low Human development index (HDI). METHODS: We used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of the Democratic Republic of Congo (20,792 households, 21,756 women aged 15 to 49 and 21,456 children under five), Guinea Bissau (6601 households, 10,234 women aged 15–49 and 7573 children under five) and Mali (11,830 households, 18,409 women in 15–49 years and 16,468 children under five) to compute the human opportunity index (HOI) and the dissimilarity index (D-index). Secondly, the Shapley decomposition method was used to estimate the relative contribution of circumstances that are beyond the control of children under-five and affecting their development outcomes in later life stages. RESULTS: The study revealed that children belonging to the most favorable group had higher access rates for immunization (93.64%) and water and sanitation facilities (73.59%) in Guinea Bissau. In Congo DR, the access rate was high for immunization (93.9%) for children in the most favorable group. In Mali, access rates stood at 6.56% for children in the most favorable group. In Guinea Bissau, the inequality of opportunity was important in access to health services before and after delivery (43.85%). In Congo DR, the inequality of opportunity was only high for the immunization composite indicator (83.79%) while in Mali, inequality of opportunity was higher for access to health services before and after delivery (41.67%). CONCLUSION: The results show that there are efforts in some places to promote access to health and nutrition services in order to make access equal without distinction linked to the socio-economic and demographic characteristics in which the children live. However, the inequalities of opportunity observed between the children of the most favorable group and those of the least favorable group, remain in general at significant levels and call on government of these countries to implement policies taking them into account.","Sanoussi, Yacobou; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Yaya, Sanni",Int J Equity Health,51,1

OBJECTIVES: To study the incidence and characteristics of heterotopic ossification (HO) after SCI. SETTING: The in-patient services of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of a tertiary care institute in India between January 2001 and December 2017. METHODS: Medical records of all consecutive patients with diagnosis of SCI in the age group of 15–60 years were reviewed for presence of HO (diagnosed by clinical signs, laboratory investigations (ALP, ESR and X-rays)) and characteristics of HO. R-Ver 3.4.2 was used for analysis and correlations. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 303 patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Nineteen individuals (6.3%) had developed HO. Seven (37%) were diagnosed within 3 months of SCI. Twelve (63%) patients developed unilateral HO. The most common site for HO was hip joint (73%). A significant association was found between the presence of a pressure ulcer and development of HO (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HO was 6.3% in our institution and the hip joint is the most common site. Due to the presence of limited treatment options it is important to diagnose HO early in patients with SCI based on clinical features and later confirmed with laboratory tests and imaging.","Rawat, Nidhi; Chugh, Sushil; Zachariah, Kurian; Ghosh, Santu",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,51,8

These varying directions of disease risk have long begged the question: when it comes to telomeres, is it better to be long or short? We propose to operationalize and answer this question by considering the relative impact of long gTL vs. short gTL on disease incidence and burden in a population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used odds ratios (OR) of disease associated with gTL from a recently published MR meta-analysis to approximate the relative contributions of gTL to the incidence and burden of neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease in a European population. We obtained incidence data of the 9 cancers associated with long gTL and 4 non-neoplastic diseases associated with short gTL from the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME). Incidence rates of individual cancers from SEER, a database of United States cancer records, were used to weight the ORs in order to align with the available IHME data. These data were used to estimate the excess incidences due to long vs. short gTL, expressed as per 100,000 persons per standard deviation (SD) change in gTL. To estimate the population disease burden, we used the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) metric from the IHME, a measure of overall disease burden that accounts for both mortality and morbidity, and similarly calculated the excess DALY associated with long vs. short gTL. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that, despite the markedly larger ORs of neoplastic disease, the large incidence of degenerative diseases causes the excess incidence attributable to gTL to balance that of neoplastic diseases. Long gTL is associated with an excess incidence of 94.04 cases/100,000 persons/SD (45.49–168.84, 95%CI) from the 9 cancer, while short gTL is associated with an excess incidence of 121.49 cases/100,000 persons/SD (48.40–228.58, 95%CI) from the 4 non-neoplastic diseases. When considering disease burden using the DALY metric, long gTL is associated with an excess 1255.25 DALYs/100,000 persons/SD (662.71–2163.83, 95%CI) due to the 9 cancers, while short gTL is associated with an excess 1007.75 DALYs/100,000 persons/SD (411.63–1847.34, 95%CI) due to 4 non-neoplastic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that genetically determined long and short telomere length are associated with disease risk and burden of approximately equal magnitude. These results provide quantitative estimates of the relative impact of genetically-predicted short vs. long TL in a human population, and provide evidence in support of the cancer-aging paradox, wherein human telomere length is balanced by opposing evolutionary forces acting to minimize both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Importantly, our results indicate that odds ratios alone can be misleading in different clinical scenarios, and disease risk should be assessed from both an individual and population level in order to draw appropriate conclusions about the risk factor’s role in human health.","Protsenko, Ekaterina; Rehkopf, David; Prather, Aric A.; Epel, Elissa; Lin, Jue",PLoS One,51,28

The aim of our study was to explore the dynamic between a second CRP test taken within 12 hours from admission CRP test in a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute bacterial infection in comparison to CRP in a control group of apparently healthy individuals. This was a historical cohort study comprised of all patients admitted to the Sourasky Tel-Aviv Medical Center, Israel, between July 2007 and March 2016. The study cohort included adult patients who were diagnosed as having an infection, assumed to be of bacterial etiology (cellulitis and erysipelas, pneumonia, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis, or septicemia), who had a CRP test during the first 6 hours of hospital admission (baseline CRP), and a successive CRP test up to 12 hours from the first one (recurrent CRP). The control group was of healthy subjects who attended our medical center for a routine annual check-up. The study included 950 patients. Baseline CRP ranged from 0.04 to 454 mg/L. The median CRP velocity was 0.53 mg/L/h. Patients were grouped by baseline CRP into 4 groups (CRP < 10, 10–74.9, 75–199.9, ≥200). There was an increase in median CRP velocity between the first (0.48 mg/L/h) and the second (0.93 mg/L/h) groups, which then was decreased in the next 2 groups (0.46 and −2.58 mg/L/h, respectively). In 45 of 103 (44%) patients of the group of baseline CRP concentration less than 10 mg/dL with bacterial diagnosis, there was a complete overlap with CRP values of apparently healthy individuals during their routine annual checkup. A first single low CRP result cannot exclude the presence of a significant bacterial infection. Patients with acute bacterial infection might present with a relatively low CRP value that at times correspond to normal limit CRP concentrations. A second test, obtained within 12 hours of admission, might serve as an important tool to identify patient with an evolving inflammatory burst commonly seen during acute bacterial infection.","Goldberg, Ilan; Shalmon, Dana; Shteinvil, Ronen; Berliner, Shlomo; Paran, Yael; Zeltser, David; Shapira, Itzhak; Shenhar-Tsarfaty, Shani; Meilik, Ahuva; Wasserman, Asaf; Goldiner, Ilana; Ziv-Baran, Tomer; Sprecher, Eli; Levinson, Tal; Rogowski, Ori",Medicine (Baltimore),51,8

The spread of these diseases has been difficult to control with biosecurity and current vaccination strategies, and increased understanding of the viral pathogenesis could be beneficial for the development of novel vaccine strategies. N-glycosylation of viral envelope proteins may be crucial for viral virulence and a possible target for its purposed attenuation. In this study, we mutated the N-glycosylation consensus motifs of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of a SAV3 infectious clone using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of the glycosylation motif in E1 gave a complete inactivation of the virus as no viral replication could be detected in cell culture and infectious particles could not be rescued. In contrast, infectious virus particles could be recovered from the SAV3 E2 mutants (E2319Q, E2319A), but not if they were accompanied by lack of N-glycosylation in E1. Compared to the non-mutated infectious clone, the SAV3-E2319Q and SAV3-E2319A recombinant viruses produced less cytopathic effects in cell culture and lower amounts of infectious viral particles. In conclusion, the substitution in the N-linked glycosylation site in E2 attenuated SAV3 in cell culture. The findings could be useful for immunization strategies using live attenuated vaccines and testing in fish will be desirable to study the clone’s properties in vivo.","Aksnes, Ida; Markussen, Turhan; Braaen, Stine; Rimstad, Espen",Viruses,51,1

Papillar cytoplasm sharing does not employ canonical mechanisms such as incomplete cytokinesis or muscle fusion pore regulators. Instead, sharing requires gap junction proteins (normally associated with transport of molecules < 1 kDa), which are positioned by membrane remodeling GTPases.

The increasing demand for multitargeting diagnostics requires multi-informative single tests. In this study, we demonstrated three strategies to upgrade standard multiplex LFIA to multimodal capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we applied the strategies to the differential diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, a widespread pathogen, for which conventional multiplex LFIA testing is well-established. In the new two-parameter LFIA (x(2)LFIA), we exploited color encoding, in which the binding of multiple targets occurs in one reactive band and the color of the probe reveals which one is present in the sample. By combining the sequential alignment of several reactive zones along the membrane of the LFIA strip and gold nanoparticles and gold nanostars for the differential visualization, in this demonstration, the x(2)LFIA can furnish information on HIV serotype and stage of infection in a single device. Three immunosensors were designed. The use of bioreagents as the capturing ligand anchored onto the membrane or as the detection ligand labelled with gold nanomaterials affected the performance of the x(2)LFIA. Higher detectability was achieved by the format involving the HIV-specific antigens as capturing agent and labelled secondary bioligands (anti-human immunoglobulins M and protein G) as the probes.","Cavalera, Simone; Di Nardo, Fabio; Forte, Luca; Marinoni, Francesca; Chiarello, Matteo; Baggiani, Claudio; Anfossi, Laura",Sensors (Basel),51,28

Following the implementation of a series of policies, the private sector in China’s hospital market has expanded rapidly over the past decade. It remains unknown whether the market mix of hospital ownership could alleviate medical disputes, this study aims to bridge the gap. Data are collected from all hospitals (2171) in Sichuan province, China, from 2012 to 2015. Using a negative binomial hurdle model, the results show that for hospitals with disputes, the private hospital market share has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the number of disputes. However, no significant relationship is found between the private hospital market share and the probability of dispute occurrence. For hospitals with disputes, competition plays a protective role in the effect of the private hospital market share on the number of disputes, hindering the increase in the number of disputes and facilitating a more rapid drop. However, medical quality is found to play an insignificant role in that effect. The findings also support encouraging new private hospitals in China rather than privatizing existing public hospitals.","Lan, Tianjiao; Pan, Jay",Inquiry,51,1

In Germany, the national health agenda supports measures that enhance the appropriate, guideline-oriented use of antibiotics. The study “Converting Habits of Antibiotic Use for Respiratory Tract Infections in German Primary Care (CHANGE-3)” aimed at a sustainable reduction of antimicrobial resistance through converting patterns of prescribing practice and use of antibiotics and an increase in health literacy in primary care patients, practice teams, and in the general public. Embedded in a cluster-randomized trial of a multifaceted implementation program, a process evaluation focused on the uptake of program components to assess the fidelity of the implementation program in the CHANGE-3 study and to understand utilization of its educational components. METHODS: A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods was used. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with General Practitioners, Medical Assistants, patients treated for respiratory tract infection and outreach visitors who had carried out individual outreach visits. A two-wave written survey (T1: 5 months after start, T2: 16 months after start) was conducted in general practitioners and medical assistants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic framework analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey data. RESULTS: Uptake of intervention components was heterogenous. Across all components, the uptake reported by General Practitioners varied from 20 to 88% at T1 and 31 to 63% at T2. Medical Assistants reported uptake from 22 to 70% at T1 and 6 to 69% at T2. Paper-based components could by and large be integrated in daily practice (64 to 90% in T1; 41 to 93% in T2), but uptake of digital components was low. A one-time outreach visit provided thematic information and feedback regarding actual prescribing, but due to time constraints were received with reluctance by practice teams. Patients were largely unaware of program components, but assumed that information and education could promote health literacy regarding antibiotics use. CONCLUSIONS: The process evaluation contributed to understanding the applicability of the delivered educational components with regards to the appropriate use of antibiotics. Future research efforts need to identify the best mode of delivery to reach the targeted population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN15061174.

In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in Caenorhabditis elegans activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. Enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction is necessary for the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.","Mao, Kai; Breen, Peter; Ruvkun, Gary",PLoS Biol,51,11

Clinical manifestations can vary from life-threatening arrythmias to chronic conditions, such as heart failure or hypertension, which dramatically reduce quality of life of cancer survivors. Standard chemotherapy exerts its toxic effect mainly by inducing oxidative stress and genomic instability, while new targeted therapies work by interfering with signaling pathways important not only in cancer cells but also in myocytes. For example, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors interfere with class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms involved in cardiac hypertrophy, contractility, and regulation of various channel forming proteins; thus, off-target effects of BTK inhibitors are associated with increased frequency of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, compared to standard chemotherapy.

A quite strong linkage between this type of ailments and elevated plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) has been always noticed. Notably, this risk factor is mired in deep confusion, since its role in atherosclerosis is uncertain. One of the explanations that aim to decipher this persistent enigma was provided by apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), a small protein historically recognized as an important regulator of TG metabolism. Preeminently, hundreds of studies have been carried out in order to explore the APOC3 genetic background, as well as to establish a correlation between its variants and dyslipidemia-related disorders, pointing to an earnest predictive power for future outcomes. Among several polymorphisms reported within the APOC3, the SstI site in its 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) was the most consistently and robustly associated with an increased CVD risk. As more genetic data supporting its importance in cardiovascular events aggregate, it was declared, correspondingly, that apoC-III exerts various atherogenic effects, either by intervening in the function and catabolism of many lipoproteins, or by inducing endothelial inflammation and smooth muscle cells (SMC) proliferation. This review was designed to shed the light on the structural and functional aspects of the APOC3 gene, the existing association between its SstI polymorphism and CVD, and the specific molecular mechanisms that underlie apoC-III pathological implications. In addition, the translation of all these gathered knowledges into preventive and therapeutic benefits will be detailed too.","Dib, Israa; Khalil, Alia; Chouaib, Racha; El-Makhour, Yolla; Noureddine, Hiba",Mol Biol Rep,51,8

ME/CFS usually occurs as sporadic cases, but epidemics (outbreaks) have occurred worldwide. Myalgic encephalomyelitis was named to describe an outbreak affecting the lymphatic, muscular, and nervous systems that closed the Royal Free hospital for three months in 1955. Fifteen years later, two psychiatrists concluded that epidemic hysteria was the likely cause. ME/CFS research studies show multiple pathophysiological differences between patients and controls and a possible etiological role for infectious organisms, but the belief that ME/CFS is psychosomatic is widespread and has been specifically supported by the epidemic hysteria hypothesis for the Royal Free outbreak. Our objective was to obtain accounts from ex-Royal Free hospital staff who personally experienced the 1955 outbreak and evaluate evidence for it being an infectious illness versus epidemic hysteria. Materials and Methods: Statements in the newsletters of two organizations for staff who had worked at the Royal Free hospital invited anyone who had experienced the 1955 Royal Free outbreak to contact the authors. Accounts of the outbreak from telephone interviews and letters were evaluated against the “epidemic hysteria hypothesis” paper and original medical staff reports. Results: Twenty-seven ex-Royal Free hospital staff, including six who had developed ME, provided descriptions typical of an infectious illness affecting the lymphatic, muscular, and nervous systems, and were not consistent with epidemic hysteria. Conclusions: The 1955 Royal Free hospital epidemic of myalgic encephalomyelitis was an organic infectious disease, not psychogenic epidemic hysteria.","Underhill, Rosemary; Baillod, Rosemarie",Medicina (Kaunas),51,28

The source of the bloodmeal is identified by analyzing the remnants of blood remaining in the arthropod at the time of capture, though this is often fraught with challenges. This review provides a roadmap and guide for those considering modern techniques for arthropod bloodmeal identification with a focus on progress made in the field over the past decade. We highlight genome regions that can be used to identify the vertebrate source of arthropod bloodmeals as well as technological advances made in other fields that have introduced innovative new ways to identify vertebrate meal source based on unique properties of the DNA sequence, protein signatures, or residual molecules present in the blood. Additionally, engineering progress in miniaturization has led to a number of field-deployable technologies that bring the laboratory directly to the arthropods at the site of collection. Although many of these advancements have helped to address the technical challenges of the past, the challenge of successfully analyzing degraded DNA in bloodmeals remains to be solved. ABSTRACT: Understanding vertebrate–vector interactions is vitally important for understanding the transmission dynamics of arthropod-vectored pathogens and depends on the ability to accurately identify the vertebrate source of blood-engorged arthropods in field collections using molecular methods. A decade ago, molecular techniques being applied to arthropod blood meal identification were thoroughly reviewed, but there have been significant advancements in the techniques and technologies available since that time. This review highlights the available diagnostic markers in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and discusses their benefits and shortcomings for use in molecular identification assays. Advances in real-time PCR, high resolution melting analysis, digital PCR, next generation sequencing, microsphere assays, mass spectrometry, and stable isotope analysis each offer novel approaches and advantages to bloodmeal analysis that have gained traction in the field. New, field-forward technologies and platforms have also come into use that offer promising solutions for point-of-care and remote field deployment for rapid bloodmeal source identification. Some of the lessons learned over the last decade, particularly in the fields of DNA barcoding and sequence analysis, are discussed. Though many advancements have been made, technical challenges remain concerning the prevention of sample degradation both by the arthropod before the sample has been obtained and during storage. This review provides a roadmap and guide for those considering modern techniques for arthropod bloodmeal identification and reviews how advances in molecular technology over the past decade have been applied in this unique biomedical context.","Borland, Erin M.; Kading, Rebekah C.",Insects,51,11

However, since all the health information is scattered in multiple places, it is an onerous task to carry it whenever people move to other countries. To effectively and efficiently utilize health information, interoperability, which is the ability of various healthcare information technologies to exchange, to interpret, and to use data, is needed. Hence, building a robust transnational health information infrastructure with clear interoperability guidelines considering heterogeneous aspects is necessary.

Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.","Burman, Richard J.; Watson, Lauren M.; Smith, Danielle C.; Raimondo, Joseph V.; Ballo, Robea; Scholefield, Janine; Cowley, Sally A.; Wood, Matthew J.

Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) regulate the hair cycle and play important roles in hair growth and regeneration. Myristoleic acid (MA) increases Wnt reporter activity in DPCs. However, the action mechanisms of MA on the stimulation of anagen signaling in DPCs is not known. In this study, we evaluated the effects of MA on anagen-activating signaling pathways in DPCs. MA significantly increased DPC proliferation and stimulated the G2/M phase, accompanied by increasing cyclin A, Cdc2, and cyclin B1. To elucidate the mechanism by which MA promotes DPC proliferation, we evaluated the effect of MA on autophagy and intracellular pathways. MA induced autophagosome formation by decreasing the levels of the phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (phospho-mTOR) and increasing autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3II (LC3II). MA also increased the phosphorylation levels of Wnt/β-catenin proteins, such as GSK3β (Ser(9)) and β-catenin (Ser(552) and Ser(675)). Treatment with XAV939, an inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, attenuated the MA-induced increase in β-catenin nuclear translocation. Moreover, XAV939 reduced MA-induced effects on cell cycle progression, autophagy, and DPC proliferation. On the other hand, MA increased the levels of phospho (Thr(202)/Tyr(204))-extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK). MA-induced ERK phosphorylation led to changes in the expression levels of Cdc2, Atg7 and LC3II, as well as DPC proliferation. Our results suggest that MA promotes anagen signaling via autophagy and cell cycle progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK pathways in DPCs.","Choi, Youn Kyung; Kang, Jung-Il; Hyun, Jin Won; Koh, Young Sang; Kang, Ji-Hoon; Hyun, Chang-Gu; Yoon, Kyung-Sup; Lee, Kwang Sik; Lee, Chun Mong; Kim, Tae Yang; Yoo, Eun-Sook; Kang, Hee-Kyoung",Biomol Ther (Seoul),51,17

METHODS: Here, two novel DNA-based (pVAXzenv) and fowlpox-based (FPzenv) recombinant putative vaccine candidates were constructed that contained the cPrME genes of ZIKV. The env gene inserted into the fowlpox vector was verified for correct transgene expression by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence in different cell lines. The production of virus-like particles as a result of env gene expression was also demonstrated by electron microscopy. BALB/c mice were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and immunized following a prime–boost strategy in a heterologous protocol where pVAXzenv was followed by FPzenv, to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Env protein. The mice underwent a challenge with an epidemic ZIKV after the last boost. RESULTS: These data show that the ZIKV Env protein was correctly expressed in both normal human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) and green monkey kidney (Vero) cells infected with FPzenv, and that the transgene expression lasted for more than 2 weeks. After mucosal administration of FPzenv, the immunized mice showed specific and significantly higher humoral responses compared to the control mice. However, virus neutralizing antibodies were not detected using plaque reduction assays. CONCLUSIONS: Although BALB/c mice appear to be an adequate model for ZIKV infection, as it mimics the natural mild infection in human beings, inadequate immune suppression seemed to occur by dexamethasone and different immune suppression strategies should be applied before challenge to reveal any protection of the mice.","Zanotto, Carlo; Paolini, Francesca; Radaelli, Antonia; De Giuli Morghen, Carlo",Virol J,51,11

PI3P is generated by two complexes that both contain the lipid kinase VPS34: complex II on endosomes (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin 1/UVRAG), and complex I on autophagosomes (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin 1/ATG14L). The endosomal GTPase Rab5 binds complex II, but the mechanism of VPS34 activation by Rab5 has remained elusive, and no GTPase is known to bind complex I. Here we show that Rab5a–GTP recruits endocytic complex II to membranes and activates it by binding between the VPS34 C2 and VPS15 WD40 domains. Electron cryotomography of complex II on Rab5a-decorated vesicles shows that the VPS34 kinase domain is released from inhibition by VPS15 and hovers over the lipid bilayer, poised for catalysis. We also show that the GTPase Rab1a, which is known to be involved in autophagy, recruits and activates the autophagy-specific complex I, but not complex II. Both Rabs bind to the same VPS34 interface but in a manner unique for each. These findings reveal how VPS34 complexes are activated on membranes by specific Rab GTPases and how they are recruited to unique cellular locations.","Tremel, Shirley; Ohashi, Yohei; Morado, Dustin R.; Bertram, Jessie; Perisic, Olga; Brandt, Laura T.

Structured in-bed mobility interventions have been proposed to prevent sequelae of complete immobility in such patients, yet the feasibility and safety of these interventions is unknown. We studied neurological and hemodynamic changes before and after cycle ergometry (CE) in a subset of NCCU patients with external ventricular drains (EVDs). METHODS: Patients admitted to the NCCU who had an EVD placed for cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring underwent supine CE therapy with passive and active cycling settings. Neurologic status, ICP and hemodynamic parameters were monitored before and after each CE session. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients successfully underwent in-bed CE in the NCCU. No clinically significant changes were recorded in neurologic or in physiological parameters before or after CE. There were no device dislodgements or other adverse effects requiring cessation of a CE session. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that supine CE in a heterogeneous cohort of neurocritical care patients with EVDs is safe and tolerable.

METHODS: Eighty eligible patients who underwent MV for > 72 h in the ICU from June 2019 to March 2020 were enrolled in this prospective randomised controlled trial. The patients were randomly divided into a rehabilitation group (n = 39) and a control group (n = 41). Rehabilitation therapy included six levels of rehabilitation exercises. Diaphragm function was determined using ultrasound (US). RESULTS: Diaphragmatic excursion (DE) and diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) were significantly decreased in all patients in both groups after prolonged MV (p < 0.001). The rehabilitation group had significantly higher DTF (p = 0.008) and a smaller decrease in DTF (p = 0.026) than the control group after 3 days of rehabilitation training. The ventilator duration and intubation duration were significantly shorter in the rehabilitation group than in the control group (p = 0.045 and p = 0.037, respectively).

Later, these images are normalized and utilized to train the AlexNet, VGG-16 and Inception-v3 deep learning models. Transfer learning is performed to train a model and extract the deep features from different output layers. After that, the features are fused by a concatenation approach, and the best features are selected using a heuristic entropy calculation approach.

Unnecessary use of antibiotics is associated with the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance. In 2016, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded ‘TARGET’ programme developed a prognostic algorithm to identify children with acute cough and RTI at very low risk of 30-day hospitalisation and unlikely to need antibiotics. The intervention includes: (1) explicit elicitation of parental concerns, (2) the results of the prognostic algorithm accompanied by prescribing guidance and (3) provision of a printout for carers including safety netting advice. The CHIldren’s COugh feasibility study suggested differential recruitment of healthier patients in control practices. This phase III ‘efficiently designed’ trial uses routinely collected data at the practice level, thus avoiding individual patient consent. The aim is to assess whether embedding a multifaceted intervention into general practitioner (GP) practice Information Technology (IT) systems will result in reductions of antibiotic prescribing without impacting on hospital attendance for RTI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The coprimary outcomes are (1) practice rate of dispensed amoxicillin and macrolide antibiotics, (2) hospital admission rate for RTI using routinely collected data by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Data will be collected for children aged 0–9 years registered at 310 practices (155 intervention, 155 usual care) over a 12-month period. Recruitment and randomisation of practices (using the Egton Medical Information Systems web data management system) is conducted via each CCG stratified for children registered and baseline dispensing rates of each practice.

The development of biomimetic nanoparticles by combining the natural cellular material with synthetic nanoparticles has inspired innovative vaccine strategies for modifying the antibacterial immunity. A lot of work has been done in which synthetic nanoparticles are coated with biomimetic cellular membranes for enhancement of biological functions and treatments. Outer membrane protein of bacteria not only act as adjuvant but also contain a large number of immunogenic antigens that play an important role in motivating the native immunity and stimulating the immune responses of the body. Outer membrane protein coating onto the surfaces of synthetic nanoparticles has synergistic effects to produce antibacterial responses.

There is currently no Irish national guideline for GBS screening, and protocols vary across maternity units. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at induction or labour onset informs triage for antibiotic prophylaxis; however, there are human and infrastructural resource requirements to enable widespread implementation. AIM: Our aim was to identify current standard practices for GBS prevention in Irish obstetric and neonatal services and to utilise this data to inform the need for, and potential impact of implementation of, a national guideline. METHODS: A questionnaire on GBS screening, management and existing resources was completed by an informed staff member from each of the 19 Irish maternity units, including questions regarding timing and method of screening, antibiotic usage, and neonatal management. RESULTS: One unit (5.2%) performs routine GBS screening at 35–37 weeks of gestation. Twelve units (63%) screen for GBS following spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) after 37 weeks, of which two (17%) perform PCR and ten (83%) culture testing. Seventeen units (89.3%) have access to a GeneXpert PCR machine, and of these, two (11.7%) use the machine for rapid GBS testing. Two units screen patients for GBS at either the start of labour or induction of labour. Four units (21%) use the neonatal early onset sepsis (EOS) calculator. Sixteen units (84%) do not treat asymptomatic infants born to GBS-positive mothers. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of consistency in the methods for GBS screening and disease prevention across the country, highlighting the need for a national guideline accompanied by an implementation plan and budget to standardise care.","Dakin, Alex; Ferguson, Wendy; Drew, Richard; McCallion, Naomi; Higgins, Mary F.; Eogan, Maeve",Ir J Med Sci,51,8

The laboratory permeation tests with high ionic strength salt solutions reveal that the GB fails to seal and exhibits a significant mechanical collapse under different applied stresses. The applicability of GB in the form of geosynthetic clay liners as the bottom liner facilities in landfills that produce high ionic strength salt leachates, therefore, remains a serious concern. We propose an additional barrier system based on kaolin, for the first time, to address this problem. The proposed kaolin-GB layered system performs satisfactorily in terms of its sealing and swelling ability even in adverse saline conditions and low overburden stresses. The kaolin improves the osmotic efficiency of the self and also helps the underlying GB layer to seal the inter-granular voids. The estimated design parameters by through-diffusion test suggest that the kaolin-GB layered system effectively attenuates the permeant flux and suitable as a landfill liner.","Das, Partha; Bharat, Tadikonda Venkata",Sci Rep,51,1

Consistently, it is vital to understand how communication within the employment cycle of this group can be improved. This study aims to identify and analyze the possibilities of modifying the communication processes around recruitment, selection, onboarding, and job retention to address the specific characteristics and needs of the representatives of this group. This qualitative study is based on 15 in-depth interviews conducted with 21 field experts, i.e.,: therapists, job trainers, and entrepreneurs employing people with ASD. The findings of this research informed the creation of an inclusive communication model supporting the employment cycle of individuals with ASD. The most important recommendations within the model that was created include the modification of job advertisements, use of less structured job interviews, providing opportunities for mentorship, and supportive and non-direct, electronically mediated communication. To apply the above-mentioned solutions and take full advantage of the talents of people with ASD, it is also necessary to provide tailored sensitivity and awareness training programs for their direct addressees as well as their neurotypical colleagues, including managerial staff.","Tomczak, Michał T.; Szulc, Joanna Maria; Szczerska, Małgorzata",Int J Environ Res Public Health,51,1

A natural consequence of this approach is a massive amount of alarms, which potentially leads to fatigue in the personnel and negatively impacts the quality of care provided. The study objective is to determine the prevalence, types, and determinants of alarms in a neurological critical care unit (NCCU) prototype. During a one-month period corresponding to 272 days of monitoring in 34 patients, nursing staff recorded the type and number of sounding alarms in a university NCCU. Alarms were categorized into three types as type-A alarms that were merely handled by the nursing staff, type-B alarms that were primarily managed by nurses, but the physician was also notified, and type-C alarms that were principally handled by NCCU physicians. There were a total of 9439 alarms, with an average of daily 34.7 alarms per bed, corresponding to one alarm every 41.4 min. Most of the alarms were type-A (57.7%), followed by type-B (39.2%) and type-C (3.1%) alarms. Alarms originated from electrocardiogram (34.6%), pulse oximeter (33.7%), noninvasive blood pressure monitoring (9.8%), respiratory monitoring (9.7%), intravenous fluid pumps (4.5%), ventilator (3.9%), enteral pumps (2.1%) and invasive blood pressure systems (1.7%). A noticeable diurnal variation was observed for type-A pulse oximeter, type-A and -B ECG alarms (increase during morning shifts), and type-A ventilator alarms (decrease during morning shifts). Alarms are highly prevalent in NCCUs and can correspond to an important portion of the workload.","Unal, Ali; Arsava, Ethem Murat; Caglar, Gülsen; Topcuoglu, Mehmet Akif",J Clin Monit Comput,51,11

We developed an easy to navigate interactive approach to organize recommendations and applied it to tuberculosis (TB) guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). STUDY DESIGN: We used a mixed-methods study design to develop a framework for recommendation mapping with seven key methodological considerations. We define a recommendation map as an online repository of recommendations from several guidelines on a condition, providing links to the underlying evidence and expert judgments that inform them, allowing users to filter and cross-tabulate the search results. We engaged guideline developers, users, and health software engineers in an iterative process to elaborate the WHO eTB recommendation map. RESULTS: Applying the seven-step framework, we included 228 recommendations, linked to 103 guideline questions and organized the recommendation map according to key components of the health question, including the original recommendations and rationale (https://who.tuberculosis.recmap.org/). CONCLUSION: The recommendation mapping framework provides the entire continuum of evidence mapping by framing recommendations within a guideline questions’ population, interventions, and comparators domains. Recommendation maps should allow guideline developers to organize their work meaningfully, standardize the automated publication of guidelines through links to the GRADEpro guideline development tool, and increase their accessibility and usability.","Hajizadeh, Anisa; Lotfi, Tamara; Falzon, Dennis; Mertz, Dominik; Nieuwlaat, Robby; Gebreselassie, Nebiat; Jaramillo, Ernesto; Korobitsyn, Alexei; Zignol, Matteo; Mirzayev, Fuad; Ismail, Nazir; Brozek, Jan; Loeb, Mark; Piggott, Thomas; Darzi, Andrea; Wang, Qi; Mahmood, Al Subhi; Saroey, Praveen; Matthews, Micayla; Schünemann, Finn; Dietl, Bart; Nowak, Artur; Kulesza, Kuba; Muti-Schünemann, Giovanna E.U.; Bognanni, Antonio; Charide, Rana; Akl, Elie A.; Kasaeva, Tereza; Schünemann, Holger J.",J Clin Epidemiol,51,22

The threat of brucellosis has increased, yet currently available live attenuated vaccines still have drawbacks. Therefore, subunit vaccines, produced using protein antigens and having the advantage of being safe, cost-effective and efficacious, are urgently needed. In this study, we used core proteome analysis and a compositive RV methodology to screen potential broad-spectrum antigens against 213 pathogenic strains of Brucella spp. with worldwide geographic distribution. Candidate proteins were scored according to six biological features: subcellular localization, antigen similarity, antigenicity, mature epitope density, virulence, and adhesion probability. In the RV analysis, a total 32 candidate antigens were picked out. Of these, three proteins were selected for assessment of immunogenicity and preliminary protection in a mouse model: outer membrane protein Omp19 (used as a positive control), type IV secretion system (T4SS) protein VirB8, and type I secretion system (T1SS) protein HlyD. These three antigens with a high degree of conservation could induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Omp19, VirB8 and HlyD could substantially reduce the organ bacterial load of B. abortus S19 in mice and provide varying degrees of protection. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of this unique strategy for the screening of potential broad-spectrum antigens against Brucella. Further evaluation is needed to identify the levels of protection conferred by the vaccine antigens against wild-type pathogenic Brucella species challenge.

Another FDA cleared RT-PCR assay is the Xpert® Xpress Strep A, which detects Streptococcus pyogenes DNA, and is performed on the Cepheid GeneXpert instrument. Three hundred seventy-five positive and negative specimens were randomly selected from 5489 throat specimens that had been tested by the Solana® GAS Assay during January 2018 and were tested with the Xpress Strep A assay. A throat culture was also set up (sheep blood agar at 35 °C in 5% CO2). All beta-hemolytic streptococci were purified and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Of the 375 samples, 185 were positive by Solana® GAS Assay, and 187 were positive by the Xpress Strep A. The total agreement between the Solana® GAS Assay and the Xpert® Xpress Strep A was 99.5%. The agreement of the Xpert® Xpress Strep A assay with culture was 90.1%. The sensitivity and specificity for Xpress Strep A versus culture were 100% and 83.5%, respectively. The Xpert® Xpress Strep A assay’s performance was equivalent to the Solana® GAS Assay, and was highly sensitive. The lower specificity was likely due to the Xpress Strep A assay having higher sensitivity as compared to throat culture.","Ferrieri, Patricia; Thonen-Kerr, Elizabeth; Nelson, K.; Arbefeville, Sophie",Curr Microbiol,51,1

It has been regarded as the principal cause of acquired heart disease in children of the developed countries. Interleukin (IL)-37, as one of the IL-1 family members, is a natural suppressor of inflammation that is caused by activation of innate and adaptive immunity. However, detailed roles of IL-37 in KD are largely unclear. Sera from patients with KD displayed that IL-37 level was significantly decreased compared with healthy controls (HCs). QRT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that the expression level of IL-37 variant, IL-37b, was remarkably downregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to KD sera-treated THP1 cells. Therefore, we researched the role of IL-37b in the context of KD and hypothesized that IL-37b may have a powerful protective effect in KD patients. We first observed and substantiated the protective role of IL-37b in a mouse model of KD induced by Candida albicans cell wall extracts (CAWS). In vitro experiments demonstrated that IL-37b alleviated endothelial cell apoptosis and inflammation via IL-1R8 receptor by inhibiting ERK and NFκB activation, which were also recapitulated in the KD mouse model. Together, our findings suggest that IL-37b play an effective protective role in coronary endothelial damage in KD, providing new evidence that IL-37b is a potential candidate drug to treat KD.","Jia, Chang; Zhuge, Yingzhi; Zhang, Shuchi; Ni, Chao; Wang, Linlin; Wu, Rongzhou; Niu, Chao; Wen, Zhengwang; Rong, Xing; Qiu, Huixian; Chu, Maoping",Cell Death Dis,51,1

The combined effects of general anaesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can aggravate this condition and cause increased pulmonary blood pressures, reduced systemic blood pressures and ventricular contractility. Although perioperative use of inotropic support or vasopressors is almost mandatory for these patients, preference is disputed. In this study, we investigated the effects of norepinephrine and dobutamine and their ability to improve the arterio-ventricular relationship and haemodynamics in pigs suffering from chronic pulmonary hypertension. METHOD: Pulmonary hypertension was induced in five pigs by banding the pulmonary artery at 2–3 weeks of age. Six pigs served as controls. After 16 weeks of pulmonary artery banding, the animals were re-examined under general anaesthesia using biventricular conductance catheters and a pulmonary artery catheter. After baseline measurements, the animals were exposed to both norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions in incremental doses, with a stabilising period in between the infusions. The hypothesis of differences between norepinephrine and dobutamine with incremental doses was tested using repeated two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-test. RESULTS: At baseline, pulmonary artery-banded animals had increased right ventricular pressure (+ 39%, p = 0.04), lower cardiac index (− 23% p = 0.04), lower systolic blood pressure (− 13%, p = 0.02) and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (− 33%, p = 0.02). When incremental doses of norepinephrine and dobutamine were administered, the right ventricular arterio-ventricular coupling was improved only by dobutamine (p < 0.05). Norepinephrine increased both left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular contractility to a greater extent (p < 0.05) in pulmonary artery-banded animals. While the cardiac index was improved equally by norepinephrine and dobutamine treatments in pulmonary artery-banded animals, norepinephrine had a significantly greater effect on mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05) and diastolic arterial pressure (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: While norepinephrine and dobutamine improved cardiac index equally, it was obtained in different manners. Dobutamine significantly improved the right ventricular function and the arterio-ventricular coupling. Norepinephrine increased systemic resistance, thereby improving arterial pressures and left ventricular systolic function by maintaining left ventricular end-diastolic volume.","Hyldebrandt, Janus Adler; Bøgh, Nikolaj; Omann, Camilla; Agger, Peter",Intensive Care Med Exp,51,1

We specifically examined the signature gene expression profiles associated with pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory responses, and resolution of inflammation pathways in macrophages under the influence of IP6. Interestingly, our data suggested that IP6 polarizes bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDM) into an M2a‐like subtype. Our results also demonstrated that IP6 reduces lipopolysaccharide‐induced apoptosis and pro‐inflammatory responses in macrophages. In contrast, the expression levels of genes related to anti‐inflammatory responses and resolution of inflammation pathways are upregulated.

PURPOSE: Widespread resistance to trypanocidal drugs creates urgent need for new, more effective drugs with potential to inhibit important trypanosome molecular targets. METHODS: Nine column chromatographic, partially purified leaf fractions of Azadirachta indica (AIF) were subjected to trypanosome alternative oxidase (TAO) inhibition assay using ubiquinol oxidase assay. The potent TAO inhibitors were evaluated for trypanocidal activities against T. congolense in rat model using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays. Complete cessation or reduction in parasite motility was scored from 0 (no parasite) to 6 (greater than or equal to 6 × 10(7) trypanosomes/milliliter of blood), and was used to evaluate the efficacy of in vitro treatments. RESULTS: Only AIF1, AIF2, and AIF5 significantly inhibited TAO. AIF1 and AIF5 produced significant, dose-dependent suppression of parasite motility reaching score zero within 1 h with EC(50) of 0.005 and 0.004 µg/µL, respectively, while trypanosome-laden blood was still at score six with an EC(50) of 44,086 µg/µL. Mice inoculated with the concentrations at scores 0 and 1 (1–2 moribund parasites) at the end of the experiment did not develop parasitaemia. The two fractions significantly (p < 0.05) lowered parasite burden, with the AIF5 exhibiting highest in vivo trypanocidal effects. Packed cell volume was significantly higher in AIF1 (p < 0.05) and AIF5 (p < 0.001) groups compared to DMSO-treated group. Only AIF5 significantly (p < 0.05) lowered malondialdehyde.

However, no study has been conducted so far on the co-encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) and epoxomicin (Epo) into NPs as biocompatible drug delivery carriers. Therefore, we investigated if co-encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) and/or epoxomicin (Epo) into NPs enhance their anticancer efficiency and prevent drug resistance and toxicity to normal cells. We synthesized Dox and/or Epo loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs using a multiple emulsion solvent evaporation technique and characterized them in terms of their particle size and stability, surface, molecular, thermal, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release properties. We studied the effects of drug encapsulated NPs on cellular accumulation, intracellular drug levels, oxidative stress status, cellular viability, drug resistance, 20S proteasome activity, cytosolic Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB-p65), and apoptosis in breast cancer and normal cells. Our results proved that the nanoparticles we synthesized were thermally stable possessing higher encapsulation efficiency and particle stability. Thermal, morphological and molecular analyses demonstrated the presence of Dox and/or Epo within NPs, indicating that they were successfully loaded. Cell line assays proved that Dox and Epo loaded NPs were less cytotoxic to single-layer normal HUVECs than free Dox and Epo, suggesting that the NPs would be biocompatible drug delivery carriers. The apoptotic index of free Dox and Epo increased 50% through their encapsulation into NPs, proving combination strategy to enhance apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our results demonstrated that the co-encapsulation of Dox and Epo within NPs would be a promising treatment strategy to overcome multidrug resistance and toxicity to normal tissues that can be studied in further in vivo and clinical studies in breast cancer.","Kucuksayan, Ertan; Bozkurt, Fatih; Yilmaz, Mustafa Tahsin; Sircan-Kucuksayan, Aslinur; Hanikoglu, Aysegul; Ozben, Tomris",Sci Rep,51,8

The amount of insulin in supernatants of cell cultures persistently infected with CV-B4 was not affected by the infection; in fact, a larger quantity of proinsulin was found. The mRNA expression of pro-hormone convertase 2, an enzyme involved in the maturation of proinsulin into insulin and studied using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was inhibited in infected cultures. Further, the pattern of 47 cell proteins analyzed using Shotgun mass spectrometry was significantly modified. The DNA of persistently infected cell cultures was hypermethylated unlike that of controls. The persistent infection of INS-1 cells with CV-B4 had a deep impact on these cells, especially on insulin metabolism. Cellular changes caused by persistent CV-B4 infection of β cells can play a role in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis.","Nekoua, Magloire Pandoua; Bertin, Antoine; Sane, Famara; Gimeno, Jean-Pascal; Fournier, Isabelle; Salzet, Michel; Engelmann, Ilka; Alidjinou, Enagnon Kazali; Hober, Didier",Microorganisms,51,17

Ciclopirox (CPX) is an off-label drug, topically prescribed as an antifungal. It has been recently shown that it also acts as a pharmacological chaperone in CEP, presenting a specific activity in deleterious mutations in UROIIIS. Despite CPX is active at subtoxic concentrations, acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was found due to the precipitation in the stomach of the active compound and subsequent accumulation in the intestine. To increase its systemic availability, we carried out pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies using alternative formulations for CPX. Such strategy effectively suppressed GI toxicity in WT mice and in a mouse model of the CEP disease (UROIIIS(P248Q/P248Q)). In terms of activity, phosphorylation of CPX yielded good results in CEP cellular models but showed limited activity when administered to the CEP mouse model. These results highlight the need of a proper formulation for pharmacological chaperones used in the treatment of rare diseases.","Bernardo-Seisdedos, Ganeko; Charco, Jorge M.; SanJuan, Itxaso; García-Martínez, Sandra; Urquiza, Pedro; Eraña, Hasier; Castilla, Joaquín; Millet, Oscar",J Pers Med,51,11

In general, virtual learning environments where these three modalities are all the time, are not common; at some moments only the video modality is available, while in others only text or/and video and/or audio. Different approaches using feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion are proposed for multimodal recognition with missing data. Recognizing according to available modalities is studied following the ideas of dropout from neural networks and of variable input length from recurrent neural networks. This proposal is innovative because it represents emotions in the continuous space, which is not common in virtual education; and makes use of the available modalities in a virtual environment in a given moment, which is very common in virtual learning environments because the people are not speaking or writing all the time.","Salazar, Camilo; Montoya-Múnera, Edwin; Aguilar, Jose",Heliyon,51,1

We aimed to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus clinical isolates in vivo, through intranasal administration on a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. RESULTS: We screened in vitro 50 pulmonary clinical isolates of Lactobacillus for their ability to decrease the synthesis of two QS dependent-virulence factors (elastase and pyocyanin) produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1. Two blends of three Lactobacillus isolates were then tested in vivo: one with highly effective anti-PAO1 virulence factors properties (blend named L.rff for L. rhamnosus, two L. fermentum strains), and the second with no properties (blend named L.psb, for L. paracasei, L. salivarius and L. brevis). Each blend was administered intranasally to mice 18 h prior to PAO1 pulmonary infection. Animal survival, bacterial loads, cytological analysis, and cytokines secretion in the lungs were evaluated at 6 or 24 h post infection with PAO1. Intranasal priming with both lactobacilli blends significantly improved 7-day mice survival from 12% for the control PAO1 group to 71 and 100% for the two groups receiving L.rff and L.psb respectively. No mortality was observed for both control groups receiving either L.rff or L.psb. Additionally, the PAO1 lung clearance was significantly enhanced at 24 h. A 2-log and 4-log reduction was observed in the L.rff + PAO1 and L.psb + PAO1 groups respectively, compared to the control PAO1 group. Significant reductions in neutrophil recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion were observed after lactobacilli administration compared to saline solution, whereas IL-10 production was increased. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that intranasal priming with lactobacilli acts as a prophylaxis, and avoids fatal complications caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. These results were independent of in vitro anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa activity on QS-dependent virulence factors. Further experiments are required to identify the immune mechanism before initiating clinical trials.

This classical approach takes several days until large enough plaques can be visualized and counted with some variation due to subjectivity in plaque recognition. Since plaques are clonal lesions produced by virus-induced cytopathic effect, we applied DNA fluorescent dyes with differential cell permeability to visualize them by live-cell imaging. We could observe different stages of that cytopathic effect corresponding to an early wave of cells with chromatin-condensation followed by a wave of dead cells with membrane permeabilization within plaques generated by different animal viruses. This approach enables an automated plaque identification using image analysis to increase single plaque resolution compared to crystal violet counterstaining and allows its application to plaque tracking and plaque reduction assays to test compounds for both antiviral and cytotoxic activities. This fluorescent real-time plaque assay sums to those next-generation technologies by combining this robust classical method with modern fluorescence microscopy and image analysis approaches for future applications in virology.","Arias-Arias, Jorge L.; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Mora-Rodríguez, Rodrigo A.",Viruses,51,1

Electronic devices with music applications, such as iPods and smartphones, are popular during gym sessions as they support the ambiance to one’s exercise programme. Earphones are the popular choice for the transmission of music to the gym user’s ear. There is a direct correlation between the cardiovascular health and the aural health because of the effect of increased blood supply to the auditory system. Therefore, this research study explores the ear hygiene of gym users. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at determining the ear hygiene and middle-ear status of gym users who wore earphones whilst exercising. METHOD: A purposive sampling method was adopted. Data were collected in two phases: phase 1 via a questionnaire and phase 2 included an otoscopic examination and tympanometry. Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-four participants were included. Ear hygiene was not a priority for all gym users. The results revealed that 87% of the participants randomly cleaned their ears; however, 59% were cleaning their earphones. The middle ear assessment indicated that 17% of the participants presented with pathological indicators. Participants requested for the implementation of educational programmes pertaining to infection control measures for proper ear hygiene. CONCLUSION: There is a dearth of health and wellness educational programmes that include ear hygiene practices, necessitating the development of prevention and promotion programmes for this niche area in audiology. The need for guidelines pertaining to ear hygiene practices amongst gym users is vital to ensure that the auditory system is monitored and protected when individuals participate in exercise sessions.","Flowers, Aimee; Pillay, Dhanashree",S Afr J Commun Disord,51,1

The strategy for successful design of synthetic mRNAs by chemically modifying their caps aims to increase resistance to the enzymatic deccapping complex, offer a higher affinity for binding to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (elF4E) protein and enforce increased translation of their encoded proteins. However, the cellular homeostasis is finely balanced and obeys to specific laws of thermodynamics conferring balance between complexity and growth rate in evolution. An overwhelming and forced translation even under alarming conditions of the cell during a concurrent viral infection, or when molecular pathways are trying to circumvent precursor events that lead to autoimmunity and cancer, may cause the recipient cells to ignore their differential sensitivities which are essential for keeping normal conditions. The elF4E which is a powerful RNA regulon and a potent oncogene governing cell cycle progression and proliferation at a post-transcriptional level, may then be a great contributor to disease development. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis manly inhibits the elF4E to proceed with mRNA translation but disturbance in fine balances between mTOR and elF4E action may provide a premature step towards oncogenesis, ignite pre-causal mechanisms of immune deregulation and cause maturation (aging) defects.","Kyriakopoulos, Anthony M.; McCullough, Peter A.",Diseases,51,1

Given the role of neighborhoods in HIV outcomes, synthesis of findings from such research is key to inform efforts toward HIV eradication. We conducted a systematic review to examine the relationship between neighborhood-level factors (e.g., poverty) and HIV vulnerability (via sexual behaviors and substance use). We searched six electronic databases for studies published from January 1, 2007 through November 30, 2017 (PROSPERO CRD42018084384). We also mapped the studies’ geographic distribution to determine whether they aligned with high HIV prevalence areas and/or the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for the United States”. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria. Neighborhood disadvantage, whether measured objectively or subjectively, is one of the most robust correlates of HIV vulnerability. Tests of associations more consistently documented a relationship between neighborhood-level factors and drug use than sexual risk behaviors. There was limited geographic distribution of the studies, with a paucity of research in several counties and states where HIV incidence/prevalence is a concern. Neighborhood influences on HIV vulnerability are the consequence of centuries-old laws, policies and practices that maintain racialized inequities (e.g., racial residential segregation, inequitable urban housing policies). We will not eradicate HIV without multi-level, neighborhood-based approaches to undo these injustices. Our findings inform future research, interventions and policies.","Brawner, Bridgette M.; Kerr, Jelani; Castle, Billie F.; Bannon, Jaqueline A.; Bonett, Stephen; Stevens, Robin; James, Richard; Bowleg, Lisa",AIDS Behav,51,1

However, the categorization of primary osteoblast subtypes in vivo in humans has not yet been achieved. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to perform a systematic cellular taxonomy dissection of freshly isolated human osteoblasts from one 31-year-old male with osteoarthritis and osteopenia after hip replacement. Based on the gene expression patterns and cell lineage reconstruction, we identified three distinct cell clusters including preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, and an undetermined rare osteoblast subpopulation. This novel subtype was found to be the major source of the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 and 2 (NR4A1 and NR4A2) in primary osteoblasts, and the expression of NR4A1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining on mouse osteoblasts in vivo. Trajectory inference analysis suggested that the undetermined cluster, together with the preosteoblasts, are involved in the regulation of osteoblastogenesis and also give rise to mature osteoblasts. Investigation of the biological processes and signaling pathways enriched in each subpopulation revealed that in addition to bone formation, preosteoblasts and undetermined osteoblasts may also regulate both angiogenesis and hemopoiesis. Finally, we demonstrated that there are systematic differences between the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse osteoblasts, highlighting the necessity for studying bone physiological processes in humans rather than solely relying on mouse models.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on PAWS and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and leptin levels in patients with alcohol dependency. A total of 114 patients with alcohol dependence were randomly divided into two groups: the treatment group and the control group. The patients in the treatment group were treated with taVNS of the bilateral auricular concha using an ear vagus nerve stimulator. The Pennsylvania Alcohol Craving Scale was used to evaluate the extent of craving for alcohol. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used to evaluate the extent of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure plasma BDNF, IL-6, TNF-α, and leptin levels. The results showed that the SDS and PSQI scores were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group. Moreover, compared with the control group, the average BDNF levels in the treatment group were significantly increased. These results suggest that taVNS could improve the depression symptoms and sleep quality in alcohol-dependent patients after withdrawal, which might be related to the upregulation of plasma BDNF levels.","Wang, Yong-Mei; Xu, Ya-Yun; Zhai, Yi; Wu, Qian-Qian; Huang, Wen; Liang, Yan; Sun, Yan-Hong; Xu, Lian-Yin",Front Psychiatry,51,8

Many websites offer users the opportunity to leave comments, which may provide rich insights into public perspectives on health issues. With an established role in public health, fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption is central to the government’s dietary guidelines. However, FV intake continues to fall short of government recommendations. OBJECTIVE: Using comments from news websites, this study aims to explore public perspectives on FV intake and related government dietary guidelines. METHODS: Data comprised 2696 web user comments generated in response to substantial media coverage for a meta-analysis examining FV consumption and the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and total cancer. Using an inductive thematic approach, the data were analyzed and coded in an iterative process. RESULTS: Four overarching themes emerged: personal factors, rejection, lack of knowledge, and food landscape, each with component subthemes. The lack of clarity around government dietary health guidelines was apparent, and this, along with emergent personal factors, may hinder better consumption. Rejection was also evident, as was a quality versus quantity of life debate. CONCLUSIONS: There are gaps in the public’s understanding of government guidelines, which may act as a constraint to better compliance. Further work should examine this issue and rejection and the possibility of public fatigue related to dietary health information and news. Similarly, future work should also explore targeted interventions with a specific emphasis on health literacy.","Hornsby, B; Ensaff, H",J Med Internet Res,51,1

Methods: Human umbilical arteries (hUAs, n = 10) were submitted to decellularization. Then, an evaluation of decellularized hUAs, involving histological, biochemical and biomechanical analysis, was performed. Wharton’s Jelly (WJ) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) were isolated and characterized for their properties. Then, WJ-MSCs (1.5 × 10(6) cells) were seeded on decellularized hUAs (n = 5) and cultivated with (Group A) or without the presence of the CBPL, (Group B) for 30 days. Histological analysis involving immunohistochemistry (against Ki67, for determination of cell proliferation) and indirect immunofluorescence (against activated MAP kinase, additional marker for cell growth and proliferation) was performed. Results: The decellularized hUAs retained their initial vessel’s properties, in terms of key-specific proteins, the biochemical and biomechanical characteristics were preserved. The evaluation of the repopulation process indicated a more uniform distribution of WJ-MSCs in group A compared to group B. The repopulated vascular grafts of group B were characterized by greater Ki67 and MAP kinase expression compared to group A.

Differential gut microbiome studies have become a frontier in autism research, affecting 85% of autistic children. The present study aims to understand how gut microbiota of autism subjects differ from their neurotypical counterparts. This study would help to identify the abundance of bacterial signature species in autism and their associated metabolites. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequence datasets of 30 out of 206 autism subjects were selected from the American Gut Project Archive. First, the taxonomic assignment was inferred by similarity-based methods using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) toolkit. Next, species abundance was characterized, and a co-occurrence network was built to infer species interaction using measures of diversity. Thirdly, statistical parameters were incorporated to validate the findings. Finally, the identification of metabolites associated with these bacterial signature species connects with biological processes in the host through pathway analysis. Gut microbiome data revealed Akkermansia sp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to be statistically lower in abundance in autistic children than their neurotypical peers with a five and two-fold decrease, respectively. While Prevotella sp. and Sutterella sp. showed a five and a two-fold increase in cases, respectively.

CONCLUSION: A high magnitude of MTB and RR-MTB was reported among TB patients with HIV and a history of previous treatment. Therefore, coordinated efforts should be applied to the improvement of treatment adherence of known TB cases, and appropriate control and prevention methods to reduce the emergence and increase of MTB and RR-MTB cases.","Diriba, Kuma; Awulachew, Ephrem; Churiso, Gemechu",Infect Drug Resist,51,1

The higher the number of acquired mutations necessary for function, the more convoluted are the antibody developmental pathways. HIV bnAbs acquire a large number of somatic mutations, but not all mutations are functionally important. In this study, we identify a minimal subset of mutations sufficient for the function of the naturally occurring V3-glycan bnAb DH270.6. Using antibody library screening, candidate envelope immunogens that interact with DH270.6-like antibodies containing this set of key mutations are identified and selected in vitro. Our results demonstrate that less complex B cell evolutionary pathways than those naturally observed exist for the induction of HIV bnAbs by vaccination, and they establish rational approaches to identify boosting candidate immunogens.","Swanson, Olivia; Rhodes, Brianna; Wang, Avivah; Xia, Shi-Mao; Parks, Robert; Chen, Haiyan; Sanzone, Aja; Cooper, Melissa; Louder, Mark K.; Lin, Bob C.; Doria-Rose, Nicole A.; Bonsignori, Mattia; Saunders, Kevin O.; Wiehe, Kevin; Haynes, Barton F.; Azoitei, Mihai L.",Cell Rep,51,1

Owing to their desirable cancer-targeting efficacy and controlled release, these nanotherapeutic modalities are broadly used in clinics to improve the efficacy of small-molecule inhibitors. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family members engage in various intracellular processes, including DNA repair, gene transcription, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell division, and antioxidant response. PARP inhibitors are synthetic small-molecules that have emerged as one of the most successful innovative strategies for targeted therapy in cancer cells harboring mutations in DNA repair genes. Despite these advances, drug resistance and unwanted side effects are two significant drawbacks to using PARP inhibitors in the clinic. Recently, the development of practical nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems has tremendously improved the efficacy of PARP inhibitors. NPs can specifically accumulate in the leaky vasculature of the tumor and cancer cells and release the chemotherapeutic moiety in the tumor microenvironment. On the contrary, NPs are usually unable to permeate across the body’s normal organs and tissues; hence the toxicity is zero to none. NPs can modify the release of encapsulated drugs based on the composition of the coating substance. Delivering PARP inhibitors without modulation often leads to the toxic effect; therefore, a delivery vehicle is essential to encapsulate them. Various nanocarriers have been exploited to deliver PARP inhibitors in different cancers. Through this review, we hope to cast light on the most innovative advances in applying PARP inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.","Sargazi, Saman; Mukhtar, Mahwash; Rahdar, Abbas; Barani, Mahmood; Pandey, Sadanad; Díez-Pascual, Ana M.",Int J Mol Sci,51,1

Twenty male guinea pigs (initial BW 1.011 ± 0.096 kg) were selected in a crossover design experiment, maintained at metabolic cages (2 animals per cage) during a total digestibility period of 25 d (2 periods of 13-d). Animals were randomly assigned at 1 of 2 altitudinal sites, 2986 and 2480 m. above the sea level (masl; 5 cages per altitude). Animals were fed 45 g of alfalfa (DM) to meet energy requirements at maintenance levels. At the end of the digestion phase, an animal from each cage was slaughter to determine body fat content from body specific gravity and visceral organ mass. A subsequent performance phase was evaluated as completely randomized design, and animals were kept at the same altitudinal floor in which they ended period 2 of the crossover period. Animals were fed ad libitum with alfalfa. At the end of the performance phase, all remaining animals were slaughtered and visceral organ mass was measured. Energy intake and Dry matter, were increased by animals at 2986 compared to animals at 2480 masl (P<0.001). Metabolizable energy tended to be lower for animals kept at 2986 masl (P=0.053). Nutrient digestibility was lower for animals kept at 2986 compared to 2480 masl. Liver, kidneys and spleen mass were greater for animals maintained at 2986 masl (P<0.012). Heart mass tended to be greater for animasl kept at 2480 masl (P=0,060). Body fat was not alterd by altitudinal site (P>0.345). Final BW, ADG, and feed conversion rate was decreased by animals fed at 2986 masl (P<0.002). Results from this experiment suggest a novel approach to determine Energy efficiency as affected by altitudinal site. Data from this experiment evidenced a 7% increase on energy requirements on ME for animals kept 516 masl higher. Further research is requiered to apply to other biological models.","Izurieta, D; Heredia, B; Sandoval, D; Ponce, C",J Anim Sci,51,8

Moreover, most human infectious diseases are derived from animals, and zoonotic infections always spread on directed interconnected networks. So, in this article, we consider the epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections on a unidirectional circular-coupled network. Here, we construct two unidirectional three-layer circular interactive networks, one model has direct contact between interactive networks, the other model describes diseases transmitted through vectors between interactive networks, which are established by introducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method. Then we obtain the basic reproduction numbers and stability of equilibria of the two models. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that basic reproduction numbers of the models depend on the infection rates, infection periods, average degrees, and degree ratios. Numerical simulations illustrate and expand these theoretical results very well.","Xu, Zhongpu; Fu, Xinchu",Acta Math Sci,51,28

During the initial stages of neutropenia, most of these infections are bacterial. The spectrum of bacterial infections depends to some extent on whether or not patients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis when neutropenic. Since most transplant recipients do, Gram-positive organisms predominate, due to the fact prophylaxis is directed primarily against Gram-negative organisms. Staphylococcus species (often methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus species (viridans group streptococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci), and Enterococcus species (including vancomycin-resistant strains) are isolated most often. Therefore, potent empiric Gram-positive coverage is recommended by many in this setting. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella species are the most common Gram-negative pathogens isolated. Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter species) are emerging as important pathogens. Many of these organisms acquire multiple mechanisms of resistance that render them multidrug resistant. The administration of prompt, broad-spectrum, empiric, antimicrobial therapy is essential and is generally based on local epidemiology and susceptibility/resistance patterns. Response rate to the initial regimen is generally in the range of 75–85%. Fungal infections develop in patients with prolonged neutropenia (greater than 7–10 days). Candida species and Aspergillus species are the predominant fungal pathogens, although many other fungi are opportunistic pathogens in this setting. Fungal infections are seldom documented microbiologically or on histopathology, and the administration of empiric antifungal therapy, when such infections are suspected, is the norm. Therapy is often prolonged, and outcomes are still suboptimal. The importance of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship cannot be overemphasized.","Nesher, Lior; Rolston, Kenneth V.

The recent development of highly specialized facilities in the United States to assess and treat patients with highly hazardous communicable diseases has led to the design of dedicated laboratories or the redesign of laboratory space to safely process and test specimens that might contain one of these pathogens. For frontline and other acute care facilities to be prepared, safety practices need to be assessed and reviewed as necessary as pertaining to all laboratory activities, to include the pre-analytical (specimen collection and processing), analytical (specimen testing), and post-analytical (specimen disposal/waste management and reporting) processes. Laboratorians and administrative personnel need to consider the risks in handling specimens containing these pathogens and subsequently develop or revise processes to mitigate risks. In addition, issues such as scalability to handle large volume testing, the availability of trained staff, and long-term sustainability to meet the requirements of regulatory agencies need to be adopted within a fiscally responsible budget setting.

The boy has a 12-hour history of a loud cough, slight fever to 101°F, and a hoarse voice. The mother reports that the child had a difficult time sleeping the previous night because of the harsh cough. On examination, the boy is playful and smiling with a temperature of 99°F. It is noticed that he has a seal-like barking cough and subtle evidence of audible stridor.His chest is clear on auscultation with a normal respiratory rate.No chest wall recession is noted. The rest of the exam is unremarkable. The patient is sent home with a suspected upper respiratory infection. Later that evening, the family practitioner receives a phone call from the emergency department informing him that the patient has had worsening respiratory difficulty with visible signs of inspiratory stridor and is being admitted to the hospital for further observation.","Spencer, Jeremy; Mintz, Matthew L.",Disorders of the Respiratory Tract,51,1

The burden of infectious diseases worldwide, related to contamination via contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites), is a growing issue. Globally, these infections are linked to an estimated 1.7 million deaths a year from diarrheal disease and 1.5 million deaths from respiratory infections [1]. Apart from hospitals, the problem has become a growing liability at places where food is prepared and handled [2], where there is a growing risk associated with the cross-contamination of edible goods and where large amounts are handled by a single facility [3]. Already many E. coli and Salmonella outbreaks have been recorded and linked to single a facility [2, 4, 5]. The problem of cross-contamination via surfaces can also be traced, in smaller scale, to households where common areas can accumulate pathogens that can potentially become a threat, especially to more sensitive population groups [6]. There are also biological threats in forms of dangerous epidemic outbreaks (Ebola and SARS) and biological warfare weapons (anthrax and smallpox). The need for effective and efficient disinfection is driving the industry in the development of a wide range of products.

DNA Vaccination To Generate Chikungunya Virus-Specific Immunity,11.401047,7.5703964,2016-12-14,"Science foresight comprises a range of methods to analyze past, present and expected research trends, and uses this information to predict the future status of different fields of science and technology. With the ability to identify high-potential development directions, science foresight can be a useful tool to support the management and planning of future research activities. Science foresight analysts can choose from a rather large variety of approaches. There is, however, relatively little information about how the various approaches can be applied in an effective way. This paper describes a three-step methodological framework for science foresight on the basis of published research papers, consisting of (i) life-cycle analysis, (ii) text mining and (iii) knowledge gap identification by means of automated clustering. The three steps are connected using the research methodology of the research papers, as identified by text mining. The potential of combining these three steps in one framework is illustrated by analyzing scientific literature on wind catchers; a natural ventilation concept which has received considerable attention from academia, but with quite low application in practice. The knowledge gaps that are identified show that the automated foresight analysis is indeed able to find uncharted research areas. Results from a sensitivity analysis further show the importance of using full-texts for text mining instead of only title, keywords and abstract. The paper concludes with a reflection on the methodological framework, and gives directions for its intended use in future studies.","Rezaeian, M.; Montazeri, H.; Loonen, R.C.G.M.",Technol Forecast Soc Change,51,28

Currently, two classes of approaches exist to classify a relation between words (concepts) X and Y: (1) path-based and (2) distributional. While the path-based approaches look at word-paths connecting X and Y in text, the distributional approaches look at statistical properties of X and Y separately, not necessary in the proximity of each other. Here, we suggest how both types can be improved and empirically compare them using several standard benchmarking datasets. For our distributional approach, we are suggesting using an attention-based transformer. While they are known to be capable of supporting knowledge transfer between different tasks, and recently set a number of benchmarking records in various applications, we are the first to successfully apply them to the task of recognizing semantic relations. To improve a path-based approach, we are suggesting our original neural word path model that combines useful properties of convolutional and recurrent networks, and thus addressing several shortcomings from the prior path-based models. Both our models significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art within its type accordingly. Our transformer-based approach outperforms current state-of-the-art by 1–12% points on 4 out of 6 standard benchmarking datasets. This results in 15–40% error reduction and is closing the gap between the automated and human performance by up to 50%. It also needs much less training data than prior approaches. For the ease of re-producing our results, we make our source code and trained models publicly available.","Roussinov, Dmitri; Sharoff, Serge; Puchnina, Nadezhda",Advances in Information Retrieval,51,1

The effects of financial market weakness and the disruption to daily life around the world will trigger lower consumer spending and investment on top of the disruptions to the global supply chain. We now expect global GDP growth to slow to 2.0% this year from 2.6% in 2019, before picking up to 3.0% in 2021. But a global pandemic would lead to a far bigger slowdown this year. ▀ China seems to have made progress in containing the spread of the coronavirus, but the slow return to business as normal has prompted us to cut year‐on‐year GDP growth in Q1 from 3.8% to 2.3%, the weakest in decades. But we expect a healthy growth rebound in Q2 which will also provide Asian economies with a lift. ▀ It is isolation policies not infection rates that determine the economic impact. Outbreaks around the world are leading authorities to announce a growing list of measures to curb the virus spread. At a global level any Q2 rebound will thus be small at best. We expect investment in the advanced economies as a whole to contract on a year‐on‐year basis in Q2 for the first time since the global financial crisis, while annual household spending growth may slow to its lowest since the eurozone crisis. ▀ Our baseline assumes that the global economy will return to business as usual in Q3 and that some catch‐up will result in robust H2 GDP growth. Combined with favourable base effects in early‐2021, this is expected to result in world GDP growth averaging about 3% in 2021. ▀ Since January, we have cut our 2020 global GDP growth forecast by a hefty 0.5pp. But larger revisions may be required if the disruption triggered by shutdowns and other responses to coronavirus proves longer than we assume currently or if more draconian actions are needed in the event of a global pandemic.

Fine mapping of T‐cell surface markers by flow cytometry offers a detailed status of the individual's inflammatory response. The frequency of MT2 (CD4(+)CD45RA(–)CD62L(+)CD11adim) and MT1 (CD4(+)CD45RA(–)CD62L(–)CD11abright) cells in peripheral blood, and their ratio, has been shown to differ predictably in atopics and patients with leprosy, where MT2 correlates with a Th2 phenotype and MT1 with a Th1 phenotype. Stable asthmatics, requiring fluticasone propionate (FP) 750–1000 µg daily or equivalent, were randomized to receive, double‐blinded, either Seretide(®)[salmeterol and fluticasone propionate (SFC, n = 16)] 50 µg/500 µg bd or FP 500 µg bd (n = 17). If asthma was controlled based on lung function and symptoms at clinic visits every 6 weeks, ICS dose was tapered until asthma exacerbated or 0 µg was reached. The frequency and ratio of MT2 and MT1 T cells of the patients was monitored at 6 week intervals. As treatment tapered, the frequency of MT2 cells decreased (P = 0038 from first to final visit), whereas that of MT1 cells increased. The ratio of MT2/MT1 decreased (P = 0049 from first to final visit). In patients receiving LABA + ICS, the fall in MT2/MT1 ratio appeared to be more pronounced than in patients receiving ICS alone. Thus, the MT2 phenotype may be associated with stable asthma, whereas an imminent exacerbation may associate with an increase in the MT1 phenotype. LABA may allow for a greater effect of FP on the MT ratio.","Hoffmann, H. J.; Nielsen, L. P.; Blumberga, G.; Dahl, R.",Scand J Immunol,51,11

Thus, as a critic on blind Modernity, Cortázar, from his stories, questions anthropocentrism in a gesture that in the current crisis of the Anthropocene could not be more topical. Moreover, while he supported the transformation of people’s material conditions of life in Latin America, he innovated and celebrated literature in intermedial texts that are the decanted result of a creative performance, embedded in the strongly transcultural context of a diaspora that was first voluntary and then became exile.","Abrego, Verónica",Neohelicon,51,8

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) can be a life-saving bridging procedure. However its requirements and feasibility of implementation in patients with OHCA, appropriate inclusion criteria and achievable outcomes remain poorly defined. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral university hospital center. PATIENTS: Here we report on characteristics, course and outcomes on the first consecutive 254 patients admitted between August 2014 and December 2017. INTERVENTION: eCPR program for OHCA. MESUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A structured clinical pathway was designed and implemented as 24/7 eCPR service at the Charité in Berlin. In total, 254 patients were transferred with ongoing CPR, including automated chest compression, of which 30 showed or developed ROSC after admission. Following hospital admission predefined in- and exclusion criteria for eCPR were checked; in the remaining 224, 126 were considered as eligible for eCPR. State of the art postresuscitation therapy was applied and prognostication of neurological outcome was performed according to a standardized protocol. Eighteen patients survived, with a good neurological outcome (cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2) in 15 patients. Compared to non-survivors survivors had significantly shorter time between collaps and start of eCPR (58 min (IQR 12–85) vs. 90 min (IQR 74–114), p = 0.01), lower lactate levels on admission (95 mg/dL (IQR 44–130) vs. 143 mg/dL (IQR 111–178), p < 0.05), and less severe acidosis on admission (pH 7.2 (IQR 7.15–7.4) vs. 7.0 (IQR6.9–7.2), p < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis identified latency to eCPR and low pH as independent predictors for mortality. CONCLUSION: An eCPR program can be life-saving for a subset of individuals with refractory circulatory arrest, with time to initiation of eCPR being a main determinant of survival.","Nee, Jens; Koerner, Roland; Zickler, Daniel; Schroeder, Tim; Enghard, Philipp; Nibbe, Lutz; Hasper, Dietrich; Buder, Robert; Leithner, Christoph; Ploner, Christoph J.; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Storm, Christian; Kruse, Jan M.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,51,1

It becomes significantly more difficult when multiple time-steps are to be presented, as the visual clutter quickly increases. Moreover, the challenge to perceive the significant temporal evolution is even greater. In this paper, we present a method to plot temporal high-dimensional data in a static scatterplot; it uses the established PCA technique to project data from multiple time-steps. The key idea is to extend each individual displacement prior to applying PCA, so as to skew the projection process, and to set a projection plane that balances the directions of temporal change and spatial variance. We present numerous examples and various visual cues to highlight the data trajectories, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for visualizing temporal data.","Patashnik, Or; Lu, Min; Bermano, Amit H.; Cohen-Or, Daniel",Comput Vis Media (Beijing),51,31

We aimed to objectively measure differences in mood reports before and after COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in rural older Veterans. Participants age > 62 were enrolled in the Collaborative Aging Research using Technology (CART) initiative, a NIH and VA HSRD funded multi-site study examining the feasibility of unobtrusive remote sensing and monitoring of physical, cognitive, and health-related activities. The VA CART site consists of Pacific Northwest Veteran volunteers and their cohabitants. Weekly online health forms including questions about blue mood and loneliness were collected January – July 2020. A COVID stay-at-home order was instituted March 13 2020. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with logit link was used to investigate differences in mood reports pre- and post- stay-at-home orders. 100 older volunteers completed 2441 health reports (mean age 71.2 years, 41% female, 19% single). Thirty-five percent were urban, 34% large rural, and 31% small rural using rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) scores urban: 1-3; large rural 4-6; small rural 7-10. After adjusting for covariates, incidence of blue mood and loneliness reports were significantly higher after stay-at-home orders (OR=4.4, p<0.0001 and OR=7.2, p<0.0001 respectively). Results varied by rurality with large rural volunteers showing the largest increases. Real-world monitoring of weekly health reports may identify those at greatest risk for depression and social isolation in older Veterans and their cohabitants and is of particular relevance in rural settings, where access to specialty care is limited.","Mattek, Nora; Wall, Rachel; Beattie, Zachary; Wu, Chao-Yi; Kaye, Jeffrey; Dodge, Hiroko; Silbert, Lisa",Innov Aging,51,13

The coronavirus pandemic has prompted a rapid shift to telemedicine. In 2016-2017, only 58% of medical schools in the US offered telemedicine curricula. Thus, a large gap in medical education has emerged. There are specific skills needed to ensure students’ “webside” manner is comparable to their bedside manner.This curriculum was created to train medical students in geriatric-sensitive telemedicine using standardized patients (SP). Methods: A didactic detailing geriatric interviewing preceded the SP encounter. Students were assigned roles for the SP encounter as follows: A) Set agenda, elicit questions, triage problems, perform a history, ensure appropriate lighting and audio B) Perform a geriatric review of systems and reconcile medications C) Present an assessment and plan to the preceptor D) Relay the plan to the SP E) Provide feedback. Students were given pre- and post-surveys to assess their comfort using telemedicine and caring for SP’s >65 years old. Results: Seventeen participants were surveyed (pre-survey=17, post-survey=10). Fifty-nine percent of participants reported no prior experience with telemedicine. Participants reported statistically significant increases in comfort using telemedicine (p=0.022), using telemedicine for patients >65 years old (p<0.001), interviewing patients >65 years old over telemedicine (p=0.007), managing patients over telemedicine (p=0.040), and managing patients >65 years old over telemedicine (p=0.001) after completing the curriculum. Discussion: This virtual curriculum improved medical student comfort with geriatric care and telemedicine and highlights the need for telemedicine curricula in medical schools.","Wilson, Lindsay; Powell, Ross; Foster, Megan; Vogel, Kathleen; Kelley, Casey; Henage, Cristine; Roberts, Ellen; Busby-Whitehead, Jan",Innov Aging,51,1

It is currently recommended that patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears are fast tracked for surgical opinion. However, there is uncertainty about the most clinically and cost-effective intervention for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears and further research is required. SPeEDy will assess the feasibility of a fully powered, multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypothesis that, compared to surgical repair (and usual post-operative rehabilitation), a programme of physiotherapist-led exercise is not clinically inferior, but is more cost-effective for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears. METHODS: SPeEDy is a two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility RCT with integrated Quintet Recruitment Intervention (QRI) and further qualitative investigation of patient experience. A total of 76 patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears will be recruited from approximately eight UK NHS hospitals and randomly allocated to either surgical repair and usual post-operative rehabilitation or a programme of physiotherapist-led exercise. The QRI is a mixed-methods approach that includes data collection and analysis of screening logs, audio recordings of recruitment consultations, interviews with patients and clinicians involved in recruitment, and review of study documentation as a basis for developing action plans to address identified difficulties whilst recruitment to the RCT is underway. A further sample of patient participants will be purposively sampled from both intervention groups and interviewed to explore reasons for initial participation, treatment acceptability, reasons for non-completion of treatment, where relevant, and any reasons for treatment crossover. DISCUSSION: Research to date suggests that there is uncertainty regarding the most clinically and cost-effective interventions for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears. There is a clear need for a high-quality, fully powered, RCT to better inform clinical practice. Prior to this, we first need to undertake a pilot and feasibility RCT to address current uncertainties about recruitment, retention and number of and reasons for treatment crossover.

However, mechanistic proof that reducing pollution may be beneficial to prevent atherothrombotic events is limited. We aimed at appraising the impact of temporary traffic bans in a large metropolitan area on the risk of acute coronary syndromes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Aggregate and anonymized data from 15 tertiary cardiac care centers were obtained detailing pre-coronarivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) daily cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Data on pollutants and climate were sought for the same days. Mixed level regression was used to compare the week before vs. after the traffic ban (Fortnight analysis), the 3 days before vs. after (Weekly analysis) and the Sunday before vs. after (Sunday analysis). A total of 8 days of temporary traffic bans were included, occurring between 2017 and 2020, totaling 802 STEMI and 1196 NSTEMI in the Fortnight analysis, 382 STEMI and 585 in the Weekly analysis, and 148 STEMI and 210 NSTEMI in the Sunday analysis. Fortnight and Sunday analysis did not disclose a significant impact of traffic ban on STEMI or NSTEMI (all P > 0.05). Conversely, Weekly analysis showed non-significant changes for STEMI but a significant decrease in daily NSTEMI when comparing the 3 days before the traffic ban with the ban day (P = 0.043), as well as the 3 days before vs. the 3 days after the ban (P = 0.025). No statistically significant effect of traffic ban was found at Fortnight, Weekly or Sunday analyses for daily mean concentrations of benzene, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM) <2.5 µm or PM < 10 µm (all P > 0.05). However, minimum daily concentrations showed a significant reduction of ozone during the ban in comparison to the week preceding it (P = 0.034), nitric oxide during the ban in comparison to the 3 days preceding it (P = 0.046), and an increase in benzene during the ban in comparison to the Sunday before (P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Temporary traffic bans may favorably reduce coronary atherothrombotic events, and in particular NSTEMI, even if not globally and immediately impacting on environmental pollution. Further controlled studies are required to confirm and expand this hypothesis-generating results.","De Luca, Alessandra; Proietti, Igino; Trani, Carlo; Berni, Andrea; Sergi, Sonia Cristina; Speciale, Giulio; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Tomai, Fabrizio; Di Giosa, Alessandro; Marchegiani, Giada; Zoccai, Giuseppe Biondi; Versaci, Francesco",Eur Heart J Suppl,51,20

Minibeam radiation therapy (MBRT) shows a highly promising reduction of to-xicity in normal tissue, so that very heavy ions, such as Neon (Ne) or Argon (Ar), with extremely high LET, might become applicable to clinical situations. The high LET in the target would be unrivalled to overcome hypoxia, while MBRT might limit the side effects normally preventing the use of those heavy ions in a conventional radiotherapeutic setting. The work reported in this manuscript is the first experimental proof of the remarkable reduction of normal tissue (skin) toxicities after Ne MBRT irradiations as compared to conventional Ne irradiations. This result might allow for a renewed use of very heavy ions for cancer therapy. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: among all types of radiation, very heavy ions, such as Neon (Ne) or Argon (Ar), are the optimum candidates for hypoxic tumor treatments due to their reduced oxygen enhancement effect. However, their pioneering clinical use in the 1970s was halted due to severe side effects. The aim of this work was to provide a first proof that the combination of very heavy ions with minibeam radiation therapy leads to a minimization of toxicities and, thus, opening the door for a renewed use of heavy ions for therapy; (2) Methods: mouse legs were irradiated with either Ne MBRT or Ne broad beams at the same average dose. Skin toxicity was scored for a period of four weeks. Histopathology evaluations were carried out at the end of the study; (3) Results: a significant difference in toxicity was observed between the two irradiated groups. While severe da-mage, including necrosis, was observed in the broad beam group, only light to mild erythema was present in the MBRT group; (4) Conclusion: Ne MBRT is significantly better tolerated than conventional broad beam irradiations.","Prezado, Yolanda; Hirayama, Ryochi; Matsufuji, Naruhiro; Inaniwa, Taku; Martínez-Rovira, Immaculada; Seksek, Olivier; Bertho, Annaïg; Koike, Sachiko; Labiod, Dalila; Pouzoulet, Frederic; Polledo, Laura; Warfving, Nils; Liens, Aléthéa; Bergs, Judith; Shimokawa, Takashi",Cancers (Basel),51,29

Our goal was to introduce a standardised, easily identifiable document for this purpose, with an aim of 90% of medical inpatients having a clear escalation plan discussed and documented. INTERVENTION: We developed a Treatment Escalation Plan (TEP), raised awareness via different platforms and delivered teaching for staff. For baseline and subsequent data collections following interventions, we reviewed the notes of twenty random medical inpatients for decisions regarding escalation, patient involvement in decision making including capacity and specific interventions considered. We also included time taken to find information; documented patient/family discussions and whether a TEP was present. We collected qualitative feedback from staff. IMPROVEMENT: After introduction, TEP was present in 35/60 patients (58%). Improvement was demonstrated across all measured domains when a TEP form was present: escalation decision (no TEP 80%, TEP 100%), discussion with patient/relative (no TEP 4%, TEP 85%), capacity decision regarding escalation (no TEP 52%, TEP 91%), decision on specific interventions (no TEP 12%, TEP 94%), mean time taken to find information (no TEP 84 seconds, TEP 34 seconds). Qualitative feedback from staff was positive, particularly the inclusion of specific care decisions beyond “DNACPR”. DISCUSSION: We felt it was critical to develop a TEP to ensure appropriate decisions are made and clearly documented for medical inpatients, especially in light of COVID-19. In patients with a TEP completed, we observed improvements in all domains, particularly in the involvement of patients/relatives in escalation decisions, which is key to delivering patient-centered care. Implementing a new system in a pandemic had challenges, such as continuity of staffing, however feedback was uniformly positive. This is an ongoing project that will continue to promote TEPs to improve patient care.","Ralston, K; Campbell, A; Alcorn, G",Age Ageing,51,30

However, MHSU among Chinese nurses has seldom been studied. Our study aimed to explore the rate of MHSU among Chinese nurses and to identify the factors associated with MHSU. METHODS: A self-designed anonymous questionnaire was used in this study. MHSU was assessed by the question, “Have you ever used any kind of mental health services, such as mental health outpatient services or psychotherapies, when you felt that your health was suffering due to stress, insomnia, or other reasons?” The answer to the question was binary (yes or no). Sleep quality, burnout, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , the Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 10.94% (301/2750) of the nurses reported MHSU. 10.25% (282/2750) of the nurses had poor sleep quality, burnout and depressive symptoms, and only 26.95% of these nurses reported MHSU.

Thereby, the benefits and ethical issues relating to social media screening, as well as recommendations for its use have been extracted and discussed against Leventhal’s (1980) rules of procedural justice. It turns out that without clear guidelines for recruiters, social media screening cannot be considered procedurally fair, as it opens up way too many opportunities for infringements on privacy, unfair discrimination, and adverse selection based on inaccurate information.

Does greater information on the internet about COVID-19 vaccine access increase the number of vaccines administered? Does greater information about COVID-19 vaccine reliability facilitate vaccine administration? To gauge the COVID-19 related information on the world-wide-web we created two cross-state datasets using Google search. One search dealt with searching for information on vaccination availability and scheduling in each state, while the other search involved information on vaccine reliability and its side effects. The estimation results showed that greater availability of the relevant information on the internet increased vaccine administration rates, and this was true for both types of internet searches, resulting in an affirmative answer to the questions above. In contrast, the diffusion of internet access and the digital divide across states did not have a significant impact on vaccination rates. Whereas supply chain issues have garnered most of the attention in terms of the limitations of quickly vaccinating the public, our results show that internet information might be acting as a (largely unheralded) enabler.","Goel, Rajeev K.; Nelson, Michael A.",J Econ Finan,51,20

In order to illuminate developments that govern the adoption of security technologies and render them in their dependencies comprehensible, we present two plausible and consistent future scenarios for Germany 2035. Following Jasanoff and Kim, these scenarios are theoretically conceived as two competing “sociotechnical imaginaries” which implies different trajectories for shaping the future. In these imaginaries, security technologies condition social change, and vice versa, in a mutually interdependent process. On the basis of current literature in tandem with a structured scenario development process, we condensed the present sociotechnical imaginaries into two tangible future scenarios for the field of public security, illustrating its effects on how we live as a society. Our overarching goal is to identify key factors that will mediate future developments, and, by extension, to facilitate discussion on the type of future we find collectively desirable. The analysis of impact factors resulted in ten key factors that play a crucial role for the use of security technologies and serve as a leverage for shaping the future. Projections of these factors lead to two narrative scenarios “To Be Ahead” and “Turn Back The Clock”.","Gerhold, Lars; Brandes, Edda",Eur J Futures Res,51,1

The RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) plays a critical function in replicating the genome of all RNA viruses and is one of the most intensively studied viral enzyme targets for the development of direct‐acting antiviral therapeutics. Comparisons of recently determined cryo‐EM structures of the SARS CoV‐2 RdRP with crystal structures of calicivirus, picornavirus and flavivirus RdRP's in complex with RNA and nucleoside analogue inhibitors suggest how differences in the sequences and structures of these RdRPs may result in differences in the activity of the enzyme as well as its sensitivity to different inhibitors. Molecular modeling, crystallographic studies and in vitro primer extension assays reveal how chimeric RdRPs bearing different sequence features from the RdRPs of SARS CoV‐2 and human norovirus GII.4 may contribute to differences in polymerase activity and the effects of nucleoside analogue inhibitors. These results suggest how some of the structural features of viral RdRPs may be productively targeted for the design of novel and more potent inhibitors to serve as lead compounds for the development of more effective antiviral therapeutics in the future.","Sharlin, Noga; Campo, Lucas; Rehman, Fasih; Ng, Kenneth",FASEB J,51,1

The main causes are considered to be little knowledge about potential hazards and, as a result, low risk awareness among pupils. OBJECTIVE: We introduce a prevention concept, comprising a serious game and accompanying didactical materials for pupils and teachers. We describe the learning goals, game mechanics and the practical application of the concept in a blended-learning setting. In addition, relevant results of two studies in the course of a concomitant evaluation are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In study 1, prior knowledge and expectations of the target groups were assessed in semistructured interviews (n(Pupils) = 92; n(Teachers) = 9). In study 2, following the development of a game prototype, gameplay experience and attitudes towards using the concept were collected in an online survey (n(Pupils) = 13; n(Teachers) = 8; n(Experts) = 5). RESULTS: Pupils had little knowledge about hazards in ball games at schools. Pupils reported their gameplay experience to be generally positive. Teachers reported generally positive attitudes towards the concept. DISCUSSION: Results from both studies guided the further development of the game and accompanying materials.

Currently, different vaccine formulations, such as viral vector, mRNA, and protein-based, almost all directed toward the spike protein that includes the domain for receptor binding, have been approved. Although data are not conclusive, patients affected by autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) seem to have a slightly higher disease prevalence, risk of hospitalization, and death from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) than the general population. Therefore, ARD patients, under immunosuppressive agents, have been included among the priority target groups for vaccine administration. However, specific cautions are needed to optimize vaccine safety and effectiveness in these patients, such as modification in some of the ongoing immunosuppressive therapies and the preferential use of mRNA other than vector-based vaccines. Immunomodulating agents can be a therapeutic opportunity for the management of COVID-19 patients; however, their clinical impact depends on how they are handled. To place in therapy immunomodulating agents in the correct window of opportunity throughout the identification of surrogate markers of disease progression and host immune response is mandatory to optimize patient’s outcome.","Picchianti Diamanti, Andrea; Rosado, Maria Manuela; Nicastri, Emanuele; Sesti, Giorgio; Pioli, Claudio; Laganà, Bruno",Front Immunol,51,1

The Thai government introduced a ban on alcohol sales and other measures at the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown with gradual lifts. However, drinking behaviors, behaviors of community members, and alcohol marketing activities during the ban and lifts have not been described. METHODS We contracted a survey research firm to conduct four phone-based cross-sectional surveys between April and July 2020 (n = 6239 participants in total). Participants were recruited from all regions and Bangkok. We also summarized alcohol control measures as reported by multiple sources. We analyzed data from Waves 1 thru 4 using descriptive statistics with adjustment for sampling weight. RESULTS A total of 6239 persons participated in the 4 waves of surveys. Among survey respondents who were drinkers, half did not drink alcohol during the alcohol sale ban while one-third reported drinking less than usual in the past 30 days. Almost no participant reported drinking more than usual. During the ban (Wave 1), one-sixth of respondents noticed social drinking in their areas while less than 6 percent reported witnessing alcohol sale. Online parties were the predominant alcohol marketing activity, but became less common during Wave 3 compared to Wave 2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Ever drinkers either abstained from alcohol or drank less than usual during the ban on alcohol sale.

METHODS Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke for visualization. Oxygen flow was gradually increased from 1 to 5 L/min, with the HPS sitting at 45°. The leakage jet plume was revealed by laser light-sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. The experiments were conducted at a double-door, negative pressure isolation room with a dimension of 4.1 × 5.1 × 2.6 m, pressure of -7.4 Pa and 16 air exchanges/h (ACH) (room A). Results were compared with experiments repeated in a smaller isolation room with a dimension of 2.7 × 4.2 × 2.4 m, pressure of -5 Pa and 12 ACH (room B). RESULTS Room A: an exhalation jet spread almost horizontally outward from the nostrils of the HPS to 0.66 m and 1 m towards the end of bed when oxygen flow was increased from 1 to 5 L/min respectively. Room B: there was interaction between the downward ceiling ventilation current and the exhaled air from the HPS, leading to deflection of exhaled smoke towards the head of the HPS at an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min. As oxygen flow was increased gradually to 5 L/min, more room contamination with smoke was noted. CONCLUSIONS Substantial exposure to exhaled air occurs within 1 m towards the end of the bed from patients receiving oxygen via nasal cannula. Room dimension and air exchange rate are important factors in preventing contamination in isolation rooms.","Hui, David S; Chow, Benny K; Chu, Leo; Ng, Susanna S; Lai, Sik-To; Gin, Tony; Chan, Matthew T V",Respirology,51,1

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).","Dyal, Jonathan W; Grant, Michael P; Broadwater, Kendra; Bjork, Adam; Waltenburg, Michelle A; Gibbins, John D; Hale, Christa; Silver, Maggie; Fischer, Marc; Steinberg, Jonathan; Basler, Colin A; Jacobs, Jesica R; Kennedy, Erin D; Tomasi, Suzanne; Trout, Douglas; Hornsby-Myers, Jennifer; Oussayef, Nadia L; Delaney, Lisa J; Patel, Ketki; Shetty, Varun; Kline, Kelly E; Schroeder, Betsy; Herlihy, Rachel K; House, Jennifer; Jervis, Rachel; Clayton, Joshua L; Ortbahn, Dustin; Austin, Connie; Berl, Erica; Moore, Zack; Buss, Bryan F; Stover, Derry; Westergaard, Ryan; Pray, Ian; DeBolt, Meghan; Person, Amy; Gabel, Julie; Kittle, Theresa S; Hendren, Pamela; Rhea, Charles; Holsinger, Caroline; Dunn, John; Turabelidze, George; Ahmed, Farah S; deFijter, Siestke; Pedati, Caitlin S; Rattay, Karyl; Smith, Erica E; Luna-Pinto, Carolina; Cooley, Laura A; Saydah, Sharon; Preacely, Nykiconia D; Maddox, Ryan A; Lundeen, Elizabeth; Goodwin, Bradley; Karpathy, Sandor E; Griffing, Sean; Jenkins, Mary M; Lowry, Garry; Schwarz, Rachel D; Yoder, Jonathan; Peacock, Georgina; Walke, Henry T; Rose, Dale A; Honein, Margaret A",MMWR.

Schacter (1999, 2001) proposed that memory's misdeeds can be classified into seven categories or ""sins"". This article discusses the impact of media and technology on four memory sins, transience (forgetting over time), absent-mindedness (lapses in attention that produce forgetting), misattribution (attributing a memory to the wrong source), and suggestibility (implanted memories). Growing concerns have been expressed about the negative impact of media and technology on memory. With respect to transience, I review research regarding the impact of the Internet (ie, Google), GPS, and photographs. Studies have documented impaired memory following specific tasks on which people rely on media/technology (eg, poor memory for a route after using GPS), but have revealed little evidence for broader impairments (eg, generally impaired memory in GPS users), and have also documented some mnemonic benefits (eg, reviewing photos of past experiences). For absent-mindedness, there is strong evidence that media multitasking is associated with poor memory for a target task (eg, a lecture) because of attentional lapses, suggestive evidence that chronic media multitasking could be associated with broader memory problems, and emerging evidence that technology can help to reduce certain kinds of absent-minded errors. Regarding misattribution and suggestibility, there is clear evidence that manipulated or misleading photos are associated with false memories for personal events and fake news, but no evidence of broader effects on susceptibility to memory distortion. Further study of the impact of media and technology on the memory sins is a fruitful pursuit for interdisciplinary studies.","Schacter, Daniel L","Memory, mind & media",51,12

We hypothesized that multiple breath washout (MBW) could be a valuable tool for such a purpose. Objectives: To compare the ability of MBW lung clearance index with traditional lung function measurements to discriminate between preschool children with well-controlled asthma/persistent wheeze and healthy children. Methods: We investigated 646 children from the COPSAC2010 (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) mother-child cohort, who completed MBW testing with nitrogen, spirometry, and plethysmography before age 6 years. Asthma/persistent wheeze was prospectively diagnosed according to a validated symptom-based algorithm at the COPSAC clinic. Student's t tests and receiver operating characteristic curves were applied to analyze the discriminative ability of the lung function indices. Results: A total of 144 (22.3%) children were diagnosed with asthma/persistent wheeze during their first 6 years of life.

The contribution of walking activity to home and community mobility in PD is poorly understood. METHODS Cross-sectional baseline data (N = 69) were analyzed from a randomized controlled PD trial. The Life-Space Assessment (LSA) quantified the extent, frequency, and independence across 5 expanding levels of home and community mobility, producing individual subscores and a total score. Two additional summed scores were used to represent mobility within (Levels 1-3) and beyond (Levels 4-5) neighborhood limits. An accelerometer measured walking activity for 7 days. Regression and correlation analyses evaluated relationships between daily steps and mobility scores. Mann-Whitney U tests secondarily compared differences in mobility scores between the active and sedentary groups. RESULTS Walking activity contributed significantly to the summed Level 1-3 score (β = 0.001, P = 0.004) but not to the summed Level 4-5 (β = 0.001, P = 0.33) or total (β = 0.002, P = 0.07) scores. Walking activity was significantly related to Level 1 (ρ = 0.336, P = 0.005), Level 2 (ρ = 0.307, P = 0.010), and Level 3 (ρ = 0.314, P = 0.009) subscores. Only the summed Level 1-3 score (P = 0.030) was significantly different between the active and sedentary groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Persons with PD who demonstrated greater mobility beyond the neighborhood were not necessarily more active; walking activity contributed more so to home and neighborhood mobility. Compared with LSA total score, the Level 1-3 summed score may be a more useful participation-level measure for assessing the impact of changes in walking activity.

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.","Willis, Sara; Masel, Joanna",Genetics,51,16

PROCEDURES Included in this retrospective study were 53 patients with endometrial cancers who underwent [18F]-FDG PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) before treatment. Since two different PET scanners were used, post-reconstruction harmonization was performed for all PET parameters using the ComBat harmonization method. Four clinical (age, histological type, stage, and treatment method) and 40 [18F]-FDG PET-based radiomic features were ranked, and a subset of useful features was selected based on the decrease in the Gini impurity in terms of associations with disease progression. The machine learning algorithms (random forest, neural network, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine) were compared using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and validated by the random sampling method. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by the Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The five best predictors of disease progression were coarseness, gray-level run length nonuniformity, stage, treatment method, and gray-level zone length nonuniformity. The kNN model obtained the best performance classifier for predicting the disease progression (AUC =0.890, accuracy =0.849, F1 score =0.848, precision =0.857, and recall =0.849). Coarseness which was the first ranked radiomic feature was selected for survival analyses, and only coarseness remained as a significant and independent factor for both PFS (hazard ratios (HR), 0.65; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.86; p=0.003) and OS (HR, 0.52; 95 % CI, 0.36-0.76; p<0.001) at multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS [18F]-FDG PET-based radiomic analysis using a machine learning approach may be useful for predicting tumor progression and prognosis in patients with endometrial cancers.","Nakajo, Masatoyo; Jinguji, Megumi; Tani, Atsushi; Kikuno, Hidehiko; Hirahara, Daisuke; Togami, Shinichi; Kobayashi, Hiroaki; Yoshiura, Takashi",Molecular imaging and biology,51,27

Respiratory related oscillation (RRO) is derived from rhythmic nasal airflow in the olfactory bulb (OB) and is conveyed to higher order brain networks, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC), where it may potentially contribute to communication between these structures by synchronizing their activities at the respiratory rate. RRO was shown to change with sleep-wake states, it is strongest in quiet waking, somewhat less in active waking, characterized with theta activity in the HC, and absent in sleep. The goal of this study was to test RRO synchronization between PFC and HC under urethane anesthesia where theta and non-theta states spontaneously alternate. We found that in theta states, PFC-HC coherences significantly correlated with OB-HC but not with OB-PFC, even though RRO was stronger in PFC than in HC. In non-theta states, PFC-HC synchrony correlated with coherences connecting OB to either PFC or HC. Thus, similar to freely behaving rats, PFC-HC synchrony at RRO was primarily dependent on the response of HC to the common rhythmic drive, but only in theta state. The findings help outlining the value and the limits of applications in which urethane-anesthetized rats can be used for modeling the neural mechanisms of RRO in behaving animals.","Mofleh, Rola; Kocsis, Bernat",The European journal of neuroscience,51,1

We, therefore, conducted a scoping review on trans men's health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS The review included peer-reviewed articles and conference abstracts, and grey literature published from 1 January 1999 to 5 July 2019 in English, French, Hindi or Spanish and reporting original quantitative and/or qualitative data on the health of trans men or transmasculine persons living in LMIC. Studies were excluded if they did not disaggregate data for trans men or if they only described surgical techniques or laboratory values. RESULTS We included 53 studies (42 peer-reviewed and 11 grey literature) from 19 LMIC. Most were conducted in higher-middle-income countries (n=12) and in Latin America (n=16, 30.2%), the Middle East (n=14, 26.4%) or Sub-Saharan Africa (n=12, 22.6%) and published in 2014 or later (n=44, 83.0%). Approximately half of studies used quantitative methods (52.8%, n=28), of which 64.3% (n=18) had fewer than 50 participants and 14.2% (n=4) had over 150. Across study designs, social determinants of health and gender-affirming care were the most commonly represented domains (49.1% and 47.1% of studies respectively), with common themes including gender-based violence, coercion and discrimination as well as unprescribed hormone use. Other domains represented included mental health (32.1%), sexual and reproductive health (24.5%), general healthcare access (18.9%), physical health (9.4%) and substance use (9.4%). CONCLUSION Greater inclusion and disaggregation of trans men and transmasculine persons in global health research is needed to support sex- and gender-based analyses of trans health. Community-based research approaches and theoretically driven research may help to increase the relevance and rigour of such research. Funders should invest in research on trans men's health in LMIC.","Scheim, Ayden; Kacholia, Vibhuti; Logie, Carmen; Chakrapani, Venkatesan; Ranade, Ketki; Gupta, Shaman",BMJ global health,51,19

Quinalphos is one such widely used organophosphorus pesticide in agricultural fields. Herein, for degradation and mineralization of quinalphos, ZnO nanoflowers and their hybrid nanocomposite with graphene oxide have been synthesized. FESEM analysis confirmed the formation of ZnO nanoflowers over nanosheets of graphene oxide having a thickness of 20 ± 10 nm. GO-ZnO composite exhibited remarkable photocatalytic activity in comparison to pure ZnO. 98 % degradation of quinalphos was achieved using GO-ZnO nano-catalyst at 6 pH within 45 min of irradiations, whereas it was 80 % for bare ZnO nanoflowers. Higher degradation with hybrid nanocomposite was attributed to improved surface area (36 m2 g-1), a substantial reduction in bandgap energy from 3.10 to 2.90 eV and enhanced charge separation (e-/h+ pairs) after the addition of GO. Reaction kinetics study followed pseudo-first-order behaviour. Further, mineralization to the extent of 90 % in 90 min was confirmed by TOC analysis. Based on identified intermediates, using LCMS analysis, degradation pathways were proposed. The plausible pathways confirmed the presence of smaller and safer reaction intermediates supported by excitation of e- from nanocomposite followed by oxidation of quinalphos with huge free radicals. Overall, this study is significant in terms of using photocatalysis as a tertiary treatment of quinalphos pesticide wastewater at pH 6 in a short duration.","Garg, Renuka; Gupta, Renu; Singh, Nirmal; Bansal, Ajay",Chemosphere,51,10

Therefore, in vivo models of inflammation are essential to study the pathophysiology and to evaluate immunomodulatory therapies. Intravenous bolus administration of endotoxin to healthy volunteers is a well-established model of a short-lived systemic inflammatory response, characterized by increased plasma cytokine levels, flu-like symptoms and fever. In contrast, patients suffering from systemic inflammation are often exposed to inflammatory stimuli for an extended period of time. Therefore, continuous infusion of endotoxin may better reflect the kinetics of the inflammatory response encountered in these patients. Herein, we characterize a novel model of systemic inflammation elicited by a bolus infusion of 1 ng/kg, followed by a 3hr continuous infusion of 1 ng/kg/h of endotoxin in healthy volunteers, and compared it with models of bolus administrations of 1 and 2 ng/kg of endotoxin. The novel model was well-tolerated and resulted in a more pronounced increase in plasma cytokine levels with different kinetics and more prolonged symptoms and fever compared with the bolus-only models. Therefore, the continuous endotoxin infusion model provides novel insights into kinetics of the inflammatory response during continuous inflammatory stimuli and accommodates a larger time window to evaluate immunomodulating therapies.","Kiers, D; Koch, R M; Hamers, L; Gerretsen, J; Thijs, E J M; van Ede, L; Riksen, N P; Kox, M; Pickkers, P",Scientific reports,51,1

However, linear incision methods or minimal extraction techniques often do not provide a sufficient surgical view. Therefore, removing large lipomas is often difficult. To present the Z-incision and half Z-incision designs for lipoma extraction, this retrospective study analyzed lipomas surgically excised at our institution between September 2015 and December 2018. The area of surgical field exposed by the Z-incision versus that exposed by the linear incision was calculated using a schematic model. Cure rate, complications, and surgical field area were investigated. A total of 84 lipomas were included. A Z- or half Z-incision was used to treat 30 lipomas, while a linear incision was used to treat 54 lipomas. The mean diameter of the mass in the Z- or half Z-incision group was 47.7 mm (range, 15-160 mm), larger than that in the linear incision group (25.5 mm; range, 7-59 mm) (p < .001). The Z-incision involved making rectangular windows by lifting 2 triangular flaps. According to our mathematical model, the Z-incision provided a larger surgical field area than that provided by the linear incision based on stretched angles (1.81 times larger at 30° and 3.14 times larger at 15°). The Z- and half Z-incisions were successfully performed in all but 1 lipoma (29 lipomas, 96.7%). There was 1 lipoma that resulted in postoperative complications (seroma, 3.3%). The Z-incision design can be a useful alternative technique for the extirpation of lipomas, especially large lipomas.

Australia is a key player in this industry, especially on the east and west coast where humpback whales migrate each year between their breeding and feeding grounds. However, the global whale-watching industry faces uncertainty from changing whale migration patterns, with whales progressively 'arriving' at the traditional whale-watching areas earlier than in previous years/decades. If the whale-watching industry cannot evolve with these changing dynamics then the arrival of the whales might be missed resulting in a potential loss of revenue. This social-ecological issue has suddenly been exacerbated by the disruption to tourism caused by the global pandemic COVID-19. In this study, we use a systems modelling framework, which combines qualitative and quantitative processes, to evaluate the social-ecological system behaviour of the whale-watching industry. We apply this systems approach to the Gold Coast, one of Australia's premier tourist destinations and home to a vibrant whale-watching industry. The outcome of this systems assessment is that the efficacy of the whale-watching industry is affected through determinants of both supply (ability to respond to changes in whale behaviour) and demand (attractiveness of whale-watching). Furthermore, the recovery time of all tourism after COVID-19 will take years if not decades.","Richards, Russell; Meynecke, Jan-Olaf; Sahin, Oz",The Science of the total environment,51,1

Our aim was to provide a morphologic classification that reflects hemorrhage rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively categorized 355 cavernous malformations of 70 children and adolescents according to their morphologic appearance on MR imaging and calculated prospective hemorrhage rates on the basis of survival functions for 255 lesions in 25 patients with a radiologic observation period of >180 days. RESULTS Overall, there were 199 MR imaging examinations with 1558 distinct cavernous malformation observations during a cumulative observation period of 1094.2 lesion-years. The mean hemorrhage rate of all 355 cavernous malformations was 4.5% per lesion-year. According to Kaplan-Meier survival models, Zabramski type I and II cavernous malformations had a significantly higher hemorrhage rate than type III and IV lesions. The presence of acute or subacute blood-degradation products was the strongest indicator for an increased hemorrhage risk (P = .036, Cox regression): The mean annual hemorrhage rate and mean hemorrhage-free interval for cavernous malformations with and without signs of acute or subacute blood degradation products were 23.4% and 22.6 months and 3.4% and 27.9 months, respectively. Dot-sized cavernous malformations, visible in T2* and not or barely visible in T1WI and T2WI sequences, had a mean annual hemorrhage rate of 1.3% and a mean hemorrhage-free interval of 37.8 months. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to predict hemorrhage rates based on the Zabramski classification. Our findings imply a tripartite classification distinguishing lesions with and without acute or subacute blood degradation products and dot-sized cavernous malformations.","Nikoubashman, O; Di Rocco, F; Davagnanam, I; Mankad, K; Zerah, M; Wiesmann, M",AJNR.

The patient gradually improved and was weaned from the ventilator and discharged alive from the ICU on day 63. INTERPRETATION This case report concerns one patient with clinical improvement after convalescent plasma transfusion. A SARS-CoV-2 test was not performed immediately before transfusion and the complexity of intensive care treatment makes it difficult to draw any conclusions on the potential effectiveness of this treatment. However, this case report is encouraging with regard to planned trials with convalescent plasma.","Hahn, Michael; Condori, Maria Elena Huanca; Totland, Atle; Kristoffersen, Einar K; Hervig, Tor Audun","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",51,1

This study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of CXR, with emphasis on its predictive value, for severe COVID-19 disease. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, 358 chest radiographs were performed on 109 COVID-19 patients (median age 44.4 years, 58 males and 30 with comorbidities) admitted between 22 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Each CXR was reviewed and scored by three radiologists in consensus using a 72-point COVID-19 Radiographic Score (CRS). Disease severity was determined by the need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Results Patients who needed supplemental oxygen (n=19, 17.4%) were significantly older (P<0.001) and significantly more of them had co-morbidities (P=0.011). They also had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (P<0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P<0.001), lower lymphocyte count (P<0.001) and lower hemoglobin (Hb) (P=0.001). Their initial (CRSinitial) and maximal CRS (CRSmax) were higher (P<0.001). Adjusting for age and baseline hemoglobin, the AUROC of CRSmax (0.983) was as high as CRPmax (0.987) and higher than the AUROC for lymphocyte countmin (0.897), and LDHmax (0.900). The AUROC for CRSinitial was slightly lower (0.930). CRSinitial ≥5 had a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 92% in predicting the need for oxygen, and 73% sensitivity and 88% specificity in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. CRS between the 6th and 10th day from the onset of symptoms (CRSD6-10) ≥5 had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 95% in predicting the need for oxygen, and 100% sensitivity and 86% specificity in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Adjusting for key confounders of age and baseline Hb, CRSmax performed comparable to or better than laboratory markers in the diagnosis of severe disease. CXR performed between the 6th and 10th days from symptom onset was a better predictor of severe disease than CXR performed earlier at presentation. A benign clinical course was seen in CXR that were normal or had very mild abnormalities.","Hui, Terrence C H; Khoo, Hau Wei; Young, Barnaby E; Haja Mohideen, Salahudeen Mohamed; Lee, Yeong Shyan; Lim, Chien Joo; Leo, Yee Sin; Kaw, Gregory J L; Lye, David C; Tan, Cher Heng",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,51,1

In high-resolution metagenomics, bacterial strains can now be resolved, enhancing medical microbiology and the description of microbial evolution in vivo. In the Hildebrand lab, we are researching novel approaches to further increase the phylogenetic resolution of metagenomics. I propose that ultra-resolution metagenomics will be the next qualitative level of community sequencing, classified by the accurate resolution of ultra-rare genetic events, such as subclonal mutations present in all populations of evolving cells. This will be used to quantify evolutionary processes at ecologically relevant scales, monitor the progress of infections within a patient, and accurately track pathogens in food and infection chains. However, to develop this next metagenomic generation, we first need to understand the currently imposed limits of sequencing technologies, metagenomic strain delineation, and genome reconstructions.","Hildebrand, Falk",mSystems,51,31

Currently used rodent models have yielded little clinical success, however large animal models may provide a more suitable alternative to improve clinical translation. We sought to develop a model of acute proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke in sheep, including both permanent occlusion and transient occlusion with reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS 18 adult male and female Merino sheep were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 6/gp): 1) sham surgery; 2) permanent proximal MCA occlusion (MCAO); or 3) temporary MCAO with aneurysm clip. All animals had invasive arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen monitoring. At 4 h following vessel occlusion or sham surgery animals were killed by perfusion fixation. Brains were processed for histopathological examination and infarct area determination. 6 further animals were randomized to either permanent (n = 3) or temporary MCAO (n = 3) and then had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 h after MCAO. RESULTS Evidence of ischemic injury in an MCA distribution was seen in all stroke animals. The ischemic lesion area was significantly larger after permanent (28.8%) compared with temporary MCAO (14.6%). Sham animals demonstrated no evidence of ischemic injury. There was a significant reduction in brain tissue oxygen partial pressure after permanent vessel occlusion between 30 and 210 mins after MCAO. MRI at 4 h demonstrated complete proximal MCA occlusion in the permanent MCAO animals with a diffusion deficit involving the whole right MCA territory, whereas temporary MCAO animals demonstrated MRA evidence of flow within the right MCA and smaller predominantly cortical diffusion deficits. CONCLUSIONS Proximal MCAO can be achieved in an ovine model of stroke via a surgical approach. Permanent occlusion creates larger infarct volumes, however aneurysm clip application allows for reperfusion.","Wells, Adam J; Vink, Robert; Blumbergs, Peter C; Brophy, Brian P; Helps, Stephen C; Knox, Steven J; Turner, Renée J",PloS one,51,1

Meanwhile, according to the analysis of microstructure, there are two failure modes that were observed at different stress ratios (R = -1 and 0.1), including surface crack failure and internal crack failure, respectively. Besides, the theoretical threshold value of the crack growth is compared with the calculated value of the fracture surface. To decrease the difference between the threshold value of internal crack initiation and the corresponding theoretical value, a new model for the crack growth threshold of the interior-induced fracture at different stress ratios is proposed and discussed.","Wang, Quanyi; Chen, Yao; Liu, Yongjie; Wang, Chong; Li, Lang; He, Chao; Gong, Xiufang; Wang, Tianjian; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Qingyuan; Zhang, Hong",Materials,51,1

Although previous studies have showed that NH3 caused kidney injury, the molecular mechanisms of nephrotoxicity induced by NH3 remain unclear. To explore the mechanisms of NH3 nephrotoxicity, a total of 36 broiler chicks at one day of age were exposed to NH3. After 42 days of exposure, blood samples were collected to determine creatinine and uric acid; and kidney samples were weighted and then collected to detect ultrastructural changes, oxidative stress parameters, ATPases, necroptosis- and mitochondrial dynamics-related genes. The results showed that chickens exposed to NH3 showed lower relative kidney weight and an increase concentration in serum creatinine and uric acid. NH3 exposure caused nephrocyte necrosis and increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes (TNF-α, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and JNK). Besides, the activities of antioxidant systems (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and T-AOC) were reduced, whereas the concentrations of H2O2 and MDA were elevated. Lower activities of ATPases were obtained in NH3 treatment groups. Furthermore, the mitochondrial fission-related genes drp1 and mff were activated, and mitochondrial fusion-related genes opa1, mfn1 and mfn2 were suppressed after NH3 exposure. Based on the above results, we conclude that NH3 caused-oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated nephrocyte necroptosis in chickens. This study may provide new insight into NH3 nephrotoxicity.","Han, Qi; Zhang, Jingyang; Sun, Qi; Xu, Yanmin; Teng, Xiaohua",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,51,19

RECENT FINDINGS Although high-flow nasal oxygen has shown promising results in patients with de-novo acute respiratory failure, further large clinical trials are needed to determine the best oxygenation strategy. As NIV may have deleterious effects, especially in patients generating strong inspiratory efforts, protective NIV using higher levels of positive-end expiratory pressure, more prolonged sessions and additional interfaces such as helmets should be assessed in the future. Whereas NIV is the first-line ventilation strategy in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, high-flow nasal oxygen could be an alternative to NIV after partial reversal of respiratory acidosis. To prevent severe hypoxemia during intubation of hypoxemic patients or to prevent postextubation respiratory failure in patients at high-risk of reintubation, NIV is the best strategy for preoxygenation or immediately after extubation in ICUs. SUMMARY New large-scale clinical trials are needed to compare high-flow nasal oxygen with standard oxygen in patients with de-novo acute respiratory failure to determine the reference treatment. After which, more protective NIV could be assessed among the more severe patients.","Thille, Arnaud W; Coudroy, Rémi; Frat, Jean-Pierre",Current opinion in critical care,51,1

However, the effects of high volumes of iodixanol on renal function after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not been fully elucidated. This study evaluates the effects of high-dose (>300 mL) iodixanol on renal function within 72 hours of PCI. We retrospectively reviewed 676 consecutive patients who received high-dose (>300 mL) iodixanol during PCI between October 2015 and December 2017 in 4 centers. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant independent predictors for CI-AKI. The incidence of CI-AKI was 3.5% (23/651). In patients administered 300 to 500 mL and >500 mL iodixanol, the incidence of CI-AKI was 3.9% and 1.7%, respectively. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of CI-AKI was 2.6%. In high-risk and very high-risk patients, stratified by the Mehran risk score, the incidence of CI-AKI was 3.3% and 4.3%, respectively. In patients received high-dose iodixanol (>300 mL), logistic regression analysis demonstrated that female sex, chronic kidney disease, and eGFR were independent risk factors for CI-AKI, but contrast volume was not. The administration of high (300-500 mL) and very high (>500 mL) dose of iodixanol is associated with low rates of CI-AKI.","Zhao, Ning; Chen, Zaiyan; Zhou, Yinpin; Xu, Qiang; Xu, Zhonglin; Tong, Wuyang; Li, Lufeng; Mao, Qi; Song, Yaoming; Jin, Jun; Huang, Lan; Azzalini, Lorenzo; Zhao, Xiaohui",Angiology,51,1

American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend IA screening, but appropriate age and interval of screening and its effectiveness remain a critical knowledge gap. METHODS AND RESULTS To evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography screening for IA in patients with coarctation of the aorta, we developed and calibrated a Markov model to match published IA prevalence estimates. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included lifetime cumulative incidence of prophylactic IA treatment and mortality and SAH deaths prevented. Using a payer perspective, a lifetime horizon, and a willingness-to-pay of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, we applied a 3% annual discounting rate to costs and effects and performed 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In a simulated cohort of 10 000 patients, no screening resulted in a 10.1% lifetime incidence of SAH and 183 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years led to 978 prophylactic treatments for unruptured aneurysms, 19 procedure-related deaths, and 65 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective compared with screening at ages 10 and 20 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $106 841/quality-adjusted life-year). Uncertainty in the outcome after aneurysm treatment and quality of life after SAH influenced the preferred screening strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective in 41% of simulations and at ages 10 and 20 in 59% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS Our model supports the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendation to screen patients with coarctation of the aorta for IA and suggests screening at ages 10 and 20 or at 10, 20, and 30 years would extend life and be cost-effective.","Pickard, Sarah S; Prakash, Ashwin; Newburger, Jane W; Malek, Adel M; Wong, John B",Circulation.

ME/CFS is often triggered by an infectious episode and associated with an aberrant immune system. Here we report that ME/CFS is a disorder characterized by skewed B cell receptor gene usage. By applying a next-generation sequencing to determine the clone-based IGHV/IGHD/IGHJ repertoires, we revealed a biased usage of several IGHV genes in peripheral blood B cells from ME/CFS patients. Results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis further indicated a possibility of distinguishing patients from healthy controls, based on the skewed B cell repertoire. Meanwhile, B cell clones using IGHV3-30 and IGHV3-30-3 genes were more frequent in patients with an obvious infection-related episode at onset, and correlated to expression levels of interferon response genes in plasmablasts. Collectively, these results imply that B cell responses in ME/CFS are directed against an infectious agents or priming antigens induced before disease onset.","Sato, Wakiro; Ono, Hirohiko; Matsutani, Takaji; Nakamura, Masakazu; Shin, Isu; Amano, Keiko; Suzuki, Ryuji; Yamamura, Takashi","Brain, behavior, and immunity",51,16

METHODS A 3-in polyvinyl chloride pipe with an attached 100 mL saline bag to the outer surface was used to simulate a human forearm. A pressure transducer was attached to the bag and connected to a monitor providing continuous pressure measurements. Either a circumferential fiberglass cast or single-sided plaster splint was applied around the bag. To simulate the dressing's compliance to soft tissue swelling, change in pressure was measured after 25 mL of saline was injected into the bag. Compliance was determined by calculating change in volume over change in pressure as volume was added. RESULTS In our 150 mL model, cast bivalving reduced pressure up to 28%, and splitting the cotton padding of a splint reduced pressures up to 33%. The mean compliance (ability to accommodate swelling) across all volume intervals was 182% greater in a bivalved cast versus a cast and 21% greater in a cotton-split splint versus a splint. Below-dressing pressure of a tightly wrapped elastic bandage was up to 2.76× greater than a medium tension bandage and up to 6.44× greater than a loosely applied bandage. A splint with real cotton padding had a 28% greater pressure than a splint with synthetic soft-roll padding. CONCLUSIONS Splitting a dressing, utilizing synthetic cotton padding, and applying an elastic bandage cautiously can help reduce surface pressures and allow the construct to be more accommodating to soft tissue swelling.","Adapa, Nikhil; Goyal, Kanu S",Hand,51,1

Today, no drug is approved to improve respiratory muscle function in these patients. Previously, we have shown that the calcium sensitizer levosimendan improves calcium sensitivity of human diaphragm muscle fibers in vitro and contractile efficiency of the diaphragm in healthy subjects. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of levosimendan on diaphragm contractile efficiency in mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial, mechanically ventilated patients performed two 30-min continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) trials with 5-h interval. After the first CPAP trial, study medication (levosimendan 0.2 µg/kg/min continuous infusion or placebo) was administered. During the CPAP trials, electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and flow were measured. Neuromechanical efficiency (primary outcome parameter) was calculated. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. Neuromechanical efficiency was not different during the CPAP trial after levosimendan administration compared to the CPAP trial before study medication. Tidal volume and minute ventilation were higher after levosimendan administration (11 and 21%, respectively), whereas EAdi and Pdi were higher in both groups in the CPAP trial after study medication compared to the CPAP trial before study medication. CONCLUSIONS Levosimendan does not improve diaphragm contractile efficiency.","Roesthuis, Lisanne; van der Hoeven, Hans; Sinderby, Christer; Frenzel, Tim; Ottenheijm, Coen; Brochard, Laurent; Doorduin, Jonne; Heunks, Leo",Intensive care medicine,51,11

A dohányzás káros hatásainak vizsgálata hosszú ideje az orvostudomány egyik legintenzívebben kutatott területe. A nagy tudományos érdeklődésnek köszönhetően ma már meggyőző evidenciák állnak rendelkezésre a hagyományos cigaretta használatának számos negatív hatásáról. Ezzel ellentétben a sokkal később bevezetett helyettesítő termékek veszélyeiről lényegesen kevesebbet tudunk. E körbe tartozik a manapság egyre népszerűbb elektromos cigaretta is, amelyre egyre több, egészségügyi kockázatot felmérő munka fókuszál. Ugyanakkor a több évszázados múltra visszatekintő és a világ bizonyos helyein sokáig népszerű vízipipa érdekes esetnek számít, mivel használóinak száma a nyugati világban az utóbbi időben megugrott, de az emberre gyakorolt hatása számos ponton még vita tárgyát képezi. A jelen munka célja, hogy a hazai és a nemzetközi szakirodalom alapján feltérképezze a hagyományos cigaretta, az elektromos cigaretta és a vízipipa fontosabb egészségügyi hatásait, és rámutasson azokra a kapcsolódó területekre, ahol további kutatások szükségesek. A szakirodalmi áttekintés során a különböző publikációs adatbázisokban fellelhető tudományos cikkeket elemeztük. A megvizsgált szakirodalom alapján a tartós dohányzásnak bizonyítottan a szív-ér rendszert és a légzőrendszert károsító hatása van, de növekvő számú bizonyíték utal a neurológiai káros hatásokra és a gasztroenterológiai hatásokra is. Ugyanakkor az elektromos cigaretta és a vízipipa esetében a bizonyított akut hatások mellett a hosszú távú hatásokat illetően további intenzív kutatásokra van szükség. Az elektromos cigaretta és a vízipipa esetében a hosszú távú hatások kapcsán a meggyőző evidencia hiánya semmiképpen nem jelenti azt, hogy ezen termékeket kockázatmentesnek kellene tekinteni, sőt a pulmonológusoknak és a döntéshozóknak mindent meg kell tenniük annak érdekében, hogy valamennyi dohánytermék törvényi szabályozása azok használatának visszaszorítását célozza.

However, much less is known about the replacement products such as electronic cigarettes. Moreover, the effects of waterpipes are also not fully explored, in spite of their long history. The scope of the present work is to survey the open literature to map the knowledge related to the health effects of conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes and waterpipes. The analysis of the related scientific literature was performed based on papers retrieved in large publication repositories. Based on the reviewed literature, long-term smoking has demonstrated adverse effects on the respiratory as well as the heart and circulatory systems. In addition, the correlation between cigarette smoking and some gastroenterological and neurological diseases is also increasingly evident. By the same token, though the acute effects of e-cigarette and waterpipe are well documented, the protracted effects are still to be explored. The lack of pertinent information regarding the late effects of e-cigarette and hookah does not imply that there is no health risk associated with their consumption. On the contrary, in addition to the regular antismoke measures, pulmonologists and policy makers should do everything to lower the consumption of these alternative products.

The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date systematic evaluation of the effect of weight loss interventions incorporating MR compared with alternative interventions on weight change at 1 year in adults with overweight or obesity. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to the end of August 2018 for randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of MR with interventions that did not include MR on weight at 1 year. We excluded studies using diets providing <3347 kJ/(800 kcal)/day and those which used total diet replacement (TDR) from this review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Twenty-three studies with 7884 adult participants were included. Six out of 23 studies were judged at low risk of bias across all domains, and 5/23 studies were judged at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Studies with similar intervention and comparators were grouped into five comparisons for analysis. Mean weight change at 1 year favoured the MR group relative to the control group in each comparison. In those comparisons where we conducted meta-analysis, in people assigned to a diet incorporating MR, mean difference was -1.44 kg (-2.48 to -0.39 kg; I2 = 38%) compared with alternative kinds of diets. In those assigned to a MR diet along with support, mean difference was -2.22 kg (-3.99 to -0.45, I2 = 81%) compared with other diets with support and -3.87 kg (-7.34 to -0.40; I2 = 60%) compared with other kinds of diet without support. In those assigned a MR diet with an enhanced level of support, mean difference was -6.13 kg (-7.35 to -4.91, I2 = 19%) compared with alternative diets and regular support. Programmes incorporating meal replacements led to greater weight loss at 1 year than comparator weight loss programmes and should be considered as a valid option for management of overweight and obesity in community and health care settings.","Astbury, Nerys M; Piernas, Carmen; Hartmann-Boyce, Jamie; Lapworth, Sophia; Aveyard, Paul; Jebb, Susan A",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,51,12

METHODS Eight untrained individuals completed an 8-wk aerobic training program immediately followed by 8 d of hot/humid (38°C, 65%RH) heat acclimation. Participants completed a humidity ramp protocol pretraining (PRE-TRN), posttraining (POST-TRN), and after heat acclimation (POST-HA), involving treadmill marching at a heat production of 450 W for 105 min in 37.5°C, 2.0 kPa (35%RH). After attaining a steady-state esophageal temperature (Tes), humidity increased 0.04 kPa·min. An upward inflection in Tes indicated the upper limit of physiological compensability (Pcrit), which was then used to quantify ωmax. Local sweat rate, activated sweat gland density, and sweat gland output on the back and arm were simultaneously measured throughout. RESULTS Peak aerobic capacity increased POST-TRN by approximately 14% (PRE-TRN: 45.8 ± 11.8 mL·kg·min; POST-TRN: 52.0 ± 11.1 mL·kg·min, P < 0.001). ωmax values became progressively greater from PRE-TRN (0.72 ± 0.06) to POST-TRN (0.84 ± 0.08; P = 0.02), to POST-HA (0.95 ± 0.05; P = 0.03). These shifts in ωmax were facilitated by a progressively greater local sweat rate and activated sweat gland density from PRE-TRN (0.84 ± 0.21 mg·cm·min; 67 ± 20 glands per square centimeter) to POST-TRN (0.96 ± 0.21 mg·cm·min, P = 0.03; 86 ± 27 glands per square centimeter; P = 0.009), to POST-HA (1.15 ± 0.21 mg·cm·min; P < 0.001; 98 ± 35 glands per square centimeter; P < 0.001). No differences in sweat gland output were observed. CONCLUSIONS A greater ωmax occurred after 8 wk of aerobic training, but ωmax was further augmented with heat acclimation, indicating only a partially increased heat loss capacity with training. These ωmax values may assist future predictions of heat stress risk in untrained/trained unacclimated individuals and trained heat-acclimated individuals.","Ravanelli, Nicholas; Coombs, Geoff B; Imbeault, Pascal; Jay, Ollie",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,51,24

In young adulthood (ages 18-25), dynamic transitions in education, employment, family and housing complicate the measurement of socioeconomic circumstances. To better understand approaches to capturing these circumstances, this methodological systematic review examined how socioeconomic characteristics used to identify social inequalities in smoking among young adults are measured. DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ERIC and Sociological Abstracts, and used three prior reviews. We updated the search in March 2018. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently screened peer-reviewed records from OECD countries published in English, French, German or Spanish after 1995 whose samples covered at least 1 year between the ages of 18 and 25. We included 89 of 1320 records. DATA EXTRACTION One reviewer extracted study characteristics, indicators used to operationalise socioeconomic circumstances and each indicator's relation to results on smoking (ie, significance and direction). We found 39 indicators of socioeconomic circumstances related to six broad domains. These indicators were used in 425 results. DATA SYNTHESIS We descriptively analysed the extracted data using evidence tables. Educational attainment was most common. Evidence of inequalities varied by indicator used. For example, there was inconsistent evidence regarding the role of parental characteristics and transition stages and insufficient evidence regarding personal income on smoking. CONCLUSION Despite its importance, studies have disproportionally examined inequalities among young adults using traditional indicators. The mismatch between young adults' life transitions and measurement strategies may attenuate evidence of inequalities. We suggest strategies to improve future measurement.","Gagné, Thierry; Lee, Joseph G L; Steinmetz-Wood, Madeleine; Frohlich, Katherine L",Tobacco control,51,8

METHODS Japan DMAT dispatched and managed the medical operation for DP passengers and crew members. The records of communication logs for the DMAT were evaluated. RESULTS 472 DMAT members were responded. DMAT took 3 to 4 days to manage patients due to a lack of medical supplies at the early phase of operation. The prescription was delayed for prescription required passengers that include passengers who will be in critical health conditions without prescriptions. DMAT conducted a strategic operation and developed categorization for medical care and patient transport. Eventually, DMAT constructed flow to provide rapid medical care and prescription distributions for passengers and crew members. CONCLUSION DMAT has been required to respond to unforeseen disasters in the framework since the Fukushima Nuclear Plant accident in 2011. All the past several types of disaster response were contributed to managing medical operations at the DP. These operations are thought to reduce preventable deaths from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Kondo, Hisayoshi; Koido, Yuichi; Kohayagawa, Yoshitaka; Anan, Hideaki",American journal of disaster medicine,51,16

Very limited data are available on benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised patients and in particular in solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as they were excluded from phase III trials. This review summarizes current knowledge, international guidelines and controversies regarding COVID-19 vaccination in these vulnerable populations. RECENT FINDINGS Various COVID-19 vaccine platforms showed good efficacy in phase III trials in the immunocompetent and there are data arising on the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in the immunocompromised population. SUMMARY Transplant recipients could benefit significantly from COVID-19 vaccination, both through active immunization provided they elicit protective vaccine responses, and probably through cocooning by immunization of caregivers and healthcare personnel and thus reducing the risk of SARS-coronavirus-2 exposure. Although awaiting more data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to inform potential adaptations of vaccine regimens, we strongly recommend prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination of solid and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to decrease COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.","Eberhardt, Christiane S; Balletto, Elisa; Cornberg, Markus; Mikulska, Malgorzata",Current opinion in infectious diseases,51,7

However, the optimal timing of performing carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in these patients remains unclear amid concerns for an elevated risk of perioperative complications. The primary outcome of this study was the combined incidence of major perioperative complications (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), death) based on timing of CAS relative to symptom onset. METHODS A prospectively maintained database of all neuroendovascular procedures at our hospital was searched for consecutive cases of extracranial internal CAS procedures performed for symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis between January 2009 and January 2012. Rates of perioperative complications including 30-day stroke, MI and death were assembled in a total of 221 patients. RESULTS The primary outcome was not statistically different among groups stratified based on intervention timing, with a combined incidence of stroke, MI or death of 7.1% in patients treated within 2 days, 4.5% in patients treated between days 3 and 7, 2.8% in patients treated between days 8 and 14 and 3.7% in patients treated between days 15 and 90 (p=0.749, Fisher exact test). CONCLUSIONS Our results support the conclusion that early CAS (within 2 days) carries no additional risks compared with CAS after 2 days or any other timing of the intervention up to 90 days. Early CAS may represent a reasonable option for acute revascularization to minimize the risk of perioperative stroke and overall perioperative complications.","Wach, Michael M; Dumont, Travis M; Mokin, Maxim; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,51,1

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an abundant metabolic enzyme that is recruited to the replicase complex of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and affects asymmetric viral RNA synthesis. To further our understanding on the role of GAPDH in TBSV replication, we used an in vitro TBSV replication assay based on recombinant p33 and p92(pol) viral replication proteins and cell-free yeast extract. We found that the addition of purified recombinant GAPDH to the cell extract prepared from GAPDH-depleted yeast results in increased plus-strand RNA synthesis and asymmetric production of viral RNAs. Our data also demonstrate that GAPDH interacts with p92(pol) viral replication protein, which may facilitate the recruitment of GAPDH into the viral replicase complex in the yeast model host. In addition, we have identified a dominant negative mutant of GAPDH, which inhibits RNA synthesis and RNA recruitment in vitro. Moreover, this mutant also exhibits strong suppression of tombusvirus accumulation in yeast and in virus-infected Nicotiana benthamiana. Overall, the obtained data support the model that the co-opted GAPDH plays a direct role in TBSV replication by stimulating plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase.","Huang, Tyng-Shyan; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,51,23

In Version 1, the coercive tactic (use/threat of physical force, exploitation of the inability to resist, verbal pressure) was presented first, and sexual acts (sexual touch, attempted and completed sexual intercourse, other sexual acts) were presented as subsequent questions. In Version 2, sexual acts were presented first, and coercive tactics as subsequent questions. No version effects emerged for overall perpetration rates reported by men and women. The overall victimization rate across all items was significantly higher in the tactic-first than in the sexual-act-first conditions for women, but not for men. Classifying participants by their most severe experience of sexual victimization showed that fewer women were in the nonvictim category and more men were in the nonconsensual sexual contact category when the coercive tactic was presented first.

Citric acid/zwitterionic surfactant (CAZS) has been shown to have significant efficacy at in vitro biofilm eradication. Unique hydrodebrider systems have been shown to have effective antibiofilm efficacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CAZS/hydrodebrider treatment on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in the sheep model of CRS. METHODS Forty-two sheep frontal sinuses were inoculated with S. aureus, followed by 7 days of biofilm growth. Sinuses were randomized to one of nine treatment groups: control, hydrodebrider with saline or CAZS (killed on day 0 or day 7 posttreatment), CAZS, or saline flush (killed on day 0 or day 7 posttreatment). Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) was used to confirm extent of biofilm reduction. Samples of each sinus were taken, assessing cilia morphology using electron microscopy. RESULTS A mean of 37.22 ± 9.65% of control (no treatment) CSLM images taken showed biofilms. Both CAZS flush and CAZS/hydrodebrider treatments showed initial improvements in biofilms but biofilm regrowth followed treatment, 14.74 ± 9.58% to 18.91 ± 12.14% and 15.60 ± 13.92% to 24.70 ± 3.66%, respectively (p > 0.05). Saline/hydrodebrider treatments showed a nonsignificant improvement in biofilm treatment, which was maintained, 18.34 ± 11.85% to 12.04 ± 10.28% (p > 0.05). Cilial morphology grade was significantly worse in the CAZS treatment groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION CAZS solution (with and without a hydrodebrider system) can significantly adversely affect cilia morphology. The hydrodebrider system, when combined with saline, may be a useful treatment adjunct for mucosal biofilms.","Valentine, Rowan; Jervis-Bardy, Josh; Psaltis, Alkis; Tan, Lor Wai; Wormald, Peter-John",American journal of rhinology & allergy,51,24

METHOD Out of 99 participants of an online survey, 44 individuals reported prior mental health-related inpatient treatment. Patients were asked about their levels of psychological distress and adaptation of lifestyle and activities of daily living. RESULTS Individuals with a psychiatric history were significantly more psychologically distressed (p < 0.001; d = 1.68) and displayed significantly less behavioral adaptation than healthy controls (p = 0.012; d = -0.52) in response to the changed circumstances. The difference in behavioral adaptation accounted for 21 % of the difference in psychological distress.

Background During the most difficult phases of the Covid-19 he-alth emergency, when access to the usual work location was not allowed due to the constraints related to the pandemic, Smart Working enabled business continuity in the face of the ongoing health emergency. Mo-dern technology serves a new way of working, allowing workers to effectively manage their professional and personal spheres in a world that increasingly requires them to optimize their time. The main objective of this research is to validate a Smart Working questionnaire administered to healthcare workers. Methods The questionnaire, reported in Annex I, consisting of 30 questions and submitted electronically through Google Forms, was administered in Italian to healthcare personnel of the Teaching hospi-tal Umberto I and Sapienza University of Rome between September and October 2020. The questionnaire analyzed the characteristics of the sample and investigated the perception and attitude of healthcare personnel towards seven different aspects of Smart Working.

In our previous work (Denesyuk AI, Johnson MS, Salo-Ahen OMH, Uversky VN, Denessiouk K. Int J Biol Macromol. 2020;153:399-411), we described a universal three-dimensional (3D) structural motif, NBCZone, that contains eleven amino acids: dipeptide 42 T-43 T, pentapeptide 54 T-55 T-56 T-57 T(base)-58 T, tripeptide 195 T(nucleophile)-196 T-197 T and residue 213 T (T - numeration of amino acids in trypsin). The comparison of the NBCZones among the members of the (chymo)trypsin-like protease family suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups. Within each group, the NBCZones incorporate an identical set of conserved interactions and bonds. In the present work, the structural environment of the catalytic acid at the position 102 T and the fourth member of the ""catalytic tetrad"" at the position 214 T was analyzed in 169 3D structures of proteinases with the (chymo)trypsin-like serine/cysteine fold. We have identified a complete Structural Catalytic Core (SCC) consisting of two classes and four groups. The proteinases belonging to different classes and groups differ from each other by the nature of the interaction between their N- and C-terminal β-barrels. Comparative analysis of the 3CLpro(s) from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, used as an example, showed that the amino acids at positions 103 T and 179 T affect the nature of the interaction of the ""catalytic acid"" core (102 T-Core, N-terminal β-barrel) with the ""supplementary"" core (S-Core, C-terminal β-barrel), which ultimately results in the modulation of the enzymatic activity. The reported analysis represents an important standalone contribution to the analysis and systematization of the 3D structures of (chymo)trypsin-like serine/cysteine fold proteinases. The use of the developed approach for the comparison of 3D structures will allow, in the event of the appearance of new representatives of a given fold in the PDB, to quickly determine their structural homologues with the identification of possible differences.","Denesyuk, Alexander I; Permyakov, Sergei E; Johnson, Mark S; Permyakov, Eugene A; Uversky, Vladimir N; Denessiouk, Konstantin",International journal of biological macromolecules,51,27

The study recruited male and female PTB cases from a diagnostic centre and a frequency-matched community-based control group in Kaski District, Nepal. Controls were tested for LTBI status and a separate nested case-control study was conducted based on LTBI status. Data were collected on participant household animal ownership. Using logistic regression, animal ownership was investigated for associations with both PTB and LTBI. Data were obtained from 570 PTB cases and 1,224 controls, the latter group providing 396 LTBI-positive and 692 LTBI-negative subjects. Results provided evidence of decreased odds of both PTB and LTBI positivity associated with owning bovines. The evidence was strongest for protection against infection, rather than activation of infection to PTB. Effects were strongest in women, who usually manage the animals in Nepal, and there were exposure-response relationships with numbers of bovines owned. Results suggest that exposure to bovines is protective against LTBI and PTB. A possible mechanism involves boosting the effect of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination, particularly in protecting against tuberculous infection. Additional studies with more extensive data collection are needed to confirm the observed associations.","Bates, Michael N; Pope, Karl; Sijali, Tula R; Albers, Autumn E; Verma, Sharat C",Zoonoses and public health,51,31

There is clinical evidence for a change in collapsibility of the upper airway depending on the depth of sedation. So far, a dose-response relationship between sedation and collapsibility has not been demonstrated. METHODS DISE and SimS were performed in 60 consecutive patients with SDB under monitoring of depth of sedation by BiSpectral Index® (BIS). Initially, SimS was conducted followed by DISE using bolus application of propofol. Sedation was performed up to a sedation level representing slow wave sleep (BIS = 40). The collapsibility of the upper airway was documented at decreasing sedation levels by an identical pictogram classification. RESULTS For all levels and patterns of obstruction, a dose-dependent increase in the collapsibility of the upper airway was detected. A maximum collapsibility was achieved at sedation levels representing slow wave sleep. The collapsibility during SimS corresponded to light sleep stages and did not cover slow wave sleep. CONCLUSION A dose-dependent change of patterns of obstructions can be observed during DISE under BIS monitoring indicating sedation depth. The obtained patterns of obstruction during DISE and SimS should thus be interpreted with regard to the sedation depth.","Kellner, Patrick; Herzog, Beatrice; Plößl, Sebastian; Rohrmeier, Christian; Kühnel, Thomas; Wanzek, Ramona; Plontke, Stefan; Herzog, Michael",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,51,16

Recent developments in the experimental elicitation and statistical estimation of subjective belief distributions allow inferences about whether these beliefs are biased relative to expert opinion, and the confidence with which they are held. Beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality interact with risk management efforts, so it is important to understand relationships between these beliefs and publicly disseminated statistics, particularly those based on evolving epidemiological models. The pandemic provides a unique setting over which to bracket the range of possible COVID-19 prevalence and mortality outcomes given the proliferation of estimates from epidemiological models. We rely on the epidemiological model produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation together with the set of epidemiological models summarised by FiveThirtyEight to bound prevalence and mortality outcomes for one-month, and December 1, 2020 time horizons. We develop a new method to partition these bounds into intervals, and ask subjects to place bets on these intervals, thereby revealing their beliefs. The intervals are constructed such that if beliefs are consistent with epidemiological models, subjects are best off betting the same amount on every interval. We use an incentivised experiment to elicit beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality from 598 students at Georgia State University, using six temporally-spaced waves between May and November 2020. We find that beliefs differ markedly from epidemiological models, which has implications for public health communication about the risks posed by the virus.","Harrison, Glenn W; Hofmeyr, Andre; Kincaid, Harold; Monroe, Brian; Ross, Don; Schneider, Mark; Todd Swarthout, J",Methods,51,20

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Currently new notifications in Australia are mostly considered to be locally-acquired with some cases still reported among people with recent overseas travel. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case or known cluster, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.3%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (7.1%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.7%) and the United Kingdom (15.4%).

First, the dynamics of the evaporation meniscus and the onset and evolution of nanobubbles on nanopillar surfaces were characterized. The meniscus can be pinned at the top surface of the nanopillars during evaporation for perfectly wetting fluid. The curvature of the meniscus close to nanopillars varies dramatically. Nanobubbles do not originate from the solid surface, where there is an ultrathin nonevaporation film due to strong solid-fluid interaction, but originate and evolve from the corner of nanopillars, where there is a quick increase in potential energy of the fluid. Second, according to a parametric study, the smaller pitch between nanopillars (P) and larger diameter of nanopillars (D) are found to enhance evaporation but also raise the possibility of boiling, whereas the smaller height of nanopillars (H) is found to enhance evaporation and suppress boiling. Finally, it is revealed that the nanofilm thickness should be maintained beyond a threshold, which is 20 Å in this work, to avoid the suppression effect of disjoining pressure on evaporation. Moreover, it is revealed that whether the evaporative heat transfer is enhanced on the nanopillar surface compared with the smooth surface is also affected by the nanofilm thickness. The value of nanofilm thickness should be determined by the competition between the suppression effect on evaporation due to the decrease in the volume of supplied fluid and the existence of capillary pressure and the enhancement effect on evaporation due to the increase in the heating area. Our work serves as the guidelines to achieve stable and efficient nanofilm pure evaporative heat transfer on nanopillar surfaces.","Pu, Jin Huan; Wang, Si Kun; Sun, Jie; Wang, Wen; Wang, Hua Sheng",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,51,1

TRK-inhibitors have demonstrated robust and long lasting responses in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours, including sarcoma. Access to these agents in many jurisdictions such as Canada remains limited. We undertook a modified Delphi consensus to articulate and convey the clinical importance of these agents for the Canadian sarcoma community. A systematic search of published and presented literature was conducted to identify clinical trials reporting outcomes on the use of TRK-inhibitors in relapsed/refractory NTRK fusion-positive sarcoma. Three main consensus questions were identified 1) is there currently an unmet clinical need for systemic therapy options in relapsed/refractory sarcoma? 2) do TRK-inhibitors confer a clinical benefit to patients with NTRK fusion-positive sarcoma? 3) do phase I/II basket trials provide sufficient evidence to justify funding of TRK-inhibitors in NTRK fusion-positive sarcoma?. Response rates to the first and second surveys were 57% (n = 30) and 42% (n = 22), respectively. There was strong agreement among the Canadian sarcoma community that there was unmet clinical need for effective systemic therapy options in relapsed/refractory sarcoma, that TRK-inhibitors are a safe and effective treatment option for patients with NTRK fusion-positive sarcoma, and that available phase I/II basket trials provide sufficient evidence to support funding of these agents in relapsed/refractory NTRK fusion-positive sarcoma.

Exercise training is recommended to prevent and alleviate sleep disorders. Objective The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of aerobic exercise training on quality of sleep, psychological wellbeing and immune system among subjects with chronic primary insomnia. Material and methods Eighty previously sedentary subjects with chronic primary insomnia subjects enrolled in this study, their age ranged from 35-56 years. All participants were randomly assigned to supervised aerobic exercise intervention group (group A, n=40) or control group (group B, n=40). Polysomnographic recordings for sleep quality assessment, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States(POMS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells count and CD4/CD8 ratio were measured before and at the end of the study after six months. Results There was a significant increase in the total sleep duration, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency in group(A) after six months of aerobic exercise training, while, wake time after sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latency significantly reduced after six months of aerobic training compared with values obtained prior to aerobic exercise training. Also, the mean values of BDI, POMS, CD3 count, CD4 count and CD8 count decreased significantly and the mean value of RSES significantly increased in group (A) after the aerobic exercise training, while the results of the control group were not significant. Moreover, there were significant differences between both groups at the end of the study.

There are, however, limitations to performing this type of resection. Robotic TAMIS is a novel, experimental technique and in this study was performed in a cadaveric model at a surgical education center. Various tasks were carried out using robotic TAMIS, including full-thickness sharp and cautery excision of rectal wall, as well as intra-luminal suturing of the surgical defect. It was found that for the da Vinci-trained surgeon, these tasks were simple to perform and accomplished with greater precision when compared to standard TAMIS. Our initial results indicate that robotic TAMIS overcomes the limitations of standard TAMIS and that it is a feasible platform for transanal surgery. The cost, however, of performing robotic TAMIS may limit its application to special cases in which standard TAMIS or transanal endoscopic microsurgery resections may prove difficult. Further study is necessary to validate these preliminary findings before robotic TAMIS is performed on live patients.","Atallah, S B; Albert, M R; deBeche-Adams, T H; Larach, S W",Techniques in coloproctology,51,17

These observations have now translated to the pediatric arena. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess safety and efficacy of cell-based therapies in animal and human studies of pediatric heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS A literature search was conducted to examine the effects of cell-based therapies on: (i) safety and (ii) cardiac function. In total, 18 pre-clinical and 13 human studies were included. Pre-clinical: right ventricular dysfunction was the most common animal model (80%). Cardiac-derived (28%) and umbilical cord blood (24%) cells were delivered intravenously (36%) or intramyocardially (35%). Mortality was similar between cell-based and control groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.05, 17.41). Cell-based treatments preserved ejection fraction by 6.9% (p < 0.01), while intramyocardial at a dose of 1-10 M cells/kg optimized ejection fraction. Clinical: single ventricle physiology was the most common cardiac disease (n = 9). Cardiac tissue was a frequent cell source, dosed from 3.0 × 105 to 2.4 × 107 cells/kg. A decrease in adverse events occurred in the cell-based cohort (OR 0.17, p < 0.01). Administration of cell-based therapies improved ejection fraction (MD 4.84; 95% CI 1.62, 8.07; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this meta-analysis, cell-based therapies were safe and improved specific measures of cardiac function. Implications from this review may provide methodologic recommendations (source, dose, route, timing) for future clinical trials.

Wavelet-MRP maps yield a clear depiction of hypervascular tumor regions, as recently shown. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to elucidate a possible connection of the wavelet-MRP power spectrum in glioblastoma (GBM) with local vascularity and cell proliferation. METHODS For this IRB-approved study 12 patients (63.0+/-14.9y; 7m) with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM were included. Target regions for biopsies were prospectively marked on tumor regions as seen on preoperative 3T MRI. During subsequent neurosurgical tumor resection 43 targeted biopsies were taken from these target regions, of which all 27 matching samples were analyzed. All specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed for endothelial cell marker CD31 and proliferation marker Ki67 and correlated to the wavelet-MRP power spectrum as derived from DSC perfusion weighted imaging. RESULTS There was a strong correlation between wavelet-MRP power spectrum (median = 4.41) and conventional relative cerebral blood volume (median = 5.97 ml/100g) in Spearman's rank-order correlation (κ = .83, p < .05). In a logistic regression model, the wavelet-MRP power spectrum showed a significant correlation to CD31 dichotomized to no or present staining (p = .04), while rCBV did not show a significant correlation to CD31 (p = .30). No significant association between Ki67 and rCBV or wavelet-MRP was found (p = .62 and p = .70, respectively). CONCLUSION The wavelet-MRP power spectrum derived from existing DSC-MRI data might be a promising new surrogate for tumor vascularity in GBM.","Rotkopf, Lukas T; Wiestler, Benedikt; Preibisch, Christine; Liesche-Starnecker, Friederike; Pyka, Thomas; Nörenberg, Dominik; Bette, Stefanie; Gempt, Jens; Thierfelder, Kolja M; Zimmer, Claus; Huber, Thomas",PloS one,51,31

RESULTS The average age was 62 years (range 42-79 years), average pathological tumor size was 9 mm (range 3-22 mm), and average tumor depth was 6 mm (range 1-25 mm). Although no tumors could be visualized before lung collapse, 22 tumors (85%) were detectable with ultrasonography after lung collapse. Of these 22 tumors, 16 were well-depicted, while six were poorly delineated. MD showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.81), and tumors with a MD of ≤ 6 mm had a high risk of difficult localization using ultrasonography. CONCLUSION This ultrasonographic method obtained high tumor detection rates, especially for tumors with a MD > 6 mm. Tumors with a MD ≤ 6 mm may require another localization method.

METHODS An electromagnetic field created by an ultrasound (US) machine detected the tracking bracket mounted onto the RFA needle. When the needle tip was confirmed to be in the accurate plane extracorporeally, the needle was inserted into the liver using the virtual navigation US system, and RFA was performed. Eight patients with eight liver lesions underwent percutaneous RFA under ultrasound for HCC from October to November 2012 using the real-time electromagnetic virtual needle tracking system (VirtuTRAX). RESULTS The average size of the tumors was 11.5 mm with one lesion in S4, two in S5, two in S7 and three in S8. Sufficient margins were obtained in a single session in all cases. Using only B-mode, the needle tip was obscured due to the condition of the surrounding liver or subcutaneous fat tissue, but it was identifiable with the use of the virtual needle tracking device in all cases. In one case where the lesion was large, the needle was placed twice deliberately, but the second puncture was made difficult by the ablation artifact of the first puncture. With the tracking device, however, it was possible to perform the second puncture accurately. CONCLUSION The virtual tracking system is useful in cases where the needle tip is obscured due to surrounding liver conditions or when multiple punctures are necessary due to the ablation artifact's obscuring the needle tip. Freehand puncturing may be possible in the future using this technique with further improvements in the system.","Tomonari, Akiko; Tsuji, Kunihiko; Yamazaki, Hajime; Aoki, Hironori; Kang, Jong-Hon; Kodama, Yoshihisa; Sakurai, Yasuo; Maguchi, Hiroyuki",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,51,27

A total of 4,300 patients, mainly from northern China, were enrolled, including 182 patients with acute hepatitis B and 4,118 patients with chronic HBV infection who had been exposed to nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes were determined by direct sequencing of the HBV S/Pol region. The prevalence rates were 0.40% for HBV/B1, 14.30% for HBV/B2, 0.25% for HBV/B3, 0.35% for HBV/B4, 1.05% for HBV/C1, 81.72% for HBV/C2, 0.93% for HBV/C3, 0.16% for HBV/C4, and 0.84% for HBV/D. In chronic HBV infection, patients with HBV/B2 were younger and had lower ΗBeAg positive rates than patients with HBV/C2. The incidence of lamivudine-resistant mutations was significantly higher in HBV/C2 compared to HBV/B2 (27.9% versus 19.8%; P<0.01), and the significant difference was observed only for rtM204I and not rtM204V. In addition, compensatory mutations were more frequently detected in HBV/C2. The incidence of adefovir-resistant mutations was similar between the two subsets, but HBV/C2 inclined to show rtA181V (3.6% for C2 versus 0.9% for B2; P<0.01), while HBV/B2 inclined to show rtN236T (4.5% for versus 2.5% for C2; P<0.01). The ratios of HBV/B2 to HBV/C2 infection were 1.7 (110/65), 5.7 (2,653/463), 7.5 (520/69), 8.0 (48/6), and 15.3 (183/12) for acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. In conclusion, HBV/C2 and HBV/B2, two prevalent subgenotypes, differ in lamivudine- and adefovir-resistance-associated mutational patterns. HBV/C2-infected patients are more likely to have disease progression than HBV/B2-infected ones.","Li, Xiaodong; Wang, Lin; Zhong, Yanwei; Wong, Vincent Wai-Sun; Xu, Zhihui; Liu, Yan; Li, Qinghong; Xin, Shaojie; Zhao, Jingmin; Xu, Dongping",Journal of clinical microbiology,51,24

One form of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in ADAR results in reduced adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of endogenous dsRNAs, induction of IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes, other inflammatory mediators, morbidity, and mortality. Alu elements, ∼10% of the human genome, are the most common A-to-I-editing sites. Using leukocyte whole-genome RNA-sequencing data, we found reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Dendritic cells infected with COVID-19 also exhibit reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs. Unedited Alu dsRNAs, but not edited Alu dsRNAs, are potent inducers of IRF and NF-κB transcriptional responses, IL6, IL8, and IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, decreased A-to-I editing that may lead to accumulation of unedited Alu dsRNAs and increased inflammatory responses is associated with severe COVID-19 disease.","Crooke, Philip S; Tossberg, John T; Porter, Krislyn P; Aune, Thomas M",Journal of immunology,51,24

Recently, ultrasound guidance has been reported to facilitate radial artery catheterization. A new device, Mill Suss™, has also been developed for visualization of the radial artery and superficial veins using near-infrared laser light. In this study, we hypothesized that the Mill Suss-guided method might reduce the time and the number of attempts required for radial artery catheterization under general anesthesia, as compared to the long-axis in-plane ultrasound-guided method. Seventy-two adult patients aged 20-80 years, ASA physical status I or II, were randomly assigned to the Mill Suss-guided group (Group M: n = 36) or ultrasound-guided group (Group U: n = 36). Primary outcomes were the time required for successful radial artery catheterization and the number of cannulation attempts. There were no significant differences in the characteristics of patients between the two groups. The time required for successful radial artery catheterization was significantly shorter in Group M than in Group U. The number of attempts for successful cannulation was not statistically significantly different between the two groups.

We believe this is the first such case reported in academic literature. HL with liver involvement is extremely rare and is not considered an indication for transplantation. The 12-year-old, male patient presented with a viral illness prodrome, and parvovirus was detected in pre-transplant laboratory cultures. He received an ABOi living donor liver graft followed by a course of plasma exchange and rituximab after which standard immunosuppression was used. The HL was diagnosed on hepatic biopsy post-transplant. Subsequently, the patient commenced six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, we stopped tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Immunosuppression was maintained with corticosteroids in-between cycles. The patient is alive and reports good quality of life 1-year post-transplant. The HL is in remission. During the post-operative period, the patient experienced four episodes of neutropenia, a bile leak, and gram-negative sepsis. One episode of acute rejection has been treated. Although we did not initially transplant the patient for ALF secondary to HL, its subsequent diagnosis and the patient's response to management raises many issues that warrant consideration. While the findings from a single case cannot be generalized, this could be a ""proof of concept"" for liver transplantation in hepatic HL.

Background: Nurses are assigned a key role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Of particular importance is their work engagement, depending on job demands and resources. So far, there have only been scattered and first-wave related indications of nurses' job demands, resources and work engagement in Germany during the pandemic. Aim: To systematically assess key job demands, key job resources and work engagement of nursing staff for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, also differentiating between various groups of nurses. Method: The study was realized in a cross-sectional design and included nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected with an online questionnaire using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. The dataset for analyses comprised 1027 cases in total. Results: Regarding demands, work overload was even higher than before the pandemic, but work-life interferences were less pronounced. Nurses' resource architecture was not fundamentally changed by the pandemic, but interpersonal relationships and autonomy were rated more positively. Domiciliary care workers assessed demands and resources more positively than nurses in nursing homes or hospitals, whereas nurses caring for COVID-19 patients evaluated demands and resources more critically. Nurses' work engagement was higher during the second pandemic wave than in the first wave, but still low overall. Conclusions: Due to the importance of work engagement for nurses' health and performance and thus the quality of care, demands and resources must be further improved. Starting points are, e. g., fostering team cohesion, strengthening autonomy, and managing workload.","Dürr, Lena; Forster, Andrea; Bartsch, Christina E; Koob, Clemens",Pflege,51,24

In the present study, the role of sialic acids in serotype I feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) infections was studied in feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Treatment of cells with neuraminidase (NA) enhanced infection efficiency, showing that terminal sialic acid residues on the cell surface were not receptor determinants and even hampered efficient virus-receptor engagement. Knowing that NA treatment of coronaviruses can unmask viral sialic acid binding activity, replication of untreated and NA-treated viruses was compared, showing that NA treatment of the virus enhanced infectivity in untreated cells, but was detrimental in NA-treated cells. By using sialylated compounds as competitive inhibitors, it was demonstrated that sialyllactose (2,6-α-linked over 2,3-α-linked) notably reduced infectivity of NA-treated viruses, whereas bovine submaxillary mucin inhibited both treated and untreated viruses. In desialylated cells, however, viruses were less prone to competitive inhibition with sialylated compounds. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that FECV had a sialic acid binding capacity, which was partially masked by virus-associated sialic acids, and that attachment to sialylated compounds could facilitate enterocyte infections. However, sialic acid binding was not a prerequisite for the initiation of infection and virus-receptor engagement was even more efficient after desialylation of cells, indicating that FECV requires sialidases for efficient enterocyte infections.","Desmarets, Lowiese M B; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Roukaerts, Inge D M; Acar, Delphine D; Nauwynck, Hans J",The Journal of general virology,51,30

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The urokinase receptor system is a key regulator of the intersection between inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been identified as an immunologic risk factor for AKI. Whether suPAR is associated with COVID-19-related AKI is unknown. METHODS In a multinational observational study of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples from 352 adult patients that had been collected within 48 hours of admission. We examined the association between suPAR levels and incident in-hospital AKI. RESULTS Of the 352 patients (57.4% were male, 13.9% were black, and mean age was 61 years), 91 (25.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, of whom 25 (27.4%) required dialysis. The median suPAR level was 5.61 ng/ml. AKI incidence rose with increasing suPAR tertiles, from a 6.0% incidence in patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml (first tertile) to a 45.8% incidence of AKI in patients with suPAR levels >6.86 ng/ml (third tertile). None of the patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml required dialysis during their hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, the highest suPAR tertile was associated with a 9.15-fold increase in the odds of AKI (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.64 to 22.93) and a 22.86-fold increase in the odds of requiring dialysis (95% CI, 2.77 to 188.75). The association was independent of inflammatory markers and persisted across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Admission suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are predictive of in-hospital AKI and the need for dialysis. SuPAR may be a key component of the pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19.","Azam, Tariq U; Shadid, Husam R; Blakely, Pennelope; O'Hayer, Patrick; Berlin, Hanna; Pan, Michael; Zhao, Peiyao; Zhao, Lili; Pennathur, Subramaniam; Pop-Busui, Rodica; Altintas, Izzet; Tingleff, Jens; Stauning, Marius A; Andersen, Ove; Adami, Maria-Evangelia; Solomonidi, Nicky; Tsilika, Maria; Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Arnaoutoglou, Eleni; Keitel, Verena; Tacke, Frank; Chalkias, Athanasios; Loosen, Sven H; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Eugen-Olsen, Jesper; Reiser, Jochen; Hayek, Salim S",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,51,1

METHODS We designed a prospective observational study of two elective neurosurgery groups of patients: craniotomies (CG) and non-craniotomies (NCG). We analyze the concordance and the odds ratio (OR) of altered neurological scales and BIS in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for postoperative neurological complications. We compared the isolated assessment of pupils and GCS (pupils-GCS) with all the neurologic assessment scales and BIS (scales-BIS). RESULTS In the CG (n=70), 16 patients (22.9%) had neurological complications in PACU. The scales-BIS registered more alterations than the pupils-GCS (31.4% vs. 20%; p<0.001), were more sensitive (94% vs. 50%) and allowed a more precise estimate for neurological complications in PACU (p=0.002; OR=7.15, 95% CI=2.1-24.7 vs. p=0.002; OR=9.5, 95% CI=2.3-39.4). In the NCG (n=46), there were no neurological complications in PACU. The scales-BIS showed alterations in 18 cases (39.1%) versus 1 (2.2%) with the pupils-GCS (p<0.001). Altered CNS on PACU admission increased the risk of neurological complications in the ward (p=0.048; OR=7.28, 95% CI=1.021-52.006). CONCLUSIONS Applied together, the assessment of pupils, GCS, Ramsay scale, CNS, Nu-DESC and BIS improved early detection of postoperative neurological complications in PACU after elective craniotomies.","Herrero, Silvia; Carrero, Enrique; Valero, Ricard; Rios, Jose; Fábregas, Neus",Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,51,8

Autophagy adaptors are thought to link ubiquitinated mitochondria and autophagy through ATG8 protein binding. Here, we establish methods for inducing mitophagy by mitochondria-targeted ubiquitin chains and chemical-induced mitochondrial ubiquitination. Using these tools, we reveal that the ubiquitin signal is sufficient for mitophagy and that PINK1 and Parkin are unnecessary for autophagy activation per se. Furthermore, using phase-separated fluorescent foci, we show that the critical autophagy adaptor OPTN forms a complex with ATG9A vesicles. Disruption of OPTN-ATG9A interactions does not induce mitophagy. Therefore, in addition to binding ATG8 proteins, the critical autophagy adaptors also bind the autophagy core units that contribute to the formation of multivalent interactions in the de novo synthesis of autophagosomal membranes near ubiquitinated mitochondria.","Yamano, Koji; Kikuchi, Reika; Kojima, Waka; Hayashida, Ryota; Koyano, Fumika; Kawawaki, Junko; Shoda, Takuji; Demizu, Yosuke; Naito, Mikihiko; Tanaka, Keiji; Matsuda, Noriyuki",The Journal of cell biology,51,26

However, regular midwifery practices typically do not offer caseload midwifery care - one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. Because we know very little about the outcomes for women receiving caseload care in the Netherlands, we compared caseload care with regular midwife-led care, looking at maternal and perinatal outcomes, including antenatal and intrapartum referrals to secondary (i.e., obstetrician-led) care. METHODS We selected 657 women in caseload care and 1954 matched controls (women in regular midwife-led care) from all women registered in the Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) who gave birth in 2015. To be eligible for selection the women had to be in midwife-led antenatal care beyond 28 gestational weeks. Each woman in caseload care was matched with three women in regular midwife-led care, using parity, maternal age, background (Dutch or non-Dutch) and region. These two cohorts were compared for referral rates, mode of birth, and other maternal and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS In caseload midwifery care, 46.9% of women were referred to obstetrician-led care (24.2% antenatally and 22.8% in the intrapartum period). In the matched cohort, 65.7% were referred (37.4% antenatally and 28.3% in the intrapartum period). In caseload care, 84.0% experienced a spontaneous vaginal birth versus 77.0% in regular midwife-led care. These patterns were observed for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Women in caseload care had fewer inductions of labour (13.2% vs 21.0%), more homebirths (39.4% vs 16.1%) and less perineal damage (intact perineum: 41.3% vs 28.2%). The incidence of perinatal mortality and a low Apgar score was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS We found that when compared to regular midwife-led care, caseload midwifery care in the Netherlands is associated with a lower referral rate to obstetrician-led care - both antenatally and in the intrapartum period - and a higher spontaneous vaginal birth rate, with similar perinatal safety. The challenge is to include this model as part of the current effort to improve the quality of Dutch maternity care, making caseload care available and affordable for more women.","Offerhaus, Pien; Jans, Suze; Hukkelhoven, Chantal; de Vries, Raymond; Nieuwenhuijze, Marianne",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,51,5

However, limited data are available from assessment of outcomes of FDA-approved devices. The objective of this study is to compare clinical outcomes, efficacy, and safety of non-stent retriever and stent retriever thrombectomy devices. METHODS Between January 2008 and June 2014, 166 patients treated at Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience for acute ischemic stroke with mechanical thrombectomy using Merci, Penumbra, Solitaire, or Trevo devices were retrospectively reviewed. Primary outcomes included 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [TICI score]), and incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression determined predictors of mRS Score 3-6, mortality, and TICI Score 3. RESULTS A total of 99 patients were treated with non-stent retriever devices (Merci and Penumbra) and 67 with stent retrievers (Solitaire and Trevo). Stent retrievers yielded lower 90-day NIH Stroke Scale scores and higher rates of 90-day mRS scores ≤ 2 (22.54% [non-stent retriever] vs 61.67% [stent retriever]; p < 0.001), TICI Score 2b-3 recanalization rates (79.80% [non-stent retriever] vs 97.01% [stent retriever]; p < 0.001), percentage of parenchyma salvaged, and discharge rates to home/rehabilitation. The overall incidence of ICH was also significantly lower (40.40% [non-stent retriever] vs 13.43% [stent retriever]; p = 0.002), with a trend toward lower 90-day mortality. Use of non-stent retriever devices was an independent predictor of mRS Scores 3-6 (p = 0.002), while use of stent retrievers was an independent predictor of TICI Score 3 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy devices achieve higher recanalization rates than non-stent retriever devices in acute ischemic stroke with improved clinical and radiographic outcomes and safety.","Hentschel, Kate A; Daou, Badih; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert M; Clark, Shannon; Gandhe, Ashish; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula",Journal of neurosurgery,51,1

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is proceeding with a plan to use 5G for a doctor-to-doctor remote diagnosis system. This remote diagnosis offers patients the benefit of receiving advanced medical care without having to travel long distances. The provision of a remote diagnosis will provide elderly patients in rural areas with an earlier diagnosis without burdening patients in Japan where the aging population and the uneven distribution of doctors are increasing. However, the system will increase the burden on specialists by expanding the doctor's catchment area. As a solution to that problem, deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to reduce the burden on doctors. In order to realize 5G- and AI-based real-time diagnostic support, diagnostic imaging using AI and an AI model that provides instructions are required. This is because ultrasonography and endoscopy, which can be used for remote diagnosis, do not acquire data on fixed areas like a CT or MRI scan. The AI model needs to instruct the doctor at the patient's home in order to collect appropriate information in accordance with the patient's symptoms and status. In order to build an interactive AI model, the interactions between doctors who are making a remote diagnosis should be recorded as training data and a 5G-based remote diagnosis system should be created. A remote diagnostic support system incorporating 5G and interactive diagnostic imaging incorporating AI will result in a system that places less of a burden on patients and doctors.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei",Bioscience trends,51,16

This paper describes the French efforts made since 2001 and presents data on antimicrobial consumption (AC) and AMR. Methods We gathered all data on AC and AMR recorded since 2001 from different national agencies, transferred on a regular basis to standardized European data on AC and resistance in both humans and animals. Results After a large information campaign implemented in France from 2001 to 2005 in humans, AC in the community decreased significantly (18% to 34% according to the calculation method used). It remained at the same level from 2005 to 2010 and increased again from 2010 to 2018 (8%). Contrasting results were observed for AMR. The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus decreased significantly. For gram-negative bacilli, the results were variable according to the microorganism. The resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to third-generation cephalosporins increased, remaining moderate for Escherichia coli (12% in 2017) but reaching 35% in the same year for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance to carbapenems in those 2 microorganisms remained below 1%. Both global AC and resistance to most antibiotics decreased significantly in animals. Conclusions Antibiotic consumption decreased significantly in France after a large public campaign from 2001 to 2005, but this positive effect was temporary. The effect on AMR varied according to the specific microorganism: The effect was very impressive for gram-positive cocci, variable for gram-negative bacilli, and moderate for E. coli, but that for K. pneumoniae was of concern. The consumption of and resistance to antibiotics decreased significantly in animals.","Carlet, Jean; Jarlier, Vincent; Acar, Jacques; Debaere, Olivier; Dehaumont, Patrick; Grandbastien, Bruno; Le Coz, Pierre; Lina, Gerard; Pean, Yves; Rambaud, Claude; Roblot, France; Salomon, Jérôme; Schlemmer, Benoit; Tattevin, Pierre; Vallet, Benoit",Open forum infectious diseases,51,24

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) influences TPTD results, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. We hypothesized that RRT blood flow induces errors in TPTD measurements. METHODS We analyzed TPTD data available from the PiCCO® plus hemodynamic measurement device on a personal computer using a proprietary Pulsion Medical Systems software. By using the dialysis catheter to inject the thermal indicator, 20 measurement series were performed in 12 intensive care unit patients determining CI, ITBVI, and EVLWI during RRT with the blood pump stopped, and at flows of 100 and 200 mL/min, respectively. RESULTS Data export was successful in 17 measurement series and showed a significant decrease in measured CI (6.5 ± 2.5 vs 5.4 ± 1.9 L/min/m, P < 0.001) and ITBVI (1358.8 ± 274.5 vs 1132.8 ± 218.3 mL/m, P < 0.001) with RRT and a significant increase in EVLWI (8.6 ± 4.4, 10.2 ± 4.5 mL/kg, P < 0.001). Blood temperature before and the temperature decrease after injection of the thermal indicator were unchanged by RRT. Mean transit time and downslope time of the thermodilution curve, however, were both increased with the RRT blood pump running (P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Analysis of TPTD data shows that thermodilution curve forms are modified with RRT, resulting in an erroneous calculation of thermodilution-derived hemodynamic parameters.","Schmidt, Sven; Westhoff, Timm; Schlattmann, Peter; Zidek, Walter; Compton, Friederike",Anesthesia and analgesia,51,1

Studies to date have shown there are gaps in knowledge of and communication between restaurant staff and food allergic individuals. OBJECTIVE We sought to characterize allergic reactions in restaurants to better inform the restaurant industry, food allergic individual, and allergist so that mitigation strategies can be implemented. METHODS Data collected over a 2-year period from 2827 individuals in the Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) registry were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Dining out accounted for the second most common location for a food allergic reaction, after one's home, and many were severe with 28.0% requiring one dose, and 6.2% requiring two doses of epinephrine. Cafes, fast food establishments, and Asian restaurants were frequently implicated sites. Peanut, tree nuts, and milk were the most common inciting allergens and tree nuts resulted in the most common use of epinephrine. Of the allergic reactions, 53.9% occurred despite conveyance of food allergy to restaurant staff, 26.6% occurred when allergens were declared on the menu, and 13.7% happened when allergens were declared on the menu and restaurant staff were informed of a food allergy. CONCLUSIONS Allergic reactions in restaurants are common and can be severe. Findings presented here underscore the need for restaurant staff training and mandatory declaration of allergenic ingredients in meals. This updated knowledge will help support advocacy efforts and inform patients, allergists, and the restaurant industry on best practices for dining out to improve the quality of life for food allergic individuals.","Oriel, Roxanne C; Waqar, Omar; Sharma, Hemant P; Casale, Thomas B; Wang, Julie",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

We evaluated the surgical outcomes of elderly patients in a nationwide prospective cohort study. METHODS One hundred and sixty-nine participating institutions were identified by stratified random sampling, and were adjusted for hospital volume, type and location. During 1 year from 2014 to 2015, consecutive patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer were prospectively enrolled. 'Elderly' was defined as ≥ 75 years of age, based on the prevalence of comorbidities and the activities of daily living of patients of this age. We compared the surgical outcomes of LG to those of open gastrectomy (OG) in non-elderly and elderly patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe morbidities (Grade ≥ 3). RESULTS Eight thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven patients were enrolled [non-elderly, n = 6090 (OG, n = 2602; LG, n = 3488); elderly, n = 2837 (OG, n = 1471; LG, n = 1366)]. Grade ≥ 3 complications occurred in 161 (10.9%) patients who underwent OG and 98 (7.2%) who underwent LG (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, we confirmed that laparoscopic surgery was not an independent risk factor (odds ratio = 0.81, 0.60-1.09). OG was associated with a significantly longer median length of postoperative stay in comparison to LG (16 versus 12 days, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other postoperative comorbidities. CONCLUSION The safety of LG in elderly patients was demonstrated. LG shortened the length of postoperative hospital stay.","Honda, Michitaka; Kumamaru, Hiraku; Etoh, Tsuyoshi; Miyata, Hiroaki; Yamashita, Yuichi; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Inomata, Masafumi; Konno, Hiroyuki; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kitano, Seigo; Watanabe, Masahiko; Hiki, Naoki",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,51,1

The first part presents the foundations and principles of syndemic theory. For the purposes of this essay, syndemic was defined as a process of synergic interaction between two or more diseases, in which the effects are mutually enhanced. We discussed the three principal typologies of syndemic interaction: mutually causal epidemics; epidemics interacting synergically; and serial causal epidemics. In the second part, COVID-19 is analyzed as a syndemic resulting from the interaction between various groups of diseases and the socioeconomic context. The theoretical model considered the interaction between COVID-19 and chronic noncommunicable diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, and mental health problems. The essay addressed how social iniquities and conditions of vulnerability act at various levels to increase the effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics. The last section discusses the need for comprehensive, multisector, and integrated responses to COVID-19. A model for intervention was presented that involves the patient care and socioeconomic dimensions. In the sphere of patient care, the authors defend the structuring of strong and responsive health systems, accessible to the entire population. The economic and social dimension addressed the issue of reclaiming the ideals of solidarity, the health promotion strategy, and emphasis on social determinants of health. In conclusion, the lessons learned from the syndemic approach to COVID-19 call on government and society to develop policies that link clinical, sanitary, socioeconomic, and environmental interventions.","Bispo Júnior, José Patrício; Santos, Djanilson Barbosa Dos",Cadernos de saude publica,51,1

STUDY DESIGN In a cohort of infants born ≤30 weeks EGA, weekly C-rSO2 data were prospectively collected from the second week of life through 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Clinically obtained hemoglobin values were noted at the time of recording. Recordings were excluded if they were of insufficient duration (<1 h) or if the hemoglobin was not measured within 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed effects-model and ROC analysis. ROC analysis was used to determine the threshold of anemia, where C-rSO2 critically decreased >2SD below the mean normative value (<55%) in preterm infants. RESULTS In total 253 recordings from 68 infants (mean EGA 26.9 ± 2.1 weeks, BW 1025 ± 287 g, 49% male) were included. Approximately 29 out of 68 infants (43%) were transfused during hospitalization. Mixed-model statistical analysis adjusting for EGA, BW, and PMA revealed a significant association between decreasing hemoglobin and C-rSO2 (p < 0.01) in transfusion-naive infants but not in transfused infants. In the transfusion naive group, using ROC analysis demonstrated a threshold hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (AUC 0.81, p < 0.01) for critical cerebral desaturation in preterm infants. CONCLUSIONS In transfusion-naive preterm infants, worsening anemia was associated with a progressive decrease in cerebral saturations.

Haploidentical HSCT is an emerging modality with encouraging outcomes in several blood conditions. The present study aims to comprehensively assess the feasibility and safety of haploidentical HSCT in patients with severe and very severe AA. It is a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies related to haploidentical stem cell transplantation in idiopathic AA investigating rates of successful engraftment, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), chronic GvHD (cGvHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), and posttransplantation viral infections (including cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in patients with AA. The effects of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative conditioning (NMA), as well as various GvHD prophylaxis regimens on these outcomes were evaluated. In total 15 studies were identified, (577 patients, 58.9% males), successful engraftment was observed in 97.3% of patients (95% CI, 95.9-98.7) while grades II-IV aGvHD and cGvHD were reported in 26.6% and 25.0%, respectively. The pooled incidence of TRM was 6.7% per year (95% CI, 4.0-9.4). RIC regimens were associated with higher proportions of successful engraftment (97.7% vs 91.7%, P = 0.03) and aGvHD (29.5% vs 18.7%, P = 0.008) when compared with NMA regimens with no differences in cGvHD or mortality incidence. When compared with methotrexate-containing regimens and other regimens, posttransplant cyclophosphamide-containing regimens reduced the rates of aGvHD (28.6%, 27.8%, and 12.8%, respectively, P = 0.02), CMV viremia (55.7%, 38.6%, and 10.4%, respectively, P < 0.001), and CMV disease in initially viremic patients (2.1%, 33.0%, and 0%, respectively, P < 0.001).

Integrative modalities such as yoga, acupuncture, and massage are evidenced therapies for pain management. Additionally, medical cannabis and cannabinoids are emerging therapies for treatment of neuropathic pain (4,28). The authors of this study report a case of chronic neuropathic pain treated with integrative interventions. CASE PRESENTATION The patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic neuropathic pain in her lower back and legs, degenerative arthritis, restless leg syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and severe, chronic anxiety, presenting with worsening neuropathic pain. After over a decade of unsuccessful allopathic treatment, the patient sought out a more integrative approach to her pain management. A regimen of acupuncture, massage, gentle yoga, and medical cannabis was recommended. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to continue most of the integrative modalities and reported a significant increase in pain. The patient then joined a weekly Mind and Body program and began acupuncture treatments again, reporting a steady improvement in pain. CONCLUSION The patient's chronic neuropathic pain was effectively treated using an integrative approach, with a combination of acupuncture, massage, yoga, mind-body approaches, and medical cannabis. While this case originally presented similarly to other cases of chronic neuropathic pain, it is unique in that it demonstrates the importance of an individualized complex approach, highlighting the patient's driven engagement in integrative modalities and medical cannabis.","Zarabian, Kimia; Wannon, Avi; Chin, May; Kogan, Mikhail",Explore,51,29

DESIGN This is a retrospective review. SETTING The setting is three freestanding inpatient rehabilitation hospitals operating as one system. PARTICIPANTS The participants are consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital without a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or screening duplex ultrasound prior to transfer. INTERVENTIONS A duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed upon admission to inpatient rehabilitation hospital. OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was the percentage of admission patients with a lower limb deep venous thrombosis. Secondary factors included potential risk factors for a positive screen for deep venous thrombosis. RESULTS A lower limb deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 22% (25/113) of the patients tested, with eight patients (7.1%) having a proximal deep venous thrombosis. Risk factors for screening positive for a deep venous thrombosis included being male, younger, and having been on a ventilator during the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS The high rate of deep venous thrombosis observed in these patients suggests that the risk of venous thromboembolic disorders after severe COVID-19 illness is considerable and surveillance measures of such patients should be undertaken.","Kirshblum, Steven C; DeLauter, Gabrielle; Eren, Fatma; Pomeranz, Bruce; DeLuca, Robert; Hammerman, Samuel; Gans, Bruce M",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,51,24

DESIGN In vitro prospective study. SAMPLE 132 finger trap constructs. PROCEDURES Each group of constructs comprised 6 to 10 replicates each of 3 finger trap patterns tied with 2-0 glycolide-lactide copolymer (GLC), braided nylon, and monofilament polypropylene suture on 5F polypropylene and polyvinylchloride catheters. The 3 finger trap variants were of similar lengths but differed in the number of surgeon's throws included in the pattern. Constructs were tested with a universal materials testing machine to the point of failure or a maximum of 100 mm of distraction. Force and distraction data were evaluated for significance with a competing risks model. RESULTS There was no difference in performance (as measured by the proportion of test failures, median distraction distance, or median force at failure or end of testing) attributable to the finger trap pattern variants. Sixteen of 66 constructs with polyvinylchloride catheter material failed at ≤ 100 mm distraction, whereas all polypropylene constructs failed during testing. For polypropylene catheters, braided nylon or GLC suture withstood greater distraction distance and force, respectively. For polyvinylchloride catheters, differences among suture types were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Data suggested that, for the material combinations evaluated, a finger trap suture pattern with fewer knots may provide catheter security similar to that for patterns tied with a more traditional pattern. These results should not be extrapolated to catheters of different diameters or materials, patterns tied with different suture sizes, or clinical performance in vivo without further testing.","Ricker, Zachary H; Rochat, Mark C; Payton, Mark E",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,51,30

In comparison with a reference group of 35 CIDP patients, CMT patients were younger (median age at disease-onset: 39 vs 56 years), and more frequently had motor weakness at disease onset (80% vs 29%), hearing loss (14% vs 0%), normal brachial plexus imaging (70% vs 40%), lower cerebrospinal fluid protein content (median: 0.5 vs 0.8 g/L), and lower treatment response (20% vs 69%). Treatment cost in these 35 misdiagnosed patients was estimated at 4,6 Million € (M€), whereas the cost of CMT genetic analysis in 1104 patients was estimated at 2,7M€. CONCLUSION In this study, 35/1104 (3.2%) of patients initially diagnosed with CIDP had CMT. Importantly, the cost of treating these 35 misdiagnosed patients was significantly higher than the cost of performing CMT genetic analysis in 1104 patients (4,6M€ vs 2,7M€), suggesting that CMT genetic investigations should be more widely used before diagnosing CIDP.","Hauw, Fabien; Fargeot, Guillaume; Adams, David; Attarian, Shahram; Cauquil, Cécile; Chanson, Jean-Baptiste; Creange, Alain; Gendre, Thierry; Deiva, Kumaran; Delmont, Emilien; Francou, Bruno; Genestet, Steeve; Kuntzer, Thierry; Latour, Philippe; Le Masson, Gwendal; Magy, Laurent; Nardin, Clotilde; Ochsner, François; Sole, Guilhem; Stojkovic, Tanya; Maisonobe, Thierry; Tard, Céline; Van Den Berghe, Peter; Echaniz-Laguna, Andoni",European journal of neurology,51,9

The death of visitors remains an important indicator of safety. The aim of this study was to provide updated figures on deaths of overseas travelers in Australia. METHODS Data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics concerning deaths of overseas visitors for the years 2001 to 2003. RESULTS There were 1,068 overseas visitor deaths (701 males, 66%) during the study period 2001 to 2003. Death by natural causes increased with age, while deaths associated with accidents were more frequent among younger age groups. The majority of deaths were from natural causes (782, 73%), particularly ischemic heart diseases (26%). There were a total of 247 accidental deaths (23% of all deaths) with the main causes being transportation accidents (14% of all deaths) and accidental drowning/submersion (5% of all deaths). The countries contributing the most deaths were the UK (247, 23%), New Zealand (108, 10%) Melanesia/Micronesia (95, 9%), and the United States (57, 5%). CONCLUSIONS Australia remains a relatively safe destination for international travelers, at least in terms of fatalities, which appear to be declining. Most deaths of overseas tourists in Australia are due to natural causes with cardiovascular disease being the predominant cause of death in this group. Accidents remain the most common preventable cause of death of travelers, with road and water safety being the major issues. It is important that tourism and travel medicine groups continue to advocate for improved health and safety of international travelers visiting Australia.","Leggat, Peter A; Wilks, Jeff",Journal of travel medicine,51,16

DESIGN Qualitative interview study. METHOD Ten NHS commissioners and managers participated in a semi-structured, co-produced interview. Each transcribed interview was double-coded and thematically analysed using The Framework Method. RESULTS Interviews generated three main themes. (1) Capacity issues across psychological therapy services create barriers to face-to-face therapies, and Internet-based interventions offer a solution. (2) Despite reservations, there is growing acceptance of Internet-based therapies. Different ways of connecting with patients are required, and Internet-based treatments are accessible and empowering treatment options, with guided self-help (GSH) preferred. Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered. PRACTITIONER POINTS There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","Simon, Natalie; Ploszajski, Matt; Lewis, Catrin; Smallman, Kim; Roberts, Neil P; Kitchiner, Neil J; Brookes-Howell, Lucy; Bisson, Jonathan I",Psychology and psychotherapy,51,5

Families were questioned on their experiences with preoperative counseling, practical teaching, additional support and the patient literature that was provided by the orthoptists in the CL clinic. Qualitative data and free comments were analyzed. 18/20 (90%) said they had received good practical insertion and removal teaching. 19/20 (95%) felt they received good emotional support. Only 6/20 (30%) families agreed with the statement that they found learning insertion and removal difficult. 15/20 (75%) families did not feel rushed, and 18/20 (90%) said they could learn at their own pace. All except one family (95%) achieved daily CL handling within a few months, with ongoing support from a multi-disciplinary team. One family surveyed was much earlier in their postoperative journey, but was on track to achieve this imminently. All families (100%) felt they were appropriately counselled preoperatively regarding the need for training and daily CL handling. 95% found the provided written information useful. 8/20 (40%) reported they found insertion harder than removal, 4/20(20%) reported they found removal harder. Teaching insertion and removal skills is an important aspect of managing paediatric aphakia and presents many challenges. Most parents eventually cope well and achieve daily CL handling within a few months, with support from a multi-disciplinary team. Families surveyed were all competent and were satisfied with their experience. The parental satisfaction survey gave our team confidence that our orthoptic-led service works well, orthoptists have the knowledge and skills to provide technical training to parents alongside vital emotional support, and contact lens handling is a rewarding extended role for orthoptists in a multi-disciplinary team.","Ramm, L; Painter, S",Strabismus,51,1

Father participation in prenatal care is increasing, yet little research exists to understand how mothers and fathers experience father participation in prenatal care and their preferences for father participation. We interviewed expectant first-time mothers (N = 22) and fathers (N = 20) to learn about fathers' participation in prenatal care, perceptions of providers' treatment of fathers, and preferences for father participation. Interviews were coded using principles of grounded theory. Father participation ranged from attendance at visits considered ""important"" (e.g., ultrasounds) to attendance at every appointment. Experiences of father participation varied, with many describing it as both an important act of support for the mother and part of assuming the role of father. Most participants saw great value in father participation in prenatal care as an opportunity for fathers to learn how to support a healthy pregnancy, bond with their developing baby, and share joy and/or worries with mothers. Participants generally felt that fathers were made to feel welcome and wanted providers to be inclusive of fathers during appointments. Results of this study suggest that father participation presents an opportunity for prenatal care providers to foster fathers' positive involvement in pregnancy, support for mothers, and preparation to parent.","Walsh, Tova B; Carpenter, Emma; Costanzo, Molly A; Howard, Lanikque; Reynders, Rachel",Infant mental health journal,51,1

There is accumulating data from many preclinical and clinical studies that highlights the excellent safety and immunogenicity of MVA. However, due to the complex nature of many pathogens and their pathogenicity, MVA vectored vaccine candidates need to be optimised to improve their immunogenicity.

Utilising these techniques, we have characterised pain-induced responses in the brain and improved our understanding of key pain-related phenomena. Despite the utility of these methods, there remains a need to assess the test retest reliability of pain modulated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) MR signal across repeated sessions. This is especially the case for more novel yet increasingly implemented stimulation modalities, such as noxious pressure, and it is acutely important for multi-session studies considering treatment efficacy. In the present investigation, BOLD signal responses were estimated for noxious-pressure stimulation in a group of healthy participants, across two separate sessions. Test retest reliability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and self-reported visual analogue scale measures were determined by the intra-class correlation coefficient. High levels of reliability were observed in several key brain regions known to underpin the pain experience, including in the thalamus, insula, somatosensory cortices, and inferior frontal regions, alongside ""excellent"" reliability of self-reported pain measures. These data demonstrate that BOLD-fMRI derived signals are a valuable tool for quantifying noxious responses pertaining to pressure stimulation.

This virus produces the Covid-19 disease, which has become a pandemic of devastating effects not only healthwise, but also, importantly, from an economic, political and social point of view. This essay seeks to establish the scientific evidence-based elements that guide public policies for prevention and control. Some of these elements are: a) epidemiologic intelligence. This includes not only the strategy of public surveillance, but also sentinel and event-based surveillance, as it is impossible to actually identify all positive cases; b) Mitigating measures against the spread of the epidemic, such as social distancing and hygiene, washing hands, quarantine, restricting movement and using masks, among others; c) Measures to suppress transmission when the number of cases is very high, such as strict measures to stay at home; d) strengthening health services 'capacity for medical attention and improving health services' ability to prevent transmission, including the use of diagnostic tests; e) the development of prophylactic vaccines against Covid-19, as well as the development of therapeutic agents. All of these actions must be rapidly implemented, from a multidisciplinary and multisectorial public health perspective, and they absolutely must also be taken with the community's participation as shared responsibility.

Information was gathered on the results of image quality tests recommended by the reports of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, and those additionally undertaken by medical physics departments. The assessment of efficacy considers the frequency with which a test result breaches the remedial level or other relevant threshold where applicable. The third quartile of those results exceeding the remedial level or threshold is used to estimate the severity of such a breach in terms of potential impact on patient dose and image quality. A risk assessment approach is then used to recommend to what degree, if any, the test should be included in an on-going test regimen. Data was analysed from 469 testing sessions to 337 unique fluoroscopy units throughout the UK. Across all tests, the rate with which the remedial level was exceeded varied from 0 - 10.6%, with severity ranging from little or none to major degradation to image quality or significant increase on population dose. Where possible, the data has also been used to produce representative ranges for the results of image quality tests. These could be useful as an up to date comparator for those sites considering the purchase of or commissioning new equipment. Overall the results indicate a wide range for the efficacy of those tests undertaken at present; this can be used to review local test protocols and to inform future changes to national guidance in the UK. The results also highlight some tests where measurement technique varies significantly throughout the UK, making any valid comparison difficult. This may indicate a need for further guidance on how best to undertake these tests.","Shaw, Daniel; Worrall, Mark; Baker, Chris; Charnock, Paul; Fazakerley, Jason; Honey, Ian; Iball, Gareth Richard; Koutalonis, Manthos; Price, Mandy; Renaud, Caroline; Rose, Amy; Wood, Tim J",Physics in medicine and biology,51,15

METHODS A cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted from May 9 to 30, 2020. A four-stage cluster survey was carried out at the level of the West and South districts. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were carried out using R 3.4.4 software. RESULTS In total, 400 people were surveyed. The mean age of those surveyed was 40.2 ± 14.7 years and extremes of 18 and 82 years. The male sex predominated in 66.5% of cases. People had good knowledge of the signs, transmission risks and prevention measures respectively in 4.7%; 3% and 47.8%. In total, 74% of the people surveyed respected the concept of ""stay at home"". Wearing a mask and systematic hand washing with soap and water were noted among the people surveyed in 53.6% and 34.8% of cases, respectively. People who had good knowledge of preventive measures against COVID-19 wore the mask more (ORaj = 2.1 [1.2-3.5]) and washed their hands more with soap and water (ORaj = 1.9 [1.1-3.4]).

Currently, between 5 000 and 8 000 rare or orphan diseases are known, every year about 250 rare diseases are newly described. Many of those pathologies concern the head and neck area. In many cases, a long time is required to diagnose an orphan disease. The lives of patients who are affected by those diseases are often determined by medical consultations and inpatient stays. Most orphan diseases are of genetic origin and cannot be cured despite medical progress. However, during the last years, the perception of and the knowledge about rare diseases has increased also due to the fact that publicly available databases have been created and self-help groups have been established which foster the autonomy of affected people. Only recently, innovative technical progress in the field of biogenetics allows individually characterizing the genetic origin of rare diseases in single patients. Based on this, it should be possible in the near future to elaborate tailored treatment concepts for patients suffering from rare diseases in the sense of translational and personalized medicine.

The presence of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) might be considered a contraindication for neurostimulators due to the possible interaction between the two devices. The purpose of this study is to report the feasibility and safety of concomitant use of neurostimulators and CIED, and to review surgical and clinical precautions needed to avoid possible interference between the two systems. METHODS A retrospective institutional review board approved chart review of six patients having both a neurostimulator(s) and a CIED was performed. Diagnosis included Parkinson's disease (two) and intractable pain (four). All implantable cardiac devices were set on bipolar sensing mode and bipolar stimulation was chosen for the neurostimulators. In general, both systems were implanted at sites seven inches apart. Electrocardiogram monitoring was observed throughout implantation. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 31.7 months (ranging from 14 to 67 months). An extensive chart review was done and cases from previous reports were compiled. RESULTS In all six patients, no acute events occurred during surgery with no interaction or interference noted during implantation of the second device. Subsequent follow-up visits continued to exhibit a lack of interference between the two systems, including normal electrocardiogram studies. Both systems were noted to function at optimal levels. An extensive literature review revealed 57 unique cases previously published reporting the simultaneous use of neurostimulators and a CIED in the same patient. A table summarizing previously cited cases from the literature is provided. CONCLUSION The concomitant use of neurostimulator(s) and permanent pacemaker(s) can be safely performed. Permanent pacemaker should not be considered a general contraindication for neurostimulation therapy. Current literature lacks evidence to determine the safety of concomitant use of neurostimulator(s) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator(s).","Ooi, Yinn Cher; Falowski, Steven; Wang, Daje; Jallo, Jack; Ho, Reginald T; Sharan, Ashwini",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,51,1

A study was undertaken to compare the yield of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with ICH with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and those without IVH. METHODS The DSA database at our institution was reviewed for patients who underwent DSA for acute spontaneous ICH over a period of 68 months. Patients with known vascular malformation or brain neoplasm, prior surgery, ischemic infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage or isolated IVH were excluded. Patients were grouped into those with associated IVH (group A) and those without (group B). Baseline demographic and clinical data, non-contrast head CT (NCCT) probability for a vascular lesion and angiographic results were compared. RESULTS 293 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (141 women, 152 men, mean age 57, range 18-88), 139 in group A and 154 in group B. Age and sex distributions were similar (p>0.05). Group A patients were more likely to be hypertensive or coagulopathic (p=0.001). Group B had more patients with high probability NCCT scans (p<0.001). Underlying vascular lesions were found in 21 patients (15.1%) in group A and 34 (22.1%) in group B (p>0.05). CONCLUSION The presence of IVH in patients with acute spontaneous ICH is not associated with an increased risk of an underlying vascular lesion and should not be used to select patients for neurovascular evaluation.","Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Kelly, James E; Kale, Sushant P; Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Moran, Christopher J; Cross, Dewitte T; Derdeyn, Colin P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,51,17

To this end, we sought to understand the kinematics in the DMM and ACLT joints compared to intact joints subjected to controlled tibial compressive loading. We hypothesized that the DMM and ACLT models would result in different patterns of joint instability compared to intact joints, thus explaining the different patterns of OA initiation and severity in these models. Cadaver adult C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either a DMM or ACLT in their right knee joints, while the left limbs remained as intact controls. All limbs were labeled with fiducial markers, and the rigid body kinematics of the tibia and femur were examined using roentgen stereophotogrammetry (RSA) with application of compressive loads from 0 to 9 N. DMM and intact joints demonstrated similar kinematics under compressive loading, in contrast to ACLT joints, which dislocated even before load application. These results demonstrate the importance of rigorous kinematic analysis in defining the role of joint instability in animal models of OA and suggest significant differences in DMM and ACLT joint instabilities in the context of controlled mechanical loading. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

A novel, synthetic polyurethane dermal template (NovoSorb® Biodegradable Temporising Matrix, BTM) was developed to address this need. The aim of this study was to evaluate use of BTM for primary dermal repair after deep burn injury. METHODS A multicentre, prospective, clinical study was conducted from September 2015 to May 2018. The primary endpoint was % split skin graft take over applied BTM at 7-10 days after grafting. Secondary endpoints included % BTM take, incidence of infection and adverse events, and scar quality to 12 months after BTM application. RESULTS Thirty patients were treated with BTM and delayed split skin grafting. The % graft take had a mean of 81.9% and % BTM take had a mean of 88.6%, demonstrating effective integration of BTM. When managed appropriately, it was possible for BTM to integrate successfully despite findings suggestive of infection. Scar quality improved over time. DISCUSSION These results provide additional clinical evidence on the safety and performance of BTM as an effective dermal substitute in the treatment of patients with deep burn injuries.","Lo, Cheng Hean; Brown, Jason N; Dantzer, Eric J G; Maitz, Peter K M; Vandervord, John G; Wagstaff, Marcus J D; Barker, Timothy M; Cleland, Heather",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,51,1

One of its key enzymes, similar to other coronaviruses, is the 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is essential for viral RNA stability and expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 2'-O-RNA MTase in a complex with the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin solved at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure revealed an overall fold consistent with the fold observed in other coronaviral MTases. The major differences are in the conformation of the C-terminus of the nsp16 subunit and an additional helix in the N-terminus of the nsp10 subunits. The structural analysis also revealed very high conservation of the SAM binding pocket suggesting that the SAM pocket is a suitable spot for the design of antivirals effective against all human coronaviruses.ImportanceSome coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens while some cause only common colds. The reasons are not understood although the spike proteins probably play an important role. However, to understand the coronaviral biology in sufficient detail we need to compare the key enzymes from different coronaviruses.

To better assess the demand for ""life-like"" cadaveric specimens and evaluate the possible impacts that competency-based medical education could have upon the body donation program of McGill University, Canada, the authors tracked, over the course of the last ten years, the number of soft-embalmed specimens, along with the number of teaching sessions and the residents enrolled in competency-based programs that are using cadaveric material. The results reveal that the number of soft-embalmed specimens used within residency training increased from 5 in 2009 to 35 in 2019, representing an increase from 6% of bodies to 36.5% of the total number of body donors embalmed in this institution. Correspondingly, the number of annual teaching sessions for residents increased from 19 in 2012 to 116 in 2019. These increases in teaching are correlated with increasing number of residents enrolled in competency-based programs over the last three years (Pearson r ranging from 0.9705 and 0.9903, and R2 ranging from 0.9418 and 0.9808). Those results suggest that the new skill-centered curricula which require residents to perform specific tasks within realistic settings, exhibit a growing demand for 'life-like' cadaveric specimens. Institutions' body donation programs must therefore adapt to those greater need for cadaveric specimens, which presents many challenges, ranging from the logistical to the ethical.","Noël, Geoffroy P J C; Dubé, Joseph; Venne, Gabriel",Anatomical sciences education,51,30

Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 μM WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of α-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), α-syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes. All together, these findings support that the WDL is a promising candidate to combat age-related multi-factorial PD pathology associated with protein misfolding and accumulation. The results provide sufficient information in the development of therapeutic medicines from natural products for improving the health.","Sharma, Shruti; Trivedi, Shalini; Pandey, Taruna; Ranjan, Sachin; Trivedi, Mashu; Pandey, Rakesh",Molecular neurobiology,51,19

However, PE prevalence (28%) was high compared with some studies. Our hypothesis was that the use of SPECT V/Q may be responsible for an overdiagnosis of PE, especially at the implementation phase of the test. The aim was to carry out a time trend analysis of the evolution over the years of PE diagnosis with SPECT V/Q. PATIENTS AND METHODS To evaluate the time trend of SPECT V/Q results, the conclusions of all SPECT V/Q scans performed for a suspected acute PE in our department from April 2011 to December 2016 were collected. To confirm the safety of a diagnostic management on the basis of SPECT V/Q to rule out PE, a retrospective observational study of the outcome of patients assessed with SPECT V/Q for suspected acute PE was carried out during the period 2014-2016. SPECT V/Q was interpreted using a diagnostic cutoff of one segmental or two subsegmental mismatches. The final diagnostic conclusion was established by the physician responsible for patient care. The safety of SPECT V/Q was assessed by monitoring the risk of thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period in patients left untreated on the basis of a negative SPECT V/Q. RESULTS Over the period 2011-2016, an average 16% (95% confidence interval: 10-22%) annual reduction in the proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was observed. The percentage of positive SPECT V/Q results was 25.3% over the period 2011-2013 compared with 16.3% in 2014-2016 (P<0.0001). Out of the 696 patients analyzed over the period 2014-2016, the SPECT V/Q was positive, indeterminate, and negative in 118, 3, and 575 patients, respectively. The 3-month thromboembolic risk in patients in whom PE was deemed absent according to the SPECT V/Q was 3/543=0.55% (95% confidence interval 0.19-1.61). CONCLUSION A continuous decrease in the annual proportion of positive SPECT V/Q results was mainly observed while maintaining the safety of the test to rule out PE. Explanatory factors include the introduction of a combined SPECT/CT scan, increased experience and familiarity with the test, and an increased awareness of the risks and consequences of overdiagnosing PE.","Truffault, Blandine; Robin, Philippe; Tromeur, Cecile; Le Duc Pennec, Alexandra; Abgral, Ronan; Bourhis, David; Couturaud, Francis; Le Gal, Gregoire; Salaun, Pierre-Yves; Le Roux, Pierre-Yves",Nuclear medicine communications,51,5

Infection is also associated with B-cell abnormalities, suggesting an association of the virus with B cells. The infectious JFH-1 strain of HCV can bind primary and immortalized B cells but fails to establish productive infection. However, B cell-associated virus readily infects hepatoma cells, showing an enhanced infectivity compared with extracellular virus. B cells express the viral receptors CD81, SR-BI, and the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Antibodies specific for SR-BI and DC-SIGN/L-SIGN reduced B-cell transinfection, supporting a role for these molecules in B-cell association with HCV. Stimulation of B cells with CD40 ligand and interleukin-4 promoted their ability to transinfect hepatoma cells. B cell-associated virus is resistant to trypsin proteolysis and HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies, consistent with particle internalization. HCV promoted the adhesion of primary B cells to Huh-7 hepatomas, providing a mechanism for B-cell retention in the infected liver. In summary, B cells may provide a vehicle for HCV to persist and transmit to the liver.","Stamataki, Zania; Shannon-Lowe, Claire; Shaw, Jean; Mutimer, David; Rickinson, Alan B; Gordon, John; Adams, David H; Balfe, Peter; McKeating, Jane A",Blood,51,16

METHODS OED reports of patients visited during lockdown (COVID-period) and in the corresponding period of 2017, 2018 and 2019 (COVID-free period) have been retrieved to draw a comparison. Patients' demographic and clinical data recorded and analysed are the following: age, gender, previous ocular history, aetiology, symptoms onset, type of symptoms, discharge diagnosis, urgency and severity of diagnosis. RESULTS OED consultations dropped from 20.6 ± 7.3 visits/day of the COVID-free period to 8.6 ± 4.6 visits/day of the COVID-period. In the COVID-period patients waited longer before physically going to the OED, lamented more vision loss and less redness and reported a higher percentage of traumatic events when compared to the COVID-free period. A significant reduction of ocular surface conditions occurred, while vitreo-retinal disorders increased. Overall, both urgency and severity of diagnosed diseases raised significantly in the COVID-period. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic drove a significant reduction of the overall OED activity. People with less urgent and milder conditions preferred to wait and endure their ocular discomfort for a few days rather than leaving home and risking to contract the infection. Our analysis highlights how several times the OED is used improperly by patients diagnosed with non-urgent disorders. A more accurate use of the OED would allow a reduction of management costs and the avoidance of overcrowding, which can lead to delays in the care of patients that really need assistance.","Elia, Franzolin; Stefano, Casati; Ottavia, Albertini; Giulio, Antonelli; Pierpaolo, Marchetti; Antonio, Bonora; Giorgio, Marchini",European journal of ophthalmology,51,31

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include older age, ethnicity, sex, comorbidities, and living conditions. Although asthmatics and those with allergies are susceptible to more severe outcomes to viral infections, interestingly, asthma has not been reported to be a major comorbidity of COVID-19. However, there are some conflicting reports on the impact of asthma on COVID-19. The underlying immunological and molecular mechanisms may explain at least in part these observations. Furthermore, environmental factors like air pollution that have detrimental effects on asthma and respiratory illnesses also have an impact on COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells that is upregulated by Th1-mediated responses. In asthmatics, ACE2 gene expression is generally reduced and recent studies have shown a negative correlation between the levels of Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in airway epithelial cells and other type 2 biomarkers with ACE2 expression. This may explain in part the potential protective role of asthma on COVID-19. Here, we review the relation of respiratory viral illnesses and asthma, the immune-molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of asthma on COVID-19 and that of SARS-CoV-2 on asthma and allergic rhinitis, and the impact of environmental factors like air pollution on COVID-19. SUMMARY Expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells in SARS-COV-2 is influenced by inflammatory profile. Respiratory allergic diseases like asthma appear to have a protective effect against SARS-COV-2 infection. However, the clinical association between asthma and SARS-COV-2 is not fully established and the underlying immune-molecular mechanisms may explain these observations.","Wakabayashi, Mako; Pawankar, Ruby; Narazaki, Hidehiko; Ueda, Takahiro; Itabashi, Toshikazu",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,51,1

Our aim was to investigate which clinical and laboratory parameters affect measures of TP and to validate its diagnostic accuracy in an independent cohort of patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Seventy-five patients from a prospectively maintained database with proximal occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (M1) were retrospectively analyzed. Thrombi were segmented on coregistered noncontrast computed tomography and CT angiography to determine the thrombus attenuation increase and void fraction (attenuation increase relative to contralateral side). RESULTS TP measures were significantly higher in patients with cardioembolic stroke compared to patients with stroke attributed to large artery atherosclerosis (median thrombus attenuation increase [interquartile range], 2.79 [-3.54 to 8.85] versus -5.11 [-11.23 to -1.47]; P=0.001). In linear regression analysis for TP including age, time to scan, prior medication with antiplatelets or anticoagulants, and selected laboratory parameters, only stroke cause was significantly associated with TP. In multivariable binary logistic regression analysis for dichotomized stroke cause (ie, cardioembolic versus noncardioembolic stroke), only thrombus attenuation increase was independently associated with cardioembolic stroke (odds ratio of 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.22]; P=0.004). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that TP can identify cardioembolic stroke with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.87) for thrombus attenuation increase. With a cutoff value of 6.23 Hounsfield units, cardioembolic strokes were identified with 100% specificity. Results for void fraction were similar. CONCLUSIONS The assessment of TP on baseline noncontrast computed tomography/CT angiography in patients with M1 occlusion may aid in determining cardioembolic stroke cause and guide secondary prevention. Selected clinical and laboratory parameters other than stroke cause did not affect TP measures.","Kufner, Anna; Erdur, Hebun; Endres, Matthias; Nolte, Christian H; Scheel, Michael; Schlemm, Ludwig",Stroke,51,6

Healthcare workers may transmit influenza to patients. OBJECTIVES To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers on the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs). SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to October 2015) and Web of Science (2006 to October 2015), but Biological Abstracts only from 1969 to March 2013 and Science Citation Index-Expanded from 1974 to March 2013 due to lack of institutional access in 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Effects on dichotomous outcomes were measured as risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We identified four cluster-RCTs and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza vaccination for HCWs caring for individuals ≥ 60 years in LTCIs. Four cluster RCTs (5896 residents) provided outcome data that addressed the objectives of our review. The studies were comparable in their study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal sources of bias in the studies related to attrition, lack of blinding, contamination in the control groups and low rates of vaccination coverage in the intervention arms, leading us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes due to serious risk of bias.Offering influenza vaccination to HCWs based in long term care homes may have little or no effect on the number of residents who develop laboratory-proven influenza compared with those living in care homes where no vaccination is offered (RD 0 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.03), two studies with samples taken from 752 participants; low quality evidence). HCW vaccination probably leads to a reduction in lower respiratory tract infection in residents from 6% to 4% (RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.01), one study of 3400 people; moderate quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes may have little or no effect on the number of residents admitted to hospital for respiratory illness (RD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, one study of 1059 people; low quality evidence). We decided not to combine data on deaths from lower respiratory tract infection (two studies of 4459 people) or all cause deaths (four studies of 8468 people). The direction and size of difference in risk varied between the studies. We are uncertain as to the effect of vaccination on these outcomes due to the very low quality of evidence. Adjusted analyses, which took into account the cluster design, did not differ substantively from the pooled analysis with unadjusted data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of HCW vaccination programmes on specific outcomes of laboratory-proven influenza, its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness), or all cause mortality in people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions. This review did not find information on co-interventions with healthcare worker vaccination: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) not to work. This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination.","Thomas, Roger E; Jefferson, Tom; Lasserson, Toby J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,51,31

Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common among African American (AA) communities, where the COVID-19 infection rate is three-fold higher, and the mortality rate nearly six-fold higher, compared with rates in predominantly white communities. COVID-19 infection primarily affects the lungs and airways. Previous reports have linked 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency with subclinical interstitial lung disease. AA are at risk for lower cellular glutathione (GSH) levels, and GSH deficiency epigenetically impairs VD biosynthesis pathway genes. Compared with vitamin D alone, co-supplementation of vitamin D and L-cysteine (a GSH precursor) showed a better efficacy in improving levels of GSH and VD-regulatory genes at the cellular/tissue level, increasing 25(OH) vitamin D levels, and reducing inflammation biomarkers in the blood in mice studies. We propose that randomized clinical trials are needed to examine the potential of co-supplementation with anti-inflammatory antioxidants, vitamin D and L-cysteine in correcting the 25(OH)VD deficiency and preventing the 'cytokine storm,' one of the most severe consequences of infection with COVID-19, thereby preventing the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the vulnerable AA population.","Jain, Sushil K; Parsanathan, Rajesh",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,51,20

Despite its ubiquity in the hospital, consensus on much of its management is lacking. METHODS Representatives from ID, Podiatry, and Pathology interested in quality improvement (QI) developed multidisciplinary institutional recommendations culminating in an educational intervention describing optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to DFO. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by pre- and post-intervention surveys. Inpatients with forefoot DFO were retrospectively reviewed pre- and post- intervention to assess frequency of recommended diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, including appropriate definition of surgical bone margins, definitive histopathology reports, and unnecessary intravenous antibiotics or prolonged antibiotic courses. RESULTS A post-intervention survey revealed significant improvements in knowledge of antibiotic treatment duration and the role of oral antibiotics in managing DFO. There were 104 consecutive patients in the pre-intervention cohort (4/1/2018-4/1/2019) and 32 patients in the post-intervention cohort (11/5/2019-03/01/2020), the latter truncated by changes in hospital practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-categorizable or equivocal pathology reports decreased from pre-intervention to post-intervention (27.0% vs 3.3%, respectively, P=0.006). We observed non-significant improvement in correct bone margin definition (74.0% vs 87.5%, p=0.11), unnecessary PICC line placement (18.3% vs 9.4%, p=0.23), and unnecessary prolonged antibiotics (21.9% vs 5.0%, p=0.10). Additionally, by working as an interdisciplinary group, many solvable misunderstandings were identified, and processes were adjusted to improve the quality of care provided to these patients. CONCLUSIONS This QI initiative regarding management of DFO led to improved provider knowledge and collaborative competency between these three departments, improvements in definitive pathology reports, and non-significant improvement in several other clinical endpoints. Creating collaborative competency may be an effective local strategy to improve knowledge of diabetic foot infection and may generalize to other common multidisciplinary conditions.","Jhaveri, Vimal V; Sullivan, Christopher; Ward, Ashley; Giurini, John; Karchmer, A W; Stillman, Isaac E; Davis, Roger B; Freed, Jason A; LaSalvia, Mary T; Stead, Wendy",Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,51,19

However, TPN-induced hyperglycemia is a predictor of hospital mortality and is associated with increased length of stay. Elevated blood glucose in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is also associated with increased mortality. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) is primarily used in the outpatient setting but there is rapidly growing interest in its applicability to help treat dysglycemia in critically ill patients, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the use of rtCGM data (Dexcom G6) in a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 infection, who developed TPN-induced hyperglycemia with markedly elevated total daily insulin requirements as high as 128 units. rtCGM was used to safely titrate insulin infusion and monitor glucose levels. No episodes of hypoglycemia were observed despite an extremely aggressive insulin regimen. This case demonstrates the potential utility of rtCGM in the critical care setting and highlights its potential to help conserve personal protective equipment and minimize unnecessary staff exposure in the setting of COVID-19.

The clinical significance of sequential rhinovirus infections remains unclear. To determine the incidence and clinical relevance of sequential rhinovirus detections, nasopharyngeal samples from 2485 adults with acute cough/lower respiratory illness were analysed. Patients were enrolled prospectively by general practitioners from 12 European Union countries during three consecutive years (2007-2010). Nasopharyngeal samples were collected at the initial general practitioner consultation and 28 days thereafter and symptom scores were recorded by patients over that period. Rhinovirus RNA was detected in 444 (18%) out of 2485 visit one samples and in 110 (4.4%) out of 2485 visit two respiratory samples. 21 (5%) of the 444 patients had both samples positive for rhinovirus. Genotyping of both virus detections was successful for 17 (81%) out of 21 of these patients. Prolonged rhinovirus shedding occurred in six (35%) out of 21 and re-infection with a different rhinovirus in 11 (65%) out of 21. Rhinovirus re-infections were significantly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.04) and asthma (p=0.02) and appeared to be more severe than prolonged infections. Our findings indicate that in immunocompetent adults rhinovirus re-infections are more common than prolonged infections, and chronic airway comorbidities might predispose to more frequent rhinovirus re-infections.","Zlateva, Kalina T; de Vries, Jutte J C; Coenjaerts, Frank E J; van Loon, Anton M; Verheij, Theo; Little, Paul; Butler, Christopher C; Goossens, Herman; Ieven, Margareta; Claas, Eric C J",The European respiratory journal,51,31

We aimed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose, compared with placebo, on outcomes in patients who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure. METHODS AFFIRM-AHF was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial done at 121 sites in Europe, South America, and Singapore. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were hospitalised for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 μg/L, or 100-299 μg/L with transferrin saturation <20%), and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%. Before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency. To maintain masking of patients and study personnel, treatments were administered in black syringes by personnel not involved in any study assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalisations for heart failure and cardiovascular death up to 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-randomisation data point. Secondary outcomes were the composite of total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; cardiovascular death; total heart failure hospitalisations; time to first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death; and days lost due to heart failure hospitalisations or cardiovascular death, all evaluated up to 52 weeks after randomisation. Safety was assessed in all patients for whom study treatment was started. A pre-COVID-19 sensitivity analysis on the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937454, and has now been completed. FINDINGS Between March 21, 2017, and July 30, 2019, 1525 patients were screened, of whom 1132 patients were randomly assigned to study groups. Study treatment was started in 1110 patients, and 1108 (558 in the carboxymaltose group and 550 in the placebo group) had at least one post-randomisation value. 293 primary events (57·2 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 372 (72·5 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·62-1·01, p=0·059). 370 total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 451 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·64-1·00, p=0·050). There was no difference in cardiovascular death between the two groups (77 [14%] of 558 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 78 [14%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·96, 95% CI 0·70-1·32, p=0·81). 217 total heart failure hospitalisations occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 294 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0·74; 95% CI 0·58-0·94, p=0·013). The composite of first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 181 (32%) patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 209 (38%) in the placebo group (HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·66-0·98, p=0·030). Fewer days were lost due to heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death for patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo (369 days per 100 patient-years vs 548 days per 100 patient-years; RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·47-0·97, p=0·035). Serious adverse events occurred in 250 (45%) of 559 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 282 (51%) of 551 patients in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION In patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.

Respiratory support given to preterm newborns via a single nasal prong (SNP; ie, short nasal tube, nasopharyngeal tube) may be more effective. We wished to determine whether giving respiratory support to preterm newborns with a SNP rather than a FM reduces the rate of intubation in the DR. METHODS Infants <31 weeks' gestation were randomized just before delivery to SNP (endotracheal tube shortened to 5 cm) or FM. Randomization was stratified by gestation (<28 weeks, 28-30(+6)). Infants with apnea, respiratory distress, and/or heart rate <100 received positive pressure ventilation with a T-piece. The primary outcome was intubation and mechanical ventilation in the DR. Infants in both groups were intubated for heart rate <100 and/or apnea despite PPV and not solely for surfactant administration. All other aspects of treatment in the DR and NICU were the same. Relevant secondary outcomes were recorded and data were analyzed by using the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS One hundred forty-four infants were enrolled. The rate of intubation in the DR was the same in both groups (11/72 [15%] vs 11/72 [15%], P = 1.000]. Infants assigned to SNP had lower SpO2 at 5 minutes and received a higher maximum concentration of oxygen in the DR. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Giving respiratory support to newborn infants <31 weeks' gestation via a SNP, compared with a FM, did not result in less intubation and ventilation in the DR.","McCarthy, Lisa K; Twomey, Anne R; Molloy, Eleanor J; Murphy, John F A; O'Donnell, Colm P F",Pediatrics,51,22

To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout. We describe an automatable, portable microfluidic platform for the nucleic acid preparation device that could permit practical, in situ use by nontechnical personnel.","Dignan, Leah M; Woolf, M Shane; Tomley, Christopher J; Nauman, Aeren Q; Landers, James P",Analytical chemistry,51,11

The goal of this study was to evaluate the changes in wounds treated with a hypothermically stored amniotic membrane (HSAM). In this prospective single-arm study, 15 female patients with venous leg ulcers were treated with HSAM from male donors and standard of care for 12 weeks. Over the course of the study, wound exudate was collected and evaluated using proteomic microarrays. Biopsies were collected during the course of treatment to detect the presence of HSAM tissue.

METHODS In this nested case-control study, cases were Olmsted county, Minnesota residents with incident RA (based on 1987 ACR criteria) from 1980-2013 who developed HF after RA incidence. Each case was matched on year of birth, sex and year of RA incidence with an RA control who did not develop HF. Data on HCQ use including start and stop dates and dose changes was reviewed, and used to calculate HCQ duration and cumulative dose. Age-adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the association between HCQ and HF. RESULTS The study identified 143 RA cases diagnosed with HF (mean age 65.8, 62% females) and 143 non-HF RA controls (mean age 64.5, 62% female). HCQ cumulative dose was not associated with HF (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.96 per 100g increase in cumulative dose, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.90-1.03). Likewise, no association was found for patients with a cumulative dose ≥300g (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.41-2.08). The HCQ duration of intake in years prior to index was not associated with HF (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91-1.05). CONCLUSION Use of HCQ was not associated with development of HF in patients with RA in this study. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of higher doses of HCQ on development of HF in RA.","Sorour, Ahmed A; Kurmann, Reto D; Shahin, Youssef E; Crowson, Cynthia S; Achenbach, Sara J; Mankad, Rekha; Myasoedova, Elena",The Journal of rheumatology,51,1

To aid reliability, it is recommended that two researchers carry out data extraction independently. The extraction of statistical data from graphs in PDF files is particularly challenging, as the process is usually completely manual, and reviewers need sometimes to revert to holding a ruler against the page to read off values: an inherently time-consuming and error-prone process. Methods: To mitigate some of the above problems we developed a new web-based graphical data extraction tool to assist reviewers in extracting data from graphs. This tool aims to facilitate more accurate and timely data extraction through a user interface which can be used to extract data through mouse clicks. We carried out a non-inferiority evaluation to examine its performance in comparison to standard practice. Results: We found that our new graphical data extraction tool is not inferior to users' prior preferred current approaches. Our study was not designed to show superiority, but suggests that there may be a saving in time of around 6 minutes per graph, accompanied by a substantial increase in accuracy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the incorporation of this type of tool in online systematic review software would be beneficial in facilitating the production of accurate and timely evidence synthesis to improve decision-making.","Cramond, Fala; O'Mara-Eves, Alison; Doran-Constant, Lee; Rice, Andrew Sc; Macleod, Malcolm; Thomas, James",Wellcome open research,51,1

Its inhibitory activity supersedes that of paromomycin, which is extensively used in treating cryptosporidiosis. Through the per-residue energy decomposition approach, crucial moieties of P131 were identified and subsequently adopted to create a pharmacophore model for virtual screening in the ZINC database. This search generated eight ADMET-compliant hits that were examined thoroughly to fit into the active site of CpIMPDH via molecular docking. Three compounds ZINC46542062, ZINC58646829, and ZINC89780094, with favorable docking scores of - 8.3 kcal/mol, - 8.2 kcal/mol, and - 7.5 kcal/mol, were selected. The potential inhibitory mechanism of these compounds was probed using molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) analyses. Results revealed that one of the hits (ZINC46542062) exhibited a lower binding free energy of - 39.52 kcal/mol than P131, which had - 34.6 kcal/mol. Conformational perturbation induced by the binding of the identified hits to CpIMPDH was similar to P131, suggesting a similarity in inhibitory mechanisms. Also, in silico investigation of the properties of the hit compounds implied superior physicochemical properties with regards to their synthetic accessibility, lipophilicity, and number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors in comparison with P131. ZINC46542062 was identified as a promising hit compound with the highest binding affinity to the target protein and favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties relative to P131. The identified compounds can serve as a basis for conducting further experimental investigations toward the development of anticryptosporidials, which can overcome the challenges of existing therapeutic options.

This was followed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) global targets for the care and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. These announcements and targets were important in raising awareness and calling for action, however, tracking countries' progress toward these elimination goals has provided insights to the limitations of these targets. The existing targets compare a country's progress relative to its 2015 values, penalizing countries who started their programs prior to 2015, countries with a young population, or countries with a low prevalence. We recommend that (1) WHO simplify the hepatitis elimination targets, (2) change to absolute targets and (3) allow countries to achieve these disease targets with their own service coverage initiatives that will have the maximum impact. The recommended targets are: reduce HCV new chronic cases to ≤5 per 100,000, reduce HBV prevalence among 1-year-olds to ≤0.1%, reduce HBV & HCV mortality to ≤5 per 100,000, and demonstrate HBV & HCV year to year decrease in new HCV and HBV related HCC cases. The objective of our recommendations is not to lower expectations or diminish the hepatitis elimination standards; but to provide clearer targets that recognize the past and current elimination efforts by countries, help measure progress toward true elimination, and motivate other countries to follow suit.","Razavi, Homie; Blach, Sarah; Razavi-Shearer, Devin",Journal of viral hepatitis,51,33

The objective of this study was to review economic models to identify, evaluate, and compare cost-effectiveness estimates for HCC treatments. METHODS A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to identify economic evaluations was performed and studies that modeled treatments for HCC reporting costs and cost effectiveness were included. Risk of bias was assessed qualitatively, considering costing approach, reported study perspective, and funding received. Intervention costs were adjusted to 2021 US dollars for comparison. For studies reporting quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), we conducted analyses stratified by comparison type to assess cost effectiveness at the time of the analysis. RESULTS A total of 27 studies were included. Non-curative versus non-curative therapy comparisons were used in 20 (74.1%) studies, curative versus curative comparisons were used in 5 (18.5%) studies, and curative versus non-curative comparisons were used in 2 (7.4%) studies. Therapy effectiveness was estimated using a QALY measure in 20 (74.1%) studies, while 7 (25.9%) studies only assessed life-years gained (LYG). A health sector perspective was used in 26 (96.3%) of the evaluations, with only 1 study including costs beyond this perspective. Median intervention cost was $53,954 (range $4550-$4,760,835), with a median incremental cost of $6546 (range - $72,441 to $1,279,764). In cost-utility analyses, 11 (55%) studies found the intervention cost effective using a $100,000/QALY threshold at the time of the study, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging from - $1,176,091 to $1,152,440 when inflated to 2021 US dollars. CONCLUSION The majority of HCC treatments were found to be cost effective, but with significant variation and with few studies considering indirect costs.

Early recognition reduces morbidity and mortality, and supporting clinicians in ruling out SBIs may limit unnecessary admissions and antibiotic use. METHODS A prospective, diagnostic accuracy study of clinical and biomarker variables in the diagnosis of SBIs (pneumonia or other SBI) in febrile children <16 years old. A diagnostic model was derived by using multinomial logistic regression and internally validated. External validation of a published model was undertaken, followed by model updating and extension by the inclusion of procalcitonin and resistin. RESULTS There were 1101 children studied, of whom 264 had an SBI. A diagnostic model discriminated well between pneumonia and no SBI (concordance statistic 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.78-0.90) and between other SBIs and no SBI (0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.83) on internal validation. A published model discriminated well on external validation. Model updating yielded good calibration with good performance at both high-risk (positive likelihood ratios: 6.46 and 5.13 for pneumonia and other SBI, respectively) and low-risk (negative likelihood ratios: 0.16 and 0.13, respectively) thresholds. Extending the model with procalcitonin and resistin yielded improvements in discrimination. CONCLUSIONS Diagnostic models discriminated well between pneumonia, other SBIs, and no SBI in febrile children in the emergency department. Improvements in the classification of nonevents have the potential to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions and improve antibiotic prescribing. The benefits of this improved risk prediction should be further evaluated in robust impact studies.","Irwin, Adam D; Grant, Alison; Williams, Rhian; Kolamunnage-Dona, Ruwanthi; Drew, Richard J; Paulus, Stephane; Jeffers, Graham; Williams, Kim; Breen, Rachel; Preston, Jennifer; Appelbe, Duncan; Chesters, Christine; Newland, Paul; Marzouk, Omnia; McNamara, Paul S; Diggle, Peter J; Carrol, Enitan D",Pediatrics,51,1

It is believed that biosecurity practices are effective for the prevention and control of such infectious diseases. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether or not an association between biosecurity level and herd productivity, as well as disease status exists on Japanese commercial swine farms. The present study was conducted on 141 farms. Biosecurity in each farm was assessed by a biosecurity assessment tool named BioAsseT. BioAsseT has a full score of 100 and consists of three sections (external biosecurity, internal biosecurity and diagnostic monitoring). Production data for number of pigs weaned per sow per year (PWSY) and post-weaning mortality per year (PWM) were collected for data analysis. Regarding PRRS status, the farms were categorized into two groups: unknown or unstable and stable or negative. In addition, these farms were categorized based on their PED status, either positive or negative. The total BioAsseT score was associated with herd productivity: as total score increased by 1, PWSY increased by 0.104 pigs and PWM decreased by 0.051 % (P < 0.05). Herd productivity was associated with the score of external and internal biosecurity (P < 0.05), but did not correlate with the score of diagnostic monitoring. Regarding PRRS status, farms with an unknown or unstable status had lower total score than those with stable or negative status (P < 0.05). Similarly, PED positive farms had a lower total score compared to PED negative farms (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the association between high biosecurity levels and increased herd productivity as well as a decreased risk for novel introductions of infectious diseases such as PED.","Sasaki, Yosuke; Furutani, Aina; Furuichi, Tomohiro; Hayakawa, Yuiko; Ishizeki, Sayoko; Kano, Rika; Koike, Fumiko; Miyashita, Mali; Mizukami, Yoshihiro; Watanabe, Yugo; Otake, Satoshi",Preventive veterinary medicine,51,1

In addition, little is known about the association with distinct stroke symptoms, not summarized as classical lacunar syndromes. We aimed to describe the spatial lesion distribution of acute supra- and infratentorial lacunar infarcts and their association with stroke symptoms in patients eligible for thrombolysis. Methods All patients enrolled in the WAKE-UP trial (efficacy and safety of magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-based thrombolysis in wake-up stroke) were screened for lacunar infarcts on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The relationship between the anatomical distribution of supra- and infratentorial lacunar infarcts, their demographic characteristics and acute stroke symptoms, defined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, were correlated and compared. Results Maps of lesion distribution from 224 lacunar infarct patients (76 [33.9%] females, mean age [standard deviation] of 63.4 [11.5] years) were generated using computational image mapping methods. Median infarct volume was 0.73 ml (interquartile range [IQR] 0.37-1.15 ml). Median NIHSS sum score on hospital arrival was 4 (IQR 3-6). 165 (73.7%) patients had lacunar infarcts in the supratentorial deep white or grey matter, while 59 (26.3%) patients had infratentorial lacunar infarcts. Patients with supratentorial lacunar infarcts presented with a significantly lower occurrence of deficits in the NIHSS items gaze (p < 0.001) and dysarthria (p = 0.008), but had more often a paresis of the left arm (p = 0.009) and left leg (p = 0.068) compared to patients with infratentorial infarcts.

This study aimed to identify whether evaluation by cardiologists could reduce mortality in MINS patients. METHODS From a single-centre retrospective cohort, we enrolled a total of 5633 adult patients diagnosed with MINS between January 2010 and June 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on evaluation by cardiologist, which was defined as a cardiology consultation or transfer to the cardiology department. For the outcome, 30-day mortality was compared in crude and propensity-score matched populations. RESULTS Of a total of 5633 patients, 2120 (37.6%) were evaluated by cardiologists and 3513 (62.4%) were not. Mortality during the first 30 days after surgery was significantly lower in MINS patients who were evaluated by cardiologists compared with those who were not (5.8% vs 8.3%; HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001 for all-cause mortality and 1.6% vs 2.0; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96; p=0.03 for cardiovascular mortality). The propensity score matched analysis showed similar results (5.6% vs 8.6%; HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; p<0.001 for all-cause mortality and 1.3% vs 2.2%; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; p=0.03 for cardiovascular mortality).

The use of five separate recipient vessels is highlighted in a unique case of recurrent locally advanced breast cancer requiring multiple complex reconstructions using free tissue transfer. A 56-year-old lady presented for delayed breast reconstruction one year after radical mastectomy for locally advanced lobular breast cancer. Despite wide resections, local chest-wall recurrence five times necessitated five microsurgical reconstructions, using separate recipient pedicles: internal mammary vessels, thoracodorsal vessels, serratus branch of thoracodorsal vessels, intercostal vessels and thoracoacromial vessels. All flaps survived completely, without donor or recipient complications. There has not been a subsequent recurrence at 6 months since last reconstruction. The purpose of this report is to present the first reported case of microsurgical chest wall reconstruction using five separate free flaps requiring anastomosis to multiple recipient vessels for anterior chest wall coverage, to present a literature-based and clinical review of the regional vascular anatomy of the anterior chest wall, and to present an operative approach algorithm. In such complex cases, this understanding can facilitate a streamlined approach to management. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mechanisms regulating granulomatous inflammation remain ill-understood. CD154, the ligand of CD40, is a key mediator of inflammation. CD154 confers a proinflammatory phenotype to macrophages and controls several macrophagic functions. Here, we studied the contribution of CD154 in a mouse model of toxic liver injury with carbon tetrachloride and a model of absorbable suture graft. In both models, granulomas are triggered in response to endogenous persistent liver calcified necrotic lesions or by grafted sutures. CD154-deficient mice showed delayed clearance of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver calcified necrotic lesions and impaired progression of suture-induced granuloma. In vitro, CD154 stimulated phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes by macrophages, suggesting a potential mechanism for the altered granulomatous inflammation in CD154KO mice. These results suggest that CD154 may contribute to the natural history of granulomatous inflammation.","Villeneuve, Julien; Desmoulière, Alexis; Dewitte, Antoine; Bordeau, Nelly; Costet, Pierre; Bassaganyas, Laia; Fricain, Jean-Christophe; Ripoche, Jean; Lepreux, Sébastien",Mediators of inflammation,51,5

METHODS We reviewed patients with GAVE who underwent treatment at University of Alabama at Birmingham between March 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. Included patients had an endoscopic diagnosis of GAVE with associated upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. RESULTS Seven out of 15 patients had classic watermelon description for GAVE, 1/15 with diffuse/honeycomb pattern and 6/15 with nodular GAVE per EGD description. Seven out of 15 patients required multimodal treatment. Four out of six of patients with endoscopically nodular GAVE required multimodal therapy. Overall, mean pre- and post-treatment hemoglobin (Hb) values were 8.2 ± 0.8 g/dL and 9.7 ± 1.6 g/dL, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Mean number of packed red blood cells transfusions before and after treatment was 3.8 ± 4.3 and 1.2 ± 1.7 (P ≤ 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION Patients with nodular variant GAVE required multimodal approach more frequently than non-nodular variants. Patients responded well to multimodal therapy and saw decrease in transfusion rates and increase in Hb concentrations. Our findings suggest a multimodal approach may be beneficial in nodular variant GAVE.","Matin, Tasnia; Naseemuddin, Mohammed; Shoreibah, Mohamed; Li, Peng; Kyanam Kabir Baig, Kondal; Wilcox, Charles Mel; Peter, Shajan",World journal of gastrointestinal endoscopy,51,27

Significant inter- and intra- patient variability in lung mechanics and condition makes managing MV difficult. Accurate prediction of patient-specific response to changes in MV settings would enable optimised, personalised, and more productive care, improving outcomes and reducing cost. This study develops a generalised digital clone model, or in-silico virtual patient, to accurately predict lung mechanics in response to changes in MV. METHODS An identifiable, nonlinear hysteresis loop model (HLM) captures patient-specific lung dynamics identified from measured ventilator data. Identification and creation of the virtual patient model is fully automated using the hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method to identify lung elastances from clinical data. Performance is evaluated using clinical data from 18 volume-control (VC) and 14 pressure-control (PC) ventilated patients who underwent step-wise recruitment maneuvers. RESULTS Patient-specific virtual patient models accurately predict lung response for changes in PEEP up to 12 cmH2O for both volume and pressure control cohorts. R2 values for predicting peak inspiration pressure (PIP) and additional retained lung volume, Vfrc in VC, are R2=0.86 and R2=0.90 for 106 predictions over 18 patients. For 14 PC patients and 84 predictions, predicting peak inspiratory volume (PIV) and Vfrc yield R2=0.86 and R2=0.83. Absolute PIP, PIV and Vfrc errors are relatively small. CONCLUSIONS Overall results validate the accuracy and versatility of the virtual patient model for capturing and predicting nonlinear changes in patient-specific lung mechanics. Accurate response prediction enables mechanically and physiologically relevant virtual patients to guide personalised and optimised MV therapy.","Zhou, Cong; Chase, J Geoffrey; Knopp, Jennifer; Sun, Qianhui; Tawhai, Merryn; Möller, Knut; Heines, Serge J; Bergmans, Dennis C; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Desaive, Thomas",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,51,24

Regarding cultivars widespread in the Serra Gaucha, about 90 % of the area is occupied by vines of Vitis labrusca that is the most important specie used in grape juice production. The objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and neuroprotective effect of chronic intake of purple grape juice (organic and conventional) from Bordo variety (V. labrusca) on oxidative stress in different brain regions of rats supplemented with high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 months. A total of 40 male rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 received a standard diet and water, group 2 HFD and water, group 3 HFD and conventional grape juice (CGJ), and group 4 HFD and organic grape juice (OGJ). All groups had free access to food and drink and after 3 months of treatment the rats were euthanized by decapitation and the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum isolated and homogenized on ice for oxidative stress analysis. We observed that the consumption of calories in HFD and control groups, were higher than the groups supplemented with HFD and grape juices and that HFD diet group gain more weight than the other animals. Our results also demonstrated that HDF enhanced lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein damage (carbonyl) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, reduced the non-enzymatic antioxidants defenses (sulfhydryl) in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, reduced catalase and superoxide dismutase activities in all brain tissues and enhanced nitric oxide production in all cerebral tissues. CGJ and OGJ were able to ameliorate these oxidative alterations, being OGJ more effective in this protection. Therefore, grape juices could be useful in the treatment of some neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative damage.","Cardozo, Marcia Gilceane; Medeiros, Niara; Lacerda, Denise dos Santos; de Almeida, Daniela Campos; Henriques, João Antônio Pegas; Dani, Caroline; Funchal, Cláudia",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,51,24

METHODS Retrospective analysis of the recordings obtained from 26 subjects ventilated on proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors under different conditions, each considered as an experimental case. The estimated inspiratory output (peak Pmus) and effort (PTP-peak Pmus) were compared with the actual-determined by the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure- and the derived PTP. Validation of the algorithm was performed by assessing the accuracy of peak Pmus in predicting the actual inspiratory muscle effort and indicating the appropriate level of assist. RESULTS In the 63 experimental cases analyzed, a limited agreement was observed between the estimated and the actual inspiratory muscle pressure (-11 to 10 cm H2O) and effort (-82 to 125 cm H2O × s/min). The sensitivity and specificity of peak Pmus to predict the range of the actual inspiratory effort was 81.2% and 58.1%, respectively. In 49% of experimental cases, the level of assist indicated by the algorithm differed from that indicated by the transdiaphragmatic pressure and PTP.

Furthermore, the association of inflammation parameters, disease severity and obstetric complications with VEGF-A was investigated. METHODS This prospective case-control study was conducted on pregnant women who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital between 14 June 2020 and 28 August 2020. Pregnant women with COVID-19 (n=95) were compared with a control group of healthy pregnant women (n=92) with similar clinical and demographic characteristics. Demographic featues, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, VEGF-A values were compared between the groups. A correlation analysis was performed between VEGF-A levels, inflammation parameters and clinical characteristics of the cases for pregnant women with COVID-19. VEGF-A levels were also compared between patients with composite adverse outcome and patients without any complication in the COVID-19 group. RESULTS Two groups were similar except for obstetric complications (p>0.05). Obstetric complication rate was higher in the COVID-19 group (p=0.02). Two groups were comparable in terms of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and VEGF-A values. VEGF-A values were slightly different between the trimesters. A negative moderate statistically significant correlation was found between the neutrophil and VEGF-A values (r=-0.231, p=0.02).VEGF-A values were similar between patients with and without composite adverse outcomes (p>0.05).

Among the 431 participants, the mean age ± SD (years) was 53.8 ± 13.7 and 60.1% (n= 259) were females. Participants mainly reported difficulties in accessing medication (n=198, 45.9%), reduced supplies or unavailability of medications (n=213, 49.4%), nonadherence to medications due to lack of access (n=98, 22.7%) and high costs (n=85, 19.7%).

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for amyloid-β peptides, tau species, and various neurodegenerative and inflammatory analytes are leading the way in this regard, yet there is room for improved sensitivity and specificity. In particular tau is known to be present in many different fragments, conformations, and post-translationally modified forms. While the exact tau species that might best reflect AD pathology is unknown, a growing body of evidence suggests that forms with high levels of phosphorylation in the mid-region may be especially enriched in AD. OBJECTIVE Develop an assay for measuring p217tau in CSF. METHODS Here we describe the development and validation of a novel sELISA for measuring CSF tau species containing phosphorylation at threonines 212 & 217, aka p217 + tau, using the PT3 antibody. RESULTS While the analyte is present at extremely low levels the assay is sufficiently sensitive and specific to quantitate p217 + tau with excellent precision, accuracy, and dilution linearity, allowing good differentiation between diagnostic subgroups. The p217 + tau measurements appear to track AD pathology better than the commonly used p181tau epitope, suggesting superior diagnostic and staging performance. Finally, the assay can also be configured to differentiate antibody-bound versus antibody-free tau, and therefore can be used to measure target engagement by p217 + tau-targeting immunotherapeutics. CONCLUSION The assay for measuring p217 + tau described here is highly sensitive, accurate, precise, dilution linear, and shows good potential for identifying and staging AD.","Triana-Baltzer, Gallen; Van Kolen, Kristof; Theunis, Clara; Moughadam, Setareh; Slemmon, Randy; Mercken, Marc; Galpern, Wendy; Sun, Hong; Kolb, Hartmuth",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,51,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 175 computed tomography (CT)-guided ablation sessions performed on 109 patients (43 males and 66 females, mean age: 56.6 years). Seventeen patients with 22 lesions underwent LITT treatment (tumour size: 1.2-4.8 cm), 29 patients with 49 lesions underwent RFA (tumour size: 0.8-4.5 cm) and 63 patients with 104 lesions underwent MWA treatment (tumour size: 0.6-5 cm). CT scans were performed 24-h post-therapy and on follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS The overall-survival rates at 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year were 93.8, 56.3, 50.0 and 31.3% for patients treated with LITT; 81.5, 50.0, 45.5 and 24.2% for patients treated with RFA and 97.6, 79.9, 62.3 and 45.4% for patients treated with MWA, respectively. The mean survival time was 34.14 months for MWA, 34.79 months for RFA and 35.32 months for LITT. In paired comparison, a significant difference could be detected between MWA versus RFA (p = 0.032). The progression-free survival showed a median of 23.49 ± 0.62 months for MWA,19.88 ± 2.17 months for LITT and 16.66 ± 0.66 months for RFA (p = 0.048). The lowest recurrence rate was detected in lesions ablated with MWA (7.7%; 8 of 104 lesions) followed by RFA (20.4%; 10 of 49 lesions) and LITT (27.3%; 6 of 22 lesions) p value of 0.012. Pneumothorax was detected in 22.16% of MWA ablations, 22.73% of LITT ablations and 14.23% of RFA ablations. CONCLUSION LITT, RFA and MWA may provide an effective therapeutic option for non-colorectal cancer lung metastases with an advantage for MWA regarding local tumour control and progression-free survival rate.","Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin A; Exner, Sybille; Al-Subhi, Mohammed; Naguib, Nagy N N; Kaltenbach, Benjamin; Roman, Andrei; Vogl, Thomas J","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",51,1

However, flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices are mostly built on polymers or glass substrates which lack suitable epitaxy seeds for the orientation control. Applying cubic-structure seeds, it was possible to fabricate polar c-plane and nonpolar m-plane aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films epitaxially on flexible Hastelloy substrates through minimizing the lattice mismatch. The growth is predicted of c-plane and m-plane AZO on cubic buffers with lattice parameters of 3.94-4.63 Å and 5.20-5.60 Å, respectively. The ∼80 nm-thick m-plane AZO film has a resistivity of ∼11.43 ± 0.01 × 10-4 Ω cm, while the c-plane AZO film shows a resistivity of ∼2.68 ± 0.02 × 10-4 Ω cm comparable to commercial indium tin oxide films. An abnormally higher carrier concentration in the c-plane than in the m-plane AZO film results from the electrical polarity along the c-axis. The resistivity of the c-plane AZO film drops to the order of 10-5 Ω cm at 500 K owing to the semiconducting behaviour. Epitaxial AZO films with low resistivities and controllable orientations on flexible substrates offer optimal transparent electrodes and epitaxy seeds for high-performance flexible ZnO devices.","Li, Yongkuan; Liu, Xinxing; Wen, Dan; Lv, Kai; Zhou, Gang; Zhao, Yue; Xu, Congkang; Wang, Jiangyong","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",51,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Liver cancer patients undergoing TACE plus partial segment ablation from 2012 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics were collected. TACE was performed for all patients before ablation. After ablation, CT imagings were used to evaluate treatment and follow-up. Overall survival (OS) and local tumor progression free survival (LTPFS) were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-three patients with 68 liver tumors were included. The median tumor maximum diameter was 55 mm (range, 24 to 91 mm). The complete response rate of combination therapy was 87%. The one-, two-, three- and four-year overall survival rates were 78%, 65%, 54% and 54%, respectively. The three-year survival rate for BCLC stage C HCC patients was 53%. The one-, two- and three-year LTPFS rates were 54%, 35% and 35%, respectively. Tumor maximum diameter, vascular invasion and partial treatment response were independent risk factors for LTPFS. Only one patient suffered a major complication. CONCLUSION TACE combined with partial hepatic segment thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for liver cancer patients, especially for those with more advanced disease.","Wang, Yang; Ma, Liang; Sheng, Shoupeng; Yuan, Zhuhui; Zheng, Jiasheng; Li, Wei",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,51,17

We seek to assess the effect of social isolation on anxiety, sleep quality and quality of life for elite athletes. METHODS 206 athletes from collective and individual sports (116 men and 90 women) participated in the present study, with an average age of 24.61 ± 8.73 years. Time devoted to physical training before and during the pandemic was assessed. Assessment of anxiety symptoms, sleep quality and mood were assessed using semi-structured questionnaires. RESULTS There was a reduction in hours dedicated to training, as well as in training sessions for both groups evaluated. There is a high prevalence (> 90%) of anxiety symptoms (medium and high) in both groups. There were no major losses in the sleep quality of the athletes (> 75% presented regular to very good sleep). CONCLUSIONS There are no differences regarding the traits and state of anxiety between athletes of collective and individual modalities. However, both groups showed traces of anxiety, which, from the point of view of health, becomes worrying.","Soares, Leôncio L; Leite, Luciano B; Guilherme, Larissa Q; Rezende, Leonardo M; Noce, Franco; Pussieldi, Guilherme",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,51,23

Recent data suggest that outcomes following embolization and resection may have worsened in the Onyx era. It has been hypothesized that there may be increased complications with Onyx embolization and increased surgical aggressiveness in patients treated with Onyx. In this study the authors analyzed their institutional experience with the endovascular treatment of cerebral AVMs prior to and after the introduction of Onyx to determine factors associated with periprocedural neurological morbidity and mortality. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of all patients with cerebral AVMs undergoing embolization at the Barrow Neurological Institute from 1995 to 2012. RESULTS Endovascular treatment of 342 cerebral AVMs was performed over 446 treatment sessions (mean age 37.8 years, range 1-83 years). Clinical presentation included hemorrhage in 47.6%, seizures in 21.9%, headaches in 11.1%, and no symptoms in 10% of cases. The endovascular pretreatment strategy was preoperative in 78.9%, preradiosurgery in 9.1%, palliative in 5.3%, targeted in 4.4%, and curative in 2.3%. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was III. The mean number of arteries embolized was 3.5 (range 0-13 arteries), and the mean number of treatment sessions was 1.3 (range 1-4 sessions). Onyx was used in 105 AVMs (30.7%), and N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) without Onyx was used in 229 AVMs (67%). AVMs treated with Onyx had a higher mean number of arterial pedicles embolized than did NBCA cases (4.3 ± 2.7 vs 3.2 ± 2.4, respectively; p < 0.001) and a greater number of sessions (1.5 ± 0.7 vs 1.2 ± 0.5, respectively; p < 0.05). Unexpected immediate postprocedural permanent neurological deficits were present in 9.6% of AVMs, while transient deficits were present in 1.8%. There was 1 death (0.3%). Spetzler-Martin grade was not associated with differences in outcome, as permanent neurological deficits were observed in 12%, 9%, 13%, 11%, and 13% of AVMs for Spetzler-Martin Grades I-V, respectively (p = 0.91). The use of Onyx compared with NBCA was not associated with differences in periprocedural morbidity (p = 0.23). This lack of a difference persisted even when controlling for number of arteries and sessions (p = 0.14). Sex was not associated with differences in outcome. CONCLUSIONS Permanent and transient postprocedural neurological deficits were noted in 9.6% and 1.8% of all cases, respectively. AVM grade was not associated with endovascular outcome. Despite the greater number of sessions required and arteries embolized for Onyx cases, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of neurological deficits following cerebral AVM embolization with Onyx and NBCA.","Crowley, R Webster; Ducruet, Andrew F; Kalani, M Yashar S; Kim, Louis J; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,51,15

Two animals required a supplemental dose for safe handling (additive dose used in calculating means) and a third animal was not adequately sedated despite a supplemental dose. Bison immobilized with NalMed-A showed good sedation in 12 of 13 handling attempts. Advantages of this drug combination included a relatively low delivery volume, rapid antagonism, and minimal regulatory burden for component drugs. The most consistent disadvantage was hypoxemia, and oxygen supplementation is recommended when using this sedative combination in bison.","Wolfe, Lisa L; Wood, Mary E; Nol, Pauline; McCollum, Matthew P; Fisher, Mark C; Lance, William R",Journal of wildlife diseases,51,31

Here, we assessed the hypothesis that there is a link between reactive oxygen species levels in leaves and TSNA formation during curing. First, we show that burley varieties KT 204LC and NCBH 129LC accumulate TSNAs to different levels but not as a result of a variety-specific abundance of TSNA precursors. Next, we measured the levels of reactive oxygen species, and we show that the variety that accumulates more TSNAs, NCBH 129LC, had significantly higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than KT 204LC. The NCBH 129LC also has more oxidatively damaged and glutathionylated proteins. Finally, we analyzed the antioxidant levels in KT 204LC and NCBH 129LC and their tolerance to oxidative stress. NCBH 129LC contained more of the essential antioxidant glutathione and was more tolerant to the oxidative stress-generating compound paraquat. Collectively, our data suggest that there is indeed a link between foliar oxidative stress parameters and the extent to which TSNAs accumulate in cured tobacco leaves.","Kurepa, Jasmina; Shull, Timothy E; Fisher, Anne; Fisher, Colin; Ji, Huihua; Smalle, Jan A",Journal of plant physiology,51,1

However, it is contraindicated in patients with previous abdominal surgery, because of a higher risk of enteric injury, technical difficulties associated with adhesions, and longer operative times. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and clinical outcomes of LAG in patients who had previously undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2008 and May 2012, we performed laparoscopic gastrectomies in 17 patients with remnant stomach cancer who had previously undergone open gastrectomy (10 patients) or LAG (7 patients) for early gastric cancer. We performed laparoscopic distal gastrectomies with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy in 10 patients, and laparoscopic total gastrectomies in 7 patients. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to open surgery or intraoperative transfusion. One patient with postoperative bleeding received a transfusion of 4 U of blood. There were 2 cases of serious postoperative complications: 1 internal herniation and 1 anastomosis leakage. One patient experienced tractitis at the trocar site. All patients had tumor-free resection margins, and there were no mortalities. CONCLUSION LAG is a safe and realistic treatment for patients who have previously undergone gastrectomy, although it may be associated with an increased need for adhesiolysis and longer surgery times.","Kim, Hee Sung; Kim, Beom Su; Lee, In Seob; Lee, Sol; Yook, Jeoung Hwan; Kim, Byung Sik","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",51,1

[18F]FMISO is an established tracer but requires substantial accumulation time, limiting its use in hyperacute AIS. [64Cu]CuATSM requires less accumulation time and has shown promise as a hypoxia tracer. We compared these tracers in a M2-occlusion model (M2CAO) with preserved collateral blood flow. Rats underwent M2CAO and [18F]FMISO (n = 12) or [64Cu]CuATSM (n = 6) examinations. [64Cu]CuATSM animals were also examined with MRI. Pimonidazole was used as a surrogate for [18F]FMISO in an immunofluorescence analysis employed to profile levels of hypoxia in neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (GFAP). There was increased [18F]FMISO uptake in the M2CAO cortex. No increase in [64Cu]CuATSM activity was found. The pimonidazole intensity of neurons and astrocytes was increased in hypoxic regions. The pimonidazole intensity ratio was higher in neurons than in astrocytes. In the majority of animals, immunofluorescence revealed a loss of astrocytes within the core of regions with increased pimonidazole uptake. We conclude that [18F]FMISO is superior to [64Cu]CuATSM in detecting hypoxia in AIS, consistent with an earlier study. [18F]FMISO may provide efficient diagnostic imaging beyond the hyperacute phase. Results do not provide encouragement for the use of [64Cu]CuATSM in experimental AIS.","Little, Philip V; Arnberg, Fabian; Jussing, Emma; Lu, Li; Ingemann Jensen, Andreas; Mitsios, Nicholas; Mulder, Jan; Tran, Thuy A; Holmin, Staffan",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,51,1

We fit available daily data since the first diagnosed case until the end of June 2020 and we forecast possible scenarios of contagion associated with different levels of social distancing measures and travel inflows. We determine the initial reproductive transmission rate in Lebanon and all subsequent dynamics. In the repeated iterations (RI) model we iterate the available data of currently infected people to forecast future infections under several possible scenarios of contagion. In both models, our results suggest that tougher mitigation measures would slow down the spread of the disease. On the other hand, the current relaxation of measures and partial resumption of international flights, as the STEIR reveals, would trigger a second outbreak of infections, with severity depending on the extent of relaxation. We recommend strong institutional and public commitment to mitigation measures to avoid uncontrolled spread.","Deeb, Omar El; Jalloul, Maya",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,51,5

Using data covering a 5.3 year baseline after accounting for gravitational time delays, we find models that can reproduce the observed emission-line spectra and integrated CIV fluctuations. The models suggest a thick disk BLR that is inclined by $\sim$40 degrees to the observer's line of sight and with a emissivity weighted median radius of $r_{\rm median} = 33.0^{+2.4}_{-2.1}$ light days. The kinematics are dominated by near-circular Keplerian motion with the remainder inflowing. The rest-frame lag one would measure from the models is $\tau_{\rm median} = 36.4^{+1.8}_{-1.8}$ days, which is consistent with measurements based on cross-correlation.

The survey items, domains, entire instruments, and implementation considerations to develop a sexual health survey were solicited via a global crowdsourcing open call. The open call received 175 contributions from 49 countries. Following review of submissions from the open call, 18 finalists and eight facilitators with expertise in sexual health research, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), were invited to a 3-day hackathon to harmonize a survey instrument. Consensus was achieved through an iterative, modified Delphi process that included three rounds of online surveys.

The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. Importance ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.","Davis, James J.; Long, S.

An obvious caveat is that several reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are blind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead individuals to search for health-related information, masking the disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here, we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19) and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply by using less (better) data.

As testing is limited early in development, it is difficult to predefine these optimal specifications, prioritize or continue investment in candidate interventions. Mathematical models of disease can provide quantitative evidence as they can simulate deployment and predict impact of a new intervention considering deployment, health-system, population and disease characteristics. However, due to large uncertainty early in development, as well as model complexity, testing all possible combinations of interventions and deployments becomes infeasible. As a result, mathematical models have been only marginally used during intervention development to date. Here, we present a new approach where machine learning enables the use of detailed disease models to identify optimal properties of candidate interventions to reach a desired health goal and guide development. We demonstrate the power of our approach by application to five novel malaria interventions under development. For various targeted reductions of malaria prevalence, we quantify and rank intervention characteristics which are key determinants of health impact. Furthermore, we identify minimal requirements and tradeoffs between operational factors, intervention efficacy and duration to achieve different levels of impact and show how these vary across disease transmission settings. When single interventions cannot achieve significant impact, our method allows finding optimal combinations of interventions fulfilling the desired health goals. By enabling efficient use of disease models, our approach supports decision-making and resource investment in the development of new interventions for infectious diseases.","Golumbeanu, M.; Yang, G.; Camponovo, F.; Stuckey, E.

It was aimed to develop an advanced and reliable predicting model that provides future forecasts of possible confirmed cases and mortality rates (Total Deaths per 1 million Population of COVID-19) that could help the public health authorities to develop plans required to resolve the crisis of the pandemic threat in a timely and efficient manner. The study focused on predicting the mortality rates of COVID-19 because the mortality rate determines the prevalence of highly contagious diseases. The Genetic algorithm (GA) has the capability of improving the forecasting performance of the ARIMA model by optimizing the ARIMA model parameters. The findings of this study revealed the high prediction accuracy of the proposed (GA-ARIMA) model. Moreover, it has provided better and consistent predictions compared to the traditional ARIMA model and can be a reliable method in predicting expected death rates as well as confirmed cases of COVID-19. Hence, it was concluded that combining ARIMA with GA is further accurate than ARIMA alone and GA can be an alternative to find the parameters and model orders for the ARIMA model. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Deif, M.

How safe haven properties of precious metals change by the severity and the duration of shocks? and whether precious metals have hedge properties or not in normal conditions against different stock markets. Design/methodology/approach: To analyze the time-varying behavior of precious metals with respect to stock market returns, the authors used the rolling window approach. After obtaining the time-varying beta series that way, the authors regressed the beta series on different severities of stock market shocks. Findings: The findings show that the number of safe haven precious metals increases in the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to the GFC. Furthermore, the number of safe haven precious metals increases as the severity of shocks increases and the duration of them extended. Finally, in the absence of an extreme market condition, only gold has strong hedge asset properties. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that examines the safe haven and hedge properties of all tradable precious metals against seven major stock markets. Besides this, it presents a comparative analysis for the safe haven properties of precious metals in terms of two major crises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Kangalli Uyar, S.

Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several type of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for the treatment of cancer. A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus found a significant CK2 kinase activity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300, originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary results show an antiviral activity of CIGB-300 versus a surrogate model of coronavirus. Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidences at the molecular level of how CIGB-300 might interfere with SARS-CoV-2 life cycle inside infected human cells. First, from SARS-CoV studies, we infer the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on immune response. Next, from the analysis of multiple Omics data, we propose the action of CIGB-300 since early stage of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery. It was also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, we provide evidences of CIGB-300 attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders.","Miranda, Jamilet; Bringas, Ricardo; Fernández-de-Cossio, Jorge; Perera, Yasser",bioRxiv,51,1

Following the positive results achieved with the injectivity test, a polymer interwell pilot test started in the last months of 2019, but it was suspended in April 2020 due to Covid restrictions. Thanks to the acquired data during the pilot test, polymer model was tuned into a dedicated sector of the reservoir model, including one injector and two producers. Using internal company EOR-screening tools, polymer flooding was identified as the most suitable technology for the asset. An integrated study of 3D-modeling and in-house laboratory activities was performed to assess polymer injection potentialities and select the best chemical product for the asset. 3D dynamic analyses confirm the benefits of polymer injection with a significant oil production gain. Four representative horizontal wells were selected for the injectivity test in order to confirm the injection effectiveness. The selection of injectors was based on an extensive analyses of wells status and performance. The test strategy consisted of 2-weeks polymer injection per well, at constant injection rate and increasing polymer concentration steps. A detailed real-Time surveillance plan was realized to monitor injector pressures and polymer solution properties. The injectivity test was concluded successfully: Target viscosity, defined during the laboratory and modeling analyses, was achieved with a limited impact on injectivity. Pressure increase and stabilization during polymer injection confirmed the feasibility of the technique for the reservoir. Well test and temperature profile acquired before and after polymer injection were interpreted. Once assessed the feasibility of polymer injectivity, a 1-year inter-well pilot started in November 2019. Injection took place up to March 2020 and was suspended due to Covid restrictions. The re-start is planned for mid-2021. During the test several injection and production data were gathered, analyzed and interpreted. In addition to that, starting from the full reservoir model, a detailed sector model was set up in order to match pressures and water cut and forecast the performances of polymer injection. © IOR 2021 - 21st European Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery.","Pepe, T.; Martin, M.; Galeazzi, P.; Masserano, F.; De Simoni, M.; Bartosek, M.; Furlani, S.; Salvi, V.; Giraud, H.","21st European Symposium on Improved Oil Recovery, IOR 2021",51,22

We organised the study during the first waves of Covid-19. To conceptualise how ?deregulated bodies? have been structured into the industry as the exchange condition of work, we draw on the work of transnational feminist and Marxist scholars. The study provides insights about how a gendered GPN emerged under the neoliberal development regime;the pattern of work and work conditions are innately linked to volatile market conditions. By documenting workers? lived experiences, the paper enhances our empirical understanding of how workers depend upon work, and how a form of expendable but regulated life linked with work has been embedded in GPN. Our findings reveal that unlike those of other human beings, workers? bodies do not need to be regulated by norms that enable protection from Covid-19. As for the workers, work implies earning for living and survival, so ?live or be left to die? becomes the fundamental employment condition, and the possibility of their death an overlooked consideration. This reality has not changed or been challenged, despite the existence of compliance regimes. We further argue that as scholars, we bear a responsibility to consider how we engage in research on the implications of such organisation practices in a global environment, when all of us are experiencing the pandemic.","Alamgir, Fahreen Alamgir Fariba Irina Alamgir Faria",Organization,51,1

We have applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of stable and ALAD patients to determine key cellular elements in dysfunctional lung allografts. Our particular focus here is on studying alveolar macrophages (AMs) as scRNAseq enables us to elucidate their heterogeneity and possible association with ALAD where our knowledge from cytometry-based assays is very limited. Methods Fresh bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 6 LT patients, 3 with stable lung function (3044 ± 1519 cells) and 3 undergoing an episode of ALAD (2593 ± 904 cells) were used for scRNAseq. R Bioconductor and Seurat were used to perform QC, dimensionality reduction, annotation, pathway analysis, and trajectory. Donor and recipient deconvolution was performed using single nucleotide variations. Results Our data revealed that AMs are highly heterogeneous (12 transcriptionally distinct subsets in stable). We identified two AM subsets uniquely represented in ALAD. Based on pathway analysis and the top differentially expressed genes in BAL we annotated them as pro-inflammatory interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and metallothioneins-mediated inflammatory (MT). Pseudotime analysis suggested that ISG AMs represent an earlier stage of differentiation which may suggest them as monocyte drive macrophages. Our functional analysis on an independent set of BAL samples shows that ALAD samples have significantly higher expression of CXCL10, a marker of ISG AM, as we as higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Single nucleotide variation calling algorithm has allowed us to identify macrophages of donor origin and demonstrated that donor AMs are lost with time post-transplant. Conclusion Using scRNAseq, we observed AMs heterogeneity and identified specific subsets that may be associated with allograft dysfunction. Further exploration with scRNAseq will shed light on LT immunobiology and the role of AMs in allograft injury and dysfunction.","Moshkelgosha, Sajad; Wilson, Gavin; Duong, Allen; Andrews, Tallulah; Berra, Gregory; Renaud-Picard, Benjamin; Keshavjee, Shaf; Martinu, Tereza; MacParland, Sonya; Yeung, Jonathan; Juvet, Stephen",bioRxiv,51,22

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey approach was used to collect data. A sample of 300 fulltime employees, having administrative and teaching responsibilities participated using a self-completion questionnaire. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), correlation and multiple regressions to determine the impact of external factors on the commitment in use of technology. Findings: Overall, the results provided evidence that organization technical support, organization administrative support, and organization infrastructure and resources have a significant positive impact on the commitment in use of technology. However, organization ICT policy has an insignificant negative impact on the commitment in use of technology. The findings could be generalized on other public sector universities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Research limitations/implications: The data were collected from one public sector university of Hail province, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Only four external factors were taken into consideration in investigating its influence on the commitment in use of technology. There could be other external/environmental factors which might be useful to underpin the theory and advance literature. Practical implications: In-service and trainee faculties should take an advantage of using learning management system. Faculty should create a positive learning environment in their online classes so the learners can take a benefit out of the immense investment on ICT by ministry of higher education. Apart from giving training to teaching staff in use of technology, learners should also be given a platform to increase and improve their digital literacy.

Such patterns need to be accommodated, often with reliable service quality. Although several studies have examined the user association and resource allocation (UA-RA) issue, there is still no optimal strategy to address such a problem with low complexity while reducing the time overhead. To this end, we propose Performance-Improved Reduced Search Space Simulated Annealing (PIRS3A), an algorithm for solving UA-RA problems in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). First, the UA-RA problem is formulated as a multiple 0/1 knapsack problem (MKP) with constraints on the maximum capacity of the base stations (BS) along with the transport block size (TBS) index. Second, the proposed PIRS3A is used to solve the formulated MKP. Simulation results show that PIRS3A outperforms existing schemes in terms of variability and Quality of Service (QoS), including throughput, packet loss ratio (PLR), delay, and jitter. Simulation results also show that PIRS3A generates solutions that are very close to the optimal solution compared to the default simulated annealing (DSA) algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.","Agarwal, B.; Togou, M.

Methods: In this large nationwide study, we reviewed medical records of patients with lung cancer and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from 65 Spanish hospitals. Clinical features, treatments and disease outcomes were collected. The primary endpoint was to determine all-cause mortality;secondary endpoints were hospitalization and admission to intensive care units (ICU). Risk factors for poor prognosis were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Overall, 447 patients were included for analysis. Mean age was 67 1 ± 9 8 years;332 (74 3%) were men, and 383 (85 7%) current/former smokers. NSCLC was the most frequent type of cancer (377, 84 5%), consisting mainly of adenocarcinoma (228, 51 0%), and stage III metastatic or unresectable disease (354, 79 2%). Two-hundred and sixty-six (59 5%) patients were receiving anticancer treatment, mostly first-line chemotherapy.

Advanced disease and the use of corticosteroids to treat COVID-19 during hospitalization were predictors of mortality. Hospitalized, non-endof-life stage patients with lymphocytopenia and high LDH had an increased risk of death. Severity of COVID-19 correlated to higher mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation rates. Conclusions: Due to their underlying comorbidities and immunocompromised status, patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 show high hospitalization and mortality rates. These outcomes, alongside the identification of prognostic factors, may inform physicians on the risks and benefits in this population, in order to provide individualized oncological care.","Provencio, M.; Mazarico, J.

It remains unclear how synovial microenvironment impinges on CD4+ T cells pathogenic functions. Here, we identified a TLR4+ follicular helper T (Tfh) cell-like population present in the blood and expanded in synovial fluid. Mechanistically, we unveiled that homotypic T-T cell interactions through non-cognate HLA-DR:TCR contacts regulate TLR4 expression on T cells. TLR4+ T cells possess a two-pronged pathogenic activity. Upon TCR and ICOS engagement, TLR4+ T cells produce IL-21, a cytokine known to sponsor antibody production. However, direct TLR4+ engagement on T cells, by endogenous ligands in the arthritic joint, reprograms them towards an IL-17 inflammatory profile compatible with tissue damage program. Blocking TLR4 signaling with a specific inhibitor impaired IL-17 production in response to synovial fluid recognition. Ex vivo, synovial fluid TLR4+ T cells produced IL-17, but not IL-21.

Therefore, many specialists consider time as the most important component of life, and the most important resource available to human in life, due to his unique and distinctive features. Because of the importance of time for humans, the ancient civilizations and the various monotheistic religions varied in their interest in it, but during research findings that there are important to recorded a precedent in order to take advantage of each part of time, its parts to implement the righteous and purposeful workers that benefit them with good and benefit in the world and the hereafter, and warned them against wasting it and this is clearly manifested in many of the evidences included in the recommendation and result part. © 2020 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

Prior acute e-cigarette studies demonstrated inflammatory and cardiopulmonary physiology changes while chronic studies demonstrated extra-pulmonary effects, including neurotransmitter alterations in reward pathways. In this study we investigated effects of chronic flavored JUUL aerosol inhalation on inflammatory markers in brain, lung, heart, and colon. JUUL induced upregulation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression and increased HMGB1 and RAGE in the nucleus accumbens. Inflammatory gene expression increased in colon, and cardiopulmonary inflammatory responses to acute lung injury with lipopolysaccharide were exacerbated in the heart. Flavor-dependent changes in several responses were also observed. Our findings raise concerns regarding long-term risks of e-cigarette use as neuroinflammation may contribute to behavioral changes and mood disorders, while gut inflammation has been tied to poor systemic health and cardiac inflammation to development of heart disease.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia and visceral adipose tissue in ICU patients treated for COVID-19. Material and Methods: The study designed as a retrospective cross-sectional study for evaluating the effect of prognostic radiologic features in COVID-19 infected patients. The patient characteristics, intubation status and dates, transfer to ICU, and last control or death dates were recorded. Axial CT images, including all abdominal muscles, total skeletal muscle area, were calculated. The total and psoas sarcopenia index (PSI) was calculated by dividing the square of the patient’s height by the square meter (cm2/m2). Also, axial CT images of the body fat subcutaneous adipose and visceral adipose tissue distribution areas were calculated in cm2 using threshold values of-30 to-190 for adipose tissue. Results: In the study population, there were nine deaths that occurred among male patients. In univariate analysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and PSI were found to be related to prognosis. The median survival was 14 days in PSI low group. The prognostic effect of the PSI was still valid in the male population. Other factors had no relationship with survival in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, the prognostic effect of TSI and PSI was related to prognosis, while COPD lost its prognostic effect. Discussion: In this study, we found a new prognostic factor in critically ill COVID-19 patients, which may be a new area of interest. In contrast to other studies, we found no effect of BMI and visceral adipose tissue on mortality in COVID-19 patients treated in ICU. This feasible method needs further evaluation and validation with prospective studies in a large patient population.","Beypinar, I.; Bayav, M.; Ucan, A.; Efe, S.",Annals of Clinical and Analytical Medicine,51,13

No licensed RSV vaccine available thus far calls for the development of vaccines with new target(s) and vaccination strategies. Here, we constructed a recombinant protein, designated P-KFD1, comprised of RSV phosphoprotein (P) and E. coli K12 strain-derived flagellin variant KFD1. Intranasal (i.n.) immunization with P-KFD1 inhibits RSV replication in both upper and lower respiratory tract, and protects mice against lung disease without vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). The P-specific CD4+ T cells provoked by P-KFD1 i.n. immunization, either reside in or migrate to respiratory tract, mediate protection against RSV infection. Sc-RNA seq and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled cell transfer further characterized the Th1 and Th17 responses induced by P-KFD1. Finally, we found the anti-viral protection depends on either IFN-γ or IL-17A. Collectively, P-KFD1 is promising as a safe and effective mucosal vaccine candidate to prevent RSV infection.

Unfortunately, towards the end of 2020, the number of daily new cases exponentially increased. We previously identified a B.1.1.28 sublineage carrying mutations Q675H+Q677H in the viral Spike, with local transmission in Rocha, a department bordering Brazil. To understand whether these B.1.1.28+Q675H+Q677H sequences were part of an emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineage broadly disseminated in Uruguay, herein we analyzed the country-wide genetic diversity of viruses between November, 2020 and April, 2021. Our findings support that B.1.1.28+Q675H+Q677H probably arose around November 2020, in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital department. This clade spread to other Uruguayan departments, with evidence of further local transmission clusters. It also spread to the USA and Spain. The Q675H and Q677H mutations are in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary and also arose independently in many SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide. Although in Uruguay the B.1.1.28+Q675H+Q677H lineage was dominated by the VOC P.1 since April 2021, the monitoring of the concurrent emergence of Q675H+Q677H in VOIs and/or VOCs should be of worldwide interest.","Rego, N.; Salazar, C.; Paz, M.; Costabile, A.; Fajardo, A.; Ferres, I.; Perbolianachis, P.; Fernandez-Calero, T.; Noya, V.; Arce, R.; Arleo, M.; Possi, T.; Reyes, N.; Bentancor, M.

Here, we dissected the dynamics of virus replication and the host cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at a systems level by combining time-resolved RNA sequencing with mathematical modeling. We observed an immediate transcriptional activation of inflammatory pathways linked to the anti-viral response followed by increased expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus hinting at rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, metabolic processes, in particular those depending on cytochrome P450 enzymes, were downregulated. To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying transcriptional dynamics, we developed an ODE model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Iterative model reduction and refinement revealed that a negative feedback from virus proteins on the expression of anti-viral response genes was essential to explain our experimental dataset. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interaction dynamics and facilitates the identification of druggable host pathways supporting virus replication.","Adam, Lukas; Stanifer, Megan; Springer, Fabian; Mathony, Jan; Di Ponzio, Chiara; Eils, Roland; Boulant, Steeve; Niopek, Dominik; Kallenberger, Stefan M.",bioRxiv,51,1

A secondary goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of the COVIDQ in identifying subjects at higher risk of being tested positive for COVID19. Material and methods Consecutive not hospitalized adults who underwent nasopharyngeal and throat swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) detection at Treviso Hospital in March 2020, were enrolled. Subjects were divided into positive (cases) and negative (controls) in equal number. All of them gave consent and answered the COVIDQ. Patients not able to answer the COVIDQ due to clinical conditions were excluded. Parallel Analysis and Principal Component Analysis were used to identify clusters of items measuring the same dimension. The Item Response Theory (IRT) based analyses evaluated the functioning of item categories, the presence of clusters of local dependence among items, item fit within the model and model fit to the data. Results Answers obtained from 230 COVID19 cases (113 males, and 117 females; mean age 55 years, range 20 to 99 years) and 230 controls (61 males, and 169 females; mean age 46 years, range 21 to 89) were analyzed. Parallel analysis led to the extraction of six components, which corresponded to as many clinical presentation patterns: asthenia, influenza symptoms, ear and nose symptoms, breathing issues, throat symptoms, and anosmia/ageusia. The final IRT models retained 27 items as significant for symptom assessment. The total score on the questionnaire was significantly associated with positivity to the molecular SARSCoV2 test: subjects with multiple symptoms were significantly more likely to be affected by COVID19 (p < .001). Older age and male gender also represented risk factors. Presence of breathing issues and anosmia/ageusia were significantly related to positivity to SARSCoV2 (p < 0.001). None of the examined comorbidities had a significant association with COVID19 diagnosis. Conclusion According to the analyses, COVIDQ could be validated since the aspects it evaluated were overall significantly related to SARSCoV2 infection. The application of the novel COVIDQ to everyday clinical practice may help identifying subjects who are likely to be affected by COVID19 and address them to a nasopharyngeal swab in order to achieve an early diagnosis.","Spinato, G.; Fabbris, C.; Conte, F.; Menegaldo, A.; Franz, L.; Gaudioso, P.; Cinetto, F.; Agostini, C.; Costantini, G.; Boscolo Rizzo, P.",,51,26

The disease transmission rates, the recovering rates and the fraction of individuals who wear masks are all time dependent in the model. We develop a progressive estimation of the disease transmission rates and the recovering rates based on the COVID-19 data published by John Hopkins University. We determine the fraction of individual who wear masks by a maximum likelihood estimation, which maximizes the transition probability of a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered model. The transition probability is numerically difficult to compute if the number of infected individuals is large. We develop an approximation for the transition probability based on central limit theorem and mean field approximation. We show through numerical study that our approximation works well.

The resulting disorientation extends beyond health research and into many domains of our individual and collective lives. We suffer from political disorientation (the need for a radical shift in economic thinking), from social disorientation (the rearrangement of social dynamics based on distancing measures), and from temporal disorientation (the warping of our sense of time during lockdown), to name but a few. This generalised state of disorientation has substantial effects on wellbeing and decision making. In this paper, we review the multiple dimensions of disorientation of the COVID-19 crisis and use state-of-the art research on disorientation to gain insight into the social, psychological and political dynamics of the current pandemic. Just like standard, spatial cases of disorientation, the non-spatial forms of disorientation prevalent in the current crisis consist in the mismatch between our frames of reference and our immediate experience, and they result in anxiety, helplessness and isolation, but also in the possibility of re-orienting. The current crisis provides a unique environment in which to study non-spatial forms of disorientation. In turn, existing knowledge about spatial disorientation can shed light on the shifting landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. © Bristol University Press 2021.","Fernández Velasco, P.; Perroy, B.; Casati, R.",Global Discourse,51,13

A growing number of cases of adaptive introgression are being identified in species across the tree of life, however the timing of selection, and therefore the importance of the different evolutionary roles of admixture, is typically unknown. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal history of selection favoring Neanderthal-introgressed alleles in modern human populations. Using both ancient and present-day samples of modern humans, we integrate the known demographic history of populations, namely population divergence and migration, with tests for selection. We model how a sweep placed along different branches of an admixture graph acts to modify the variance and covariance in neutral allele frequencies among populations at linked loci. Using a method based on this model of allele frequencies, we study previously identified cases of Neanderthal adaptive introgression. From these, we identify cases in which Neanderthal introgressed alleles were quickly beneficial and other cases in which they persisted at low frequency for some time. For some of the alleles that persisted at low frequency, we show that selection likely independently favored them later on in geographically separated populations. Our work highlights how admixture with ancient hominins has contributed to modern human adaptation and contextualizes observed levels of Neanderthal ancestry in present-day and ancient samples.","Yair, Sivan; Lee, Kristin M.; Coop, Graham",bioRxiv,51,16

Global cooperation and solidarity are central to responding to and mitigating the health and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet, to many, this was slow to mobilize and lacking in political leadership. This book takes a practical look at the lessons learned from the period spanning the World Health Organization's first declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020, to the commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations in October 2020. This timespan covers a critical period in which to consider key areas of diplomacy, covering a range of tools of global cooperation: multilateral diplomacy, the rule of law, sustainable development, economics and financing, digital governance, and peace and security. Each chapter in this book introduces readers to the current situation in their respective areas, followed by a constructive consideration of lessons learned from the pandemic's impact on that field, and key recommendations for the future. The practical focus and future orientation is particularly important as the book injects pragmatism and guidance that will facilitate 'building back better' in COVID response plans, while creating space for continued focus on global commitments around sustainable development and the future of the UN.

Through computer simulations of λ’s evolution on the empirical fitness landscape, we showed that λ was more likely to evolve to use a new receptor if it experienced a shift in its fitness landscape caused by coevolution. This result was further validated by additional laboratory experiments. This study provides direct evidence for the role of coevolution in driving evolutionary novelty and provides a quantitative framework for predicting evolution in coevolving ecological communities.","Gupta, Animesh; Zaman, Luis; Strobel, Hannah M.; Gallie, Jenna; Burmeister, Alita R.; Kerr, Benjamin; Tamar, Einat S.; Kishony, Roy; Meyer, Justin R.",bioRxiv,51,24

No inhibition or delay to blood-stage P. cynomolgi parasitemia was observed at any ivermectin dose (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg). Ivermectin (0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg) and chloroquine (10 mg/kg) in combination were well-tolerated with no adverse events and no significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions observed. Repeated daily ivermectin administration for seven days did not inhibit ivermectin bioavailability. It was recently demonstrated that both ivermectin and chloroquine inhibit replication of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro. Further ivermectin and chloroquine trials in humans are warranted to evaluate their role in Plasmodium vivax control and as adjunctive therapies against COVID-19 infections.","Vanachayangkul, Pattaraporn; Im-erbsin, Rawiwan; Tungtaeng, Anchalee; Kodchakorn, Chanikarn; Roth, Alison; Adams, John; Chaisatit, Chaiyaporn; Saingam, Piyaporn; Sciotti, Richard J.; Reichard, Gregory A.; Nolan, Christina K.; Pybus, Brandon S.; Black, Chad C.; Lugo, Luis A.; Wegner, Matthew D.; Smith, Philip L.; Wojnarski, Mariusz; Vesely, Brian A.; Kobylinski, Kevin C.",bioRxiv,51,16

Methods 2μL of sterile PBS or bioluminescent Xen29 Staphylococcus aureus was administered to the tendon sheath of 36 male C57BL/6J mice. The infectious course was monitored by bioluminescence (BLI) signal via IVIS imaging and recording of weight change. The infected hind paws were harvested at four time points: 24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks for histopathology using Alcian Blue hematoxylin staining. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis. Results The infected cohort displayed significantly elevated bioluminescent values, reductions in weight, and exhibited swelling of the infected digit throughout the course of infection. By day 7 most infected mice saw a substantial decrease in BLI signal intensity, however two infected mice exhibited persistent BLI intensity through day 14. Histopathology of the infected cohort showed tissue disorganization and the presence of a cellular infiltrate in and around the flexor tendon sheath. Conclusions A murine model of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is possible. Further optimization of the model offers an experimental platform for investigation of the pathophysiology of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis. Clinical Relevance This animal model can be utilized in order to elucidate the basic molecular/cellular mechanisms of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis while simultaneously evaluating novel therapeutic strategies.","Qiu, Bowen; Cobb, Justin; Loiselle, Alayna; Ketonis, Constantinos",bioRxiv,51,24

The analysis included all laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases in British Columbia as of January 15th, 2021. We evaluated factors associated with hospital admission using multivariable Poisson regression analysis with robust error variance. Findings: From 56,874 COVID-19 cases included in the analyses, 2,298 were hospitalized. Models showed significant association of the following factors with increased hospitalization risk: male sex (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)=1.27; 95%CI=1.17-1.37), older age (p-trend <0.0001 across age groups with a graded increase in hospitalization risk with increasing age [aRR 30-39 years=3.06; 95%CI=2.32-4.03, to aRR 80+years=43.68; 95%CI=33.41-57.10 compared to 20-29 years-old]), asthma (aRR=1.15; 95%CI=1.04-1.26), cancer (aRR=1.19; 95%CI=1.09-1.29), chronic kidney disease (aRR=1.32; 95%CI=1.19-1.47), diabetes (treated without insulin aRR=1.13; 95%CI=1.03-1.25, requiring insulin aRR=5.05; 95%CI=4.43-5.76), hypertension (aRR=1.19; 95%CI=1.08-1.31), injection drug use (aRR=2.51; 95%CI=2.14-2.95), intellectual and developmental disabilities (aRR=1.67; 95%CI=1.05-2.66), problematic alcohol use (aRR=1.63; 95%CI=1.43-1.85), immunosuppression (aRR=1.29; 95%CI=1.09-1.53), and schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (aRR=1.49; 95%CI=1.23-1.82).

By meta-analysing existing studies, we tested the hypothesis that lower pulmonary function and respiratory illness are linked to an elevated risk of dementia. Aims To review the best available evidence, taken from longitudinal studies, for pulmonary function and respiratory disease as risk factors of dementia. Method We conducted a systematic review of longitudinal studies using PubMed until April 1st, 2019 and, where possible, pooled results in random-effects meta-analyses. Results We identified eleven studies relating pulmonary function to later dementia risk, and eleven studies of respiratory illness and dementia (including one which studied both). The lowest quartile of lung function measure Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) compared with the highest was associated with a 1.5-fold (1.51, 95%CI 0.94-2.42) increased dementia risk (Ntotal=127,710, 3 studies). Respiratory illness was also associated with increased dementia risk to a similar degree (1.54, 1.30-1.81, Ntotal=288,641, 11 studies).

Silent hypoxia is characterized by the presence of hypoxia without dyspnea. Silent hypoxia has been shown to affect the outcomes in previous studies. Research Question Are the outcomes in patients presenting with silent hypoxia different from those presenting with dyspneic hypoxia? Study design and Methods This was a retrospective study of a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hypoxic at presentation. Clinical, laboratory and treatment parameters in patients with silent hypoxia and dyspneic hypoxia were compared. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the factors predicting mortality. Results Among 2080 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, 811 patients were hypoxic with SpO2<94% at the time of presentation. 174 (21.45%) did not have dyspnea since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. 5.2% of patients were completely asymptomatic for COVID-19 and were found to be hypoxic only on pulse oximetry. The case fatality rate in patients with silent hypoxia was 45.4% as compared to 40.03% in dyspneic hypoxic patients (P=0.202). The odds ratio of death was 1.1 (95% CI 0.41-2.97) in the patients with silent hypoxia after adjusting for baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment, and in-hospital complications, which did not reach statistical significance (P=0.851). Interpretation Silent hypoxia may be the only presenting feature of COVID-19. Since the case fatality rate is comparable between silent and dyspneic hypoxia, it should be recognized early and treated as aggressively. Since home isolation is recommended in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to use pulse oximetry at the home setting to identify these patients.","Sirohiya, P.; Elavarasi, A.; Sagiraju, H. K.

The world health organisation (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic in March 2020. The recommended measures in almost every infected country was to enforce social distance. In 17 March 2020 Iraq declared curfew “Social distance” and provinces lockdown for the entire country as a precautious measure to control the spread of the disease. The daily reports data collected from JHU can be represented as time series, thus it can be analysed using time series analysis methods. The challenges in this pandemic include the short in data points for each vital pointer, the current continuous exponential trend in confirmed cases, and the randomness as the dominant phenomenon in observations. Those reasons made it very hard to predict or forecast long periods in the future. This paper suggests short periods for forecasting and an online updated state space model. The model records high accuracy with low error percentages comparing with other statistical models, which indicate that this rank of predictors is more suitable than other statistical models.

As part of a research programme to identify the optimal transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) threshold that translates into significantly improved QOL, we conducted a pilot randomized study of two transfusion algorithms (liberal versus restrictive) to determine the feasibility of a larger study. This trial was aligned with the REDDS study (ISRCTN26088319, Stanworth et al., BJH 2019) and followed the same pre-defined statistical analysis plan. Methods The study was undertaken at 3 cancer centers (NCT02099669). We included patients with MDS, CMML, low blast AML (20-30%) or myeloproliferative neoplasms who were TD (> 1 RBC/8 weeks x 16 weeks). Patients on disease modifying therapy for > 6 months were permitted only if they had remained stably RBC-TD with a life expectancy of > 3 months. Central randomization was to one of two RBC transfusion strategies over a 12-week period: 1. Restrictive strategy to maintain Hb between 85 and 105g/L. To achieve this, 2 RBC units were transfused when Hb < 85 g/L 2. Liberal strategy to maintain Hb between 110 and 120 g/L. To achieve this, 2 RBC units were transfused when Hb < 105 g/L and 1 unit for Hb 105-110 g/L. The first 4 weeks were considered a run-in period to achieve the target Hb. The primary outcomes of this feasibility study were 1. The percentage compliance of Hb being within or above the target range of the assigned transfusion threshold (after the 4 week run-in). Feasibility was set at 70%. 2. Achievement of at least a 15 g/L difference between the mean pre-transfusion Hb of the liberal and restrictive strategy groups. Secondary outcomes included changes and differences in QOL scores, rates of transfusion reactions and alloimmunizations, overall blood utilization and visit numbers and impact on serum ferritin. The primary analysis was intention to treat. The study was closed early due to COVID-19, with 28 patients randomized of planned 30. Results 30 patients were enrolled over 5 years and 28 patients randomized (n=15, liberal;n=13 restrictive). Median age was 74 (range 58-84), 26/28 had MDS or CMML and there were no significant imbalances in baseline disease and patient characteristics although patients in the restrictive group tended to have lower risk disease (IPSS-R very low + low 69% versus 53% liberal). Compared with the restrictive arm, liberal arm patients had more complete blood counts, were transfused more RBC units (only during the 4-week run-in) and were transfused at shorter intervals (Table 1). There were no differences in adverse events. Over the 12 weeks, the mean Hb value was 90 ± 4 g/L (restrictive) versus 101 ± 4 g/L (liberal), (p <0.0001, Figure 1). The pretransfusion difference was 11.8 g/L (95% CI 9.4-14.3) with mean pre-transfusion Hb values of 98.6 (± 10.6) g/L and 86.7 (± 8.6) in the liberal and restrictive arms respectively. Percentage compliance of pre-transfusion Hb falling within or above the target Hb range was 48% for restrictive patients but only 14% for liberal patients. Adherence with QOL completion (minimum of 4 serial) was 93%. While sample sizes are small and comparisons exploratory, the area under the curve for several serial quality of life scores was numerically higher and the curve more stable for the liberal arm (EQ5D (figure 2), EORTC cognitive and emotional functioning). Similarly, a higher % of patients in the liberal arm achieved pre-defined clinically meaningful increases in several symptom and function domains (emotional, social, fatigue, dyspnea, financial problems). Discussion Whilst our study results did not meet our feasibility endpoints, this small randomized trial in MDS patients demonstrated clinically important differences in mean Hb achievable with different transfusion thresholds. Poor rates of compliance with Hb targets were clearly identified for patients in the liberal arm, suggesting a need to understand the barriers to protocol adherence in this rm prior to embarking on larger trials. Compared with the REDDS trial, we did not document a significant excess of RBC transfusions needed (post run-in period) to maintain the higher Hb threshold. Similar to REDDS, we did observe some signals of improved QOL with a liberal transfusion strategy. A formal analysis of pooled results with REDDS study patients is planned.

As this value increases monotonically over time, the end of June 2021 was chosen, when the growth rate in Ukraine and the vast majority of European countries was small. This allowed us to draw some intermediate conclusions about the influence of the volume of population, its density, and the level of urbanization on the accumulated number of laboratory-confirmed cases per capita in European countries and regions of Ukraine. A simple analysis showed that the number of cases per capita does not depend on these demographic factors, although it may differ by about 4 times for different regions of Ukraine and more than 9 times for different European countries. The number of COVID-19 per capita registered in Ukraine is comparable with the same characteristic in other European countries but much higher than in China, South Korea and Japan.","Nesteruk, I.; Rodionov, O.",,51,20

Methods: We enrolled 378 healthcare workers (255 women, 123 men) whose blood samples were collected 91 plus or minus 15 days after the second of two inoculations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) given 3 weeks apart. Medical histories and demographic characteristics were recorded using a structured self-reported questionnaire. The relationships between Ab titres and these factors were analysed. Results: Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) of the participants was 44 (32-54) years. Median Ab titre (IQR) against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike antigen was 764 (423-1140) U/mL. Older participants had significantly lower Ab titres; median (IQR) Ab titres were 942 (675-1390) and 1095 (741-1613) U/mL in men and women in their 20s, respectively, but 490 (297-571) and 519 (285-761) U/mL in men and women in their 60s-70s, respectively. In the age-adjusted analysis, the only risk factors for lower Ab titres were male sex and smoking. However, the sex difference may have arisen from the sex difference in smoking rate. Moreover, Ab titres were significantly lower in current smokers than in ex-smokers. Conclusion: The most important factors associated with low Ab titres were age and smoking habit. In particular, current smoking status caused lower Ab titres, and smoking cessation before vaccination may improve the individual efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Nomura, Y.; Sawahata, M.; Nakamura, Y.; Kurihara, M.; Koike, R.; Katsube, O.; Hagiwara, K.; Niho, S.; Masuda, N.; Tanaka, T.; Sugiyama, K.",,51,8

DNA polymerases select against NTPs by using steric gates to exclude the 2’ OH, but RNAPs have to employ alternative selection strategies. In single-subunit RNAPs, a conserved Tyr residue discriminates against 2’dNTPs, whereas selectivity mechanisms of multi-subunit RNAPs remain hitherto unknown. Here we show that a conserved Arg residue uses a two-pronged strategy to select against 2’dNTPs in multi-subunit RNAPs. The conserved Arg interacts with the 2’OH group to promote NTP binding, but selectively inhibits incorporation of 2’dNTPs by interacting with their 3’OH group to favor the catalytically-inert 2’-endo conformation of the deoxyribose moiety. This deformative action is an elegant example of an active selection against a substrate that is a substructure of the correct substrate. Our findings provide important insights into the evolutionary origins of biopolymers and the design of selective inhibitors of viral RNAPs.","Mäkinen, Janne J.; Shin, Yeonoh; Vieras, Eeva; Virta, Pasi; Metsä-Ketelä, Mikko; Murakami, Katsuhiko S.; Belogurov, Georgiy A.",bioRxiv,51,22

This review outlines four major challenges that were observed and informally reported by the healthcare workers at PHCs in Oman from January to December 2020. Understanding the nature of these challenges can help health authorities in preparing effectively for any future viral outbreaks and mitigating them in a timely and efficient manner. One of the major challenges faced by PHCs was the reduction in outpatient services from January to December 2020 in comparison with the same time period in the last year. PHCs addressed the main health problems in the community through health promotion, as well as preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services under unusual circumstances. However, there is a need for a modified approach during circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This will help us cope with possible future viral outbreaks in a better manner.","Al Rashidi, B.; Al Wahaibi, A. H.; Mahomed, O.; Langrial, S. U.; Al Awaidy, S.

Our initial analysis revealed that 18.3% of patients who met screening criteria had an appropriately ordered LDCT scan, with an 8.7% completion rate. The aim of this study was to improve lung ca screening compliance following the USPSTF guidelines among residents from the University of Connecticut Internal Medicine (IM) residency program at a Clinic in Hartford, Connecticut. Methods: Care provided to patients by an IM resident at the Gengras Clinic were included. After initial data was gathered, we implemented an intervention to improve screening compliance between October 2019 and March 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 pandemic occurred and routine services were interrupted. USPSTF screening guidelines were emailed monthly to residents and attendings;they were reminded of the importance of lung ca screening;updating the pack-year smoking history;as well as instructions on correctly ordering LDCT and documenting shared decision making, which is needed for insurance approval. In-person reminders also occurred at the clinic. Results: Post-intervention, 601 charts were reviewed. 168/601 (27%) patients met screening criteria. 433 patients were excluded due to unclear packyear, did not meet screening criteria, were deceased or last seen at the clinic prior to the intervention. 63/168 (37.5%) met the criteria and had an appropriately ordered LDCT;51/168 (30.35%) had a completed LDCT in chart. The remaining 12/168 (7.14%) with an appropriately ordered LDCT, had it scheduled at the time of data collection or it had been cancelled for unclear reasons. 20 patients' LDCT was ordered by their pulmonologist. 94 (62.5%) who met screening criteria did not have a LDCT ordered. 11 patients with a smoking history, who did not meet screening criteria had a LDCT ordered because of clinical suspicion for cancer. Lastly, 4/168 (2.4%) had a diagnosis of personal history of lung ca. Conclusions: After our educational intervention, patients who qualified had an increase of LDCT being ordered (37.5% from 18.3%) and completed (30.3% from 8.7%). This is, to our knowledge, the first study of its kind. We identified areas of improvement that were key to achieving higher screening rates: educating all residents and attendings on lung ca screening guidelines;educating patients on the importance of undergoing screening tests;creating a best practice advisory in the electronic medical record system that reminds provider to input pack-year smoking history and if the criteria for screening is met, a pop-up prompting the provider to order LDCT;obtaining insurance approval;and lastly, stressing the importance on screening and overall outcomes.","Lopetegui-Lia, N.; Condit, D.; Lima, G.

To establish the clinical efficacy of an immunotherapy, it is critical to adjust the trial's design to the expected immunotherapy-specific response patterns. Methods In silico cancer immunotherapy trials are virtual clinical trials that simulate the kinetics and outcome of immunotherapy depending on the type and treatment schedule. We used an ordinary differential equation model to simulate (1) cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment, (2) translates these into disease courses in patients, and (3) assemble populations of virtual patients to simulate in silico late-stage immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or combination trials. We predict trial outcomes and investigate how therapy-specific response patterns affect the probability of their success. Results In silico cancer immunotherapy trials reveal that immunotherapy-derived survival kinetics -- such as delayed curve separation and plateauing curve of the treatment arm -- arise naturally due to biological interactions in the tumor microenvironment. In silico clinical trials are capable of translating these biological interactions into survival kinetics. Considering four aspects of clinical trial design -- sample size calculations, endpoint and randomization rate selection, and interim analysis planning -- we illustrate that failing to consider such distinctive response patterns can significantly reduce the power of novel immunotherapy trials. Conclusion In silico trials have three significant implications for immuno-oncology. First, they provide an economical approach to verify the robustness of biological assumptions underlying an immunotherapy trial and help to scrutinize its design. Second, the biological basis of these trials facilitates and encourages communication between biomedical researchers, doctors, and trialists. Third, its application as an educational tool can illustrate design principles to scientists in training, contributing to improved designs and higher success rates of future immunotherapy trials.","Creemers, J.

The initiatives taken by various ministries and divisions of Bangladesh resonated partially with 84 targets of SDGs.FindingsAmbiguous mandates of different ministries and divisions have caused overlapping jurisdiction, followed by conflicts of interest and lack of cohesion. Inaccurate stakeholder analysis, data unavailability, lack of competency and accountability, and a top-down policy approach can be considered as the major institutional bottlenecks in achieving SDGs.Originality/valueThis paper advocates revising the map to incorporate the right stakeholders to avoid erroneous monitoring, evaluation, and finally, inaccurate reporting. The reallocation of business for ministries and divisions is warranted to abolish jurisdictional overlapping and conflict of interests and make SDGs friendly.

Manganese dioxide (MnO2) showed a good effect on the removal of TCS. The morphology of MnO2 was regulated in this study to increase the active sites for removing TCS and improve the removal effect. The results showed that nanoflower ε-MnO2 exhibited best removal efficiency due to its high oxygen vacancy, high Mn3+ content, easily released lattice oxygen and unique tunnel structure which make its Mn-O bond easier to activate. Further study of the mechanism revealed that the process of removing TCS by MnO2 was the first adsorption and then oxidation process and the detailed reaction process was clarified. 3-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol were proved to be their oxidative product. Additionally, it was verified that oxidation dominated in the removal of TCS by MnO2 rather than adsorption through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations analysis.

This period could have been particularly painful for the patients due to the virus itself, and to the difficulty to access to healthcare facilities due to the lockdown. Objectives: To assess the impact of the lockdown in patients under biologics. Methods: This is a descriptive study, conducted between 03/01/2021 and 07/31/2021 in the Department of Rheumatology of the University Hospital of Ibn Rochd in Casablanca. Inclusion criteria were all patients on biologics during the lockdown period. The number of painful, swollen joints, pain visual analogue scale, and disease activity were collected before and during the lockdown. Results: Thirty-one patients under biologics were included. The average age was 43.4 years. There were 17 males and 14 females (sex ratio M/F 1,21). Cormibidities were hypertension and type 2 diabetes (9.7%), hypertension and dyslipidemia (6.5%), arrhythmia (6.5%), smoking (9.7%), hypertension and dysthyroidism (3.2%). All the patients were under biologics with an average duration of 2 years distributed as follows: 3 patients on etanercept (9.67%), 8 patients on tocilizumab (28.8%), 10 patients on infliximab (32.25%), 5 patients on adalimumab (16.12%)), 4 patients under golimumab (12.90%), 1 under secukinumab (3.22%). Biologics were associated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in 38.7% (methotrexate 12.9%, salosopyrine25, 8%), corticosteroids in 25.7%, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 16.1%. The disease activity before COVID-19 of the patients was: 48.39% weak activity, 35.4% remission, 16.13% moderate activity. No patient reported a flare of the disease. During lockdown, 5 patients reported a flare of their disease (16.12%) They were followed for: 2 spondyloarthritis, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, 1 psoriatic arthritis, 1 adult onset Still's disease. All the patients have temporarily stopped their drugs because they couldn't come to their appointments because of the lockdown. Conclusion: Our study notes that the patients who kept their follow-up during lockdown have maintained a control of their disease activity. Our results are consistent with the observations of a French study on the impact of lockdown on the activity of rheumatoid arthritis. However, those who couldn't come to their control appointment due to the lockdown had a flare of their disease.

Despite this, cases reached a record high again in April 2021, and the country went back to a state of emergency. The reasons for this are multiple, complex, and interconnected. A feeling of false safety with the beginning of vaccination, the appearance of new more transmissible variants, too early relaxation of non-pharmacological measures at a point of vaccination below herd immunity, and vaccination in a high prevalence setting, appear to be main reasons for the resurgence. However, the political context and the socio-economic inequalities in Chile also play an important role, and are more difficult to measure and to compare with other countries. In conclusion, the Chilean example is a warning sign not to count on vaccination figures alone, and to maintain some of the previous non-pharmaceutical strategies to contain the pandemic.","Lanzavecchia, Sabrina Beyer Katharina Johanna Evina Bolo Sophie",Epidemiologia,51,1

As the state faced a crisis of confidence, state social media responded with a propagandistic display of state efficacy, broadcasting a round-the-clock livestream of a massive emergency hospital construction project. Chinese internet users playfully embellished imagery from the livestream. They unexpectedly transformed the construction vehicles into cute personified memes, with Baby Forklift and Baby Mud Barfer (a cement mixer) among the most popular. In turn, state social media strategically channeled this playful engagement in politically productive directions by resignifying the personified vehicles as celebrity idols. Combining social media studies with cultural and linguistic anthropology, we offer a processual account of the semiotic mediations involved in turning vehicles into memes, memes into idols, and citizens into fans. We show how, by embedding cute memes within modules of fandom management such as celebrity ranking lists, state social media rendered them artificially vulnerable to a fall in status. Fans, in turn, rallied around to “protect” these cute idols with small but significant acts of digital devotion and care, organizing themselves into fan circles and exhorting each other to vote. In elevating the memes to the status of celebrity idols, state social media thereby created a disposable pantheon of virtual avatars for the state, and consolidated state power by exploiting citizens’ voluntary response to vulnerability. We analyze fandom governance as a new development in the Chinese state’s long history of governing citizens through the management of emotion. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wong, J.; Lee, C.; Long, V.

In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19. METHOD: An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. RESULTS: Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.","Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Zali, Alireza; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Zarghi, Afshin; Hosseini, Mostafa; Safari, Saeed",Arch Acad Emerg Med,51,7

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is characterized by dysregulated lung mucosae, and that mucosal homeostasis is heavily influenced by interleukin (IL)-13 activity, we explore recent findings indicating that IL-13 production is proportional to disease severity. We propose that excessive IL-13 contributes to the progression of severe/fatal COVID-19 by (1) promoting the recruitment of immune cells that express inflammatory cytokines, causing a cytokine storm that results in widespread destruction of lung tissue, (2) directly facilitating tissue-remodeling that causes airway hyperinflammation and obstruction, and (3) diverting the immune system away from developing high-quality cytotoxic T cells that confer effective anti-viral immunity. These factors may cumulatively result in significant lung distress, multi-organ failure, and death. Here, we suggest repurposing existing IL-13-inhibiting interventions, including antibody therapies routinely used for allergic lung hyperinflammation, as well as viral vector-based approaches, to alleviate disease. Since many of these strategies have previously been shown to be both safe and effective, this could prove to be a highly cost-effective solution. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: There remains a desperate need to establish medical interventions that reliably improves outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19. We explore the role of IL-13 in maintaining homeostasis at the lung mucosae and propose that its dysregulation during viral infection may propagate the hallmarks of severe disease – further exploration may provide a platform for invaluable therapeutics.","Deimel, Lachlan Paul; Li, Zheyi; Ranasinghe, Charani",J Clin Transl Res,51,19

In this study, we show that the overexpression of Bcl-XL, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family, blocks 7a-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the mechanism for apoptosis induction by 7a is at the level of or upstream from the Bcl-2 family. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 7a interacts with Bcl-XL and other prosurvival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1) but not with the proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid). A good correlation between the abilities of 7a deletion mutants to induce apoptosis and to interact with Bcl-XL was observed, suggesting that 7a triggers apoptosis by interfering directly with the prosurvival function of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, amino acids 224 and 225 within the C-terminal transmembrane domain of Bcl-XL are essential for the interaction with the 7a protein, although the BH3 domain of Bcl-XL also contributes to this interaction. In addition, fractionation experiments showed that 7a colocalized with Bcl-XL at the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the mitochondria, suggesting that they may form complexes in different membranous compartments.","Tan, Ying-Xim; Tan, Timothy H P; Lee, Marvin J-R; Tham, Puay-Yoke; Gunalan, Vithiagaran; Druce, Julian; Birch, Chris; Catton, Mike; Fu, Nai Yang; Yu, Victor C; Tan, Yee-Joo",Journal of virology,51,28

Cholesterol-depleted insect cells are highly resistant to alphavirus infection and were used to select srf-3, an SFV mutant that is approximately 100-fold less cholesterol dependent for infection due to a single amino acid change in the E1 spike subunit, proline 226 to serine. Sensitive lipid-mixing assays here demonstrated that the in vitro fusion of srf-3 and wild-type (wt) virus with cholesterol-containing liposomes had comparable kinetics, activation energies, and sphingolipid dependence. In contrast, srf-3 fusion with sterol-free liposomes was significantly more efficient than that of wt virus. Thus, the srf-3 mutation does not affect its general fusion properties with purified lipid bilayers but causes a marked and specific reduction in cholesterol dependence. Upon exposure to low pH, the E1 spike subunit undergoes distinct conformational changes, resulting in the exposure of an acid conformation-specific epitope and formation of an E1 homotrimer. These conformational changes were strongly cholesterol and sphingolipid dependent for wt SFV and strikingly less cholesterol dependent for srf-3. Our results thus demonstrate the functional importance of fusogenic E1 conformational changes in the control of SFV cholesterol dependence.","Chatterjee, P K; Vashishtha, M; Kielian, M",Journal of virology,51,28

During the acute phase of infection (first 48 h), minus and plus strands accumulated at the same rate initially, but maximal accumulation of minus strands peaked earlier than that for plus strands, indicating that minus- and plus-strand levels are differentially regulated. In addition, packaged (input) mRNAs appeared to serve as templates for their own early replication. mRNA replication continued throughout establishment and maintenance of persistent infection (studied for 120 days), which is consistent with our hypothesis that mRNA replication contributes mechanistically to virus persistence. A replication-defective (potentially interfering) species of RNA existed transiently (beginning at day 2 and ending before day 76 postinfection), but because of its transient nature it cannot be considered essential to the long-term maintenance of virus persistence.","Hofmann, M A; Sethna, P B; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,51,1

They can simply be removed from a low-temperature repository, thawed, seeded, and shortly thereafter exposed to the sample in question. These characteristics suggest that porcine alveolar macrophages may be useful in developing a highly sensitive and timely diagnostic test for Stx.","Mengeling, W L; Vorwald, A C; Cornick, N A; Lager, K M; Moon, H W","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",51,20
188630,188630,188630,Protection against CTL escape and clinical disease in a murine model of virus persistence.,11.858938,7.6115823,2003,"We have analyzed the effects of reducing conditions on the folding of the spike (S) protein and on the intracellular transport of the membrane (M) protein of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These proteins differ in their potential to form disulfide bonds in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intrachain disulfide bonds are formed in the S protein but not in M, which was demonstrated in a pulse-chase experiment by analyzing the viral proteins under nonreducing conditions. To reduce disulfide bonds in vivo, we added dithiothreitol (DTT) to the culture medium of mouse hepatitis coronavirus-infected cells following a procedure recently described by Braakman et al. (I. Braakman, J. Helenius, and A. Helenius, EMBO J. 11:1717-1722, 1992). Short exposure to DTT resulted in the complete reduction of newly synthesized S protein and affected its conformation as judged by the change in mobility in nonreducing gels and by the loss of recognition by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. Using this antibody in an immunofluorescence assay, we monitored the reducing effect of DTT in situ. DTT was found to initially affect only the S protein present in the ER; also, after longer treatment, the remaining signal also gradually disappeared. In contrast, folding and transport of the M protein were not inhibited by DTT. Under reducing conditions, M was transported efficiently to the trans side of the Golgi complex, indicating that cellular processes such as ER-to-Golgi transport, O-glycosylation, and Golgi retention were unaffected. In the presence of DTT, the M protein even moved at an increased rate to the Golgi complex, which is probably because of its failure to interact with unfolded S protein. The effects of in vivo reduction were reversible. When DTT was removed from pulse-labeled cells, the S protein folded posttranslationally and aberrantly; during its oxidation, most of S now transiently aggregated into large disulfide-linked complexes from which subsequently folded S molecules dissociated.","Opstelten, D J; de Groote, P; Horzinek, M C; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,51,16

Gross and histopathologic changes in the lungs were studied using light microscopy at three time-periods following administration: 16, 24, and 46 hours. Both 3-MI and Cremophore caused changes in bronchiolar epithelium at 16 hours. By 46 hours, Cremophore-injected rats showed no effects of the carrier; whereas, 3-MI rats showed severe lung changes characterized by airway epithelial and pulmonary vascular endothelial necrosis and sloughing, cellular infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages, perivascular edema, alveolar edema, and lymph stasis. Grossly, the controls showed no effect of the carrier and none died during the studies. In contrast, 3-MI injected rats quickly became lethargic and displayed tachypnea, anorexia, and progressive respiratory distress. Two of five 3-MI rats in the final group died just prior to 46 hours. All of this group had grossly congested lungs and marked pleural effusion. The lesions and time course showed similarities to those observed in ruminants and mice. We conclude that 3-MI in Cremophore causes an acute progressive pneumonitis in rats and suggest that the rats may be a suitable model for 3-MI-induced and similar toxic lung diseases in domestic animals and people.","Kiorpes, A L; Keith, I M; Dubielzig, R R",Histology and histopathology,51,0

OBJECTIVES To evaluate outcomes of the one-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy for NPT in our department. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the medical files of patients who underwent laparoscopic orchidopexy with the identical technique. Only patients with at least one year follow-up were included. At follow-up we assessed the age (at surgery), follow-up time, laterality of testes, postoperative complications, testicular size and testicular localization. RESULTS Thirty-six consecutive patients, median age 16 months, underwent one-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy. Sixteen patients (44.4%) had peeping testis type, in 13 patients (36.1%) the testicle was located within 2 cm from the internal ring and in the remaining 7 patients (19.4%) it was detected > 2 cm from the internal ring. In six children (16.7%) dividing the spermatic vessels was performed in one stage with laparoscopic orchiopexy. In the remaining 30 patients (83.7%) a laparoscopic one-stage procedure was performed with preservation of the spermatic vessels. Testicular atrophy was observed in 2 cases (5.6%), and 6 patients (16%) had a relatively small testicle compared to the contralateral normal testicle at follow-up. Two patients (5.6%) presented with testicle positioning at the entrance area into the scrotum. None of the patients demonstrated hernia recurrence at follow-up. There was no difference in surgical outcome in children who had surgery with preservation of the spermatic vessels versus those who underwent orchiopexy with division of the spermatic vessels in one stage. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transection of the testicular vessels appeared to be safe in boys with high abdominal testes that did not reach the scrotum after laparoscopic high retroperitoneal dissection.","Jawdat, Jaber R; Kocherov, Stanislav; Chertin, Boris",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,51,1

Electronic communicable disease reporting (CDR), given its legal mandate and clear public health importance, is a significant early step in the sifting and pooling of health data for purposes beyond patient care and billing. Over the next 5-10 years, almost all CDR will move to the internet. METHODS This paper reviews the components of electronic laboratory reporting (ELR), including sifting through data in a laboratory information management system for reportable results, controlled ""vocabularies"" (e.g., LOINC, Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [Regenstrief Institute], and SNOMED, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine [College of American Pathologists]), the ""syntax"" of an electronic message (e.g., health level 7 [HL7]), the implications of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for ELR, and the obstacles to and potential benefits of ELR. RESULTS There are several ways that infectious diseases physicians, infection control professionals, and microbiology laboratorians will participate in electronic CDR, including web-based case reporting and ELR, the direct, automated messaging of communicable disease reports from clinical lab information management systems to the appropriate public health jurisdiction's information system. CONCLUSIONS ELR has the potential to make a large impact on the timeliness and the completeness of communicable disease reporting, but it does not replace the clinician's responsibility to submit a case report with important demographic and epidemiologic information.","Wurtz, Rebecca; Cameron, Bruce J",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,51,28

METHODS Two liquid chip panels were developed which used a target-enriched multiplexed RT-PCR amplification followed by Luminex liquid chip hybridization based on xMAP technology. One was for the detection of 5 type/ subtypes of the influenza virus (called Influenza Panel), the other was for the identification of 14 major respiratory viruses, including emerging human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus (CoV NL63, HKU1), human bocavirus (HBoV), and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) (called Respiratory Panel). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of these two panels were determined. 108 throat swabs from influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases and 88 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) were used to evaluate the two panels. RESULTS The Influenza Panel returned the analytical sensitivity of 4 - 10 copies vRNA/microL of sample for seasonal H1N1, H3N2, pandemic H1N1, and B, and 200 copies vRNA/microL of sample for H5. The analytical sensitivity of the Respiratory Panel was as follows: 10 - 150 copies vRNA/microL of sample for most of the viral targets tested in this panel except RSV (400 copies vRNA/microL of sample). No cross reactivity was observed for both panels. As determined by commercial multi-PCR kit and conventional PCR (for HBoV and WUPyV), the diagnostic sensitivity of the Respiratory Panel for each viral targets ranged from 50.0% to 100.0%, the diagnostic specificity was 96.2%-100.0%, and accordance rate was 93.2% - 100.0%, the kappa correlation of eight viral targets was > 0.75. CONCLUSIONS Two liquid chip assay panels, developed based on xMAP technology, can detect 5 types/subtypes of influenza viruses and 14 respiratory viruses simultaneously in one reaction in 6 hours. They are potentially rapid, sensitive, specific, and high throughput diagnostic tools for major viral pathogens associated with respiratory tract infection.","Xiaoyan, Li; Jinying, Chen; Mei, Kong; Xu, Su; Ming, Zou; Liru, Guo",Clinical laboratory,51,33

The MultiCode-PLx system was tested in parallel with direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) staining and rapid shell vial culture (R-mix cells; Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc. Athens, OH) with 354 respiratory specimens from adult patients that were submitted to the clinical virology laboratory at the Emory University Hospital. Single-target PCRs were performed with retained samples to confirm the positive results obtained with the MultiCode-PLx system for viruses not covered by DFA and R-mix culture (metapneumovirus, coronaviruses [CoV], parainfluenza viruses 4a and 4b, and rhinoviruses) and to resolve any discrepancies between the DFA and R-mix culture and the MultiCode-PLx results for viruses common to both systems. Respiratory viruses were detected in 77 (21.8%) and 116 (32.7%) specimens by DFA and R-mix culture and with the MultiCode-PLx system, respectively. Among the viruses common to both systems, the MultiCode-PLx system detected significantly more influenza A viruses (P = 0.0026). An additional increased diagnostic yield with the MultiCode-PLx system resulted from the detection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 9 specimens, human CoV (HCoV) in 3 specimens, and human rhinovirus (HRV) in 16 specimens. Also, two mixed viral infections were detected by the MultiCode-PLx system (HCoV OC43 and HRV infections and HMPV and HRV infections), but none were detected by DFA and R-mix culture. Single-target PCRs verified the results obtained with the MultiCode-PLx system for 73 of 81 (90.1%) specimens that had discordant results or that were not covered by DFA and R-mix culture. The MultiCode-PLx system provides clinical laboratories with a practical, rapid, and sensitive means for the massively multiplexed molecular detection of common respiratory viruses.","Nolte, Frederick S; Marshall, David J; Rasberry, Christopher; Schievelbein, Sabina; Banks, Grier G; Storch, Gregory A; Arens, Max Q; Buller, Richard S; Prudent, James R",Journal of clinical microbiology,51,19

We here report the outcome of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) segmentectomy with and without the assessment of sentinel nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-three patients with stage IA NSCLC underwent VATS segmentectomy between January 2003 and December 2010. Twenty patients underwent indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and 63 did not. Intraoperative real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine the expression of CK-19 was used for evaluation of metastasis. Perioperative outcome, local recurrence rates and survival were compared in both groups. RESULTS Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with segmentectomy in the SNB group. The false negative rate was 0%. By RT-PCR for CK-19 expression, only one of these patients showed positive sentinel nodes, which indicated isolated tumor cells; however, segmentectomy was not converted to lobectomy. Seven of 63 patients with VATS segementectomy without SNB and none of the SNB group relapsed. In the relapsed patients without SNB, 4 (6.3%) were local recurrences and 3 (4.7%) were distant metastases. Recurrence-free survival rates in both groups were not significantly different because of the short follow-up period of the SNB group. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that VATS segmentectomy with SNB was useful for deciding intraoperatively to perform segmentectomy with an accurate lymph node status.","Moroga, Toshihiko; Yamashita, Shin-ichi; Tokuishi, Keita; Miyawaki, Michiyo; Anami, Kentaro; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Kawahara, Katsunobu",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,51,17

DATA SOURCES A MEDLINE search (1996-March 2000) was performed to identify relevant primary and review articles. References from these articles were also reviewed if deemed important. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION English-language primary and review articles focusing on the treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) were included. Studies focusing exclusively on OM with effusion or serous OM and chronic suppurative OM were excluded. Information regarding prevention and drug therapy was reviewed, with an emphasis placed on advances made in the last two years. DATA SYNTHESIS Recently, an expert panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of only three of 16 systemic antibiotics approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of AOM: amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and ceftriaxone. Controversy exists over the importance of key selection factors used by the expert panel in determining which antibiotics to recommend in a two-step treatment algorithm, that is, in vitro data, pharmacodynamic profiles, and necessity for coverage of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae at all steps of empiric treatment. Additional antibiotic and patient selection factors useful for individualizing therapy include clinical efficacy, adverse effects, frequency and duration of administration, taste, cost, comorbid infections, and ramifications should bacterial resistance develop to the chosen antibiotic. Presumed or past patient/caregiver adherence (especially when antibiotic failure has occurred) is also paramount in selecting antibiotic therapy. A three-step treatment algorithm for refractory AOM that employs amoxicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (depending on the prior dose of and adherence to amoxicillin therapy), and ceftriaxone or tympanocentesis at steps 1, 2, and 3, respectively, appears rational and cost-effective. The recent upsurge in antimicrobial resistance is highlighted, and recommendations are presented for the treatment of AOM and prevention of recurrent otitis media (rAOM). CONCLUSIONS Amoxicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for initial empiric treatment of AOM, although the traditional dosage should be increased in patients at risk for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae. In cases refractory to high-dose amoxicillin, TMP/SMX should be prescribed if adherence to prior therapy seemed good or complete, or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate if adherence was incomplete or questionable. Ceftriaxone should be reserved as third-line treatment. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae emphasizes the importance of alternative medical approaches for the prevention of OM, as well as judicious antibiotic use in established cases. Removal of modifiable risk factors should be first-line therapy for prevention of rAOM. We support the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine per guidelines for prevention of rAOM from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with consideration given to influenza vaccine for cases of rAOM that historically worsen during the flu season. Sulfisoxazole prophylaxis should be reserved for children who are immunocompromised, have concurrent disease states exacerbated by AOM, or meet the criteria of rAOM despite conjugate pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Therapy should be intermittent, beginning at the first sign of an upper respiratory infection, and should continue for 10 days. The invasive nature and risks of anesthesia relegate myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, and adenoidectomy to last-line therapies for rAOM.","Erramouspe, J; Heyneman, C A",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,51,1

Also, it has been suggested that RDN may be beneficial for other conditions characterised by increased sympathetic nerve activity. There are still many uncertainties with regard to efficacy, safety, predictors for success and long-term effects. To answer these important questions, we initiated a Dutch RDN registry aiming to collect data from all RDN procedures performed in the Netherlands. METHODS The Dutch RDN registry is an ongoing investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre cohort study. Twenty-six Dutch hospitals agreed to participate in this registry. All patients who undergo RDN, regardless of the clinical indication or device that is used, will be included. Data are currently being collected on eligibility and screening, treatment and follow-up. RESULTS Procedures have been performed since August 2010. At present, data from 306 patients have been entered into the database. The main indication for RDN was hypertension (n = 302, 99%). Patients had a mean office blood pressure of 177/100 (±29/16) mmHg with a median use of three (range 0-8) blood pressure lowering drugs. Mean 24-hour blood pressure before RDN was 157/93 (±18/13) mmHg. RDN was performed with different devices, with the Simplicity™ catheter currently used most frequently. CONCLUSION Here we report on the rationale and design of the Dutch RDN registry. Enrolment in this investigator-initiated study is ongoing.

Surprisingly, IgA plasma cells infiltrate inflamed tissues in acute Kawasaki disease, including the coronary artery, and are oligoclonal, or antigen-driven. Synthetic versions of predominant IgA antibodies in acute Kawasaki disease arterial tissue bind to an antigen present in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium and in a subset of macrophages in acute inflamed Kawasaki disease tissues. Light and electron microscopic studies of the antigen in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium indicate that the Kawasaki disease-associated antigen localizes to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are consistent with aggregates of viral protein and associated nucleic acid. SUMMARY The identification of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium has provided direction for future Kawasaki disease etiology studies. Transmission electron microscopic examination of glutaraldehyde-fixed medium-sized bronchi from acute Kawasaki disease fatalities and analysis of the protein and nucleic acid components of the inclusions should provide important information about these inclusion bodies and speed the identification of the specific etiologic agent of Kawasaki disease.","Rowley, Anne H; Shulman, Stanford T",Current opinion in pediatrics,51,1

All hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with SARS. Thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. We describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with SARS admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in Richmond Hill, Ont., and the response to a SARS outbreak within our institution. METHODS We collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable SARS. The index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) from a referral hospital on Mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of SARS in Toronto. After 13 days in the ICU, a diagnosis of probable SARS was reached for our index case. Immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. Aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time. RESULTS During the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected SARS, in addition to our index case. All but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with SARS during the period of unprotected exposure. No additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. No cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution. INTERPRETATION SARS can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. We found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.","Dwosh, Hy A; Hong, Harry H L; Austgarden, Douglas; Herman, Stanley; Schabas, Richard",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,51,16

A prospective, randomized, clinical pilot study was conducted among 70 patients with unilateral VLUs treated in a hospital dermatology department in Poland to compare three types of compression therapy (intermittent pneumatic compression, stockings, and short-stretch bandages) in persons with superficial deep venous reflux alone or combined with the segmental variety. Study endpoints were change in ulcer dimensions and proportions healed. Patients with superficial or combined superficial and deep vein insufficiency were randomly allocated to receive one of the three therapies (one of each vein type for each treatment option, six groups total). All patients received saline-soaked gauze dressings along with micronized purified flavonoid fraction, diosmin, hesperidin, and Daflon 500 once daily. Compression treatments were changed or pneumatic compression provided daily for 15 days. Wound size reduction and percentage of wounds healed were significantly higher in groups receiving intermittent pneumatic compression or stockings than in groups using short-stretch bandages (for percentage change of ulcer surface area, P = 0.02; for healing rates P = 0.01).

BRV isolates have been detected in the stools of neonatal calves with diarrhea in both Iowa and Ohio and in several areas of Europe. However, this virus has been reported only once in Canada. Therefore, a study was performed to determine the extent to which bovine torovirus is present in calves with diarrhea from farms in southern Ontario. A total of 118 fecal samples from symptomatic calves and 43 control specimens from asymptomatic calves were examined by electron microscopy (EM) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for the presence of torovirus. Torovirus RNA was detected in 43 of the 118 diarrheic samples (36.4%) by RT-PCR with primers designed in the conserved 3' end of the torovirus genome. By EM, torovirus particles were observed in 37 of the 118 specimens (31.4%). All but one of these samples were also positive by RT-PCR. The incidence of torovirus in the asymptomatic control specimens by RT-PCR was only 11.6%. To establish the identity of the particles observed in the diarrheic specimens, five of the amplicons from samples positive by both RT-PCR and EM were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the bovine torovirus found in southern Ontario manifests between 96 and 97% sequence identity to the BRV type 1 strain found in Iowa. This study shows that bovine torovirus is a common virus in the fecal specimens of calves with diarrhea from farms in southern Ontario and thus may be an important pathogen of cattle.","Duckmanton, L; Carman, S; Nagy, E; Petric, M",Journal of clinical microbiology,51,5

Although previous seroepidemiological studies demonstrated that asymptomatic infection was uncommon among health care workers and adult contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, it is unclear whether this would extend to the pediatric population. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus among asymptomatic children living near Amoy Gardens (site of largest community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong) compared with a low-risk region where no community transmission occurred. METHODS The study was conducted from September to October 2003. Target subjects living in the defined high-risk and low-risk areas were approached through the schools within the respective localities. We recruited 353 and 361 children, respectively, from the high-risk and low-risk areas and collected 3 to 5 mL of blood for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus IgG antibody testing by immunofluorescence antibody assay and confirmation by neutralization test. Parents of all of the subjects who joined the study were contacted by telephone, and a standardized questionnaire was administered by a research nurse to collect information including sociodemographic data, history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the subjects and members of the household, history of contact with known cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like symptoms since onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, travel history of the child and his/her relatives within the 15 days before any such symptom onset, use of health service as a result of such symptoms, and whether there were deaths of relatives as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome. RESULTS Two (0.57%) of 353 asymptomatic children from the high-risk area were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibody compared with 0 of 361 in the low-risk region. None of the 14 children who lived in the high-risk area and had known contacts with severe acute respiratory syndrome patients were seropositive. CONCLUSIONS As in adults, subclinical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection was rare in children in the 2003 epidemic. The very low seroprevalence implies little or no population herd immunity to protect against future resurgence of severe acute respiratory syndrome.","Lee, Pamela P W; Wong, Wilfred H S; Leung, Gabriel M; Chiu, Susan S; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Peiris, Joseph S M; Lam, Tai-Hing; Lau, Yu-Lung",Pediatrics,51,24

Red foxes and coyotes were confiscated from an animal dealer based in Ohio (USA), and gray foxes were purchased from an animal dealer in Indiana (USA). Emphasis was placed on detection of pathogens representing potential health risks to native wildlife, domestic animals, or humans. All animals were negative for rabies; however, 15 gray foxes were incubating canine distemper at necropsy. Serologic tests disclosed antibodies to canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine parainfluenza virus in one or more host species. Twenty-three species of parasites (two protozoans, three trematodes, four cestodes, eleven nematodes, and three arthropods) were found, including species with substantial pathogenic capabilities. Echinococcus multilocularis, a recognized human pathogen not enzootic in the southeastern United States, was found in red foxes. Based on this information, we conclude that the increasingly common practice of wild canid translocation for stocking fox-chasing enclosures poses potential health risks to indigenous wildlife, domestic animals, and humans and, therefore, is biologically hazardous.","Davidson, W R; Appel, M J; Doster, G L; Baker, O E; Brown, J F",Journal of wildlife diseases,51,28

However, modern contrast agents are well tolerated with a low risk of aspiration. Our current guidelines recommend fasting four to six hours before elective and semi-urgent cardiac catheterisation despite a lack of evidence to support this. We sought to determine the duration and effects of fasting at our centre. METHODS A single-centre prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterisation over a six-month period between 7 August 2017 to 7 February 2018 at Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand. RESULTS One thousand and thirty patients with a mean age of 66±12 years underwent catheterisation. Sixty-seven percent were male, 26% had diabetes, 72% had hypertension and 23% had stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease. The mean duration of fasting was 11.6±4.9 hours with 80% fasting longer than recommended. One hundred and eight (48%) patients with documented chronic kidney disease did not receive recommended pre-hydration. The most common symptoms related to fasting were hunger (47 %), nausea (3.9%) and vomiting (0.8%). Hypertension (4.1%) and hyperglycaemia (0.8%) occurred due to missed medication. There were no reports of aspiration. CONCLUSION Most patients were fasted for significantly longer than recommended and pre-hydration was underutilised in patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. There were no episodes of aspiration with modern contrast agents. Further studies are required to evaluate the need for fasting prior to non-emergency cardiac catheterisation.","Bacus, Sheila Badana; Parsons, John; Benatar, Jocelyne; Somaratne, Jithendra; Webster, Mark; Parke, Rachael",The New Zealand medical journal,51,17

It appeared that HR2 peptides, but not HR1 peptides, were inhibitory. Their efficacy was, however, significantly lower than that of corresponding HR2 peptides of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in inhibiting MHV infection. Biochemical and electron microscopical analyses showed that, when mixed, SARS-CoV HR1 and HR2 peptides assemble into a six-helix bundle consisting of HR1 as a central triple-stranded coiled coil in association with three HR2 alpha-helices oriented in an antiparallel manner. The stability of this complex, as measured by its resistance to heat dissociation, appeared to be much lower than that of the corresponding MHV complex, which may explain the different inhibitory potencies of the HR2 peptides. Analogous to other class I viral fusion proteins, the six-helix complex supposedly represents a postfusion conformation that is formed after insertion of the fusion peptide, proposed here for coronaviruses to be located immediately upstream of HR1, into the target membrane. The resulting close apposition of fusion peptide and spike transmembrane domain facilitates membrane fusion. The inhibitory potency of the SARS-CoV HR2-peptides provides an attractive basis for the development of a therapeutic drug for SARS.","Bosch, Berend Jan; Martina, Byron E E; Van Der Zee, Ruurd; Lepault, Jean; Haijema, Bert Jan; Versluis, Cees; Heck, Albert J R; De Groot, Raoul; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Rottier, Peter J M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,51,1

Four of these patients had huge multiloculated PLAs and underwent RF ablation plus antibiotics. The inclusion criteria for RF ablation were as follows: multiloculated PLA confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), widest diameter of the PLA ≥5 cm, failure to respond to or not suitable to treatment with percutaneous drainage (PD), and patient refusal of surgery. The safety and effectiveness of RF ablation were initially assessed. All patients were commenced on antibiotics on admission to our hospital. CT-guided percutaneous catheter drainage was attempted in one patient but was unsuccessful. The main organism isolated from cultures of these patients' blood or abscess samples was Klebsiella pneumoniae (3/4). RF ablation was performed as soon as eligibility according to the above criteria was established.RF ablation was technically successful in all 4 study patients, all PLAs being completely eradicated.

Nine studies have reported that laws making indoor workplaces and public places smoke-free were associated with rapid, sizeable reductions in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, most studies examined hospitalizations for 1 year or less after laws were implemented; thus, whether the observed effect was sustained over time was unknown. The Pueblo Heart Study examined the impact of a municipal smoke-free ordinance in the city of Pueblo, Colorado, that took effect on July 1, 2003. The rate of AMI hospitalizations for city residents decreased 27%, from 257 per 100,000 person-years during the 18 months before the ordinance's implementation to 187 during the 18 months after it (the Phase I post-implementation period). This report extends that analysis for an additional 18 months through June 30, 2006 (the Phase II post-implementation period). The rate of AMI hospitalizations among city residents continued to decrease to 152 per 100,000 person-years, a decline of 19% and 41% from the Phase I post-implementation and pre-implementation period, respectively. No significant changes were observed in two comparison areas. These findings suggest that smoke-free policies can result in reductions in AMI hospitalizations that are sustained over a 3-year period and that these policies are important in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease.

The innate, antiviral response must be activated rapidly after pathogen recognition, and alveolar macrophages (AMphi) play a role in this response. TLR3 and protein kinase R (PKR) recognize dsRNA, a replication intermediate of RNA viruses, and initiate transcription of IFN-alphabeta. In this study, synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C) was used to investigate innate responses of porcine AMphi compared with responses of peritoneal macrophages (PMphi). Poly(I:C) triggered IFN-alphabeta in AMphi and PMphi, but levels in AMphi were higher. In contrast, mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes, Mx and PKR, were greater in PMphi than AMphi. Low levels of Mx and PKR transcription in AMphi were not due to deficient type I IFN receptor signaling, as exogenous IFN-alpha induced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1. To investigate the differential mechanism by which IFN-alphabeta transcription is activated in AMphi and PMphi, 2-aminopurine (2-AP) was used to block dsRNA-mediated activation of PKR. IFN-alphabeta, Mx, and PKR mRNA levels in AMphi after poly(I:C) treatment were unaffected by 2-AP; conversely, transcription of IFN-alphabeta, Mx, or PKR remained at baseline levels in PMphi. Phosphorylated PKR was detected in PMphi, but not AMphi, after poly(I:C) treatment. In addition to IFN-alphabeta gene induction, mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and RANTES were higher in AMphi than PMphi after poly(I:C) stimulation. In summary, differential dsRNA-induced cytokine expression patterns between AMphi and PMphi provide evidence that dsRNA recognition and subsequent signaling is likely mediated via TLR3 in AMphi and PKR in PMphi.","Loving, Crystal L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Ma, Wenjun; Richt, Juergen A; Sacco, Randy E",Journal of immunology,51,17

METHODS 20 patients (20 male) with an average age of 54 (42-59) were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 36 months. Measurements of range of motion (ROM) and of tight circumference were collected. Lysholm and Rougraff Score were also performed. All the patients underwent a US evaluation the morphologic changes of the repaired tendon. RESULTS mean active ROM was 1°-117°; average difference in the circumference of the quadriceps was 2.6% 10 C and 3.3% 15 C. The mean Lysholm Score calculated was 88/100; the mean Rougraff Score 17/25. At ultrasonographic evaluation all tendons were continuous; heterotopic ossification was present in 18 quadriceps tendons. Thickness was augmented in 18 quadriceps tendons and in 5 patellar tendons. Vascularization was always conserved. Lateral subluxation of patella was reported in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS patellar drilling holes repair is a non-demanding procedure, inexpensive and technically uncomplicated.

EAF pose a life-threatening risk to patients already weakened by surgical insult by altering fluid and electrolyte balance and fostering malnutrition. The authors describe a method of wound management for a 64-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and bipolar disorder who developed a large abdominal wound containing multiple high-output EAF after an incarcerated abdominal hernia repair, wound infection, and subsequent laparotomy and lysis of adhesions followed by graft placement and negative pressure wound therapy. The volume, consistency, and location of the EAF caused commercial negative pressure devices to fail and simple gauze dressings were ineffective in maintaining a clean wound base and containing odor. Effluent collection and wound healing was achieved utilizing a modified method of EAF management that included two connecting rubberized catheter drains and continuous wound irrigation with wall suction and cotton gauze for debridement. Surgical EAF closure was successful after 6 months of care. This method provided a satisfactory balance between the diagnosis of EAF and the readiness to meet the physiologic demands of definitive surgical treatment.","Wright, Aaron; Wright, Monica",Ostomy/wound management,51,22

Several lines of evidence suggest that the template preference of the RNA replicase is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the viral nonstructural polyprotein. Cis-acting RNA elements in the viral genome also play crucial roles in regulating genome replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. In this report, a series of RNA templates were analyzed in vitro and in vivo to define functional elements in the 5' end of the genome. The 5' UTR was shown to contain distinct core promoter elements for both minus- and plus-strand synthesis. In addition, two conserved stem-loop structures within the nsP1 coding sequence enhanced RNA replication but were not required. Studies with chimeric templates and trans-competition experiments suggest that the 5' determinant for minus-strand initiation can differ among alphaviruses and binds to one or more limiting replicase components. The results provide compelling evidence that the 5' and 3' ends of alphavirus genome RNAs must interact to initiate replication and we propose one model for how this interaction might occur. In addition to providing new insight into the initiation of alphavirus genome replication, these results have implications for the development of improved alphavirus vector systems with reduced recombination potential.","Frolov, I; Hardy, R; Rice, C M",RNA,51,24

This study sought to evaluate the impact of hypertension and the use of ACEI/ARB on clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 3,788 patients aged 30 years or older who were confirmed with COVID-19 with real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were identified from a claims-based cohort in Korea. The primary study outcome was severe clinical events, a composite of intensive care unit admission, need for ventilator care, and death. RESULTS: Patients with hypertension (n = 1,190, 31.4 %) were older and had higher prevalence of comorbidities than those without hypertension. The risk of the primary study outcome was significantly higher in the hypertension group, even after multivariable adjustment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.67;95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 2.69). Among 1,044 patients with hypertensive medical treatment, 782 (74.9 %) were on ACEI or ARB. The ACEI/ARB subgroup had a lower risk of severe clinical outcomes compared to the no ACEI/ARB group, but this did not remain significant after multivariable adjustment (aOR, 0.68;95 % CI, 0.41 to 1.15). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hypertension had worse COVID-19 outcomes than those without hypertension, while the use of RAAS-blocking agents was not associated with increased risk of any adverse study outcomes. The use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, supporting current guidance to continue these medications when indicated.","Kang, S. H.; Lee, D. H.; Han, K.

At the group level, higher scores on occupation and worry co-occurred, and occupation predicted worry one hour later, but not vice versa. There were substantial individual differences in the magnitudes and directions of the effects. For instance, occupation with COVID-19 was related to increases in worry for some but decreases in worry for others. Neuroticism did not predict any of these individual differences in the links between worry and occupation.

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS: Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed. RESULTS: Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones. Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation.

Travel restriction and home/office quarantine are some frequently utilized non-pharmaceutical interventions, which bring the worst crisis of airline industry compared with other transport modes. Therefore, the post-recovery of global air transport is extremely important, which is full of uncertainty but rare to be studied. The explicit/implicit interacted factors generate difficulties in drawing insights into the complicated relationship and policy intervention assessment. In this paper, a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is utilized for the modelling of the post-recovery behaviour, in which parameters are synthesized from expert knowledge, open-source information and interviews from travellers. The tendency of public policy in reaction to COVID-19 is analyzed, whilst sensitivity analysis and forward/backward belief propagation analysis are conducted. Results show the feasibility and scalability of this model. On condition that no effective health intervention method (vaccine, medicine) will be available soon, it is predicted that nearly 120 days from May 22, 2020, would be spent for the number of commercial flights to recover back to 58.52%-60.39% on different interventions.

We present an easy to follow and detailed protocol for producing 3D printed face shields and an effective decontamination protocol, allowing their reuse. METHODS: The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products, and produced a simple decontamination protocol to allow their reuse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the decontamination protocol, we inoculated bacterial suspensions of E. coli and S. aureus on to the face shield components, performed the decontamination procedure, and finally swabbed and enumerated organisms onto plates that were incubated for 12-24 hours. Decontamination effectiveness was evaluated using the average log10 reduction in colony counts. RESULTS: Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production at UNMC and at Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, Hawaii). Overall, the decontamination protocol was highly effective against both E. coli and S. aureus, achieving a &#8805;4 log10 (99.99%) reduction in colony counts for every replicate from each component of the face shield unit. DISCUSSION: Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed face shield and N95 mask reuse, offering a higher level of protection for anesthesiology providers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In a time of urgent need, our protocol enabled the rapid production of face shields by individuals with little to no 3D printing experience, and provided a simple and effective decontamination protocol allowing reuse of the face shields.","Armijo, Priscila R; Markin, Nicholas W; Nguyen, Scott; Ho, Dao H; Horseman, Timothy S; Lisco, Steven J; Schiller, Alicia M",Am. j. infect. control,51,16

This study aims to summarize the key points and supply suggestions on screening paediatric COVID-19 patients more appropriately. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included paediatric patients who have accepted SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (30 January 2020 to 13 February 2020) and compared them with paediatric-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Besides, a review was carried out by analysing all current literature about laboratory-confirmed paediatric cases with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 46 suspected cases included in the descriptive study. The results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing were all negative. Compared with paediatric-confirmed cases, the incidence of epidemic history was lower in suspected cases (P < .001). The rate of fever (P < .001), cough (P < .001), headache or dizziness (P < .001), vomiting (P < .001) and abdominal discomfort or distention (P = .01) were more observed in the included suspected children. There were more children having decreased WBC count in the confirmed group. In the literature review, twenty-nine studies were obtained with 488 paediatric COVID-19 cases. 88.6% of them had epidemiological history. Cough and fever were the most common symptoms. Compared with older patients, the incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, lethargy and headache or dizziness was lower, while gastrointestinal symptoms were reported more. CONCLUSIONS: Children with a history of close contact with confirmed cases, manifested as cough and fever should be paid more attention to after excluding infection of other common pathogens. Atypical symptoms should not be over-emphasized in screening paediatric COVID-19. More studies are needed for guiding efficient recognition in paediatric COVID-19.","Zhang, Yin; Lin, Jilei; Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Enmei; Luo, Zhengxiu; Li, Qubei; Xu, Feng; He, Ling; Zou, Lin; Fu, Zhou; Dai, Jihong",Eur J Clin Invest,51,1

Based on current recommendations for various amendments in an orthodontic practice, this scoping review aims to identify orthodontic appliances that are most appropriate to us during this on-going pandemic. Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) were searched up until August 11, 2020. Full-text articles in English with keywords ""COVID-19 and Orthodontics"" and related search terms were included. Results: Out of 17 retracted articles, only 4 articles were found to be brief the choice for orthodontic appliances in pandemic times speculating clear aligner therapy (CAT) to be a pragmatic solution. The remaining articles were also thoroughly studied and the new norms set by the pandemic were determined. Criteria for orthodontic appliance selection included careful patient screening and collection of records, minimal physical visits, efficient use of technology, virtual consultations but the use of PPE for physical appointments; and lesser AGPs with a lesser risk of airborne transmission. Conclusions: Subject to regional demands, CAT can be considered as the relatively safer modality-predictable and effective apposite to fixed orthodontic appliances in these unprecedented times.","Kaur, Harneet; Kochhar, Anuraj Singh; Gupta, Harshita; Singh, Gurkeerat; Kubavat, Ajay",,51,10

METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. We collected demographic, clinical, and radiological data; time course; and treatment of patients meeting the stroke unit admission criteria from March 14 to May 14, 2020 (COVID-19 period group). Data were compared with the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period group). RESULTS: 195 patients were analyzed; 83 in the COVID-19 period group, resulting in a 26% decline of acute strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) admitted to our center compared with the previous year (p = 0.038). Ten patients (12%) tested positive for PCR SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of patients aged 65 years and over was lower in the COVID-19 period group (53 vs. 68.8%, p = 0.025). During the pandemic period, analyzed patients were more frequently smokers (27.7 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.002) and had less frequently history of prior stroke (13.3 vs. 25%, p = 0.043) or atrial fibrillation (9.6 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). ASPECTS score was lower (9 [7-10] vs. 10 [8-10], p = 0.032), NIHSS score was slightly higher (5 [2-14] vs. 4 [2-8], p = 0.122), onset-to-door time was higher (304 [93-760] vs. 197 [91.25-645] min, p = 0.104), and a lower proportion arrived within 4.5 h from onset of symptoms (43.4 vs. 58%, p = 0.043) during the CO-VID-19 period. There were no differences between proportion of patients receiving recanalization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy) and in-hospital delays. CONCLUSION: We observed a reduction in the number of acute strokes and TIAs admitted during the COVID-19 period. This drop affected especially elderly patients, and despite a delay in their arrival to the emergency department, the proportion of patients treated with recanalization therapies was preserved.","Velilla-Alonso, Gabriel; García-Pastor, Andrés; Rodríguez-López, Ángela; Gómez-Roldós, Ana; Sánchez-Soblechero, Antonio; Amaya-Pascasio, Laura; Díaz-Otero, Fernando; Fernández-Bullido, Yolanda; Iglesias-Mohedano, Ana María; Vázquez-Alén, Pilar; Vales-Montero, Marta; Gil-Núñez, Antonio-Carmelo",Cerebrovasc Dis,51,1

This study investigated the relationship between the receipt, timing, and number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and neurodevelopmental outcomes among preterm infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of preterm infants (gestational age <34 weeks) with a full neurodevelopmental assessment at 18-36 months corrected age from October 2008 to September 2020. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers were collected. Multivariable regressions were used to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcomes. RESULTS: 654 preterm infants were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 25 months. 295 infants (45%) received a total of 1,322 blood transfusions. After adjustment for gestational age, baseline morbidity, and socioeconomic status, receipt of RBC transfusion was associated with decreased two-year cognitive and motor function, but not language (p=0.047, 0.025, and 0.879, respectively). There was no significant difference in outcomes between receipt of transfusion in the first week of life compared to after. Number of transfusions was associated with decreased cognitive, language, and motor function (all p<0.001), and increased likelihood to develop severe neurodevelopmental impairment (adjusted-odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.15; p=0.004). DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates an association between RBC transfusion and lower cognitive and motor outcomes at two-years after adjustment for prematurity and illness at birth. Increasing number of transfusions worsened neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Lum, Trenton G; Sugar, Jenna; Yim, Rachel; Fertel, Sophie; Morales, Ana; Poeltler, Debra; Katheria, Anup","Blood transfus.

We compare the outcomes between CA and AA patients undergoing minimally invasive partial nephrectomy (PN) at our high-volume center. Methods We identified 942 robotic and 38 laparoscopic PN cases between 2007-2017 (852 CA and 129 AA). We compared demographics and perioperative outcomes. We then estimated the overall and disease-specific survival. Results Age, BMI, operative time, EBL, nephrometry score, tumor size, CCI, length of stay, and gender were not statistically different. The mean preoperative GFR was higher in the AA cohort (91.4mL/min/1.73m2 vs 86.1mL/min/1.73m2,p=0.007); however, at 1-year there was no mean difference (76.8mL/min/1.73m2 vs 74.5mL/min/1.73m2,p=0.428). There was a higher percentage of Fuhrman Grade 3/4 in AA (33.3% vs 22.5%,p=0.044). The AA cohort had a 2.66x higher incidence of papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (34.9% vs 13.1%,p<0.001) and unclassified RCC (3.9% vs. 0.4%,p=0.001). There was no difference in tumor stage (p=0.260) or incidence of benign histology (15.3% vs 11.6%,p=0.278). There were no differences in thirty-day complications (p=0.330). There was no observed difference in overall survival (p=0.752) or disease-free survival (p=0.403) at 43.2 months. Conclusions For low stage renal cancer, there was no difference in CKD, overall and disease-free survival at a median follow up of 43.2 months, despite having higher grade tumors and a higher percentage of unclassified RCC in the AA cohort. AA had a higher incidence of papillary RCC. The equivalent survival could be due to the earlier discovery of lower stage renal masses incidentally identified on imaging studies performed equally for other reasons in both AA and CA patients.","Sands, Kenneth G; Bhatt, Rohit; Vetter, Joel; Paradis, Alethea; Chow, Alexander K; Bhayani, Sam; Figenshau, R Sherburne; Venkatesh, Ramakrishna J",J. endourol,51,20

Several studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 may worsen the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), with the potential to increase mortality rates in patients with advanced disease. The potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 to induce PD has also been suggested because the virus can enter the brain, where it can trigger cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration. In this review, we will discuss the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to exacerbate and cause certain neurological disorders, including PD.

METHODS: During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, SARS-CoV-2-infected index cases and their close contacts in schools were identified by school and public health officials. For in-school contacts, we assessed symptoms and offered SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing; performed epidemiologic investigations and whole-genome sequencing to identify in-school transmission; and calculated secondary attack rate (SAR) by school setting (e.g., sports, elementary school classroom), index case role (i.e., staff, student), and index case symptomatic status. RESULTS: We identified 86 index cases and 1,119 contacts, 688 (63.1%) of whom received testing. Fifty-nine (8.7%) of 679 contacts tested positive; 15 (17.4%) of 86 index cases resulted in &#8805;2 positive contacts. Among 55 persons testing positive with available symptom data, 31 (56.4%) were asymptomatic. Highest SAR were in indoor, high-contact sports settings (23.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.7, 33.3), staff meetings/lunches (18.2%, CI 4.5-31.8), and elementary school classrooms (9.5%, CI 6.5-12.5). SAR was higher for staff (13.1%, CI 9.0-17.2) versus student index cases (5.8%, CI 3.6-8.0) and for symptomatic (10.9%, CI 8.1-13.9) versus asymptomatic index cases (3.0%, CI 1.0-5.5). CONCLUSIONS: Indoor sports may pose a risk to the safe operation of in-person learning. Preventing infection in staff members, through measures that include COVID-19 vaccination, is critical to reducing in-school transmission. Because many positive contacts were asymptomatic, contact tracing should be paired with testing, regardless of symptoms.","Gettings, Jenna R; Gold, Jeremy A W; Kimball, Anne; Forsberg, Kaitlin; Scott, Colleen; Uehara, Anna; Tong, Suxiang; Hast, Marisa; Swanson, Megan R; Morris, Elana; Oraka, Emeka; Almendares, Olivia; Thomas, Ebony S; Mehari, Lemlem; McCloud, Jazmyn; Roberts, Gurleen; Crosby, Deanna; Balajee, Abirami; Burnett, Eleanor; Chancey, Rebecca J; Cook, Peter; Donadel, Morgane; Espinosa, Catherine; Evans, Mary E; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E; Forero, Catalina; Kukielka, Esther A; Li, Yan; Marcet, Paula L; Mitruka, Kiren; Nakayama, Jasmine Y; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; O039,; Hegarty, Michelle; Pratt, Caroline; Rice, Marion E; Rodriguez Stewart, Roxana M; Sabogal, Raquel; Sanchez, Emanny; Velasco-Villa, Andres; Weng, Mark K; Zhang, Jing; Rivera, Grant; Parrott, Tonia; Franklin, Rachel; Memark, Janet; Drenzek, Cherie; Hall, Aron J; Kirking, Hannah L; Tate, Jacqueline E; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha",Clin. infect. dis,51,16

We sought to identify racial/ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7,868 patients by race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the US between 01/17/2020 and 7/22/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic support, and hospitalization without any of the above). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital. Results: Among 7,868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0% were Hispanic, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3% were Asian, and 35.2% were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2%) and renal replacement therapy (6.6%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1%). Overall mortality was 18.4% with 53% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.14) for Black patients, 0.90 (95% CI 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95% CI 0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The median OR across hospitals was 1.99 (95% CI 1.74-2.48). Results were similar for MACE. Asian patients had the highest COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.90). Conclusions: Although in-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity due to their disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.","Rodriguez, Fatima; Solomon, Nicole; de Lemos, James A; Das, Sandeep R; Morrow, David A; Bradley, Steven M; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Williams Iv, Joseph H; Holmes, DaJuanicia; Matsouaka, Roland A; Gupta, Divya; Gluckman, Ty J; Abdalla, Marwah; Albert, Michelle A; Yancy, Clyde W; Wang, Tracy Y",Circulation,51,21

There is emerging evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in the blood of patients from China and some developed countries. However, there is inadequate data reported in Ghana and other parts of Africa, where blood transfusion service heavily relies on voluntary and replacement blood donors. This study aimed to investigate whether plasma of infected individuals could pose significant transfusion transmitted risk of COVID-19 in Ghanaian populations. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted at the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research into Tropical Medicine (KCCR), KNUST, Ghana. Study subjects comprised contacts of COVID-19 individuals, those with classical symptoms of COVID-19 and individuals who had recovered based on the new Ghana discharge criteria. Whole blood, sputum or deep coughed saliva samples were collected and transported to KCCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Viral nucleic acid was extracted from sputum/nasopharyngeal samples using Da An Gene column based kit and from plasma using LBP nucleic acid extraction kit. Real-Time PCR was performed specifically targeting the ORF1ab and Nucleocapsid (N) genomic regions of the virus. RESULTS: A total of 97 individuals were recruited into the study, with more than half being males (58; 59.7%). The mean age of all subjects was 33 years (SD = 7.7) with minimum being 22 years and maximum 56 years. Majority (76; 78.4%) of all the subjects were asymptomatic, and among the few symptomatic subjects, cough (10; 10.3%) was the most predominant symptom. Of the 97 sputum samples tested, 79 (81.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We identified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the plasma of 1 (1.03%) subject who had clinically recovered. CONCLUSION: This study reports the identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in a convalescent individual in Ghana. Due to the low prevalence observed and the marginal cycling thresholds associated, the risk of transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is negligible. Well-powered studies and advanced diagnostics to determine infectious viremia is recommended to further evaluate the potential risk of hematogenous transmission among recovered patients.","Owusu, Michael; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; El-Duah, Philip; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Yeboah, Richmond; Adu, Eric; Asamoah, Jesse; Frimpong, Michael; Senyo, Japhet; Acheampong, Godfred; Mutocheluh, Mohamed; Amuasi, John; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Phillips, Richard Odame",PLoS One,51,32

Engaged curiosity toward each patient is a source of meaning and connection for health care providers, and it protects against sympathetic distress and burnout. In a prolonged crisis like Covid-19, clinicians provide care out of a sense of duty, especially the duty of nonabandonment. We argue that when duty alone is relied on too heavily, with fear and frustration continually suppressed, the risk of burnout is dramatically increased. Even before Covid-19, clinicians often worked under dehumanizing and unjust conditions, and rates of burnout were 50 percent for physicians and 33 percent for nurses. The Covid-19 intensification of burnout can serve as a wake-up call that the structure of health care needs to be improved if we are to prevent the loss of a whole generation of empathic clinicians.","Anzaldua, Adrian; Halpern, Jodi",Hastings Cent Rep,51,32

METHODS: We first tested SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell (C&#959;V-2-ST) immunity and expansion in unexposed donors, COVID-19 infected individuals (convalescent), asymptomatic PCR-positive subjects, vaccinated individuals, non-ICU hospitalized patients and ICU patients who either recovered and were discharged (ICU recovered) or had a prolonged stay and/or died (ICU critical). CoV-2-STs were generated from all types of donors and underwent phenotypic and functional assessment. RESULTS: We demonstrate causal relationship between the expansion of endogenous CoV-2-STs and the disease outcome; insufficient expansion of circulating CoV-2-STs, identified hospitalized patients at high-risk for an adverse outcome. CoV-2-STs with a similarly functional and non-alloreactive, albeit highly cytotoxic, profile against SARS-CoV-2 could be expanded from both convalescent and vaccinated donors generating clinical-scale, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell products with functional activity against both the unmutated virus and its B.1.1.7 variant. In contrast, critical COVID-19 patient-originating CoV-2-STs failed to expand, recapitulating the in vivo failure of CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity to control the infection. CoV-2-STs generated from asymptomatic PCR+ individuals presented only weak responses whereas their counterparts originating from exposed to other seasonal coronaviruses subjects failed to kill the virus, thus disempowering the hypothesis of protective cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide evidence on risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the feasibility of generating powerful CoV-2-ST products from both convalescent and vaccinated donors as an ""off-the shelf"" T-cell immunotherapy for high-risk patients.","Papayanni, Penelope-Georgia; Chasiotis, Dimitrios; Koukoulias, Kiriakos; Georgakopoulou, Aphrodite; Iatrou, Anastasia; Gavriilaki, Eleni; Giannaki, Chrysavgi; Bitzani, Militsa; Geka, Eleni; Tasioudis, Polychronis; Chloros, Diamantis; Fylaktou, Asimina; Kioumis, Ioannis; Triantafyllidou, Maria; Dimou-Besikli, Sotiria; Karavalakis, Georgios; Boutou, Afroditi K; Siotou, Eleni; Anagnostopoulos, Achilles; Papadopoulou, Anastasia; Yannaki, Evangelia",Clin. infect. dis,51,16

Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift toward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. The observation that only one-third of transmission was presymptomatic at baseline, combined with the finding that NPIs reduced presymptomatic transmission by less than 20%, suggests that the overall impact of NPIs was driven in large part by reductions in transmission following symptom onset. This implies that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as contact tracing and isolation, are particularly important for control of SARS-CoV-2. Interventions which specifically reduce opportunities for presymptomatic transmission, such as quarantine of asymptomatic contacts, are likely to have smaller, but non-negligible, effects on overall transmission.","Bushman, Mary; Worby, Colin; Chang, Hsiao-Han; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Hanage, William P",Eur J Epidemiol,51,29

In this work, we recreated the scene of a year ago, 2020, when the pandemic erupted across the world for the fifty countries with more COVID-19 cases reported. We performed some experiments in which we compare state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as LSTM, against online incremental machine learning algorithms to adapt them to the daily changes in the spread of the disease and predict future COVID-19 cases. To compare the methods, we performed three experiments: In the first one, we trained the models using only data from the country we predicted. In the second one, we use data from all fifty countries to train and predict each of them. In the first and second experiment, we used a static hold-out approach for all methods. In the third experiment, we trained the incremental methods sequentially, using a prequential evaluation. This scheme is not suitable for most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms because they need to be retrained from scratch for every batch of predictions, causing a computational burden.

Measurement technologies like single-cell RNA-sequencing and CRISPR-based lineage tracing have opened new windows on these processes, through computational trajectory inference and lineage reconstruction. While these two mathematical problems are deeply related, methods for trajectory inference are not typically designed to leverage information from lineage tracing and vice versa. Here, we present LineageOT, a unified framework for lineage tracing and trajectory inference. Specifically, we leverage mathematical tools from graphical models and optimal transport to reconstruct developmental trajectories from time courses with snapshots of both cell states and lineages. We find that lineage data helps disentangle complex state transitions with increased accuracy using fewer measured time points. Moreover, integrating lineage tracing with trajectory inference in this way could enable accurate reconstruction of developmental pathways that are impossible to recover with state-based methods alone.","Forrow, Aden; Schiebinger, Geoffrey",Nat Commun,51,16

Here, nanoparticle coatings of three antimicrobial materials (Ag, CuO and ZnO) are deposited on both solid flat surfaces as well as porous filter media, and their activity against SARS-CoV-2 viability is compared with a viral plaque assay. These nanocoatings are manufactured by aerosol nanoparticle self-assembly during their flame synthesis. Nanosilver particles as a coating exhibit the strongest antiviral activity of the three studied nanomaterials, while copper oxide exhibits moderate activity, and zinc oxide does not appear to significantly reduce the virus infectivity. Thus, nanosilver and copper oxide show potential as antiviral coatings on solid surfaces and on filter media to minimize transmission and super-spreading events while also providing critical information for the current and any future pandemic mitigation efforts.","Merkl, Padryk Long Siwen McInerney Gerald M.; Sotiriou, Georgios A.",Nanomaterials,51,16

Whether declines in VE are due to waning immunity, the Delta variant, or other causes, is debated. MethodsWe conducted a prospective study of 8,834,604 New York adults, comparing vaccine cohorts defined by product, age, and month of full-vaccination to age-specific unvaccinated cohorts, by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. VE was estimated from May 1, 2021 for incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (weekly life-table hazard rates through September 3) and hospitalizations (monthly incidence rates through August 31). Results155,092 COVID-19 cases and 14,862 hospitalizations occurred. Estimated VE for cases declined contemporaneously across age, products, and time-cohorts, from high levels beginning May 1 (1.8% Delta variant prevalence), to a nadir around July 10 (85.3% Delta), with limited changes thereafter (>95% Delta). Decreases were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech (-24.6%, -19.1%, -14.1% for 18-49, 50-64 years, and [≥]65 years, respectively), and similar for Moderna (-18.0%, -11.6%, -9.0%, respectively) and Janssen (-19.2%, -10.8, -10.9%, respectively). VE for hospitalization for adults 18-64 years was >86% across cohorts, without time trend. Among persons [≥]65 years, VE declined from May to August for Pfizer-BioNTech (95.0% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%). VE was lower for Janssen, without trend, ranging 85.5%-82.8%. ConclusionsDeclines in VE for cases may have been primarily driven by factors other than waning. VE for hospitalizations remained high, with modest declines limited to Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients [≥]65 years, supporting targeted booster dosing recommendations.","Rosenberg, Eli; Dorabwila, Vajeera; Easton, Delia; Bauer, Ursula; Kumar, Jessica; Hoen, Rebecca; Hoefer, Dina; Wu, Meng; Lutterloh, Emily; Conroy, Mary Beth; Greene, Danielle; Zucker, Howard A",,51,1

Three vaccines have been approved in the United States (USA). However, there is still some hesitancy in COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among some subgroups, including college students. While research is limited on vaccine acceptability behavior among college students, preliminary data suggests hesitancy as being high. This study aimed to explain the correlates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among college students who reported hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine and those who did not using the initiation component of the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change. Using a cross-sectional study design, data were collected from a Southern USA University (n = 282) utilizing a valid and reliable 27-item questionnaire in February and March 2021. Almost half (47.5%) of participants reported hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The three constructs of MTM's initiation model, behavioral confidence (b = 0.089, p &lt; 0.001), participatory dialogue (b = 0.056, p &lt; 0.001), and changes in the physical environment (b = 0.066, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among those who were not hesitant to take the vaccine and accounted for 54.8% of the variance. Among those who were hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine, the MTM construct of behavioral confidence (b = 0.022, p &lt; 0.001) was significant along with Republican Party political affiliation (b = -0.464, p = 0.004), which was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. The model accounted for 60.6% of the variance in intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

Uganda hosts over 1.43 million refugees, and more than 83,000 live in Kampala, largely in informal settlements. There is limited information about HIV testing uptake and preferences among urban refugee and displaced youth. HIV self-testing is a promising method for increasing testing uptake. Further, mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been effective in increasing HIV testing uptake and could be particularly useful among youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of two HIV self-testing implementation strategies (HIV self-testing intervention alone and HIV self-testing combined with an mHealth intervention) in comparison with the HIV testing standard of care in terms of HIV testing outcomes among refugee/displaced youth aged 16 to 24 years in Kampala, Uganda. METHODS: A three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be implemented across five informal settlements grouped into three sites, based on proximity, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1:1 method. Approximately 450 adolescents (150 per cluster) will be enrolled and followed for 12 months. Data will be collected at the following three time points: baseline enrollment, 8 months after enrollment, and 12 months after enrollment. Primary outcomes (HIV testing frequency, HIV status knowledge, linkage to confirmatory testing, and linkage to HIV care) and secondary outcomes (depression, condom use efficacy, consistent condom use, sexual relationship power, HIV stigma, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health stigma) will be evaluated. RESULTS: The study has been conducted in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The study has received ethical approval from the University of Toronto (June 14, 2019), Mildmay Uganda (November 11, 2019), and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (August 3, 2020). The Tushirikiane trial launched in February 2020, recruiting a total of 452 participants. Data collection was paused for 8 months due to COVID-19. Data collection for wave 2 resumed in November 2020, and as of December 10, 2020, a total of 295 participants have been followed-up. The third, and final, wave of data collection will be conducted between February and March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the knowledge of differentiated HIV testing implementation strategies for urban refugee and displaced youth living in informal settlements.

METHODS: CT volumes from 2,398 US radiology practices participating in the ACR Dose Index Registry from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020, were analyzed. Data were compared to projected CT volumes using 2019 normative data and analyzed with respect to time since government orders, population-normalized positive COVID-19 tests, and attributed deaths. Data were stratified by state population density, unemployment status, and race. RESULTS: There were 16,198,830 CT examinations (2,398 practices). Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs per day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 fewer CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378 of 1,142,247; quartile 1] versus 21% [1,894,152 of 9,140,689; quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331 of 2,071,251; quartile 1] versus 23% [1,753,521 of 7,496,443; quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856 of 71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 substantially reduced US CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment. Partial volume recovery occurred despite rising positive COVID-19 tests.","Davenport, Matthew S; Fruscello, Tom; Chatfield, Mythreyi; Weinstein, Stefanie; Sensakovic, William F; Larson, David B",J.

We explored the use of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) program to care for such outpatients. METHODS: Consecutive patients who were tested for COVID-19 because of symptom onset but were clinically stable were offered enrollment into a pilot RPM program. Patients were provided equipment for vital sign measurements and a computer tablet to enter results three times per day. The results were monitored centrally by clinical staff. The goal was to closely monitor patients and escalate care as warranted. RESULTS: Between March and June of 2020, 29 patients were approached and 26 were enrolled. The mean age was 57 years old (range, 30-88), 14 were women, and patients remained in the program for an average of 16 days (range, 2-63). Twenty-four patients (83%) were on active anticancer therapy. During that time period, only one patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening respiratory symptoms. The percentage of days during which at least one set of data and all three sets of data were entered was 97.2% and 65.7%, respectively. There was no association between the demographic factors of age, sex, or the reason for being monitored with the level of engagement (P > .05).

Methods: We constructed stable AML cell lines with downregulated expression of circRNF13, and then, we explored the effect of downregulation of circRNF13 expression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion through qRT-PCR, MTT curve, colony formation, transwell migration and invasion experiment, cell cycle, apoptosis, Caspase 3/7 assay, and other experiments. We also studied the expression of C-myc and Tenascin-C by qRT-PCR to explore the role of circRNF13. Results: When the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the proliferation rate of AML cells decreased significantly, the cell cycle was blocked to G1 phase, and apoptosis rate increased significantly. C-myc related to cell proliferation decreased significantly at RNA level. Furthermore, when the expression of circRNF13 was downregulated, the migration and invasion ability of AML cells was significantly reduced, and the expression of Tenascin-C related to migration and invasion also decreased significantly. The luciferase reporter assay system confirmed that miRNA-1224-5p was the direct target of circRNF13. Conclusion: CircRNF13 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of AML cells by regulating the expression of miRNA-1224-5p.

In almost 500 samples from 75 hospitalized and community cases, we detected infectious virus with quantitative burdens varying from 5.0 plaque-forming units/mL (PFU/mL) up to 1.0x106 PFU/mL in clinical specimens and up to 1.3x106 PFU/mL on fomites including facial tissues, nasal prongs, call bells/cell phones, dentures, and sputum deposits with confirmation by plaque morphology, PCR, immunohistochemistry, and sequencing. Expectorated sputum samples had the highest percentage of positive samples and virus titers (71%, 2.9x102 to 5.2x105 PFU/mL), followed by saliva (58%, 10 to 4.6x104 PFU/mL), and cough samples without sputum (19%, 5 to 1.9x103 PFU/mL). We also detected infectious SARS-CoV-2 from patients hands (28%, 60 to 2.3x102 PFU/mL) but no infectious virus was found in continuous speech samples despite finding high levels of infectious virus in the associated nasopharynx, throat, or saliva specimens. We demonstrated infectious virus stability in clinical samples, including those dried for prolonged periods of time. Infectious virus correlated with time since symptom onset with no detection after 7-8 days in immunocompetent hosts and with N-gene based Ct values [≤] 25 significantly predictive of yielding plaques in culture. One PFU was associated with [~]105 copies of N gene RNA across a diversity of samples and times from symptom onset. Clinical salivary isolates caused illness in a hamster model with a minimum infectious dose of [≤]14 PFU/mL. Our findings of high quantitative burdens of infectious virus, stability even with drying, and a very low minimal infectious dose suggest multiple modes of transmission are exploited by SARS-CoV-2, including direct contact, large respiratory droplet, and fomite transmission and in the context of a high binding avidity to human cellular receptors, offer an explanation of the high contagiousness of this virus. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched the literature for articles that reported on the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in patients samples from clinical and environmental sources. We found several key primary studies and systematic reviews providing valuable background on the carriage of infectious virus and the correlation with cycle threshold (Ct) and/or RNA copies/mL on PCR testing. Clinical correlations with respect to underlying clinical conditions and details on the onset of illness were not commonly reported with respect to the timing of obtaining specimens for culture. Few studies carefully assessed the presence of infectious virus in cough samples, sputum, nasal secretions, hands, and common high touch surfaces. A few published works were found on factors which may be associated with shedding of infectious virus. Added value of this studyWe assessed the presence of infectious virus shedding in almost 500 specimens from 75 patients with COVID-19 in both the hospital and community setting. High titers of infectious virus were detected in multiple clinical and environmental samples. The longest duration of recovery of infectious virus in a fomite sample was from a dried facial tissue found at a patients bedside table, used at least 9 hours earlier. Cough specimens revealed infectious virus in 28% of specimens with infectious virus titers as high as 5.2x105 PFU/mL. Hand samples contained infectious virus with titers ranging from 55 to 2.3x102 PFU/mL. Infectious viral loads correlated with N-gene based Ct values and showed that Ct values [≤] 25 were predictive of yielding plaques in culture. These experiments also showed that infectious virus is most often recovered during a 7 to 8-day period following illness onset in immunocompetent persons, and during that time the ratio of RNA/PFU in these clinical specimens varies relatively little, with a ratio [~]160,000:1. Infectious virus may be recovered for weeks to several months in immunosuppressed persons. We also showed that virus recovered from saliva specimens, representing a commonly encountered fomite sample, caused infection in the Syrian hamster model, hence demonstrating the infectiousness of the virus sourced from this type of specimen. A challenge dose as low as 14 PFU/mL yielded infection in this model. Implications of all the available evidenceWe have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is relatively easy to culture when obtained early in the course of illness and there are high levels of cultivatable SARS-CoV-2 in multiple types of clinical specimens and common fomites, including high-touch surfaces and demonstrated their infectiousness in a mammalian host. Our results demonstrate the presence of high quantitative burdens of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, saliva, and droplets from coughing, which would lend support to large respiratory droplet transmission, hands which would support direct contact transmission, and fomites which would promote indirect contact transmission. We were unable to detect any infectious virus in continuous speech samples which suggests that brief conversations, without coughing or sneezing, pose little risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an explanation for the high contagiousness of this virus and support current public health measures and infection prevention and control guidelines including physical distancing, hand hygiene, masking, and cleaning and disinfection.","Lin, Yi-Chan; Malott, Rebecca J.; Ward, Linda; Kiplagat, Linet; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Gill, Kara; Berenger, Byron M.; Hu, Jia; Fonseca, Kevin; Noyce, Ryan; Louie, Thomas; Evans, David H.; Conly, John M.",,51,16

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the ventricular repolarization indexes which are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and concomitant azithromycin for COVID-19. METHOD: A total of 81 patients who had hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy because of possible or reverse-transcription polymertase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. Baseline and control electrocardiograms (before and after treatment) were analyzed retrospectively.

RESULTS: While there was no significant increase in QTc interval in patients receiving combination therapy, there was a significant increase in ventricular repolarization indexes. CONCLUSION: The increase in ventricular replarization indexes is associated with the risk of arrhythmia. In patients using QTc prolonging medication for COVID-19 treatment, QTc monitoring alone may not be sufficient to follow-up for arrhythmia. Even if there is no prolongation in QTc, an increase in ventricular repolarization indexes may be seen (Tab. 5, Ref. 37).","Gunay, S; Caliskan, S; Sigirli, D; Sahin, E",Bratisl Lek Listy,51,16

Numerous initiatives aim to gauge the indirect impact of COVID-19 on RMNH. MethodsWe assessed the impact of COVID-19 on RMNH coverage in the early stages of the pandemic using panel survey data from PMA-Ethiopia. Enrolled pregnant women were surveyed 6-weeks post-birth. We compared the odds of service receipt, coverage of RMNCH service indicators, and health outcomes within the cohort of women who gave birth prior to the pandemic and the COVID-19 affected cohort. We calculated impacts nationally and by urbanicity. ResultsThis dataset shows little disruption of RMNH services in Ethiopia in the initial months of the pandemic. There were no significant reductions in women seeking health services or the content of services they received for either preventative or curative interventions. In rural areas, a greater proportion of women in the COVID-19 affected cohort sought care for peripartum complications, ANC, PNC, and care for sick newborns. Significant reductions in coverage of BCG vaccination and chlorohexidine use in urban areas were observed in the COVID-19 affected cohort. An increased proportion of women in Addis Ababa reported postpartum family planning in the COVID-19 affected cohort. Despite the lack of evidence of reduced health services, the data suggest increased stillbirths in the COVID-19 affected cohort. DiscussionThe government of Ethiopias response to control the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure continuity of essential health services appears to have successfully averted most negative impacts on maternal and neonatal care. This analysis cannot address the later effects of the pandemic and may not capture more acute or geographically isolated reductions in coverage.

However, the trajectory of the current outbreak of COVID-19 depicts a similar picture of the Spanish Flu outbreak. Estimates suggest that ~500 million infected cases and ~50 million deaths occurred globally from 1918-1919 due to the H1N1 virus. While SARS-CoV2 accounted for ~2 million cases and 130,885 deaths just within three and a half months, and the number is still increasing.

This was a retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old between March 2020 and May 2020. Patients were diagnosed to have COVID-19 based either on chest computed tomography findings or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. Age, gender, chronic medical conditions, and laboratory values including hemogram parameters (white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and the international normalized ratio were recorded. Overall, we included 302 patients. Of these, 148 patients were male; the male to female ratio was 0.961. The mean age of the entire study cohort was 57.1 ± 17.6 years. The most common chronic medical condition was hypertension (38.1%). Half of the patients received low molecular weight heparin. During the study period, 25 patients (8.2%) died. White blood cell count and neutrophil count were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the deceased patients. The median neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 11.6 in the deceased patients, it was significantly higher than the surviving patients (p < 0.001). The values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin were significantly higher among the deceased patients. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and the international normalized ratio were significantly longer in the deceased group compared with the surviving group. Logistic regression analysis showed age > 65 years, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and hypertension as the independent predictors of mortality. The rate of abnormal inflammatory and hematologic-coagulation parameters increased with the COVID-19 severity.

As such, detailed characterization of antibody-antigen binding provides important information to guide development. Due to the time and expense required, high-resolution structural characterization techniques are typically used sparingly and late in a development process. Here, we show that antibody-antigen binding can be characterized early in a process for whole panels of antibodies by combining experimental and computational analyses of competition between monoclonal antibodies for binding to an antigen. Experimental ""epitope binning"" of monoclonal antibodies uses high-throughput surface plasmon resonance to reveal which antibodies compete, while a new complementary computational analysis that we call ""dock binning"" evaluates antibody-antigen docking models to identify why and where they might compete, in terms of possible binding sites on the antigen. Experimental and computational characterization of the identified antigenic hotspots then enables the refinement of the competitors and their associated epitope binding regions on the antigen. While not performed at atomic resolution, this approach allows for the group-level identification of functionally related monoclonal antibodies (i.e., communities) and identification of their general binding regions on the antigen. By leveraging extensive epitope characterization data that can be readily generated both experimentally and computationally, researchers can gain broad insights into the basis for antibody-antigen recognition in wide-ranging vaccine and immunotherapy discovery and development programs.","Brooks, Benjamin D; Closmore, Adam; Yang, Juechen; Holland, Michael; Cairns, Tina; Cohen, Gary H; Bailey-Kellogg, Chris",Molecules (Basel),51,26

METHODS: 67 health workers with biological risk in their tasks, who have been filed as non-responders to conventional vaccination against Hepatitis B, were enrolled in the Clinical Trial. All participants were from 18 years up to 64 years old. INCLUSION CRITERIA: NHS workers -including university students doing their internships in health centres dependent on the National Health System (inclusion of students is regulated and limited by specific instructions on labour prevention in each autonomous community)- classified as non-responders. The criteria defining them as non-responders to the conventional hepatitis B vaccine is anti HBsAb titers < 10 mUI/ml following the application of six doses of conventional vaccine at 20 µg doses (two complete guidelines). The objective of this study was to provide Health workers-staff with an additional protection tool against hepatitis B infection, and to evaluate the efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine in healthy non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccine. The primary outcome was the measurement of antibody antiHBs before the first Fendrix® dose and a month after the administration of each dose. Other outcome was collection of adverse effects during administration and all those that could be related to the vaccine and that occur within 30 days after each dose. In this study, only one group was assigned. There was no randomization or masking. RESULTS: The participants were recruited between April 13, 2018 and October 31, 2019. 67 participants were enrolled in the Clinical Trial and included the analyses. The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix®, administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose. Once the positivity was reached in any of the doses, the participant finished the study and was not given the following doses. 68.66% (46 out 67) had a positive response to first dose of Fendrix®. 57.14% (12 out 21) had a positive response to second dose of Fendrix®. 22.22% (2 out 9) had a positive response to third dose of Fendrix and 42.96% (3 out 7) had a positive response to last dose of Fendrix®. Overall, 94.02% (64 out 67) of participants had a positive response to Fendrix®. No serious adverse event occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Fendrix®, is a viable vaccine alternative for NHS workers classified as ""non-responders"". Revaccination of healthy non-responders with Fendrix®, resulted in very high proportions of responders without adverse events.

Furthermore, there are widespread shortages of necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) for these individuals. Filtering facepiece respirators, such as the N95 respirator, intended for single use, can be reused in times of need. We explore the evidence for decontamination or sterilization of N95 respirators for health care systems seeking to conserve PPE while maintaining the health of their workforce. Observations: The filtration properties and fit of N95 respirators must be preserved to function adequately over multiple uses. Studies have shown that chemical sterilization using soap and water, alcohols, and bleach render the respirator nonfunctional. Decontamination with microwave heat and high dry heat also result in degradation of respirator material. UV light, steam, low-dry heat, and commercial sterilization methods with ethylene oxide or vaporized hydrogen peroxide appear to be viable options for successful decontamination. Furthermore, since the surface viability of the novel coronavirus is presumed to be 72 hours, rotating N95 respirator use and allowing time decontamination of the respirators is also a reasonable option. We describe a protocol and best practice recommendations for redoffing decontaminated N95 and rotating N95 respirator use. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 presents a high risk for health care professionals, particularly otolaryngologists, owing to the nature of viral transmission, including possible airborne transmission and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Proper PPE is effective when used correctly, but in times of scarce resources, institutions may turn to alternative methods of preserving and reusing filtering facepiece respirators. Based on studies conducted on the decontamination of N95 respirators after prior outbreaks, there are several options for institutions to consider for both immediate and large-scale implementation.","Su-Velez, Brooke M; Maxim, Tom; Long, Jennifer L; St John, Maie A; Holliday, Michael A",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

METHODS: We describe a cohort of critically ill patients during the first two months of the pandemic (from March 3, 2020, to May 2, 2020) in HUVH, Barcelona. In this manuscript, we report our previsions, strategies implemented, and the outcomes obtained. RESULTS: Three-thousand and thirty-three patients were admitted to the HUVH Critical Care Units. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients on IMV or IMV and ECMO remained above 78%. Most patients were men (65%); the most common age group was 60-70 years. Twenty-three patients received ECMO, and eighteen were cannulated at another center and transferred to HUVH. At the end of the study, fourteen patients were successfully decannulated, three patients died, and the rest of the patients were still on ECMO. Eight pregnant women have been treated in the ICU, with a survival rate of 100%. The ICU mortality of patients younger than 60 years was 3.2%. The mean ICU stay of both survivors and nonsurvivors was 14 days.

Although effective treatments exist, OCD often remains underdetected and undertreated. METHODS: The authors performed a scoping review of the literature (of articles in PubMed and PsycINFO published from January 1, 2000, to February 1, 2020) to define gaps in OCD diagnosis and treatment among U.S. adults. Interventions at the patient, clinician, and health care system levels used to address these gaps are described, and promising approaches from around the world are highlighted. RESULTS: Of 102 potential studies identified in the search, 27 (including five non-U.S. studies) were included. The studies revealed that lack of clinician and patient knowledge about OCD and misdiagnosis contributes to its underdetection. Suboptimal prescribing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and limited use of exposure and response prevention, as a first-line psychotherapy, contribute to OCD undertreatment. Digital health technologies show promise in increasing OCD detection and delivery of evidence-based care and in ensuring continuity of care (including during the COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant rates of disability, morbidity, and mortality associated with OCD, addressing gaps in OCD care will reduce the U.S. burden of mental illness. Further research is needed to determine how the use of digital health technologies can increase the detection and management of OCD.","Senter, Meredith S; Patel, Sapana R; Dixon, Lisa B; Myers, Robert W; Simpson, H Blair",Psychiatr Serv,51,21

METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase for cohort studies and meta-analysis reporting mortality by pre-existing ARB/ACE inhibitor treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease between users and non-users of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study-level during data synthesis. RESULTS: In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (OR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.96)). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no confounder adjustment performed (0.87 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.08)). CONCLUSIONS: ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Under the Xi Jinping administration, the enhancement of ""international discourse power"" became an explicit policy and a diplomatic goal, closely linked to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). BRI, further, overlaps with China's efforts to develop a new concept of ""institutional discourse power"" as a mechanism to convert the economic gravity of China into political power by enhancing their agenda-setting capability, particularly in emerging rule-making process of the new economy. Such ambition has also shaped the new economic integrative framework between China and developed countries including Japan. Japan, on the other hand, relied on an increasingly inclusive notion of free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) to define and promote its relations with both ""likeminded countries"" and China for the purpose of making the BRI relative. Although Japan and China have agreed on economic cooperation in third countries as a new collaborative scheme in 2018, there remains a gap in their political objectives and strategic communications.

369758,369758,369758,Graphene biosensors for bacterial and viral pathogens,11.849722,7.529999,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the number of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the United States has exponentially increased. Identifying and monitoring individuals with COVID-19 and individuals who have been exposed to the disease is critical to prevent transmission. Traditional contact tracing mechanisms are not structured on the scale needed to address this pandemic. As businesses reopen, institutions and agencies not traditionally engaged in disease prevention are being tasked with ensuring public safety. Systems to support organizations facing these new challenges are critically needed. Most currently available symptom trackers use a direct-to-consumer approach and use personal identifiers, which raises privacy concerns. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a monitoring and reporting system for COVID-19 to support institutions conducting monitoring activities without compromising privacy. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary team designed a symptom tracking system after consultation with experts. The system was designed in the Georgetown University AvesTerra knowledge management environment, which supports data integration and synthesis to identify actionable events and maintain privacy. We conducted a beta test for functionality among consenting Georgetown University medical students. RESULTS: The symptom tracker system was designed based on guiding principles developed during peer consultations. Institutions are provided access to the system through an efficient onboarding process that uses clickwrap technology to document agreement to limited terms of use to rapidly enable free access. Institutions provide their constituents with a unique identifier to enter data through a web-based user interface to collect vetted symptoms as well as clinical and epidemiologic data. The website also provides individuals with educational information through links to the COVID-19 prevention recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Safety features include instructions for people with new or worsening symptoms to seek care. No personal identifiers are collected in the system. The reporter mechanism safeguards data access so that institutions can only access their own data, and it provides institutions with on-demand access to the data entered by their constituents, organized in summary reports that highlight actionable data. Development of the system began on March 15, 2020, and it was launched on March 20, 2020. In the beta test, 48 Georgetown University School of Medicine students or their social contacts entered data into the system from March 31 to April 5, 2020. One of the 48 users (2%) reported active COVID-19 infection and had no symptoms by the end of the monitoring period. No other participants reported symptoms. Only data with the unique entity identifier for our beta test were generated in our summary reports. CONCLUSIONS: This system harnesses insights into privacy and data sharing to avoid regulatory and legal hurdles to rapid adaption by entities tasked with maintaining public safety. Our pilot study demonstrated feasibility and ease of use. Refinements based on feedback from early adapters included release of a Spanish language version. These systems provide technological advances to complement the traditional contact tracing and digital tracing applications being implemented to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission during reopening.","Kassaye, Seble G; Spence, Amanda Blair; Lau, Edwin; Bridgeland, David M; Cederholm, John; Dimolitsas, Spiros; Smart, J C",JMIR Public Health Surveill,51,26

This is an important research question to inform the response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The transmission modes of human coronaviruses are similar, thought to be by droplet, contact, and sometimes airborne routes. There are several randomized clinical trials of masks and respirators, but most used clinical endpoints or tested only for influenza. In four trials that we conducted, we tested for human coronaviruses, but only composite viral endpoints were reported in the trials. We reviewed and analyzed the coronavirus data from four of our trials. Laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infections were identified in our community household trial (one case), health worker trials (eight cases), and trial of mask use by sick patients (19 cases). No coronavirus infections were transmitted in households to parents who wore P2 or surgical masks, but one child with coronavirus infection transmitted infection to a parent in the control arm. No transmissions to close contacts occurred when worn by sick patients with coronavirus infections. There was a higher risk of coronavirus infection in HCWs who wore a mask compared to a respirator, but the difference was not statistically significant. These are the only available clinical trial data on coronavirus infections associated with mask or respirator use. More clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of respiratory protection against coronavirus infections.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Chughtai, Abrar A; Seale, Holly; Dwyer, Dominic E; Quanyi, Wang",Int J Infect Dis,51,16

STUDY DESIGN: We systematically searched the guideline databases, Medline, Embase, and nationale/international neonatal societies websites as of June 19, 2020, for guidelines on neonatal management and feeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time assessing the methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. RESULTS: Eleven guidelines were included. The Chinese and American recommendations suggest separation of the mother and her neonate, whereas in French, Italian, UK, Canadian, and World Health Organization consensus documents the rooming-in is suggested, with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggesting to decide on a case-by-case basis. All the guidelines recommend breastfeeding or feeding with expressed maternal milk; the only exception is the Chinese recommendations, these last suggesting to avoid breastfeeding.

It is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Since December of 2019, a global expansion of the infection has occurred with widespread dissemination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 often manifests as only mild cold-like symptomatology, but severe disease with complications occurs in 15% of cases. Respiratory failure occurs in severe disease that can be accompanied by a systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by inflammatory cytokine release. In severe cases, fatality is caused by the rapid development of severe lung injury characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although ARDS is a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not viral replication or infection that causes tissue injury; rather, it is the result of dysregulated hyperinflammation in response to viral infection. This pathology is characterized by intense, rapid stimulation of the innate immune response that triggers activation of the Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway and release of its products including the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1ß. Here we review the literature that describes the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and NLRP3 activation and describe an important role in targeting this pathway for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","Freeman, Tracey L; Swartz, Talia H",Front Immunol,51,14

Surgical treatment of the primary tumor is crucial since it provides the only curative approach in most cases, but management of patients is highly complex, especially in the presence of new antiplatelet drugs and/or anticoagulants. Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) represent a frequent complication of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and include different hematological symptoms in patients, whilst occlusion of arterial blood vessels displays a rare form of PNS accompanying renal tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 62-year old man who was initially hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome. He subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty treatment including multiple stenting and treatment with ticagrelor and aspirin. Post-interventional, acute arterial thrombotic emboli of several limb arteries required thrombectomy. By computer tomography we identified a renal lesion suspicious for an RCC and suspected a PNS as underlying cause of the thrombotic complications. Triple anticoagulant therapy was maintained with therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), aspirin, and clopidogrel, by which we replaced ticagrelor. Surgery was postponed for 4 weeks. We paused LMWH, aspirin and clopidogrel only at the day of surgery and perioperatively restored hemostasis by transfusion of two platelet concentrates. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was uneventful. Pathology confirmed a clear cell RCC. The patient fully recovered whilst slowly reducing anticoagulation dose. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary team approach of experts in urology, cardiology and hemostasis was key in managing this patient since a personalized thrombosis consult was needed to minimize the risk of reinfarction due to in-stent thrombosis. We report a therapeutic protocol that may be helpful for the management of similar cases. Furthermore, the finding of thrombotic arterial occlusions in larger blood vessels represents a novel complication of PNS in RCC and adds to the varied possible manifestations of this clinical chameleon.","Martin, Benedikt; Greinacher, Andreas; Bülow, Robin; Hammer, Fabian; Hoene, Andreas; Burchardt, Martin; Zimmermann, Uwe",BMC Urol,51,16

However, this success was not without cost, both economic and social. In our study, we examined the psychological wellbeing of New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown when restrictions reduced social contact, limited recreation opportunities, and resulted in job losses and financial insecurity. We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders in April 2020. The survey contained three standardised measures-the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the GAD-7, and the Well-Being Index (WHO-5)-as well as questions designed specifically to measure family violence, suicidal ideation, and alcohol consumption. It also included items assessing positive aspects of the lockdown. Thirty percent of respondents reported moderate to severe psychological distress (K10), 16% moderate to high levels of anxiety, and 39% low wellbeing; well above baseline measures. Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18-34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting 'silver linings', which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealand's lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing.","Every-Palmer, Susanna; Jenkins, Matthew; Gendall, Philip; Hoek, Janet; Beaglehole, Ben; Bell, Caroline; Williman, Jonathan; Rapsey, Charlene; Stanley, James",PLoS One,51,16

OBJECTIVE: To review the available information on mode of delivery, vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH STRATEGY: Combination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Papers reporting cases of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The following was extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes. MAIN RESULTS: In the 13 studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported. In three neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was negative.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the knowledge of intensive care physicians in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes towards the strategies and application methods to be used for COVID-19 cases that need to be followed up in an intensive care unit, and to raise awareness about this issue. DESIGN AND SETTING: The population for this descriptive study comprised clinicians working in a variety of healthcare organizations in Turkey who provide monitoring and treatment within the intensive care process for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data were collected online using a survey form on the SurveyMonkey website between April 20 and April 25, 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of the 248 intensive care clinicians participating in the study was 37.2 ± 13.7 years and 49.19% were female. High rates of classical laryngoscope use were observed, especially among clinicians employed in state hospitals. Among all the participants, 54.8% stated that they were undecided about corticosteroid treatment for patients who had been intubated due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Many medications and methods are used for COVID-19 treatment. All national science committees are attempting to create standard treatment protocols. For intensive care treatment of COVID-19 patients, many factors require management, and clinicians' experience is guiding future processes. We believe that this study will create awareness about this topic and contribute to the creation of standard treatment algorithms and the provision of better and safer healthcare services for this patient group.","Erbas, Mesut; Dost, Burhan",Säo Paulo med. j,51,20

The transition to only emergent and essential urgent surgical cases raises the question, how and when will hospitals and surgery centers resume elective cases? As a large health care system providing multispecialty tertiary/quaternary care with across the Southeast United States, a collaborative approach to resuming elective surgery is critical. Numerous surgical societies have outlined a tiered approach to resuming elective surgery. The majority of these guidelines are suggestions which place the responsibility of making decisions about re-entry strategy on individual health care systems and practitioners, taking into account the local case burden, projected case surge, and availability of resources and personnel. This paper reviews challenges and solutions related to the resumption of elective surgeries and returning to the pre-COVID-19 surgical volume within an integrated health care system that actively manages 18 facilities, 111 operating rooms, and an annual operative volume exceeding 123,000 cases. We define the impact of COVID-19 across our surgical departments and outline the staged re-entry approach that is being taken to resume surgery within the health care system.","Wohler, Andrew D; Kneisl, Jeffrey S; Macknet, David M; Hysong, Alexander A; Kaney, Kathleen; Moroney, Scott; Hsu, Joseph R",Med. care,51,6

The characteristics with which the death process took place, during the period following the Coronavirus infection, are configured as important risk factors due to the inability to give the last farewell to the deceased during the period of the lockdown, to see and accompany their loved ones in the last moments of their life. The absence of the deceased body to cry for, the lack of a funeral and any other type of social and personal ritual, are to be considered as obstacles and aggravation factors with respect to the usual elaborative dynamics of mourning. The functional role of some brain areas such as the amygdala in mediating both the responses to stress and the learning of emotions implicitly identifies its importance in the pathophysiology of major trauma such as in pathological bereavement and in PTSD. Behavioral and environmental psychology studies have highlighted the therapeutic value of open contexts, in particular green areas, such as in forest bathing, in the processing of traumas, in which the narration can take place in a way that is independent from traditional therapy, with encouraging results, as demonstrated from the clinical case of Sofia.","Spurio, M.

This study aimed to determine the number of patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care and to compare the numbers with Japan's intensive care capacity. Materials and Methods: Publicly available datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between 15 February and 19 July 2020 to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan. Results: During the epidemic peak in late April, 11,443 patients (1.03/10,000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034/10,000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028/10,000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056/10,000 adults) were under ECMO per day. At the peak of the epidemic, the number of infected patients was 651% of designated beds, and the number of patients requiring intensive care was 6.0% of ICU beds, 19.1% of board-certified intensivists, and 106% of designated medical institutions in Japan. Conclusions: The number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 continued to rise during the pandemic, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity.","Fujii, Yosuke; Hirota, Kiichi",Medicina (Kaunas),51,23

Is it time now for new approaches?],11.541121,7.555927,2020,"Purpose: Covid-19 (coronavirus) has significantly affected education communities particularly in terms of the massive shift towards online learning. This has meant a quick transformation of the curriculum and learning styles to a digital platform. Despite the dramatic change, there is a lack of understanding about what this means particularly for the community of entrepreneurship educators in the higher education sector that rely on practical and immersive training for learning requirements. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review that discusses how communities of entrepreneurship education practitioners can deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the current literature on Covid-19 and entrepreneurship education is conducted that highlights the need to incorporate a community approach. This enables a better understanding about how communities of educational stakeholders including teachers, students and institutions can facilitate a more proactive and positive attitude. Findings: The paper finds that managing the Covid-19 crisis is difficult for entrepreneurship educations due to the need for practical and real life examples. This means the use of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is needed to simulate the real environment. This will enable a more community orientated approach to the study and practice of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: This paper is among the first to suggest how this change has taken place and what it means for educational management, thereby providing a unique and timely commentary about how coronavirus has altered in positive and negative ways entrepreneurship education.","Ratten, Vanessa",J.

Research is needed to better understand the early COVID-19 anti-vaccine activities on social media. METHODS: This study chronicles the social media posts concerning COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines by leading anti-vaccine groups (Dr Tenpenny on Vaccines, the National Vaccine Information Center [NVIC] the Vaccination Information Network [VINE]) and Vaccine Machine in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (February-May 2020). RESULTS: Analysis of 2060 Facebook posts showed that anti-vaccine groups were discussing COVID-19 in the first week of February 2020 and were specifically discussing COVID-19 vaccines by mid-February 2020. COVID-19 posts by NVIC were more widely disseminated and showed greater influence than non-COVID-19 posts. Early COVID-19 posts concerned mistrust of vaccine safety and conspiracy theories. CONCLUSION: Major anti-vaccine groups were sowing seeds of doubt on Facebook weeks before the US government launched its vaccine development program 'Operation Warp Speed'. Early anti-vaccine misinformation campaigns outpaced public health messaging and hampered the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kalichman, Seth C; Eaton, Lisa A; Earnshaw, Valerie A; Brousseau, Natalie",J. public health (Oxf),51,1

There is a natural succession between the two courses. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly swept the world. During this unusual period, to ensure that medical students would understand and master basic medical knowledge and to lay a solid foundation for future medical bridge courses and professional courses, a web-based medical morphology teaching team, mainly including teachers of courses in Histology and Embryology and Pathology, was established. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore a new teaching mode of Histology and Embryology and Pathology courses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate its feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: From March to July 2020, our team selected clinical medicine undergraduate students who started their studies in 2018 and 2019 as recipients of web-based teaching. Meanwhile, nursing undergraduate students who started their studies in 2019 and 2020 were selected for traditional offline teaching as the control group. For the web-based teaching, our team used the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to realize a new ""seven-in-one"" teaching method (ie, videos, materials, chapter tests, interactions, homework, live broadcasts, and case analysis/discussion). This new teaching mode involved diverse web-based teaching methods and contents, including flipped classroom, screen-to-screen experimental teaching, a drawing competition, and a writing activity on the theme of ""What I Know About COVID-19."" When the teaching was about to end, a questionnaire was administered to obtain feedback regarding the teaching performance. In the meantime, the final written pathology examination results of the web-based teaching and traditional offline teaching groups were compared to examine the mastery of knowledge of the students. RESULTS: Using the Xuexi Tong platform as the major platform to conduct ""seven-in-one"" teaching is feasible and acceptable. With regard to the teaching performance of this new web-based teaching mode, students demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, and the questionnaire showed that 71.3% or more of the students in different groups reported a greater degree of satisfaction or being very satisfied. In fact, more students achieved high scores (90-100) in the web-based learning group than in the offline learning control group (P=.02). Especially, the number of students with objective scores >60 in the web-based learning group was greater than that in the offline learning control group (P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the web-based teaching mode was not inferior to the traditional offline teaching mode for medical morphology courses, proving the feasibility and acceptability of web-based teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings lay a solid theoretical foundation for follow-up studies of medical students.","Liu, Qinlai; Sun, Wenping; Du, Changqing; Yang, Leiying; Yuan, Na; Cui, Haiqing; Song, Wengang; Ge, Li",JMIR Med Inform,51,15

There have been several individual and organizational strategies that can be put in place to tackle their well-being. Self-strategies that are recommended are adequate rest and sleep, consistent work breaks, help seeking behavior, emotional control and acceptance of limitations of their own competence and healthcare systems. Several online training programs are available for individual guidance. Organizations can also support their staff in different ways. It is important to recognize those who are more vulnerable physically and emotionally. Institution should implement stress reduction strategies, provide adequate PPE, should be able to communicate with their employees in a clear and honest manner and enforce infection control policies. In addition, institutions must take other physical measures where resources permit, like provision of negative pressure rooms and to provide updated and accurate information. Both personal and psychological support is needed. Several different models have been suggested for emotional support. One particularly vulnerable group that requires additional assistance are those in quarantine.

Published literature primarily offers a retrospective view of experience, with few studies examining and understanding the individual lived experience of practitioners prospectively. This study explores paramedics' lived experience of emergency preparedness and applies that learning. METHODS: Thirteen paramedics were recruited through purposive sampling. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews explored their individual experiences of emergency preparedness, in line with the idiographic focus of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS: Through data analysis, the following superordinate themes were identified for further discussion: self-determination, control, and experience-based practice. Participants appeared to value their role and the unpredictable environment in which they worked. Personal resilience, an area that they suggested is not covered effectively within individual preparation, was viewed as important. The participants articulated that risk, threat, uncertainty, safety, trust, and control were important concepts within individual preparedness. These paramedics valued practice-based knowledge and education as credible and transferrable to their clinical work. CONCLUSION: Evidence from this study suggests that standard emergency preparedness, with the focus at organizational level, is not sufficient for the individual workers or for an overall effective response. Dimensions of individual preparedness are presented, with the paramedic central to the experience within a conceptual model (the DiEP model), creating a new form of emergency preparedness that reflects the individual paramedic's experience.","Day, Alison; Staniszewska, Sophie; Bullock, Ian",J Emerg Nurs,51,16

This new virus induces COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease with high death rate. A putative target to interfere with the virus is the host transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2). This enzyme is critical for the entry of coronaviruses into human cells by cleaving and activating the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning approved, investigational and experimental drugs on the serine protease domain of TMPRSS2 could thus be valuable. There is no experimental structure for TMPRSS2 but it is possible to develop quality structural models for the serine protease domain using comparative modeling strategies as such domains are highly structurally conserved. Beside the TMPRSS2 catalytic site, we predicted on our structural models a main exosite that could be important for the binding of protein partners and/or substrates. To block the catalytic site or the exosite of TMPRSS2 we used structure-based virtual screening computations and two different collections of approved, investigational and experimental drugs. We propose a list of 156 molecules that could bind to the catalytic site and 100 compounds that may interact with the exosite. These small molecules should now be tested in vitro to gain novel insights over the roles of TMPRSS2 or as starting point for the development of second generation analogs.","Singh, Natesh; Decroly, Etienne; Khatib, Abdel-Majid; Villoutreix, Bruno O",Eur J Pharm Sci,51,6

METHODS: Patients over 18 who were evaluated for COVID-19 during the period from April 1, to April 30, 2020 were retrospectively scanned. Patients with at least 1 positive PCR test result were as assigned to Group 1 while patients with negative test results were assigned to Group 2. The LMR ratio was calculated by dividing the lymphocyte value by that of MPV. The relationship between LMR, severity of patients' CT findings and 28-day mortality was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 938 patients were included in the study. It was observed that the lymphocyte and LMR levels were significantly different in those who died within 28 days (p < 0.001, p &#8804; 0.001). In the ROC analysis for the LMR level, the area under the curve (AUC) was found to be 0.737 (95% CI 0.639â0.834). When the cut­off value of LMR was 0.045, the sensitivity was found to be 99.0 % and specificity was 15.2 %. CONCLUSION: LMR can be a guide in multiple cases of care provided to critical patients, as is the case in the COVID-19 pandemic and can be used in recognizing critical patients (Tab. 5, Fig. 1, Ref. 21).","Eraybar, S; Yuksel, M; Aygun, H; Ay, M O; Kaya, H; Bulut, M",Bratisl Lek Listy,51,20

Urease, in combination with TRGO, allowed us to create a mediator-free amperometric biosensor with the intention of precise detection of urea in clinical trials. Beyond simplicity of the technology, the biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (2.3 ± 0.1 µA cm-2 mM-1), great operational and storage stabilities (up to seven months), and appropriate reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD) about 2%). The analytical recovery of the TRGO-based biosensor in urine of 101 ÷ 104% with RSD of 1.2 ÷ 1.7% and in blood of 92.7 ÷ 96.4%, RSD of 1.0 ÷ 2.5%, confirmed that the biosensor is acceptable and reliable. These properties allowed us to apply the biosensor in the monitoring of urea levels in samples of urine, blood, and spent dialysate collected during hemodialysis. Accuracy of the biosensor was validated by good correlation (R = 0.9898 and R = 0.9982) for dialysate and blood, utilizing approved methods.

OBJECTIVES: To explore ACP knowledge, experiences, views, facilitators, and barriers among older adults of Turkish origin in Belgium. METHODS: This qualitative study was based on constant comparative analysis of semi-structured interview content. Participants were 33 older adults (aged 65-84 years; mean, 71.7 years; median, 74.5 years) of Turkish origin living in Belgium. RESULTS: Despite unfamiliarity with the term ACP in this sample, several participants had engaged in some ACP behaviors. Respondents considered ACP to be useful and were ready to engage in conversations about it. The most commonly mentioned facilitator was the provision of tailored information about ACP. Other facilitators included concerns about future care needs, increasing awareness among respondents' children about the advantages of ACP, and respondents' desire to avoid ""burdening"" their children. The most commonly mentioned barrier was respondents' lack of knowledge about ACP. Other barriers were language issues, a lack of urgency about ACP discussion, reliance on familial support, and older adults' fear of triggering negative emotions in themselves and their children. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of tailored information about ACP to older adults of Turkish origin in Belgium and the promotion of awareness about the importance of ACP among their children (when patients desire), as well as the use of professional interpreters, could facilitate ACP engagement in this population.","Demirkapu, Hakki; Van den Block, Lieve; De Maesschalck, Stéphanie; De Vleminck, Aline; Colak, F Zehra; Devroey, Dirk",J. pain symptom manage,51,1

These infection complications produce a sort of ""cytokine release syndrome"" that sees interleukin 6, a glycosylated protein of approximately 212 amino acids, among the leading players in the inflammatory process. IL-6 typically produces a transient inflammatory state that promotes the hosts immune defence through its pleiotropic function. There is the stimulation of a response in the acute infectious phase, hematopoiesis and the regular advent of immune reactions. The action of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, which tends to regulate the inflammatory ones activity, is directed to the same cells that produce IL-6, which, through an inhibition mechanism, slow down or production ceases altogether. Evidently, in the case of the IL-6 storm, the action of these anti-inflammatory cytokines is insufficient, and the blockade of IL-6R receptors and through the use of monoclonal antibody-like tocilizumab has proved to be optimal to manage complications and avoid potentially fatal situations. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to create a mathematical model that describes the action of the IL-6 cytokine in SARS-CoV2 virus infection to understand better the extent of the disease itself and the associated severe side effects. We represent the concentration of tocilizumab, soluble IL-6R, absolute neutrophils and circulating platelets using computational modelling. Tocilizumab is administered by intravenous infusions with a minimum dose of 80mg and a maximum dose of 400 mg. Following tocilizumab administration, simulation results indicate that the population of absolute neutrophils and circulating platelets is decreasing. After the removal of tocilizumab concentration, both absolute neutrophils and circulating platelets return at their baselines.","Idrees, M.; Nutini, A.; Sohail, A.","Biomedical Engineering - Applications, Basis and Communications",51,26

HRCA has differentiated between safe and unsafe swallows, predicted components of the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile, and predicted kinematic events of swallowing such as hyoid bone displacement, laryngeal vestibular closure, and upper esophageal sphincter opening with a high degree of accuracy. However, HRCA has not been used to characterize swallow function in specific patient populations. This study investigated the ability of HRCA to differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that HRCA would differentiate between swallows from healthy people and people with neurodegenerative diseases with a high degree of accuracy. We analyzed 170 swallows from 20 patients with neurodegenerative diseases and 170 swallows from 51 healthy age-matched adults who underwent concurrent video fluoroscopy with non-invasive neck sensors. We used a linear mixed model and several supervised machine learning classifiers that use HRCA signal features and a leave-one-out procedure to differentiate between swallows. Twenty-two HRCA signal features were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for predicting whether swallows were from healthy people or from patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Using the HRCA signal features alone, logistic regression and decision trees classified swallows between the two groups with 99% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 99% specificity. This provides preliminary research evidence that HRCA can differentiate swallow function between healthy and patient populations.","Donohue, Cara; Khalifa, Yassin; Perera, Subashan; Sejdic, Ervin; Coyle, James L",Dysphagia,51,33

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 cases in total by the end of March, April, May, and June following viral introduction. METHODS: We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 cases are reached or the end of June, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under four different combinations of parameter values to test the sensitivity of our results. RESULTS: We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by end of March was close to 100% under all scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 1,000 cases in total reported by end of June whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 cases by then was higher than 50% even under the most optimistic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 cases far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.","Sun, Haoyang; Dickens, Borame L; Cook, Alex R; Clapham, Hannah E",BMC Infect Dis,51,20

In a matched case-control study from 3 French Hospital COVID-19 Departments, 27 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and SOC were matched for baseline epidemiological and clinical features and compared to 27 severe COVID-19 patients treated with SOC alone. Baseline characteristics of the study population were comparable between groups. Eleven patients (20%) died. TCZ was not associated with clinical improvement as compared to SOC regarding oxygen-free status (44% vs 63%) and death (18.5% vs 22%), despite a higher decrease of the C-reactive protein at Day 7 (10.7 vs 52âmg/L; Pâ<â10-3). Compared to the 43 patients alive at the end-of follow-up, patients who died were older (78 vs 64âyears; Pâ<â10-3), with 82% of them older than 72âyears vs only 23% of live patients (Pâ<â10-3).

TCZ in addition to SOC for severe COVID-19 patients did not reduce mortality, subsequent need for invasive mechanical ventilation nor did it shorten the time of oxygen support, despite better control of the inflammatory response.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey collecting data in Hong Kong and Fujian Province of China in April 2020. METHODS: A convenience and snowball sample of 2706 students aged 18 years or older and studying a healthcare programme were recruited in tertiary education institutions/universities in Hong Kong and Putian. The participants completed the questionnaire with six scales: Social Distancing Scale; Personal Hygiene Scale; Empathic Responding Scale; Wishful Thinking Scale; Perceived Stress Scale and Perceived Threat Scale. Path analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the preventive measures outcomes. p value < .05 was considered as statistical significance. RESULTS: The participants reported high compliances to both social distancing (SoD) and personal hygiene measures (PHM). Confidence to manage the current situation, wishful thinking and empathetic responding directly predicted compliance with SoD and PHM. The final model constructed demonstrated a very good fit to the data. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that students who are male, habituate in Hong Kong, have more clinical experience and weak confidence to manage the threat tend to have lower compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures. IMPACT: The predictive model constructed is the first one to explore factors associating with the compliance with infection control measures in healthcare students amid the COVID-19 outbreak. As the infection control behaviours of healthcare students, whom are still under training and are the high-risk group of being infected and infecting others in the community, are rarely reported in literature, this study has provided empirical evidence to nurses and other healthcare professionals to identify students susceptible to poor compliance and provide early monitoring and education to suppress the COVID-19 transmission.","Tang, Anson Chui Yan; Kwong, Enid Wai-Yung; Chen, Liangying; Cheng, Winnie Lai Sheung",J. adv. nurs,51,1

We examined the effects of spirituality, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on anxiety regarding COVID-19. METHODS: Online cross-sectional data (n = 1082) covered 17 provinces. The assessment included the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, and the KAP-COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression revealed that individuals who had low levels of spirituality had increased anxiety compared to those with higher levels of spirituality. Individuals had correct knowledge of early symptoms and supportive treatment (K3), and that individuals with chronic diseases and those who were obese or elderly were more likely to be severe cases (K4). However, participants who chose incorrect concerns about there being no need for children and young adults to take measures to prevent COVID-19 (K9) had significantly lower anxiety compared to those who responded with the correct choice. Participants who disagreed about whether society would win the battle against COVID-19 (A1) and successfully control it (A2) were associated with higher anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify high-quality publishers, so-called ""channels"" that can be recommended to patients. We hypothesized that the number of views and the number of uploaded videos were indicators for the quality of the information given by a video on PD. METHODS: YouTube was searched for 8 combinations of search terms that included ""Parkinson"" in German. For each term, the first 100 search results were analyzed for source, date of upload, number of views, numbers of likes and dislikes, and comments. The view ratio (views / day) and the likes ratio (likes * 100 / [likesâ+âdislikes]) were determined to calculate the video popularity index (VPI). The global quality score (GQS) and title - content consistency index (TCCI) were assessed in a subset of videos. RESULTS: Of 800 search results, 251 videos met the inclusion criteria. The number of views or the publisher category were not indicative of higher quality video content. The number of videos uploaded by a channel was the best indicator for the quality of video content. CONCLUSION: The quality of YouTube videos relevant for PD patients is increased in channels with a high number of videos on the topic. We identified three German channels that can be recommended to PD patients who prefer video over written content.","Braczynski, Anne K; Ganse, Bergita; Ridwan, Stephanie; Schlenstedt, Christian; Schulz, Jörg B; Hoog Antink, Christoph",J Parkinsons Dis,51,21

EXPERIENCES: ACS made system, treatment, harm reduction, and discharge planning adaptations. System changes included patient visits shifting to primarily telephone-based consultations and ACS leading regional COVID-19 emergency response efforts such as substance use treatment care coordination for people experiencing homelessness in COVID-19 isolation units and regional substance use treatment initiatives. Treatment adaptations included providing longer buprenorphine bridge prescriptions at discharge with telemedicine follow-up appointments and completing benzodiazepine tapers or benzodiazepine alternatives for people with alcohol use disorder who could safely detoxify in outpatient settings. We believe that regulatory changes to buprenorphine, and in Vancouver other medications for opioid use disorder, helped increase engagement for hospitalized patients, as many of the barriers preventing them from accessing care on an ongoing basis were reduced. COVID-19 specific harm reductions recommendations were adopted and disseminated to inpatients. Discharge planning changes included peer mentors and social workers increasing hospital in-reach and discharge outreach for high-risk patients, in some cases providing prepaid cell phones for patients without phones. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE: We believe that ACS were essential to hospitals' readiness to support patients that have been systematically marginilized during the pandemic. We suggest that hospitals invest in telehealth infrastructure within the hospital, and consider cellphone donations for people without cellphones, to help maintain access to care for vulnerable patients. In addition, we recommend hospital systems evaluate the impact of such interventions. As the economic strain on the healthcare system from COVID-19 threatens the very existence of ACS, overdose deaths continue rising across North America, highlighting the essential nature of these services. We believe it is imperative that health care systems continue investing in hospital-based ACS during public health crises.","Harris, Miriam T H; Peterkin, Alyssa; Bach, Paxton; Englander, Honora; Lapidus, Emily; Rolley, Theresa; Weimer, Melissa B; Weinstein, Zoe M",Addict Sci Clin Pract,51,16

This case highlights the need to be aware of improperly fitted face masks as a cause of artifact on standard automated perimetry (SAP). CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female underwent SAP with the 24-2 SITA Fast test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer wearing an ear-loop surgical face mask. At the end of testing, it was noted that the mask had ridden up the patient's face. Small amounts of condensate were noted on the perimeter lens. CLINICAL FINDINGS: SAP demonstrated good reliability indices but in both eyes, there was a marked reduction in sensitivity inferiorly. The glaucoma hemifield test was outside normal limits. It was ensured the upper border of the mask was well sealed with the loops secured around the ears and nasal strip of the mask pinched down. Visual fields were repeated and were found to be normal. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly fitting face masks represent a new cause of visual field artifact which may mimic pathologic field defects. Without careful attention during testing, the cause of such artifacts may not be apparent, especially as reliability indices may be normal. Adjustments to the fit of face masks may help prevent fogging or mask slippage and increase test reliability.","Young, Su Ling; Smith, Margaret L; Tatham, Andrew J",J Glaucoma,51,20

Most current serological evaluation of CP relies on examination of total immunoglobulin or IgG-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. However, IgA antibodies, which also circulate and are secreted along the respiratory mucosa, represent a relatively uncharacterized component of CP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Residual samples from patients and CP donors were assessed for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain responsible for viral entry. Symptom onset was obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Increased IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels correlated with clinical improvement and viral clearance in an infant with COVID-19, prompting a broader examination of IgA levels among CP donors and hospitalized patients. Significant heterogeneity in IgA levels was observed among CP donors, which correlated weakly with IgG levels or the results of a commonly employed serological test. Unlike IgG and IgM, IgA levels were also more likely to be variable in hospitalized patients and this variability persisted in some patients >14 days following symptom onset. IgA levels were also less likely to be sustained than IgG levels following subsequent CP donation. CONCLUSIONS: IgA levels can be very heterogenous among CP donors and hospitalized patients and do not necessarily correlate with commonly employed testing platforms.

These variants may also adapt to new hosts in part through mutations in the spike protein. In this study, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Six-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage or emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. We also infected a group of mice with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Viral load and mRNA levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the lung tissues on day 3 after infection. Our data show that unlike the B.1 virus, the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses are capable of infecting C57BL/6 mice and replicating at high concentrations in the lungs. The B.1.351 virus replicated to higher titers in the lungs compared to the B.1.1.7 and MA10 viruses. The levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-, IL-1{beta}) and chemokine (CCL2) were upregulated in response to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection in the lungs. Overall, these data indicate a greater potential for infectivity and adaptation to new hosts by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Stone, Shannon; Rothan, Hussin A.; Natekar, Janhavi P; Kumari, Pratima; Sharma, Shaligram; Pathak, Heather; Arora, Komal; Aurani, Tabassum T; Kumar, Mukesh",,51,1

Prevalence of COVID-19 in Latinos with rheumatic diseases are poorly reported. The purpose of this study was to characterize COVID-19 clinical features and outcomes in Latino patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of Latino patients with rheumatic diseases from an existing observational cohort in the Washington, DC area. Patients seen between April 1 to October 15, 2020 were analyzed in this study. We reviewed demographics, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and immunomodulatory therapies. An exploratory Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis along with logistic regression (LR) analyses were performed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 and rheumatic disease flare. RESULTS: Out of 178 patients, 32 (18%) were identified with COVID-19 and the incidence rate of infection was found to be three-fold higher than the general Latino population. No patients required ICU level care. CART analysis and multivariable LR analysis identified BMI>30.35 as a risk factor for COVID-19 [P=0.004, OR=3.37, 95%CI (1.5-7.7)]. COVID-19 positivity was a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare [P=0.02, OR=4.57, 95%CI (1.2-17.4)]. CONCLUSION: Latino patients with rheumatic diseases had a higher rate of COVID-19 compared with the general Latino population. Obesity was identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 and COVID-19 itself was found to be a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare. Latino patients with risk factors should be followed closely, especially post-COVID-19 in anticipation of disease flare.","Fike, Alice; Hartman, Julia; Redmond, Christopher; Williams, Sandra G; Ruiz-Perdomo, Yanira; Chu, Jun; Hasni, Sarfaraz; Ward, Michael M; Katz, James D; Gourh, Pravitt",Arthritis rheumatol.

In an urgent response to this pandemic, I developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify compounds and drug candidates to potentially treat COVID-19. This pipeline is based on publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and the drug perturbation database “Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures” (LINCS). I developed a ranking score system that prioritizes these drugs or small molecules. The four drugs with the highest total score are didanosine, benzylquinazolin-4-yl-amine, camptothecin, and RO-90-7501.

We then reveal further imaging showing recovery of the disease process. We recommend utilising thoracic ultrasound as it provides clinical effectiveness, ensures patient, staff and equipment safety (in the much-needed personal protective equipment environment) without exposure to radiation.

The impact of this virus has continued to overwhelm hospital infrastructure and demanded remodeling of healthcare systems. With rising concerns for a third, and possibly the largest, wave of individuals infected with the virus, national leaders are continuing to seek avenues by which we can further limit disease transmission and prevent infection with the use of vaccination. To our knowledge, no clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 has included pregnant women. In December 2020, it was anticipated that the Food and Drug Administration will approve at least 1 or 2 mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine under the Emergency Use Authorization based on phase 3 clinical trial efficacy data. Both Pfizer and Moderna have manufactured mRNA-based vaccines with 95% and 94.1% efficacy against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. AstraZeneca has manufactured a vaccine using a viral vector demonstrating early efficacy as well, and this next-generation platform has previously been utilized with the Ebola vaccine and safely administered during pregnancy with an acceptable safety profile. Approval of these vaccines will have a tremendous impact on the ongoing pandemic, yet there remains a lack of data for use of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine in pregnant women.

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranges from asymptomatic, to mild self-limited illness, to progressive pneumonia, respiratory compromise, multiorgan failure, and death. In addition, a hyperinflammatory disease state occurs in a subset of patients, and may be seen either during acute infection or following recovery. The search for effective pharmacological management of COVID-19 continues, but several promising candidates have been identified, including the viral nucleoside analog remdesivir.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its context is a paramount example for such claims. In this article, we describe why expressing the certainty in evidence to support a decision is critical and why the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach matters now, perhaps more than ever and no matter what the specific topic is in relation to COVID-19. We finally also offer suggestions for how it can be used appropriately to support decision-making at global, national, and local level when emergency, urgent or rapid responses are needed. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This is an invited commentary to address the objectives above building on examples from the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This includes an iterative discussion of examples and development of guidance. RESULTS: The GRADE approach is a transparent and structured method for assessing the certainty of evidence and when developing recommendations that requires little additional time. We describe why emergency, urgent, or rapid responses do not justify omitting this critical assessment of the evidence. In situations of emergencies and urgencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, GRADE can similarly be used to express and convey certainty in intervention effects, test accuracy, risk and prognostic factors, consequences of public health measures, and qualitative bodies of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing and communicating the certainty of evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical. Those offering evidence synthesis or making recommendations should use transparent ratings of the body of evidence supporting a claim regardless of time that is available or needed to provide this response.","Schünemann, Holger J; Santesso, Nancy; Vist, Gunn E; Cuello, Carlos; Lotfi, Tamara; Flottorp, Signe; Davoli, Marina; Mustafa, Reem; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Akl, Elie A",J Clin Epidemiol,51,1

The study shows a significant mediating role of OLM between the independent variables and learning satisfaction. In addition, DL, ILI, and ISE are shown to be significant predictors of student satisfaction. The findings have a number of valuable implications for education policy makers, universities, instructors, and students. Moreover, the study suggests some new research perspectives to overcome the limitations of this research and to gain precise knowledge on students' learning motivation and satisfaction regarding other online classes for different categories of students (e.g., high school and college, professional, and PhD).","Rahman, Md H Asibur; Uddin, Mohammad Shahab; Dey, Anamika",Journal of computer assisted learning,51,32

Models for the transmission dynamics of rotavirus are critical both for estimating current burden from imperfect surveillance and for assessing potential effects of vaccine intervention strategies. We examine rotavirus infection in the Maradi area in southern Niger using hospital surveillance data provided by Epicentre collected over two years. Additionally, a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the proportion of children with diarrhea who consulted at a health structure. Model fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model; thus, where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology an ensemble approach can account for that uncertainty. We compare our results across several variants of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartmental models to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates. Model-specific parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We then use Bayesian model averaging to generate ensemble estimates of the current dynamics, including estimates of $R_0$, the burden of infection in the region, as well as the impact of vaccination on both the short-term dynamics and the long-term reduction of rotavirus incidence under varying levels of coverage. The ensemble of models predicts that the current burden of severe rotavirus disease is 2.9 to 4.1% of the population each year and that a 2-dose vaccine schedule achieving 70% coverage could reduce burden by 37-43%.","Park, Jaewoo; Goldstein, Joshua; Haran, Murali; Ferrari, Matthew",,51,31

However, elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases often suffer from abnormal immune function and take multiple medications, which may complicate the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. Currently, there is no expert consensus on whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are suitable for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. AREAS COVERED: We searched Pubmed to conduct a systematic review of published studies, case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and expert guidelines on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegenerative diseases and the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccines. We also summarized the interaction between vaccines and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The compatibility of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with neurodegenerative diseases is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Vaccines enable the body to produce immunity by activating the body's immune response. The pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is complex, and these diseases often involve abnormal immune function, which can substantially affect the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In short, this article provides recommendations for the use of vaccine candidates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.","Shi, Yan; Guo, Minna; Yang, Wenjing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhu, Bin; Yang, Ling; Yang, Chun; Liu, Cunming",Expert Rev Vaccines,51,1

Studies have shown that the widespread expression of ACE2 in human tissues may be associated with organ function damage (e.g., lung, kidney, and stomach) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in neurodegenerative diseases, whose pathogenesis is closely related to advanced age, ACE2 plays a neurotrophic and protective role by activating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, thus inhibiting cognitive impairment. Early reports have revealed that the elderly are more susceptible to COVID-19 and that elderly patients with COVID-19 have faster disease progression and higher mortality. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to understand the role of ACE2 in neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we review the relationship between COVID-19, neurodegenerative diseases, and ACE2, as well as provide recommendations for the protection of elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Zhenyu; Xu, Xiaolin; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

The secondary aim was to analyze factors associated with rDDIs. An observational single center cohort study conducted at a tertiary hospital in Spain from March 1st to April 30th. rDDIs refer to interaction with concomitant drugs prescribed during hospital stay whereas potential DDIs (pDDIs) refer to those with domiciliary medication. DDIs checked with The University of Liverpool resource. Concomitant medications were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Binomial logistic regression was carried out to identify factors associated with rDDIs. A total of 174 patients were analyzed. DDIs were detected in 152 patients (87.4%) with a total of 417 rDDIs between COVID19-related drugs and involved hospital concomitant medication (60 different drugs) while pDDIs were detected in 105 patients (72.9%) with a total of 553 pDDIs. From all 417 rDDIs, 43.2% (n = 180) were associated with lopinavir/ritonavir and 52.9% (n = 221) with hydroxychloroquine, both of them the most prescribed (106 and 165 patients, respectively). The main mechanism of interaction observed was QTc prolongation.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess citizens' knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 recommendations in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey with open and closed questions was disseminated by community-based partners prior to the relaxation of government restrictions. Outcomes included citizen knowledge (9-question measure) and worry about the virus, perception of government measures, and recommendations for improvements. Comparisons used linear regression, controlling for age, sex, education, and health literacy. Free-text answers were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Of 807 people who accessed the survey, 684 (85%) completed all questions and 479 (60%) gave free-text recommendations. Overall, 75% were female, the mean age was 48 years, and 93% had high health literacy. Knowledge scores were high, with a median score of 8 out of 9. Mean levels of worry about the COVID-19 pandemic were higher in women than men (55/100 versus 44/100, P<.001), and in respondents with lower health literacy (57/100 versus 52/100, P=.03). Self-reported adherence to recommendations was high (85%) and increased with age and worry (both P<.001). Respondents rated their own adherence higher than others (85% versus 61%, P<.001). Moreover, 34% of respondents reported having self-quarantined; this rose to 52% for those aged &#8805;75 years. Those who had self-quarantined reported higher levels of fear. Nearly half (49%) of respondents felt the government response had been adequate, though younger age and higher levels of worry were associated with considering the response to be insufficient (both P<.001). Analysis of open-text answers revealed 4 major themes: access to and use of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer; government messaging; lockdown and lockdown exit plan communication; and testing for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge, adherence, and satisfaction regarding government recommendations and response were high in this sample, but many desired greater access to personal protective equipment. Those with lower health literacy and those who have been in self-isolation reported greater concerns about the pandemic.","Selby, Kevin; Durand, Marie-Anne; Gouveia, Alexandre; Bosisio, Francesca; Barazzetti, Gaia; Hostettler, Maxime; D039,; Acremont, Valérie; Kaufmann, Alain; von Plessen, Christian",JMIR Form Res,51,20

Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the course of the pandemic with great accuracy, and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to six days ahead, and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has strong implications for global planning and decision making. We constantly update forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.","Oliveira, Thiago de Paula; Moral, Rafael de Andrade",,51,5

To do this, we develop a modification of the Sarmanov method for constructing multivariate distributions. Our multivariate COM-Poisson (MultCOMP) model has desirable features such as (i) it admits a flexible covariance matrix allowing for both negative and positive non-diagonal entries; (ii) it overcomes the limitation of the existing bivariate COM-Poisson distributions in the literature that do not have COM-Poisson marginals; (iii) it allows for the analysis of multivariate counts and is not just limited to bivariate counts. Inferential challenges are presented by the likelihood specification as it depends on a number of intractable normalizing constants involving the model parameters. These obstacles motivate us to propose a Bayesian inferential approach where the resulting doubly-intractable posterior is dealt with via the exchange algorithm and the Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Numerical experiments based on simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed Bayesian approach. We analyze the potential of the MultCOMP model through a real data application on the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams in the Premier League from 2018 to 2021. Here, our interest is to assess the effect of a lack of crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-known home team advantage. A MultCOMP model fit shows that there is evidence of a decreased number of goals scored by the home team, not accompanied by a reduced score from the opponent. Hence, our analysis suggests a smaller home team advantage in the absence of crowds, which agrees with the opinion of several football experts.","Piancastelli, Luiza S.C.; Friel, Nial; Barreto-Souza, Wagner; Ombao, Hernando",,51,6

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Dandan; Qian, Yuxing",J Med Internet Res,51,1

Hospitals and health systems faced significant burdens during this time, particularly in New York City. APPROACH: Third- and fourth-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai formed the COVID-19 Student WorkForce to connect students to essential roles in the Mount Sinai Hospital System and support physicians, staff members, researchers, and hospital operations. With the administration's support, the WorkForce grew to include over 530 medical and graduate students. A methodology was developed for clinical students to receive elective credit for these volunteer activities. OUTCOMES: From March 15, 2020 to June 14, 2020, student volunteers recorded 29,602 hours (2,277 hours per week) in 7 different task forces which operated at 7 different hospitals throughout the health system. Volunteers included students from all years of medical school as well as PhD, master's, and nursing students. The autonomous structure of the COVID-19 Student WorkForce was unique and contributed to its ability to quickly mobilize students to necessary tasks. The group leaders collaborated with other medical schools in the New York City area, sharing best practices and resources and consulting on a variety of topics. EXT STEPS: Going forward, the COVID-19 Student WorkForce will continue to collaborate with student leaders of other institutions and prevent volunteer burnout; transition select initiatives into structured, precepted student roles for clinical education; and maintain a state of readiness in the event of a second surge of COVID-19 infections in the New York City area.","Bahethi, Rohini R; Liu, Benjamin Y; Asriel, Benjamin; Blum, James R; Huxley-Reicher, Zina; Agathis, Alexandra Z; Pathak, Shravani; Sainté Willis, Michelle; Muller, David",Acad Med,51,16

Globalisation is under significant threat as governments scramble to reduce their vulnerability to the virus by limiting global trade and flows of people. With the imposition of border closures and strict migration measures, there have been major disruptions in Africa's global supply chains with adverse impacts on employment and poverty. The African economies overly reliant on single export-orientated industries, such as oil and gas, are expected to be severely hit. This situation is further aggravated by tumbling oil prices and a lowered global demand for African non-oil products. The agricultural sector, which should buffer these shocks, is also being affected by the enforcement of lockdowns which threaten people's livelihoods and food security. Lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa and the issue of public health pandemic response will need to be addressed by enacting context-specific policies which should be implemented in a humane way. In addressing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on African nations, we argue that governments should prioritize social protection programmes to provide people with resources to maintain economic productivity while limiting job losses. International funders are committing assistance to Africa for this purpose, but generally as loans (adding to debt burdens) rather than as grants. G20 agreement so suspend debt payments for a year will help, but is insufficient to fiscal need. Maintaining cross-border trade and cooperation to continue generating public revenues is desirable. New strategies for diversifying African economies and limiting their dependence on external funding by promoting trade with a more regionalised (continental) focus as promoted by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, while not without limitations, should be explored. While it is premature to judge the final economic and death toll of COVID-19, African leaders' response to the pandemic, and the support they receive from wealthier nations, will determine its eventual outcomes.","Yaya, Sanni; Otu, Akaninyene; Labonté, Ronald",Global Health,51,20

A range of clinical features can result from these deletions with the most common being facial dysmorphisms and neurological impairment. Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rarely reported feature of the syndrome with the genetic mechanism for the dysregulated insulin secretion being unknown. Methods: We studied the clinical and genetic characteristics of 12 individuals with chromosome 9p deletions who had a history of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Using off-target reads generated from targeted next-generation sequencing of the genes known to cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (n=9), or microarray analysis (n=3), we mapped the minimal shared deleted region on chromosome 9 in this cohort. Targeted sequencing was performed in three patients to search for a recessive mutation unmasked by the deletion. Results: In 10/12 patients with hypoglycaemia, hyperinsulinism was confirmed biochemically. A range of extra-pancreatic features were also reported in these patients consistent with the diagnosis of the Chromosome 9p deletion syndrome. The minimal deleted region was mapped to 7.2 Mb, encompassing 38 protein-coding genes. In silico analysis of these genes highlighted SMARCA2 and RFX3 as potential candidates for the hypoglycaemia. Targeted sequencing performed on three of the patients did not identify a second disease-causing variant within the minimal deleted region. Conclusions: This study identifies 9p deletions as an important cause of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and increases the number of cases reported with 9p deletions and hypoglycaemia to 15 making this a more common feature of the syndrome than previously appreciated. Whilst the precise genetic mechanism of the dysregulated insulin secretion could not be determined in these patients, mapping the deletion breakpoints highlighted potential candidate genes for hypoglycaemia within the deleted region.","Banerjee, Indraneel; Senniappan, Senthil; Laver, Thomas W; Caswell, Richard; Zenker, Martin; Mohnike, Klaus; Cheetham, Tim; Wakeling, Matthew N; Ismail, Dunia; Lennerz, Belinda; Splitt, Miranda; Berberoglu, Merih; Empting, Susann; Wabitsch, Martin; Pötzsch, Simone; Shah, Pratik; Siklar, Zeynep; Verge, Charles F; Weedon, Michael N; Ellard, Sian; Hussain, Khalid; Flanagan, Sarah E",Wellcome Open Res,51,20

SETTING: Nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital payment and cost data. DESIGN: Retrospective review and economic impact analysis. METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges that were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and also stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1,230,992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2,350 million USD, with a total hospital payment of 3,624-3,786 million USD. This led to an estimated net income of 1,278-1,440 million USD overall to U.S. hospitals in the NASS dataset from elective ophthalmic surgery (approximately 107-120 million USD per month), with a larger proportion performed in teaching hospitals.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with renal replacement therapy (RRT) might have a higher prevalence and CFR due to reduced immune function from uremia and kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, but there was a lack of systematic study on the infection and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in ESRD patients with various RRT. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched five electronic databases and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis up to June 30, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence and case fatality rate (CFR) of the COVID-19 infection among ESRD patients with RRT. The global COVID-19 data were retrieved from the international database on June 30, 2020, for estimating the prevalence and CFR of the general population as referencing points. Of 3,272 potential studies, 34 were eligible studies consisted of 1,944 COVID-19 confirmed cases in 21,873 ESRD patients with RRT from 12 countries in four WHO regions.

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. METHODS: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to February 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios to simulate the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: We find that in the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between December 2019 and early January 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 1–8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, infections were likely in the thousands. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Reduced transmissibility resulted in a notable decrease in the incidence of infection in the four studied cities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sustained transmission was likely occurring several weeks prior to the implementation of the cordon sanitaire in four major cities of mainland China and that the observed decrease in incidence was likely attributable to other non-pharmaceutical, transmission-reducing interventions.","Quilty, Billy J.; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Gibbs, Hamish; Russell, Timothy W.; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Prem, Kiesha; Pearson, Carl A.

In response, we established a virtual fracture clinic (VFC) review for emergency department (ED) patients with musculoskeletal injuries, meaning patients are reviewed ‘virtually’ the next workday by a multidisciplinary team, instead of routine referral for face-to-face fracture clinic review. Patients wait at home and are contacted afterwards to discuss treatment. Based on VFC review, patients with minor injuries are discharged, while for other patients an extensive treatment plan is documented using injury-specific care pathways. Additionally, we established an ED orthopedic trauma fast-track to reduce waiting time. This study aimed to evaluate the extent to which our workflow supported adherence to national coronavirus-related guidelines and effects on ED waiting time. METHODS: A closed-loop audit was performed during two 4-week periods using predefined standards: (1) all eligible ED orthopedic trauma patients are referred for VFC review; (2) reached afterwards; and follow-up is (3) patient initiated, or (4) performed remotely, whenever possible. Total ED waiting time, time to review, time for review, and time after review were assessed during both audit periods and compared with previous measurements. RESULTS: During both audits, the majority of eligible ED patients were referred for VFC review (1st: n=162 (88.0%); 2nd: n=302 (98.4%)), and reached afterwards (1st: 98.1%; 2nd: 99.0%). Of all referred patients, 17.9% and 13.6% were discharged ‘virtually’ during first and second audits, respectively, while 45.0% and 41.1% of scheduled follow-up appointments were remote. Median total ED waiting time was reduced (1st: −36 minutes (p<0.001); 2nd: −33 minutes (p<0.001)). During the second audit, median ED time to review was reduced by −13 minutes (p<0.001), as well as time for review: −10 minutes (p=0.019). DISCUSSION: In line with national guidelines, our VFC review allowed time-effective review and triage of the majority of ED orthopedic trauma patients, supporting patient-initiated and remote follow-up, whenever possible. ED waiting time was reduced after implementing the VFC review and orthopedic trauma fast-track.

Underlying this dilemma, lies the problem of the ethical models on which the political decisions of governments in matters of health are based. The article proposes and argues the need to base health policy decisions on an ethical «first person» model, based on responsibility, that allows us to move from a normative ethic to an ethic of responsible behavior.

Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 10(5) plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection. By contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals on days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.","Kumari, Pratima; Rothan, Hussin A.; Natekar, Janhavi P.; Stone, Shannon; Pathak, Heather; Strate, Philip G.; Arora, Komal; Brinton, Margo A.; Kumar, Mukesh",Viruses,51,20

New data on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus are entering the public domain at a rapid rate such that their distillation often lags behind. To minimise weak associations becoming perceived as established paradigms, it is imperative that methodologies and outputs from different studies are appropriately critiqued and compared. In this review, we examine recent data on a potential relationship between smoking and COVID-19. While the causal role of smoking has been firmly demonstrated in regard to lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such associations have the benefit of decades’ worth of multi-centre epidemiological and mechanistic data. From our analysis of the available studies to date, it appears that a relationship is emerging in regard to patients with a smoking history having a higher likelihood of developing more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease than non-smokers. Data on whether COVID-19 has a greater incidence in smokers than non-smokers is thus far, contradictory and inconclusive. There is therefore a need for some caution to be exercised until further research has been conducted in a wider range of geographical settings with sufficient numbers of patients that have been carefully phenotyped in respect of smoking status and adequate statistical control for confounding factors.","Shastri, Madhur D.; Shukla, Shakti Dhar; Chong, Wai Chin; Kc, Rajendra; Dua, Kamal; Patel, Rahul P.; Peterson, Gregory M.; O'Toole, Ronan F.",Respir Med,51,16

The aim of this study was to describe changes in parent stress longitudinally from before (retrospective) to two timepoints during COVID-19. Stressors that influenced parenting and strategies to manage parenting difficulties at each timepoint during COVID-19 are also described. Methods: Parents (N = 433; 95% female) in the US with >1 child aged 5–18 years completed an online survey in May 2020 (T1; at the peak of stay-at-home mandates) and in September 2020 (T2; children's return to school). Surveys included the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and questions on parenting-specific stress, stressors that influenced parenting, and strategies to manage parenting difficulties during COVID-19. Retrospective report of pre-COVID-19 stress was assessed at T1; current stress was assessed at T1 and T2. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined changes in stress over time. Results: Parent's stress increased from before COVID-19 to T1 (PSS score: 16.3 ± 5.7 to 22.0 ± 6.4, respectively; p < 0.01), and decreased by T2 (19.2 ± 6.0), but remained elevated above pre-COVID-19 values (p < 0.01). Most parents (71.1%) reported an increase parenting-specific stress from before COVID-19 to T1, which continued to increase for 55% of parents at T2. Common stressors that impacted parenting during COVID-19 were changes in children's routines, worry about COVID-19, and online schooling demands. Common strategies parents used to manage parenting difficulties included doing family activities together, keeping in touch with family/friends virtually, and keeping children on daily routines. Conclusions: Parent stress increased substantially during COVID-19 and has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, suggesting the need for enhanced mental health resources and supports. Public health interventions should address parenting-specific stressors and effective strategies for managing parenting difficulties to mitigate their deleterious impact.","Adams, Elizabeth L.; Smith, Danyel; Caccavale, Laura J.; Bean, Melanie K.",Front Psychiatry,51,1

Antigen tests have recently emerged as a viable alternative to detect patients with high viral loads, associated with elevated risk of transmission. While rapid lateral flow tests greatly improved accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection in critical areas, their manual nature limits scalability and suitability for large-scale testing schemes. The Elecsys(®) SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay allows antigen immunoassays to be carried out on fully automated high-throughput serology platforms. METHODS: A total of 3139 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3 different testing sites in Germany. Swab samples were pre-characterized by reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and consecutively subjected to the antigen immunoassay on either the cobas e 411 or cobas e 801 analyzer. RESULTS: Of the tested respiratory samples, 392 were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Median concentration was 2.95 × 10(4) (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1 × 10(2)–3.5 × 10(6)) copies/ml. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the antigen immunoassay were 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.2–65.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6–100.0), respectively. A 93.7% (95% CI 89.7–96.5) sensitivity was achieved at a viral RNA concentration ≥ 10(4) copies/ml (~ cycle threshold [C(t)] value < 29.9). CONCLUSION: The Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay reliably detected patient samples with viral loads ≥ 10,000 copies/ml. It thus represents a viable high-throughput alternative for screening of patients or in situations where PCR testing is not readily available.

SETTING: The Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Christian Medical College, Vellore. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study which included COPD patients who found hospital-based PR impractical. Those willing for home-based PR constituted the intervention group and those unwilling, constituted the control group. Both groups received standard of care otherwise. At 6 weeks, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), six-minute walk test distance (6MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT) score and modified Borg dyspnea scale were compared with their baseline values. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student paired t-test. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients completed the study, 21 in each arm. The baseline characteristics were comparable. The improvement in FEV1 was 90 ml in the intervention group and 4 ml in the control group (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in 6MWD change.

There are various unknowns regarding the simultaneous impact from these two diseases, despite the fact that the majority of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are immunocompromised and have comorbidities which can predispose them to severe clinical symptoms, and poorer prognosis, from COVID‐19.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among women attending antenatal care in northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was an institutional-based cross-sectional study, including 424 women attending antenatal care from November 12/2020 to December 12/2020. The study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pretested questionnaire was used. Binary logistic regression (bivariable and multivariable) was employed. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistically significant variables based on p<0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic among women attending antenatal care was found to be 47.17% (42.2–52.2%). Women did not expose to community education (AOR=2.2; 95% CI1.1–4), women with no bad obstetric history (AOR=2.3; 95% CI1.3–4.1), a woman was not the primary decision maker for family planning service (AOR=2.9; 95% CI 1.5–5.7), no complication during index pregnancy (AOR=5.4; 95% CI 2.2–13) and women with no health-care provider support (AOR=2.4, 95% CI1.4–3.9) were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy was found to be high. Community education about maternal health services including family planning, improving women’s decision-making power for maternal health-care services, giving emphasis on pregnancy-related complications with health-care provider support, and pregnant women with bad obstetric history were suggested to reduce the problem.","Hunie Asratie, Melaku",Int J Womens Health,51,16

We report a cross-sectional study of antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and virus neutralization activity in a cohort of 44 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RBD-specific IgG responses are detectable in all patients 6 days after PCR confirmation. Isotype switching to IgG occurs rapidly, primarily to IgG1 and IgG3. Using a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate, neutralizing antibody titers are detectable in all patients by 6 days after PCR confirmation and correlate with RBD-specific binding IgG titers. The RBD-specific binding data were further validated in a clinical setting with 231 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. These findings have implications for understanding protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, therapeutic use of immune plasma, and development of much-needed vaccines.","Suthar, Mehul S.; Zimmerman, Matthew G.; Kauffman, Robert C.; Mantus, Grace; Linderman, Susanne L.; Hudson, William H.; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Nyhoff, Lindsay; Davis, Carl W.; Adekunle, Seyi; Affer, Maurizio; Sherman, Melanie; Reynolds, Stacian; Verkerke, Hans P.; Alter, David N.; Guarner, Jeannette; Bryksin, Janetta; Horwath, Michael; Arthur, Connie M.; Saakadze, Natia; Smith, Geoffrey Hughes; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Scherer, Erin M.; Hellmeister, Kieffer; Cheng, Andrew; Morales, Juliet A.; Neish, Andrew S.; Stowell, Sean R.; Frank, Filipp; Ortlund, Eric; Anderson, Evan; Menachery, Vineet D.; Rouphael, Nadine; Mehta, Aneesh; Stephens, David S.; Ahmed, Rafi; Roback, John D.; Wrammert, Jens",Cell Rep Med,51,21

To date, there is no approved effective treatment or vaccine available to control the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The preliminary in vitro studies on viral infection models showed potential antiviral activities of type I and III interferons (IFNs), chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and azithromycin (AZM); however, the clinical studies on COVID-19 patients treated with CQ/HCQ and AZM led to controversies in different regions due to their adverse side effects, as well as their combined treatment could prolong the QT interval. Interestingly, the treatment with type I IFNs showed encouraging results. Moreover, the different preliminary reports of COVID-19 candidate vaccines showcase promising results by inducing the production of a high level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and specific T cell-mediated immune response in almost all participants. The present review aims to summarize and analyze the recent progress evidence concerning the use of IFNs, CQ/HCQ, and AZM for the treatment of COVID-19.

The influence of wearing masks in physical exercise on the human body needs to be studied. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of wearing surgical masks on the cardiopulmonary function of healthy people during exercise. Methods: The physiological responses of 71 healthy subjects (35 men and 36 women, age 27.77 ± 7.76 years) to exercises with and without surgical masks (mask-on and mask-off) were analyzed. Cardiopulmonary function and metabolic reaction were measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). All tests were carried out in random sequence and should be completed in 1 week. Results: The CPETs with the mask-on condition were performed undesirably (p < 0.05), and the Borg scale was higher than the mask-off (p < 0.001). Rest oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) and carbon dioxide production ([Formula: see text] CO(2)) with the mask-on condition were lower than mask-off (p < 0.01), which were more obvious at peak exercise ([Formula: see text] O(2)(peak): 1454.8 ± 418.9 vs. 1628.6 ± 447.2 ml/min, p < 0.001; [Formula: see text] CO(2)(peak): 1873.0 ± 578.7 vs. 2169.9 ± 627.8 ml/min, p = 0.005), and the anaerobic threshold (AT) brought forward (p < 0.001). At different stages of CPET with the mask-on condition, inspiratory and expiratory time (Te) was longer (p < 0.05), and respiratory frequency (Rf) and minute ventilation ([Formula: see text] (E)) were shorter than mask-off, especially at peak exercise (Rf(peak): 33.8 ± 7.98 vs. 37.91 ± 6.72 b/min, p < 0.001; [Formula: see text] (Epeak): 55.07 ± 17.28 vs. 66.46 ± 17.93 l/min, p < 0.001). V(T) was significantly lower than mask-off just at peak exercise (1.66 ± 0.45 vs. 1.79 ± 0.5 l, p < 0.001). End-tidal oxygen partial pressure (PetO(2)), end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PetCO(2)), oxygen ventilation equivalent ([Formula: see text] (E)/ [Formula: see text] O(2)), and carbon dioxide ventilation equivalent ([Formula: see text] (E)/ [Formula: see text] CO(2)) with mask-on, which reflected pulmonary ventilation efficiency, were significantly different from mask-off at different stages of CPET (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) was found. Differences in oxygen pulse ([Formula: see text] O(2)/HR), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), work efficiency (△ [Formula: see text] O(2)/△W), peak heart rate (HR), and peak systolic blood pressure (BP) existed between two conditions (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Wearing surgical masks during aerobic exercise showed certain negative impacts on cardiopulmonary function, especially during high-intensity exercise in healthy young subjects. These results provide an important recommendation for wearing a mask at a pandemic during exercises of varying intensity. Future research should focus on the response of wearing masks in patients with related cardiopulmonary diseases.","Zhang, Guolin; Li, Mei; Zheng, Meifeng; Cai, Xiaoqing; Yang, Jinyu; Zhang, Shengqing; Yilifate, Anniwaer; Zheng, Yuxin; Lin, Qiang; Liang, Junjie; Guo, Lan; Ou, Haining",Front Physiol,51,20

There is a need to understand the reliability of such inspections and the factors that affect the results. In this study, the factor ‘cleanliness’ was analysed among other factors. Method—Fifty industry practitioners of three expertise levels inspected 24 images of parts with a variety of defects in clean and dirty conditions, resulting in a total of N = 1200 observations. The data were analysed statistically to evaluate the relationships between cleanliness and inspection performance. Eye tracking was applied to understand the search strategies of different levels of expertise for various part conditions. Results—The results show an inspection accuracy of 86.8% and 66.8% for clean and dirty blades, respectively. The statistical analysis showed that cleanliness and defect type influenced the inspection accuracy, while expertise was surprisingly not a significant factor. In contrast, inspection time was affected by expertise along with other factors, including cleanliness, defect type and visual acuity. Eye tracking revealed that inspectors (experts) apply a more structured and systematic search with less fixations and revisits compared to other groups. Conclusions—Cleaning prior to inspection leads to better results. Eye tracking revealed that inspectors used an underlying search strategy characterised by edge detection and differentiation between surface deposits and other types of damage, which contributed to better performance.","Aust, Jonas; Mitrovic, Antonija; Pons, Dirk",Sensors (Basel),51,16

It is influencing agricultural crop productivity. Therefore, thermotolerance strategies are needed to have sustainability in crop yield under higher temperature. However, improving thermotolerance in the crop is a challenging task for crop scientists. Therefore, this review work was conducted with the aim of providing information on the wheat response in three research areas, i.e., physiology, breeding, and advances in genetics, which could assist the researchers in improving thermotolerance. The optimum temperature for wheat growth at the heading, anthesis, and grain filling duration is 16 ± 2.3 °C, 23 ± 1.75 °C, and 26 ± 1.53 °C, respectively. The high temperature adversely influences the crop phenology, growth, and development. The pre-anthesis high temperature retards the pollen viability, seed formation, and embryo development. The post-anthesis high temperature declines the starch granules accumulation, stem reserve carbohydrates, and translocation of photosynthates into grains. A high temperature above 40 °C inhibits the photosynthesis by damaging the photosystem-II, electron transport chain, and photosystem-I. Our review work highlighted that genotypes which can maintain a higher accumulation of proline, glycine betaine, expression of heat shock proteins, stay green and antioxidant enzymes activity viz., catalase, peroxidase, super oxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase can tolerate high temperature efficiently through sustaining cellular physiology. Similarly, the pre-anthesis acclimation with heat treatment, inorganic fertilizer such as nitrogen, potassium nitrate and potassium chloride, mulches with rice husk, early sowing, presoaking of a 6.6 mM solution of thiourea, foliar application of 50 ppm dithiothreitol, 10 mg per kg of silicon at heading and zinc ameliorate the crop against the high temperature. Finally, it has been suggested that modern genomics and omics techniques should be used to develop thermotolerance in wheat.","Khan, Adeel; Ahmad, Munir; Ahmed, Mukhtar; Iftikhar Hussain, M.",Plants (Basel),51,24

A growing body of evidence points to an inseparable link between attributes of the nursing work environment and nurse and patient outcomes. While most studies have adopted a survey design to examine the workforce and work environment issues, this study employed a phenomenological approach to provide empirical evidence regarding nurses’ perceptions of their work and work environment. AIM: The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover through exploring frontline registered nurses’ lived experiences of working in Hong Kong public hospitals. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: A modified version of Van Kaam's controlled explication method was adopted. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 frontline nurses recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. Their perspectives in regard to their work and work environment, such as workload, manpower demand and professional values, were extensively examined, and a hypothetical description relating the nursing work environment with nurses’ turnover intention was posited. RESULTS: Contemplation of nurses’ experiences revealed the vulnerable aspects of nursing work and six essential constituents of the nursing work environment, namely staffing level, work responsibility, management, co-worker relationships, job, and professional incentives. These essential constituents have contributed to two sets of forces, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, which originate from the attributes of the nursing work environment. Nurses viewed harmonious co-worker relationships, recognition and professional development as the crucial retaining factors. However, nurses working in an unfavorable environment were overwhelmed by destabilizing forces; they expressed frustration and demonstrated an intention to leave their work environment. CONCLUSIONS: The nursing work environment is a complex entity comprising multiple constituents; its attributes affect nurses’ perceptions of their work and work environment, which warrant special attention in addressing the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover.","Choi, Sandy Pin-pin; Pang, Samantha Mei-che; Cheung, Kin; Wong, Thomas Kwok-shing",Int J Nurs Stud,51,16

To develop precise anticoronavirus drugs and prophylactics, tissue engineering and biomaterial research strategies can serve as a suitable alternative to the conventional treatment options. Therefore, in this Review, we have highlighted various tissue engineering-based diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested how these strategies involving organ-on-a-chip, organoids, 3D bioprinting, and advanced bioreactor models can be employed to develop in vitro human tissue models, for more efficient diagnosis, drug/vaccine development, and focusing on the need for patient-specific therapy. We believe that combining the basics of virology with tissue engineering techniques can help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying viral infection, which is critical for effective drug design. In addition, it can also serve to be a suitable platform for drug testing and delivery of small molecules that can lead to therapeutic tools in this dreaded pandemic situation. Additionally, we have also discussed the essential biomaterial properties which polarize the immune system, including dendritic cells and macrophages, toward their inflammatory phenotype, which can thus serve as a reference for exhibiting the role of biomaterial in influencing the adaptive immune response involving B and T lymphocytes to foster a regenerative tissue microenvironment. The situation arising from SARS-CoV-2 poses a challenge to scientists from almost all disciplines, and we feel that tissue engineers can thus provide new translational opportunities in this dreadful pandemic situation.","Chakraborty, Juhi; Banerjee, Indranil; Vaishya, Raju; Ghosh, Sourabh",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,51,20

Due to the large population sizes produced by RNA viruses during replication, this results in a cloud of closely related virus variants during host infection, of which small increases or decreases in replication fidelity have been shown to result in virus attenuation in vivo, but not typically in vitro. Since the discovery of the first RNA virus fidelity mutants during the mid-aughts, the field has exploded with the identification of over 50 virus fidelity mutants distributed amongst 7 RNA virus families. This review summarizes the current RNA virus fidelity mutant literature, with a focus upon the definition of a fidelity mutant as well as methods to confirm any mutational changes associated with the fidelity mutant. Due to the complexity of such a definition, in addition to reports of unstable virus fidelity phenotypes, the future translational utility of these mutants and applications for basic science are examined.","Kautz, Tiffany F.; Forrester, Naomi L.",Viruses,51,16

Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan.","Rodriguez, Thalia; Dobrovolny, Hana M.",Virus Res,51,22

The algorithms considered were generalized linear model (GLM), recursive partition tree (RPART), random forest (RF), neural networks models, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Since the outcome is rare, upsampling and downsampling algorithms have been applied for imbalance control. For each approach, the main performance measures were reported. Among an overall sample of 29,494 subjects, only 399 developed HF during the PICU stay. The median age was about two years, and the male gender was the most prevalent. The XGB algorithm outperformed other MLTs in predicting HF development, with a median ROC measure of 0.780 (IQR 0.770–0.793).

Some African countries have adopted stringent measures such as national lockdown, quarantine or isolation, in combination with good hand hygiene, mandatory wearing of masks and physical distancing, to prevent an impending healthcare crisis. The impact of stringent measures in low- to middle-income African countries has bought time for healthcare facilities to prepare for the onslaught of COVID-19 cases, but some measures have been challenging to implement. In some settings, public health measures have been associated with serious violations of individual rights owing to abuse of power and gaps in implementation of well-intentioned policy. Collateral damage with regard to non-COVID-19 diseases that were suboptimally managed in pre-pandemic times may mean that lives lost from other diseases could exceed those saved from COVID-19.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, eflornithine) is the best-known inhibitor of ODC and a broad-spectrum, unique therapeutical agent. Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetic profile is not perfect, especially when large doses are required in antiviral treatment. This article presents a holistic study focusing on the molecular and supramolecular structure of DFMO and the design of its analogues toward the development of safer and more effective formulations. In this context, we provide the first deep insight into the supramolecular system of DFMO supplemented by a comprehensive, qualitative and quantitative survey of non-covalent interactions via Hirshfeld surface, molecular electrostatic potential, enrichment ratio and energy frameworks analysis visualizing 3-D topology of interactions in order to understand the differences in the cooperativity of interactions involved in the formation of either basic or large synthons (Long-range Synthon Aufbau Modules, LSAM) at the subsequent levels of well-organized supramolecular self-assembly, in comparison with the ornithine structure. In the light of the drug discovery, supramolecular studies of amino acids, essential constituents of proteins, are of prime importance. In brief, the same amino-carboxy synthons are observed in the bio-system containing DFMO. DFT calculations revealed that the biological environment changes the molecular structure of DFMO only slightly. The ADMET profile of structural modifications of DFMO and optimization of its analogue as a new promising drug via molecular docking are discussed in detail.","Bojarska, Joanna; New, Roger; Borowiecki, Paweł; Remko, Milan; Breza, Martin; Madura, Izabela D.; Fruziński, Andrzej; Pietrzak, Anna; Wolf, Wojciech M.",Front Chem,51,20

We report our experience with the Seraph-100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter (Seraph-100) in 4 patients with COVID-19 early in the course of their critical respiratory illnesses. Patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were admitted to intensive care with worsening respiratory failure but did not require dialysis or vasopressors. Patients had to have a PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F ratio) <150 to qualify for hemoperfusion therapy. All patients received standard medical therapy including oral vitamins C and D and zinc in addition to intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir. Patients received a single 5- to 7-h session with Seraph-100 on a conventional dialysis machine (Fresenius 2008T) via a nontunneled central venous dialysis catheter with a goal of processing at least 100 L of blood. Patients received weight-based subcutaneous enoxaparin anticoagulation, as well as systemic intravenous heparin (70 units/kg), just prior to hemofiltration. Treatment with Seraph-100 hemoperfusion was well tolerated, and all patients were able to finish their prescribed therapy. All patients treated with Seraph-100 survived to be discharged from the hospital.

Immunocompromised status is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality. METHOD: The groups’ baseline characteristics were balanced using a propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risks of in-hospital mortality and other outcomes according to immunocompromised status using a multivariable logistic regression model. We identified immunocompromised status based on a diagnosis of malignancy or HIV/AIDS, having undergone organ transplantation within 3 years, prescriptions for corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants for ≥30 days, and at least one prescription for non-oral immunosuppressants during the last year. RESULTS: The 6,435 COVID-19 patients (≥18 years) included 871 immunocompromised (13.5%) and 5,564 non-immunocompromised (86.5%). Immunocompromised COVID-19 patients were older (60.1±16.4 years vs. 47.1±18.7 years, absolute standardized mean difference: 0.738). The immunocompromised group had more comorbidities, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (9.6% vs. 2.3%; p < .001). The immunocompromised group still had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate after inverse probability of treatment weighting (6.4% vs. 2.0%, p < .001). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that immunocompromised status was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.62–2.68, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised status among COVID-19 patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.","Baek, Moon Seong; Lee, Min-Taek; Kim, Won-Young; Choi, Jae Chol; Jung, Sun-Young",PLoS One,51,31

So every country should have their own data regarding COVID-19. Subjects and Methods: This was an online cross-sectional survey carried out in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 adult patient. A preformed questionnaire adapted in Google form and circulated through online to collect data. Informed consent was ensured before participation in this study. Results: We have studied of 305 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients mean age was 36.32(+/-12.369) years with male predominance and majority were doctor 46.9%. 48.8% of the patients family members affected along with them. After COVID-19 pandemic 31.7% did not go out of their house. For prevention (72.4%)of the patients used mask and 38.8% used hand gloves during outing. 28.7% reported to be affected while working in hospital 21.8%were affected in their office. Fever (80.1%) cough (57.7%) pain in throat (50.8%) rhinitis (45.9%) and loss of smell (45%) and taste sensation (45.6%) were the most common symptoms. Sample was given average 3 (+/- 3.384) days after onset of the symptoms and report was delivered average 4.57 days after giving sample. After getting result 32.1% of the patients seek treatment in telemedicine and 23% directly consulted in Government hospital only 2% reported to be treated by the Government designated telephone number. 73.1% of the patient took both steam inhalation and warm water gargling. Paracetamol and antihistamine was the most commonly use drugs 69.8% and 71.5% respectively besides 47.5% took ivermectin 41.6% took azithromycin 35.1% steroid 34.8% took doxycyclin and 21.6% hydroxychloroquine. Among the patients only 20.3% needed hospital admission. The patients admitted in hospital average 5 (+/-3.922) days after onset of symptoms and hospital staying was 9.2 days (average). Breathless (54.83%) was the major cause of hospital admission and 19.35% patients admitted due to fear. 14% patients needed oxygen and average duration of oxygen was 4.84 days. 81.3% patients has taken oxygen in hospital and 18.8% at their home. Among the patient 2.2% needed ICU and artificial ventilation needed for 1.1% patients. The patients recovered after 17.74 days (average) from the onset of symptom. COVID-19 became negative (RT-PCR) at15th day from onset of symptom. 91.8%) were in mental stress to become the cause of infection spread to other family members 20.7%) reported that they were anxious that they would not get oxygen or ICU if required and 27.9% were suffering from fear of death. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom in 57.4% cases. Average time required for coming back to normal life was 21.59 days (+/-7.901) ranging a wide range from 5 to 60 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients were mostly male health worker. Fever cough pain in throat were most common symptoms. Hospital admission required in only one-fifth cases and ICU required for only 2% patients. Weakness was the most common post disease symptom.

Researchers worldwide observed reductions in NO2 concentrations due to lockdown and related diminished human activities, notably the reduced industrial and vehicular use. However, limited information was available for the MENA Region. In this study, the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 on NO2 in two MENA major cities: Cairo, Egypt and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia was assessed. NO2 column was retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura for April 2017 to 2020. The monthly mean value of NO2 concentrations of April 2017-2019 was used as a baseline. NO2 concentration in April 2020 was compared to the baseline to assess the impact of lockdown on NO2. The results demonstrated that the lockdown was associated with a reduction in NO2 in both cities. NO2 decreases by 40.3% and 23% in Riyadh and Cairo. By comparing the decrease of NO2 at weekends and weekdays, it was found that in Cairo, the decrease in weekdays (16.3%) was lower than weekends (31.9%). While in Riyadh, the decrease in weekdays (43.9%) was higher than weekends (29.3%). Variation in the reduction rates appears to be related to the different lockdown regimens taken by the two countries, among other factors. The findings of the present investigation alert countries in the region about the impact of human activities on urban air population and urge them to take appropriate mitigation measures to maintain good ambient air quality to protect human health and the environment.","Abdelsattar, Amal; Al Nadhairi, Rahma; Hassan, Ali N.",,51,5

Endoscopy units transformed to comply with guidelines in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and to protect patients and staff. Many units experienced a marked decrease in case volume. Aims/Background: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the pandemic on the colonoscopy performance in our endoscopy unit;focusing primarily on case volume, pathology identified and training. Methods: This was a single center, retrospective, observational study comparing colonoscopies performed at a high-volume endoscopy center in Ireland during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with colonoscopies performed during a similar time frame pre-pandemic (March-June 2020 versus 2019). Data was collected using electronic patient records. Results: During the reference period (March to June 2019), 981 colonoscopies were performed in our unit. In the same period in 2020, there was a 4.5-fold reduction in colonoscopies performed (n=217). Baseline patient characteristics, colonoscopy comfort scores, sedation rates and quality of bowel preparation were similar in both groups. 53% were male (2019, n=522;2020, n=115). The median age in 2019 was 61 years compared with 66 years in 2020. The indications for endoscopy differed between the two time periods. The main indications pre-pandemic were previous polyps (19.47%), colorectal cancer (CRC) screening via the national CRC screening programme in Ireland (17.33%), and diarrhoea or alternating bowel habits (11.62%). In 2020, the main indications included CRC screening (33.64%), anaemia (15.67%) and rectal bleeding (13.36%). With regards to pathology identified, the overall adenoma detection rate (ADR) in 2019 was 27.83%. In 2020, the ADR was 37.33%. There was a 2.4-fold reduction in the number of malignancies detected in 2020 compared with 2019 (2019, n=24;2020, n=10). There was an 8-fold reduction in the number of colonoscopies performed by GI trainees (2019, n=367;2020, n=44). Although the total number of polyps identified reduced greatly (2019, n=331;2020, n=62), the ADR for GI trainees remained acceptable (2019 = 32.21%;2020 = 40.91%). The average number of polyps detected per procedure was equal in 2019 to 2020 (n=2). Cecal intubation rates (91.0% vs 90.9%) and withdrawal times (15.9 vs 17.3 minutes) were comparable for 2019 versus 2020. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impacted greatly on our endoscopy unit in terms of case volume and pathology identified. Endoscopy training in our unit was also adversely affected. A marked decrease in the number of colonoscopies and polypectomies performed by GI trainees was observed in 2020. At present, many countries worldwide are experiencing a second wave of the virus. Strategies will need to be created to safeguard endoscopy training for our trainees.","Conlon, Caroline; Farrelly, Niamh Mehigan; Ring, Eabha; Dunne, Talulla; Gorman, Dora; Kelleher, Barry; Leyden, Jan; Lahiff, Conor",Gastrointestinal Endoscopy,51,20

Recently, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques has provided a new scope for more detailed imaging analysis in esophageal cancer (EC) patients. Our review aims to explore the recent advances and future perspective of the ML technique in the disease management of EC patients. ML-based investigations can be used for diagnosis, treatment response evaluation, prognostication, and investigation of biological heterogeneity. The key results from the literature have demonstrated the potential of ML techniques, such as radiomic techniques and deep learning networks, to improve the decision-making process for EC patients in clinical practice. Recommendations have been made to improve study design and future applicability. ABSTRACT: Esophageal cancer (EC) is of public health significance as one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Accurate staging, treatment planning and prognostication in EC patients are of vital importance. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) techniques demonstrate their potential to provide novel quantitative imaging markers in medical imaging. Radiomics approaches that could quantify medical images into high-dimensional data have been shown to improve the imaging-based classification system in characterizing the heterogeneity of primary tumors and lymph nodes in EC patients. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence of the most recent developments in ML application in imaging pertinent to EC patient care. According to the published results, ML models evaluating treatment response and lymph node metastasis achieve reliable predictions, ranging from acceptable to outstanding in their validation groups. Patients stratified by ML models in different risk groups have a significant or borderline significant difference in survival outcomes. Prospective large multi-center studies are suggested to improve the generalizability of ML techniques with standardized imaging protocols and harmonization between different centers.","Xie, Chen-Yi; Pang, Chun-Lap; Chan, Benjamin; Wong, Emily Yuen-Yuen; Dou, Qi; Vardhanabhuti, Varut",Cancers (Basel),51,6

However, previous studies essentially evaluated psychopathological symptoms and not the presence of positive mental health. Therefore, the first objective of the present research is to evaluate health-care professionals’ mental illness (i.e., anxiety and traumatic intensity) and positive mental health (i.e., well-being) using the Complete State Model of Health. Our second objective is to study the effect of Personal Protection Equipment availability on professionals’ mental health. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-two health-care professionals working in Spain in the first line of COVID-19 patient care participated in the study. To measure anxiety, traumatic intensity and well-being participants completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships between all scales. In order to test the two continua model of mental health, we used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis. To analyze anxiety, traumatic intensity, and well-being differences between health-care professionals with and without Personal Protection Equipment availability we conducted different ANOVAS. To test our hypothesis regarding the moderating role of Personal Protection Equipment availability in the effect of mental illness on positive mental health, data were subjected to a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: As in previous studies, health-care professionals showed high levels of anxiety and traumatic intensity. They also presented low levels of well-being indicators. According to our hypothesis, results of parallel analysis and exploratory factorial analysis indicated that the measures of mental illness and positive mental health loaded on separate but correlated factors. Finally, Personal Protection Equipment availability moderated the effects of state anxiety and traumatic intensity on professionals’ well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Health-care professionals’ mental illness and positive mental health reflect distinct continua, rather than the extreme ends of a single spectrum. Therefore, it is essential to measure both psychopathology and the presence of positive health to comprehensively evaluate professionals’ mental health. Finally, our results indicated that Personal Protection Equipment availability is essential not only for professionals’ physical health, but also for their mental health.","Bajo, Miriam; Gallego, Pilar; Stavraki, Maria; Lamprinakos, Grigorios; Luna, Pablo; Díaz, Darío",Health Qual Life Outcomes,51,24

DESIGN: We analysed registered interventional COVID-19 trial data and concurrently did a prospective observational study of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who were being assessed for eligibility to one of the RECOVERY, C19-ACS or SIMPLE trials. SETTING: Interventional COVID-19 trial data were analysed from the clinicaltrials.gov and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number databases on 12 July 2020. The patient cohort was taken from five centres in a respiratory National Institute for Health Research network. Population and modelling data were taken from published reports from the UK government and Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit. PARTICIPANTS: 2082 consecutive admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 27 March 2020 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions enrolled, and reasons for exclusion from the aforementioned trials. Comparisons of trial recruitment targets with estimated feasible recruitment numbers. RESULTS: Analysis of trial registration data for COVID-19 treatment studies enrolling in England showed that by 12 July 2020, 29 142 participants were needed. In the observational study, 430 (20.7%) proceeded to randomisation. 82 (3.9%) declined participation, 699 (33.6%) were excluded on clinical grounds, 363 (17.4%) were medically fit for discharge and 153 (7.3%) were receiving palliative care. With 111 037 people hospitalised with COVID-19 in England by 12 July 2020, we determine that 22 985 people were potentially suitable for trial enrolment. We estimate a UK hospitalisation rate of 2.38%, and that another 1.25 million infections would be required to meet recruitment targets of ongoing trials. CONCLUSIONS: Feasible recruitment rates, study design and proliferation of trials can limit the number, and size, that will successfully complete recruitment. We consider that fewer, more appropriately designed trials, prioritising cooperation between centres would maximise productivity in a further wave.","Cunniffe, Nick G; Gunter, Simon J; Brown, Michael; Burge, Sarah W; Coyle, Clare; De Soyza, Anthony; Dymond, Tom; Esmail, Hanif; Francis, Darrel P; Galloway, Jacqui; Galloway, James B; Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrossyni; Greenaway, Jane; Katritsis, George; Kanagaratnam, Prapa; Knolle, Martin D; Leonard, Kelly; McIntyre, Zoe C; Prudon, Ben; Rampling, Tommy; Torok, Mili Estee; Warne, Ben; Yates, Mark; Matheson, Nicholas J; Su, Li; Villar, Sofia; Stewart, Grant D; Toshner, Mark",BMJ Open,51,8

Due to the situation of uncertainty, the hospital administration encourages the excess stock of these materials, causing excess products in some hospitals, but shortages in others. Although three main factors limit the number of patients seen at a hospital: the number of beds available, the number of equipment, and, above all, the number of health professionals available at the hospital, per shift. Objective: In this scenario, a challenge is to build an easy-to-use computational tool to predict the demand for personal protective equipment in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, with updating in real-time. Methods: We propose naive statistical modeling, which combines historical data on the consumption of personal protective equipment by hospitals, current protocols for their uses and epidemiological data related to the disease, in order to build predictive models for the demand for personal protective equipment in Brazilian hospitals during the pandemic. We then embed our modeling in a tool that can provide the safety stock for a particular hospital. Results: Our tool presents forecasts of consumption/demand for personal protective equipment over time, indicating the moment when the hospital reaches maximum consumption, the estimate of how long it will work in this state, and when it will leave it. Conclusion: With our forecasting, a hospital may have estimated, based on its stock levels and possible new purchases, its needs related to a specific personal protective equipment, which allows for the adoption of strategies to control and keep the stock at safety levels to the demand. As a direct consequence, it enables interchange and cooperation between hospitals, aiming to maximize the care during the pandemic.","Gonzatto, O. A.; do Nascimento, D. C.; Russo, C.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays using samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected prior to April 2019, thus defined as negative. Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10) with or without RF, were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed IgG multiplex bead-based assay. Six LFA and the in-house validated IgG assay correctly produced negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal for samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in samples from RF positive RA patients. No false positive samples were detected in any assay using samples from patients with MS. Poor specificity of commercial serological assays could possibly be, at least partly, due to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. For these patients, the risk of false positivity should be considered when interpreting results of the SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.","Kharlamova, Nastya; Dunn, Nicky; Bedri, Sahl K.; Jerling, Svante; Almgren, Malin; Faustini, Francesca; Gunnarsson, Iva; Rönnelid, Johan; Pullerits, Rille; Gjertsson, Inger; Lundberg, Karin; Månberg, Anna; Pin, Elisa; Nilsson, Peter; Hober, Sophia; Fink, Katharina; Fogdell-Hahn, Anna",Front Immunol,51,1

We report the case of a 64-year-old male patient who underwent explantation of a shoulder prosthesis due to a periprosthetic infection. He was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 7 days after admission to the orthopaedic department following strict infection control measures, routinely including screening all patients for multi-drug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization upon admission. Aim of our study is to report on the spreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare setting if standard contact precautions and infection control measures have been established. METHODS: All HCW with exposure to the patient from day of admission until confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified and underwent oropharyngeal swab testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-six HCW were identified: nine orthopaedic surgeons, four anaesthesiologists, 25 orthopaedic nurses, five nurse anesthetists, eight scrub nurses, five nursing students, two medical assistants and seven service employees. Fourteen HCW (21%) showed clinical symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection: cough (n = 4), sore throat (n = 3), nasal congestion (n = 3), dyspnea (n = 2), fever (n = 1), headache and myalgia (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 66 HCW. CONCLUSION: Hygienic measures and contact precautions, aimed at preventing the spread of MRDO, may have helped to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCW—despite high-risk exposure during intubation, surgical treatment and general care.

In the present study, we have identified potential natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 targeting the ATP-binding site using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulation of the prepared crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 was performed to generate an ensemble of structures of helicase Nsp13 capturing the conformational diversity of the ATP-binding site. A natural product library of more than 14,000 phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants was used to perform virtual screening against the ensemble of Nsp13 structures. Subsequently, a two-stage filter, first based on protein–ligand docking binding energy value and second based on protein residues in the ligand-binding site and non-covalent interactions between the protein residues and the ligand in the best-docked pose, was used to identify 368 phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13. MD simulations of the top inhibitors complexed with protein were performed to confirm stable binding, and to compute MM-PBSA based binding energy. From among the 368 potential phytochemical inhibitors, the top identified potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 helicase Nsp13 namely, Picrasidine M, (+)-Epiexcelsin, Isorhoeadine, Euphorbetin and Picrasidine N, can be taken up initially for experimental studies.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This is a prospective, multicentre longitudinal study (April–December 2020) in 60 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or who have recovered from COVID-19. A control group of 13 women before the pandemic were also included. SETTING: Seven health centres from different provinces in Spain. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk, targeting the N1 region of the nucleocapsid gene and the envelope (E) gene; presence and levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins (Igs)—IgA, IgG and IgM—in breast milk samples from patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All breast milk samples showed negative results for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We observed high intraindividual and interindividual variability in the antibody response to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for each of the three isotypes IgA, IgM and IgG. Main Protease (MPro) domain antibodies were also detected in milk. 82.9% (58 of 70) of milk samples were positive for at least one of the three antibody isotypes, with 52.9% of these positive for all three Igs. Positivity rate for IgA was relatively stable over time (65.2%–87.5%), whereas it raised continuously for IgG (from 47.8% for the first 10 days to 87.5% from day 41 up to day 206 post-PCR confirmation).

Contributing factors include disrupted workflows, heavier workloads, increased time restraints, and fear of contracting/passing the virus. Prolonged high stress levels can produce adverse health outcomes when unaddressed. Resilience can mitigate the negative effects of prolonged stress. Four healthcare workers relate their experiences from the frontlines of the pandemic, discussing their strategies to build resilience and maintain health. Highlighted strategies include mindfulness (the purposeful act of paying attention to the present moment without judgment), gratitude (the practice of being grateful for the positive things in life), self-care (the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle using physical, psychological, and emotional tools), and social support (the sense of belonging that comes from being cared for and valued). These strategies reduce negative outcomes produced by elevated stress levels and promote resilience in frontline healthcare workers.","Liljestrand, Rebecca; Martin, Sarah",Rehabilitation nursing : the official journal of the Association of Rehabilitation Nurses,51,16

Care homes are particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases, which may lead to increased mortality risk. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. AIM: to analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4 years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: we used anonymised electronic health records and administrative data from the secure anonymised information linkage databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. METHODS: we calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted HRs for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. RESULTS: survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1.72 (1.55, 1.90) compared with 2016. Compared with the general population in 2016–2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2.15 (2.11, 2.20) in 2016–2019 to 2.94 (2.81, 3.08) in 2020.

Since its outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there are no medicines to cure the disease till date. Based on their experience, scientists say that developing a coronavirus vaccine could take at least a year. There are many steps in place before the vaccine comes for the distribution like its safety and cost-effectiveness, especially for the developing countries. In this scenario, the only way to prevent the disease is by following certain safety guidelines and to boost up the body’s immune system. Zinc, a crucial trace element involved in several biological and metabolic processes, has been found to play a pivotal role in promoting and appropriately regulating the host defense mechanisms against viral infections. Zinc is naturally present in some foods, fortified in others and also available as dietary supplement. The current RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) of zinc is 12 and 10 mg for males and females respectively. Zinc is the second most common trace mineral after iron in the cell. It is present in all organs and tissues in the body as it forms catalytic component of all 6 classes of enzymes encompassing almost 2000 enzymes in the body. Zinc is biologically essential for cellular processes, including growth and development, as well as DNA synthesis and RNA transcription. Zinc deficiency results in a number of metabolic changes besides a compromised immune system. In this review, the role of zinc in regulating the host defense and viral replication is being discussed with the main focus on COVID-19.","Sharma, Priyanka; Reddy, Prasanna Kumar; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Biol Trace Elem Res,51,1

The Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR) program is an action-oriented, evidence-based behavioral treatment for opioid and methamphetamine disorders in parents involved in the child welfare (CW) system. A seven-clinician team operates out of a Medicaid-funded clinic, primarily delivering services in the community. Attending to underlying mechanisms of FAIR's intervention strategies that promote client engagement and clinical outcomes, FAIR rapidly adapted it procedures in response to COVID-19-onset disruptions. This study analyzes administrative records and Medicaid claims data from January 2019 to July 2020, including 157 clients and 17,449 claims. We considered COVID-19 presence as March–July 2020. The study examined changes in the frequency and reimbursement volume of FAIR service delivery pre- and postonset of COVID-19. Although average monthly reimbursement per clinician did not significantly decline, reimbursement per client significantly declined by 31% (pre: $1005 [$732]; post: $698 [$546], p < .001). Clinicians delivered services on significantly more days per month during COVID-19 (mean (sd) = 16.73 (6.33); 20.26 (7.24), t(127) = −2.70, p < .01). Average clinician caseload size was stable, as was the average monthly service receipt days for clients. Thus, this study attributes reductions in reimbursement per client when FAIR provided services remotely to the elimination of in-person billable services and reductions in session length, but not in frequency. Medicaid-funded clinics and community-based substance use treatment interventions such as FAIR can successfully sustain and implement substance use treatment practices with deliberate, rapid adaptation to ensure that families receive needed supports in the face of contextual crises.","Cruden, Gracelyn; Campbell, Mark; Saldana, Lisa",J Subst Abuse Treat,51,30

Methods A web‐based survey was distributed to centres within the European Reference Network on rare and complex epilepsies (ERN EpiCARE). Responses were collected between April 9 and May 15, 2020. Results were analysed with Microsoft Excel, Python Pandas and SciPy. Results Representants from 47 EpiCARE centres from 22 countries completed the survey. At the time of completing the survey, inpatient video‐EEGs had been stopped or restricted in most centres (61.7% vs. 36.2% for adults, and 38.3% vs. 53.2% for children). Invasive investigations and epilepsy surgery were similarly affected. Acute EEGs continued to be performed, while indications for outpatient EEGs were limited and COVID‐19 triage put in place. The strictness of measures varied according to extent of the outbreak in a given country. Conclusions The results indicate a profound impact of COVID‐19 on neurophysiological diagnostics, especially inpatient video‐EEGs, invasive investigations, and epilepsy surgery.

We show that SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike‐pseudotyped virus and genuine SARS‐CoV‐2 infections are generally restricted by human and mouse IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, using gain‐ and loss‐of‐function approaches. Mechanistically, SARS‐CoV‐2 restriction occurred independently of IFITM3 S‐palmitoylation, indicating a restrictive capacity distinct from reported inhibition of other viruses. In contrast, the IFITM3 amphipathic helix and its amphipathic properties were required for virus restriction. Mutation of residues within the IFITM3 endocytosis‐promoting YxxΦ motif converted human IFITM3 into an enhancer of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and cell‐to‐cell fusion assays confirmed the ability of endocytic mutants to enhance Spike‐mediated fusion with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of TMPRSS2, which increases plasma membrane fusion versus endosome fusion of SARS‐CoV‐2, attenuated IFITM3 restriction and converted amphipathic helix mutants into infection enhancers. In sum, we uncover new pro‐ and anti‐viral mechanisms of IFITM3, with clear distinctions drawn between enhancement of viral infection at the plasma membrane and amphipathicity‐based mechanisms used for endosomal SARS‐CoV‐2 restriction.","Shi, Guoli; Kenney, Adam D.; Kudryashova, Elena; Zani, Ashley; Zhang, Lizhi; Lai, Kin Kui; Hall‐Stoodley, Luanne; Robinson, Richard T.; Kudryashov, Dmitri S.; Compton, Alex A.; Yount, Jacob S.",EMBO J,51,1

Patients may develop severe thrombocytopenia, acute anemia of inflammation and, systemic thrombosis with the fatal course of disease, which is suggestive of further interferences of Sars-CoV-2 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the differentiation process towards erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. Therefore, we speculated whether Sars-CoV-2 propagates in or compartmentalizes with hematopoietic progenitor, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells as the main cause of thrombotic events in either COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Results: The Sars-CoV-2 RNA replication, protein translation and infectious particle formation as the spike proteins in hematopoietic cell lines take place via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) entry pathway within primary CD34(+) HSCs inducing, ex vivo, the formation of defected erythroid and megakaryocytic cells that eventually become targets of humoral and adaptive immune cells.

There is little data examining the correlation between serum albumin levels and COVID-19 disease severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether admission albumin levels reliably predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients from two hospitals who had COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and radiologic imaging, who were hospitalized between March and July 2020. We recorded demographics, COVID-19 testing techniques, and day of admission labs. The outcomes recorded included the following: venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, discharge with new or higher home oxygen supplementation, readmission within 90 days, in-hospital mortality, and total adverse events. A multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis was then performed to determine significant predictors for increased adverse events in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients (60.2%) had hypoalbuminemia (albumin level < 3.3 g/dL). Patients with higher albumin levels on admission had a 72% decreased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (adjusted relative risk [RR]:0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.14–0.53, p<0.001) for every 1 g/dL increase of albumin. Moreover, higher albumin levels on admission were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS (adjusted RR:0.73, 95% CI:0.55–0.98, p = 0.033), admission to the ICU (adjusted RR:0.64, 95% CI:0.45–0.93, p = 0.019), and were less likely to be readmitted within 90 days (adjusted RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.17–0.81, p = 0.012). Furthermore, higher albumin levels were associated with fewer total adverse events (adjusted RR:0.65, 95% CI:0.52–0.80, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum albumin levels appear to be a predictive biomarker for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We found that higher albumin levels on admission were associated with significantly fewer adverse outcomes, including less VTE events, ARDS development, ICU admissions, and readmissions within 90 days. Screening patients may lead to early identification of patients at risk for developing in-hospital complications and improve optimization and preventative efforts in this cohort.","Kheir, Matthew; Saleem, Farah; Wang, Christy; Mann, Amardeep; Chua, Jimmy",PLoS One,51,21

Focal ES, focal ES evolving into generalized ES with a stereotypical pattern and generalized ES were observed. All the cubs were normal between episodes, had a normal neurological examination and unremarkable investigations. Phenobarbital was used as a first line antiepileptic drug (AED). ES halted 10 days (0–34) after starting treatment in eight out of twenty cubs (40%). Treatment was discontinued in this group after a mean of 578 days and no further ES were reported (mean follow-up longer than 5 years). Eleven animals (55%) continued on AED treatment for a mean of 1306 days (70–3466). An adult-onset was observed for one lynx (5%). Polytherapy was necessary in seven lynxes (35%). The inheritance pattern observed was compatible with an autosomal recessive condition. Based on this assumption, mating between two identified carriers has been avoided since 2012, which may have contributed to the subsequent decrease in prevalence, with no further cases detected in 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Lynx pardinus may have an early onset self-limiting ES syndrome characteristic of benign juvenile idiopathic epilepsy. Information obtained from this study strongly suggests a genetic basis for the here presented epilepsy.","Mínguez, Juan J.; El Bouyafrouri, Yasmin; Godoy, José A.; Rivas, Antonio; Fernández, Jesús; Asensio, Victoria; Serra, Rodrigo; Perez-Aspa, María J.; Lorenzo, Valentina",BMC Vet Res,51,16

A weak immune system increases susceptibility to infections and allows infections to become more severe. One component of the immune response is inflammation. Where inflammation is excessive or uncontrolled it can damage host tissues and cause pathology. Limitation of oxidative stress is one means of controlling inflammation. Citrus fruit juices are a particularly good source of vitamin C and folate, which both have roles in sustaining the integrity of immunological barriers and in supporting the function of many types of immune cell including phagocytes, natural killer cells, T-cells and B-cells. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and reduces aspects of the inflammatory response. Important bioactive polyphenols in citrus fruit juices include hesperidin, narirutin and naringin. Hesperidin is a glycoside of hesperetin while narirutin and naringin are glycosides of naringenin. Hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and narirutin have all been found to have anti-inflammatory effects in model systems, and human trials of hesperidin report reductions in inflammatory markers. In humans, orange juice was shown to limit the post-prandial inflammation induced by a high fat-high carbohydrate meal. Consuming orange juice daily for a period of weeks has been reported to reduce markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein, as confirmed through a recent meta-analysis. A newly emerging topic is whether polyphenols from orange juice have direct anti-viral effects. In summary, micronutrients and other bioactives present in citrus fruit juices have established roles in controlling oxidative stress and inflammation and in supporting innate and acquired immune responses. Trials in humans demonstrate that orange juice reduces inflammation; its effects on innate and acquired immunity require further exploration in well-designed trials in appropriate population sub-groups such as older people.","Miles, Elizabeth A.; Calder, Philip C.",Front Immunol,51,16

There is a strong pathophysiological rationale suggesting that hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), a low-risk and non-invasive treatment, may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aimed to explore the potential effectiveness and safety of HBOT for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from December 2019 to February 2021, without language restrictions. The grey literature was searched via an internet search engine and targeted website and database searches. Reference lists of included studies were searched. Independent reviewers assessed studies for eligibility and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Data were summarised descriptively. RESULTS: Six publications (one cohort study, five case reports/series) met the inclusion criteria with a total of 37 hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients treated with HBOT. Of these 37 patients, the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation and in-hospital survival were assessed for 26 patients across three studies. Of these 26 patients, intubation and mechanical ventilation were not required for 24, and 23 patients survived. No serious adverse events of HBOT in COVID-19 patients were reported. No randomised trials have been published. CONCLUSIONS: Limited and weak evidence from non-randomised studies including one propensity-matched cohort study suggests HBOT is safe and may be a promising intervention to optimise treatment and outcomes in hypoxaemic COVID-19 patients. Randomised controlled studies are urgently needed.","Boet, Sylvain; Etherington, Cole; Djaiani, George; Tricco, Andrea C; Sikora, Lindsey; Katznelson, Rita",Diving Hyperb Med,51,16

This study aimed to investigate the lateral and longitudinal associations of lymphocyte ratio (LR) and neutrophil ratio (NR) on liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. We tested 1,409 blood samples from 245 COVID-19 patients in China between January 2020 and June 2021. The lateral U-shaped relationships, determined by smooth curve fitting and the piecewise-linear mixed-effect model, were observed between LR, NR, and AST and the incidence of AST-linked liver dysfunction, with the threshold cutoffs of 26.1 and 62.0, respectively. Over the 1,409 tests, the LR ≤ 26.1 and NR ≥ 62.0 related to the occurrence of mild liver dysfunction (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.82), moderate liver dysfunction (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.85), and severe liver dysfunction (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.90). For the patients with preexisting AST ≥ 35 U/L, the baseline LR ≤ 26.1 and NR ≥ 62.0 (b.LLCHN) groups had a fully adjusted 8.85-, 7.88-, and 5.97-fold increased risk of mild and moderate liver dysfunction after being hospitalized of 3, 6, and 9 days compared to the baseline LR > 26.1 and NR < 62.0 (b.normal) groups. Severe liver dysfunction only presents significant differences after being adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Consistently, Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that b.LLCHN reflects a better predictive value for different subsequent magnitude liver dysfunctions after admission of 3 and 6 days. To improve liver function in patients with preexisting AST ≥35 U/L, future management strategies should pay more attention to baseline LR ≤ 26.1 and NR ≥ 62.0 patients.","Liu, Fang; Liu, Hong; Yu, Wen-Yan; Liu, Zhan; Zhang, Xia; Wang, Yi; Miao, Liang-Bin; Li, Zhao-Yi; Huang, Jin-Song; Bao, Jian-Feng",Front Immunol,51,17

DESIGN: This study employed realist evaluation principles and was undertaken in three phases: document analysis and qualitative focus groups with widening access (WA) programme architects; focus groups and interviews with staff and students; generation of an idea of what works. SETTING: Participants were recruited from a further/higher education setting and were either enrolled or involved in the delivery of a Gateway to Medicine programme. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve staff were interviewed either individually (n=3) or in one of three group interviews. Nine focus groups (ranging from 5 to 18 participants in each focus group) were carried out with Gateway students from three consecutive cohorts at 2–3 points in their Gateway programme year. RESULTS: Data were generated to determine what ‘works’ in the Gateway programme. Turning a realist lens on the data identified six inter-relating mechanisms which helped students see medicine as attainable and achievable and prepared them for the transition to medical school. These were academic confidence (M1); developing professional identity (M2); financial support/security (M3); supportive relationships with staff (M4) and peers (M5); and establishing a sense of belonging as a university student (M6). CONCLUSIONS: By unpacking the ‘black box’ of a Gateway programme through realist evaluation, we have shown that such programmes are not solely about providing knowledge and skills but are rather much more complex in respect to how they work. Further work is needed to further test the mechanisms identified in our study in other contexts for theory development and to identify predictors of effectiveness in terms of students’ preparedness to transition.","Gibson Smith, Kathrine; Alexander, Kirsty; Cleland, Jennifer",BMJ Open,51,11

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) digital health monitoring platform, HealthPROMISE, leads to better quality of care and improved health outcomes in IBD patients. IBD patients were recruited in gastroenterology clinics and asked to install the HealthPROMISE application onto their smartphones. Patient satisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, patient symptoms, and resource utilization metrics were collected throughout the study and sent directly to their healthcare teams. Patients with abnormal symptom/SIBDQ scores were flagged for their physicians to follow up. After one-year, patient outcome metrics were compared to baseline values. Overall, out of 59 patients enrolled in the study, 32 patients (54%) logged into the application at least once during the study period. The number of IBD-related ER visits/hospitalizations in the year of use compared to the prior year demonstrated a significant decrease from 25% of patients (8/32) to 3% (1/32) (p = 0.03). Patients also reported an increase in their understanding of the nature/causes of their condition after using the application (p = 0.026). No significant changes were observed in the number of quality indicators met (p = 0.67) or in SIBDQ scores (p = 0.48). Given the significant burden of IBD, there is a need to develop effective management strategies. This study demonstrated that digital health monitoring platforms may aid in reducing the number of ER visits and hospitalizations in IBD patients.

RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment advances in complex, IVIG-refractory cases of Kawasaki disease. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a newly reported inflammatory condition with Kawasaki-like features and an association with the 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19). SUMMARY: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease that predominately affects children less than 5 years of age. Pathogenesis of KD remains unknown; the leading theory is that an unknown stimulus triggers an immune-mediated inflammatory cascade in a genetically susceptible child. Classic KD is a clinical diagnosis based on set criteria and excluding other similar clinical entities. Patients who do not fulfill complete diagnostic criteria for KD are often referred to as atypical (or incomplete) KD. The most feared complication of KD is coronary artery abnormality development, and patients with atypical KD are also at risk. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin has greatly reduced the incidence of coronary lesions in affected children. Several other immune-modulating therapies have recently been utilized in complex or refractory cases.","Rife, Eileen; Gedalia, Abraham",Curr Rheumatol Rep,51,12

The aims of our study were to investigate levels of resilience in Italian healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify potential predictors of resilience. Methods: We performed a web-based survey of HCPs (n = 1009) working in Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey contained a 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms. Non-HCP individuals (n = 375) from the general population were used for comparison. Results: HCPs showed significantly lower resilience compared to the control group (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed after stratification for geographical area, work setting, role, or suspected/confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. In a linear regression analysis, RS14 was inversely correlated with depression (R(2) = 0.227, p < 0.001) and anxiety (R(2) = 0.117, p < 0.001) and directly correlated with age (R(2) = 0.012, p < 0.001) but not with body mass index (BMI, R(2) = 0.002, p = 0.213). In male HCPs, higher depression score (odds ratio (OR) 1.147, p < 0.001) or BMI (OR 1.136, p = 0.011) significantly predicted having low resilience. In female HCPs, higher depression score (OR 1.111, p < 0.0001) and working in a COVID-19 free setting (OR 2.308, p = 0.002) significantly predicted having low resilience. HCPs satisfied with personal protective equipment had higher levels of resilience (p < 0.010). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that resilience was lower in Italian HCPs than in the general population after the first COVID-19 wave. Specific factors can be identified, and targeted interventions may have an important role to foster resilience of HCPs.","Lisi, Lucia; Ciaffi, Jacopo; Bruni, Antonella; Mancarella, Luana; Brusi, Veronica; Gramegna, Pasquale; Ripamonti, Claudio; Quaranta, Elisabetta; Borlandelli, Elena; Gallo, Gaetano; Garofalo, Eugenio; Chiaravalloti, Agostino; Viola, Pasquale; Ruscitti, Piero; Caio, Giacomo; D’Onghia, Martina; D’Amuri, Andrea; Cimellaro, Antonio; Facchini, Giancarlo; La Regina, Micaela; Spinardi, Luca; De Giorgio, Roberto; Giacomelli, Roberto; Landini, Maria Paola; Berardi, Domenico; Meliconi, Riccardo; Ursini, Francesco",Behav Sci (Basel),51,20

We observe immune-suppressing activity in both known host-suppressing genes (e.g., NSP1, Orf6, NSP3, and NSP5) as well as other coronavirus genes, including the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 protein. Moreover, the genes encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are generally more potent immune suppressors than their homologues from the other coronaviruses.

It has been accepted by many local and global health authorities as a suitable approach for preventing and responding to infectious disease outbreaks including pandemics. MAIN BODY: One Health (OH) is a multisectoral and interdisciplinary framework for managing the animal, human, and ecosystem determinants of health. Globally, the majority of emerging infections in humans including SARS-Cov2—the causative agent of COVID-19—are transmitted from animals through environmental contacts in the last few decades. Yet, even when the biological and social interactions at the human, animal, and environmental interface that drive spillover of zoonotic diseases have been proven, OH strategies to address associated complex health challenges today are still rudimentary in many national health systems. Despite the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, OH is minimally incorporated into routine disease control and national health security programs. Challenges include poor policy support for OH in sub-Saharan Africa, and where some form of policy framework does exist, there are significant implementation bottlenecks. In this paper, we identified ideological, technical, operational, and economic barriers to OH implementation in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, and highlighted possible recommendations across these domains. In order to yield sustainable benefits, a relevant OH policy approach in the sub-Saharan African health systems must derive from a buy-in of the critical mass of stakeholders in the society. CONCLUSION: The implementation of sustainable OH approaches as a countermeasure to recurring emerging infections is a developmental priority for sub-Saharan African countries. A deep understanding of the local context must be leveraged to develop integrative OH solutions that are bold, rooted in science, and proven to be compatible with the level of development in sub-Saharan Africa.","Ayobami, Olaniyi; Mark, Godwin; Kadri-Alabi, Zaharat; Achi, Chioma Rita; Jacob, Joy Chinwendu",J Egypt Public Health Assoc,51,10

Unavailability of transport facilities led to an inflicted need to walk back to homes barefooted without lack of any other crucial resources on the way. The woeful state of internal migrant workers walking back, with all their stuff on their back, holding their children, was trending on social media worldwide. Their problem continued even after reaching home, including misbehavior of villagers, indifferent mannerism of family members toward them, inability to fulfill family responsibility, and financial crisis, which led to stress, fear, and trauma for these internal migrant workers. The present paper aimed to assess the idiosyncratic stressors of internal migrant workers throughout the pandemic era and their responses toward those problems, which helped them cope with it. In-depth semistructured telephonic interviews were conducted with 25 internal migrant workers who were working in different cities in India before lockdown. The analyses revealed that multiple stressors include financial crisis, unavailability of food, inability to continue education, inability to pay house rent, lack of support from neighbors and family, and other psychological stressors that affected them. However, they also tried multiple strategies to deal with the problems, including a cognitive appraisal of the problem and making oneself psychologically competent to deal with the situation. Social support of family and friends played a vital role in enhancing hardiness and increasing the level of happiness at scarce times. At the same time, some of them could not deal with stressors and opted for psychiatric help to manage the physical symptoms of stress.","Srivastava, Akanksha; Arya, Yogesh Kumar; Joshi, Shobhna; Singh, Tushar; Kaur, Harleen; Chauhan, Himanshu; Das, Abhinav",Front Psychol,51,7

METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020, and May 5, 2020, were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. RESULTS: Sixteen placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were examined (15 with live birth in the third trimester, 1 delivered in the second trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), particularly abnormal or injured maternal vessels, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased. The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of decidual arteriopathy and other features of MVM, a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia.

Data were collected after the enactment of the first emergency regulations (between March 15 and April 1, 2020) via the Qualtrics Survey Software link that was sent out through social media platforms. In total, 205 participants aged 65 to 92 (mean age, 72.32; SD, 5.63) reported general anxiety symptom levels (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), frequency of receptive arts engagement in the previous year, health status, exposure to risk situations, and behavioral changes due to the pandemic. Our hypothesis that receptive arts would moderate the resilience–COVID-19 anxiety link was examined by a multiple hierarchical regression analysis and with the PROCESS computational tool. Findings show that resilience was associated with COVID-19 anxiety and that this association was moderated by levels of receptive arts engagement. The findings show that high levels of prior art engagement constituted a potent buffer against subsequent COVID-19 anxiety. Policy makers may benefit older adults by encouraging their engagement in arts activities, even during social distancing.","Keisari, Shoshi; Hoffman, Yaakov; Ring, Lia; Palgi, Yuval",J Nerv Ment Dis,51,16

Three independent cohorts from two hospitals (50 in discovery and internal validation sets, and 55 in the external validation cohorts) were included, and 12 variables such as symptoms, blood tests, first reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, and chest CT images were collected. An integrated multi-feature model (RT-PCR, CT features, and blood lymphocyte percentage) established with random forest algorism showed the diagnostic accuracy of 92.0% (95% CI: 73.9 - 99.1) in the training set, and 96. 6% (95% CI: 79.6 - 99.9) in the internal validation cohort. The model also performed well in the external validation cohort with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.79 - 1.00), an F1 score of 0.80, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.76.

Such an approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of disease emergence events and also to mitigate future emergence through improved cross-sectoral coordination. In an attempt to provide proof of concept of the utility of the One Health approach, the US Agency for International Development’s PREDICT project consortium designed and implemented a targeted, risk-based surveillance strategy based not on humans as sentinels of disease but on detecting viruses early, at their source, where intervention strategies can be implemented before there is opportunity for spillover and spread in people or food animals. Here, we share One Health approaches used by consortium members to illustrate the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships. PREDICT’s collaboration with partners around the world on strengthening local capacity to detect hundreds of viruses in wild animals, coupled with a series of cutting-edge virological and analytical activities, have significantly improved our baseline knowledge on the zoonotic pool of viruses and the risk of exposure to people. Further testament to the success of the project’s One Health approach and the work of its team of dedicated One Health professionals are the resulting 90 peer-reviewed, scientific publications in under 5 years that improve our understanding of zoonoses and the factors influencing their emergence. The findings are assisting in global health improvements, including surveillance science, diagnostic technologies, understanding of viral evolution, and ecological driver identification. Through its One Health leadership and multi-disciplinary partnerships, PREDICT has forged new networks of professionals from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors to promote global health, improving our understanding of viral disease spillover from wildlife and implementing strategies for preventing and controlling emerging disease threats.","Kelly, Terra R.; Karesh, William B.; Johnson, Christine Kreuder; Gilardi, Kirsten V.K.; Anthony, Simon J.; Goldstein, Tracey; Olson, Sarah H.; Machalaba, Catherine; Mazet, Jonna A.K.",Prev Vet Med,51,24

However, the MFMs lack effective peripheral seal, leading to concerns about their adequacy to block aerosol exposure for proper protection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the peripheral seal of level 3 and level 2 MFMs with a 3-dimensional (3D-) printed custom frame. METHODS: Level 3 and level 2 MFMs were tested on 10 participants with and without a 3D-printed custom frame; the efficiency of mask peripheral seal was determined by means of quantitative fit testing using a PortaCount Fit Tester based on ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter protocol. RESULTS: The 3D-printed custom frame significantly improved the peripheral seal of both level 3 and level 2 MFMs compared with the masks alone (P < .001). In addition, both level 3 and level 2 MFMs with the 3D-printed custom frame met the quantitative fit testing standard specified for N95 respirators. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The 3D-printed custom frame over level 3 and level 2 MFMs can offer enhanced peripheral reduction of aerosols when using collapsible masks. With the shortage of N95 respirators, using the 3D-printed custom frame over a level 3 or level 2 MFM is considered a practical alternative to dental professionals.","Ahmed, Abu; Zhong, Zhe; Suprono, Montry; Savignano, Roberto; Riter, Holli; Oyoyo, Udochukwu; Wilson, Alisa; Reece, Rebecca; Kim, Jessica; Cho, Eun-Hwi; Handysides, Robert; Richardson, Paul; Caruso, Joseph; Li, Yiming",J Am Dent Assoc,51,16

In this review, we discuss what is known about associations between social isolation and Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia. This is particularly relevant in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when social isolation has been enforced with potential emerging negative impacts on cognition. While there are neurobiological mechanisms emerging that may account for the observed epidemiological associations between social isolation and Alzheimer's disease, more fundamental research is needed to fully understand the brain changes induced by isolation that may make people vulnerable to disease.","Drinkwater, Elizabeth; Davies, Caitlin; Spires-Jones, Tara L",Eur. j. neurosci,51,30

Unaddressed burnout in medical training may persist in the internship phase and impact the quality of patient care. While some associations have been established, the link between some individual factors and training characteristics with distress and burnout in medical training remained unclear. In this study, we aim to examine the prevalence of psychological distress and burnout, and its association with gender, training phase, funding status, cumulative grade points average (CGPA), and coping strategies among medical students. The study applied a multicenter cross-sectional study design and convenience sampling on medical students from two medical schools from Malaysia and India. We used a self-reporting instrument that includes demographic details, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief COPE). A total of 748 medical students participated in the study. The prevalence of psychological distress, personal-related, work-related, and patient-related burnout were 33.0%, 56.1%, 35.0%, and 26.2%, respectively. Being male, clinical year, self-funded, and having a CGPA of more than 3.50 predicted psychological distress and burnout with mixed results. Maladaptive coping mechanisms consistently predicted the risk of psychological distress and burnout by more than two times. The findings indicate that primary and secondary mental health interventions have a role in medical training.

Recently developed automated readers for UATs may provide objective results interpretation, especially in cases of weak result bands. Using 53 defined patient urine samples, we evaluated the performance of the BinaxNOW Legionella Antigen Card (Abbott), ImmuView S. pneumoniae and Legionella (SSI Diagnostica), STANDARD F Legionella Ag FIA (SD Biosensor), and Sofia Legionella FIA (Quidel) simultaneously with their respective automated readers. Automatic and visual interpretation of result bands were also compared for the immunochromatography-based BinaxNOW and ImmuView UATs. Overall sensitivity and specificity of Legionella UATs were 53.9–61.5% and 90.0–94.9%, respectively. All four UATs successfully detected all samples from L. pneumophila serogroup 1-positive patients, but most failed to detect samples for Legionella spp., or other serogroups. Automatic results interpretation of results was found to be mostly concordant with visual results reading. In conclusion, the performance of the four UATs were similar to each other in the detection of Legionella urinary antigen with no major difference between automated or visual results reading.","Wong, Alicia Y.

Although assays are designed to detect highly conserved genomic targets, mutations can influence test sensitivity. Most of the circulating viruses in the United States during the 2014–2015 season were associated with significant genetic drift; however, the effect on testing was unknown. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We compared the performance of Prodesse ProFlu+/ProFAST+ (PFlu/PFAST), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP), cobas(®) Influenza A/B test (cIAB), and Xpert(®) Flu (Xpt) in a retrospective analysis of consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens received for a two-week period during the winter of 2015. Furthermore, limits of detection (LOD) were determined with six isolates of Flu. RESULTS: Of the 275 specimens, 63 were positive for FluA by PFAST, 60 were positive by RP, 58 were positive by cIAB and 52 were positive by Xpt. Only a subset of 135 specimens was tested by PFlu, of which 32 were positive. The sensitivity/specificity for PFAST, RP, cIAB, Xpt and PFlu was 100/99.1%, 96.7/99.5%, 91.8/99.1%, 85.2%/100%, and 75.6%/98.9%, respectively. LOD analyses demonstrated assay performance variations were strain associated. Specifically, PFlu’s and cIAB’s LODs were higher with A/Texas/50/2012-like and A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strains, while Xpt’s highest LOD was with the Swiss strain. CONCLUSIONS: Strain-associated assay performance variation is known to occur with other Flu test methods; hence, it is not surprising that such variation would be observed with molecular tests. Careful monitoring and reporting for strain-associated variances are warranted for all test methods.","Stellrecht, Kathleen A.; Nattanmai, Seela M.; Butt, Jumshan; Maceira, Vincente P.; Espino, Alvin A.; Castro, Allan J.; Landes, Allen; Dresser, Nicolas; Butt, Shafiq A.",J Clin Virol,51,1

Quantile regression is employed to examine the heterogeneous relationship at different distributions of stock returns. The study documents evidence to support a negative relationship between the oil implied volatility shocks and stock returns in the selected stock markets, especially in downturns. Findings from this study also reveal that the oil implied volatility shocks can asymmetrically influence Africa's stocks. Specifically, our empirical evidence reveals that positive shocks in the oil implied volatility index play a key role in most of Africa's stock markets in market downturns while negative shocks play a moderate role during benign market conditions in some of Africa's stock markets during the pandemic. More importantly, our findings divulge that investors can find an invaluable shelter with a portfolio of the selected African stocks and oil market securities in the time of the pandemic.

Great confidence in returning to normality has been placed in the vaccination campaign. The knowledge of individual immune profiles and the time required to achieve immunological protection is crucial to choose the best vaccination strategy. We compared anti-S1 antibody levels produced over time by BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines and evaluated the induction of antigen-specific T-cells. A total of 2569 anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG determination on dried blood spot samples were carried out, firstly in a cohort of 1181 individuals at random time-points, and subsequently, in an independent cohort of 88 vaccinated subjects, up to the seventeenth week from the first dose administration. Spike-specific T-cells were analysed in seronegative subjects between the two doses. AZD1222 induced lower anti-S1 IgG levels as compared to BNT162b2. Moreover, 40% of AZD1222 vaccinated subjects and 3% of BNT162b2 individuals resulted in seronegative during all the time-points, between the two doses. All these subjects developed antigen-specific T cells, already after the first dose. These results suggest that this test represents an excellent tool for a wide sero-surveillance. Both vaccines induce a favourable immune profile guaranteeing efficacy against severe adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, already after the first dose administration.","Lanuti, Paola; Rossi, Claudia; Cicalini, Ilaria; Pierdomenico, Laura; Damiani, Verena; Semeraro, Daniela; Verrocchio, Sara; Del Boccio, Piero; Evangelista, Adelia; Sarra, Annalina; Zucchelli, Mirco; Bologna, Giuseppina; Simeone, Pasquale; Catitti, Giulia; Di Marco, Federica; Stefanetti, Simone; Vespa, Simone; Sinjari, Bruna; Bucci, Ines; De Laurenzi, Vincenzo; Di Battista, Tonio; Stuppia, Liborio; Pieragostino, Damiana",Biomedicines,51,16

Lack of laboratory infrastructure and laboratory personnel trained in diagnostic mycology hamper prompt detection and management of IFIs on the continent. Point-of-care tests (POCT) obviate the need for complex infrastructure, skilled technicians, and stable electricity and have had major impacts on the diagnosis of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections in low- and middle-income countries. Over the last 10 years, POCTs for IFIs have become increasingly available and they have the potential to revolutionize the management of these infections if scaled up in Africa. At the beginning of 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Diagnostic List (EDL) included a cryptococcal antigen test for the diagnosis of cryptococcosis, Histoplasma antigen test for the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis, and Aspergillus-specific test for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. All of these are available in formats that may be used as POCTs and it is hoped that this will improve the diagnosis of these life-threatening IFIs, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This perspective review discusses commercially available POCTs and outlines strategies of a blueprint to achieve their roll-out in Africa. The strategies include raising awareness, conducting research that uncovers the exact burden of IFIs, increasing advocacy, integrating diagnosis of IFIs into existing public health programs, adoption of the WHO EDL at country levels, and improving logistics and supply chains.","Osaigbovo, Iriagbonse Iyabo; Bongomin, Felix",Ther Adv Infect Dis,51,24

However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: −7.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean ± 1.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic.

Methods: The study used data from an online cross-sectional survey that was conducted in Saudi Arabia between 8 December 2020 and 14 December 2020. This study employed bivariate and multivariable regression analyses. The bivariate was used to describe and tabulate the frequency of all the variables, including the sociodemographic characteristics, the risk perception and the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination and a chi-squared test of independence was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the factors associated with an intention to have the COVID-19 vaccination and the factors associated with its immediate acceptance. Results: Of the total of 736 healthcare workers who began the online questionnaire, 673 completed it (a 91.44% completion rate). Among the study participants, 50.52% were willing to have the COVID-19 vaccine, of which 49.71% intended to have the vaccine as soon as it becomes available in the country, while 50.29% would delay until the vaccine's safety is confirmed. Being a male healthcare worker, perceiving a high risk of infection, and believing that the COVID-19 vaccine should be compulsory for all citizens and residents in the country increased the probability of intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 and the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible.

Efforts to strengthen primary care must be informed by understanding of current practice. We conducted a time motion assessment in primary care facilities in Lima with the goals of assessing the feasibility of this method in an urban health care setting in Latin America and of providing policy makers with empirical evidence on the use of health care provider time in primary care. METHODS: This cross-sectional continuous observation time motion study took place from July – September 2019. We used two-stage sampling to draw a sample of shifts for doctors, nurses, and midwives in primary health facilities and applied the Work Observation Method by Activity Timing tool to capture type and duration of provider activities over a 6-h shift. We summarized time spent on patient care, paper and electronic record-keeping, and non-work (personal and inactive) activities across provider cadres. Observations are weighted by inverse probability of selection. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five providers were sampled from 60 facilities; 20% could not be observed due to provider absence (2% schedule error, 8% schedule change, 10% failure to appear). One hundred seventy-four of the 220 identified providers consented (79.1%) and were observed for a total of 898 h of provider time comprising 30,312 unique tasks. Outpatient shifts included substantial time on patient interaction (110, 82, and 130 min for doctors, nurses, and midwives respectively) and on paper records (132, 97, and 141 min) on average. Across all shifts, 1 in 6 h was spent inactive or on personal activities. Two thirds of midwives used computers compared to half of nurses and one third of doctors. CONCLUSIONS: The time motion study is a feasible method to capture primary care operations in Latin American countries and inform health system strengthening. In the case of Lima, absenteeism undermines health worker availability in primary care facilities, and inactive time further erodes health workforce availability. Productive time is divided between patient-facing activities and a substantial burden of paper-based record keeping for clinical and administrative purposes.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed 7 weeks after the confirmation of the first case of Covid-19 by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education in Iran. Data were completed online using a researcher-made questionnaire, the validity and reliability of which were confirmed, for 1,200 Iranians from 8 April 2020 to 9 May 2020. Results: The mean age of study participants was 37.77 ± 11.20 years. The mean score of preventive behaviors was 62.67 ± 8.53. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between the variables of gender, education, economic status, and preventive behaviors of COVID-19. The highest frequency is related to not using hookah and cigarettes and then avoiding losing and rubbing (78%) and the lowest percentage is related to exercising behavior (16%). Conclusion: Due to the low level of prevention behaviors during the outbreak of the disease, it is important to design educational and supportive interventions to improve and perform coronavirus prevention behaviors with more focus on men, illiterate people, and poor economic status.","Baghernezhad Hesary, Fatemeh; Salehiniya, Hamid; Miri, Mohammadreza; Moodi, Mitra",Front Public Health,51,22

In today’s world, dogs are an integral part of our communities as well as dogs breeding and rearing has become a lucrative business. Therefore, a fast, accurate, portable, and cost-effective CPV-2 detection method with the ability for on-site detection is highly desired. In this study, we for the first time proposed a nanosystem for CPV-2 DNA detection with RNA-guided RNA endonuclease Cas13a, which upon activation results in collateral RNA degradation. We expressed LwCas13a in prokaryotic expression system and purified it through nickel column. Activity of Cas13a was verified by RNA-bound fluorescent group while using a quenched fluorescent probe as signals. Further Cas13a was combined with Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and T7 transcription to establish molecular detection system termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter un-locking (SHERLOCK) for sensitive detection of CPV-2 DNA. This nanosystem can detect 100 amol/L CPV-2 DNA within 30 min. The proposed nanosystem exhibited high specificity when tested for CPV-2 and other dog viruses. This CRISPR-Cas13a mediated sensitive detection approach can be of formidable advantage during CPV-2 outbreaks because it is time-efficient, less laborious and does not involve the use of sophisticated instruments.","Khan, Haroon; Khan, Adeel; Liu, Yufeng; Wang, Su; Bibi, Sumaira; Xu, Hongpan; Liu, Yuan; Durrani, Samran; Jin, Lian; He, Nongyue; Xiong, Tao",Chin Chem Lett,51,20

Here, we characterize change in neuro-ophthalmic care delivery during the early COVID-19 PHE, including a comparison of care delivered via telemedicine and in office. METHODS: Neuro-ophthalmology outpatient encounters from 3 practices in the United States (4 providers) were studied during the early COVID-19 PHE (March 15, 2020-June 15, 2020) and during the same dates 1 year prior. For unique patient visits, patient demographics, visit types, visit format, and diagnosis were compared between years and between synchronous telehealth and in-office formats for 2020. RESULTS: There were 1,276 encounters for 1,167 patients. There were 30% fewer unique patient visits in 2020 vs 2019 (477 vs 670) and 55% fewer in-office visits (299 vs 670). Compared with 2019, encounters in 2020 were more likely to be established, to occur via telemedicine and to relate to an efferent diagnosis. In 2020, synchronous telehealth visits were more likely to be established compared with in-office encounters. CONCLUSIONS: In the practices studied, a lower volume of neuro-ophthalmic care was delivered during the early COVID-19 public health emergency than in the same period in 2019. The type of care shifted toward established patients with efferent diagnoses and the modality of care shifted toward telemedicine.","Moss, Heather E; Ko, Melissa W; Mackay, Devin D; Chauhan, Divya; Gutierrez, Karen G; Villegas, Natacha C; Lai, Kevin E",J Neuroophthalmol,51,33

To that end, this Review highlights research opportunities afforded by studying dogs with spontaneous OA, with a view to sharing this active area of veterinary research with new audiences. Similarities and differences between dog and human OA are examined, and the proposition is made that suitably aligned studies of spontaneous OA in dogs and humans, in particular hip and knee OA, could highlight new avenues of discovery. Developing cross-species collaborations will provide a wealth of research material and knowledge that is relevant to human OA and that cannot currently be obtained from rodent models or experimentally induced dog models of OA. Ultimately, this Review aims to raise awareness of spontaneous dog OA and to stimulate discussion regarding its exploration under the One Medicine initiative to improve the health and well-being of both species.","Meeson, Richard L.; Todhunter, Rory J.; Blunn, Gordon; Nuki, George; Pitsillides, Andrew A.",Nat Rev Rheumatol,51,20

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze intermediate-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuroradiological emergency consultations (NECs). METHODS: We conducted an ambispective study on NEC requests to a university hospital from a teleradiological network covering 13 hospitals in Germany. Weekly NEC rates for prepandemic calendar weeks (CW) 01/2019–09/2020 were compared with rates during first COVID-19 wave (CW 10–20/2020), first loosening of restrictions (CW 21–29/2020), intensified COVID-19 testing (CW 30–39/2020) and second COVID-19 wave (CW 40–53/2020), and contrasted with COVID-19 incidence in Germany. RESULTS: A total of n = 10 810 NECs were analyzed. Prepandemic NEC rates were stable over time (median: 103, IQR: 97–115). Upon the first COVID-19 wave in Germany, NEC rates declined sharply (median: 86, IQR: 69–92; p < 0.001) but recovered within weeks. Changes in NEC rates after first loosening of restrictions (median: 109, IQR: 98–127; p = 0. 188), a phase of intensified testing (median: 111, IQR: 101–114; p = 0.434) and as of a second COVID-19 wave (median: 102, IQR: 94–112; p = 0. 462) were not significant. Likewise, patient age and gender distribution remained constant. CONCLUSION: Upon the first pandemic COVID-19 wave in Germany, NEC rates declined but recovered within weeks.

In this study, 8 pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 who were admitted into Wuhan Children’s Hospital, China from February 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020 and the clinical features, laboratory data, maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. The mean age of the women at the time of admission was 30.6 years. The mean gestational age of the women was 37 weeks+4 days, and one woman presented with dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy. Except for one woman who was febrile, others had no typical clinical symptoms. For all pregnant women, the count of white blood cells and lymphocytes appeared normal, but 6 had a lower percentage of lymphocytes. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal for all the women. One neonate was tested positive for the coronavirus IgG and IgM antibodies. The clinical symptoms of the pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 were mild, and the laboratory data showed similar characteristics to those of non-infected pregnant women. Since one neonate was tested positive for coronavirus, there is a possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Conditions and structures of caring for people with dementia differ widely, depending on the country and the care context. Our study aimed to describe the experiences and opinions of nursing experts and managers with regard to facilitators and barriers to the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using individual interviews based on qualitative vignettes as a useful stimulus to generate narrations allowing to study peoples’ perceptions and beliefs. The study took place in nursing homes in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein using purposive sampling. We intended to conduct the interviews face-to-face in a quiet room according to the participant’s choice. However, due to the lockdown of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, we performed interviews face-to-face and by video. We analysed data thematically following Braun and Clarke to achieve a detailed, nuanced description. To verify our interpretation and to ensure congruence with participants’ perspectives, we conducted member checks. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) served to structure our manuscript. RESULTS: Six dyads of nursing home managers and nursing experts from six nursing homes took part in our study (n = 12). Our thematic analysis yielded seven themes reflecting facilitators and barriers to implementing nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care: «A common attitude and cohesion within the organization», «Commitment on several levels», «A needs-oriented implementation», «The effect and the public perception of the intervention», «A structured and guided implementation process», «Supporting knowledge and competencies», as well as «Resources for implementing the intervention». CONCLUSIONS: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, active commitment-building seems essential. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible.Commitment-building is the precondition to reach the persons involved, such as nursing home managers, nursing staff, residents and relatives. Furthermore, nurses should precisely inform about the intervention. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible. In addition, nurses should adjust the interventions to the situational needs of people with dementia, thus. Therefore, it is important to support dementia-specific competencies in long-term care. Findings indicate that the barrier is determined by the intervention and its implementation – and not by the behaviour of the person with dementia.

The proposed model adequately describes the development of the coronavirus epidemic with insufficient adherence to quarantine and social distancing. The transition from the absolute number of infected persons to their relative number per inhabitant of a settlement makes it possible to obtain universal calculation ratios. In performing the calculations, the choice of the date of the beginning of the epidemic is of great importance. Recommendations are given on how to determine the date of the beginning of the epidemic based on the analysis of statistical data on the spread of the epidemic. The coefficient of virus transmission rate k included in the calculated prognostic relation depends on the population size and the type of virus strain in the settlement in question. A simple ratio for calculating this coefficient as a function of population size is proposed. Control calculations performed using only a single empirical coefficient showed high accuracy. The calculated curves for Germany, Berlin, and its districts agree well with the corresponding statistical data. The correlation coefficients between the corresponding curves reach values of 0.93 to 0.97. The further development of the model should thus go in the direction of identifying causal links between the intensity of the epidemic and the main factors affecting this process. Some of these factors are related to the characteristics of the population's behaviour and the infrastructure of cities. The increase in the incidence in areas with a large percentage of the population rooted in Islamic countries is one of the main factors determining the development of the epidemic in Berlin. In order to explain and clarify this conclusion, it is necessary to make further assumptions about the possible emergence of a new strain of coronavirus in Berlin and in Germany and, accordingly, about the possibility of new epidemic waves. A preliminary ratio for predicting the spread of the epidemic under conditions of simultaneous existence of both strains of coronavirus is given. Simplicity of the proposed prognostic method and high accuracy of the results allow to recommend it as an effective tool for operative analysis of various measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19 epidemic including mass vaccination of population.","Below, D.; Mairanowski, J.; Mairanowski, F.",,51,26

This study’s objective was to devise a method for measuring the prevalence of mask-wearing and proper mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14−20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The average mask use prevalence among observed visitors of the 382 visited public areas was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 17% of the public areas, at least one unmasked visitor was among the observed visitors; in 48%, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed. The average mask use among staff was 92%, but unmasked staff were observed in fewer public areas, as an unmasked staff member was observed in 11% of the visited public areas. The average prevalence of proper make use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33.

Abstract During a pandemic, the three basic principles are; to prioritise medical resources, ensure patient lockdown in order to avoid community transmission and prevent healthcare collapse, and keep the number of visits to an absolute minimum to avoid patient exposure and safeguard healthcare workers. Antenatal care must be maintained during a health crisis, regardless of the COVID-19 state of alert. Routine and specialist obstetric ultrasound scans are essential for clinical decision-making during pregnancy, as it has a direct impact on the management of mothers and the foetuses and on the perinatal outcome. In an attempt to minimise in-person visits, these will be organised according to the established ultrasound schedule.

This study explores how school closure influences parents’ work style based on short panel data for the period of school closure from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Specifically, we analyze how the presence of their children influences parents’ work at home and examine how the effect differs by the parent’s gender. After controlling for various factors, we find that in cases where parents are full-time employees and the children are: (1) in primary school, mothers are more likely to work remotely, while fathers are less likely to do so and (2) in junior high school, the parents’ work styles are hardly affected. This shows that mothers shoulder the burden of working remotely and caring for small children at home, while fathers tend to work in the office and spend less time with their childcare at home. Inevitably, COVID-19 has increased the inequality in the burden of child care.","Yamamura, Eiji; Tsustsui, Yoshiro",Rev Econ Househ,51,20

In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for [Formula: see text]. By using available data, the model is validated and parameter values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of [Formula: see text] to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play the major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.","Kassa, Semu M.; Njagarah, John B.H.; Terefe, Yibeltal A.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,51,20

Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHOD: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. FINDINGS: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5 % of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that diabetes is a risk factor – and contributes to the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. This paper also provides recommendations and guidelines for which could be useful for prevention and treatment of diabetic patients affected by COVID-19.","Abdi, Alireza; Jalilian, Milad; Ahmadi Sarbarzeh, Pegah; Vlaisavljevic, Zeljko",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,51,1

But, its growth and production are significantly hampered by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) which causes leaf blight disease. Earlier studies have reported the antibacterial ability of FDA-approved niclosamide drug against Xoo. However, the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide blocks the growth of Xoo remained elusive. In the present study, by employing the microbiological, microscopical, molecular, bioinformatics and analytical tools we found that niclosamide can directly inhibit the growth of the Xoo by hampering the biofilm formation and the production of xanthomonadin and exopolysaccharide substances (EPS) required for relentless growth and virulence of Xoo. Interestingly, niclosamide was found to specifically suppress the growth of Xoo without affecting other bacteria like Escherichia coli. Our electron microscopic observations disclosed that niclosamide disrupts the membrane permeability of Xoo and causes the release of intracellular components. Similarly, the molecular docking analysis disclosed the molecular interaction of niclosamide with the biofilm, virulence and quorum sensing related proteins, which was further substantiated by relative gene expression analysis where niclosamide was found to significantly downregulate the expression of these key regulatory genes. In addition, considerable changes in chemical structures were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in response to niclosamide treatment. Overall, our findings advocate the utilization of niclosamide as a safe and potent alternative antibacterial compound to control bacterial blight disease in rice.","Sahu, Sunil Kumar; Zheng, Ping; Yao, Nan",Front Plant Sci,51,16

PURPOSE: To establish if complementary CT chest was performed as recommended, and if CT chest influenced surgical intervention decision. To assess detection rate of COVID-19 on CT and its correlation with RT-PCR swab results. To determine if COVID-19 changes is reliably detected within the lung bases which are usually imaged in standard abdominal CT. METHODS: Patients with acute abdominal symptoms presenting to a single institution between 1st and 30th April 2020 who had abdominal CT and complementary CT chest were retrospectively extracted from Computerised Radiology Information System. CT COVID-19 changes were categorised according to British Society of Thoracic Radiology reporting guidance. Patient demographics (age and gender), RT-PCR swab results and management pathway (conservative or intervention) were recorded from electronic patient records. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate any significant association between variables. p values ≤0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: Compliancy rate in performing complementary CT chest was 92.5% (148/160). Thirty-five patients (35/148,23.6%) underwent intervention during admission. There was no significant association (p = 0.9085) between acquisition of CT chest and management pathway (conservative vs intervention). CT chest had 57% sensitivity (CI 18.41% to 90.1%) and 100% specificity (CI 92% to 100%) in COVID-19 diagnosis. Three of ten patients who had classic COVID-19 changes on CT chest did not have corresponding changes in lung bases. CONCLUSION: Compliance with performing complementary CT chest in acute abdomen patients for COVID-19 screening was high and it did not influence subsequent surgical or interventional management.","Ooi, M.W.X.; Liong, S.Y.; Baguley, N.; Sharman, A.; Tuck, J.",Clin Imaging,51,22

So far, there is no approved treatment available to control this public health issue; however, a few antiviral agents and repurposed drugs support the patients under medical supervision by compromising their adverse effects, especially in emergency conditions. Only a few vaccines have been approved to date. In this context, several plant natural products‐based research studies are evidenced to play a crucial role in immunomodulation that can prevent the chances of infection as well as combat the cytokine release storm (CRS) generated during COVID‐19 infection. In this present review, we have focused on flavonoids, especially epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, hesperidin, naringenin, quercetin, rutin, luteolin, baicalin, diosmin, ge nistein, biochanin A, and silymarin, which can counteract the virus‐mediated elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines leading to multiple organ failure.

Whether cancers avoid poisoning from oxidized nucleotides by preventing incorporation via the oxidized purine diphosphatase MTH1 remains under debate. Also, little is known about DNA polymerases incorporating oxidized nucleotides in cells or how oxidized nucleotides in DNA become toxic. Here we show that replacement of one of the main DNA replicases in human cells, DNA polymerase delta (Pol Î´), with an error-prone variant allows increased 8-oxodG accumulation into DNA following treatment with TH588, a dual MTH1 inhibitor and microtubule targeting agent. The resulting elevated genomic 8-oxodG correlated with increased cytotoxicity of TH588. Interestingly, no substantial perturbation of replication fork progression was observed, but rather mitotic progression was impaired and mitotic DNA synthesis triggered. Reducing mitotic arrest by reversin treatment prevented accumulation of genomic 8-oxodG and reduced cytotoxicity of TH588, in line with the notion that mitotic arrest is required for ROS buildup and oxidation of the nucleotide pool. Furthermore, delayed mitosis and increased mitotic cell death was observed following TH588 treatment in cells expressing the error-prone but not wild-type Pol Î´ variant, which is not observed following treatments with antimitotic agents. Collectively, these results link accumulation of genomic oxidized nucleotides with disturbed mitotic progression. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings uncover a novel link between accumulation of genomic 8-oxodG and perturbed mitotic progression in cancer cells, which can be exploited therapeutically using MTH1 inhibitors.See related commentary by Alnajjar and Sweasy, p. 3459.","Rudd, Sean G; Gad, Helge; Sanjiv, Kumar; Amaral, Nuno; Hagenkort, Anna; Groth, Petra; Ström, Cecilia E; Mortusewicz, Oliver; Berglund, Ulrika Warpman; Helleday, Thomas",Cancer Res,51,8

COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is fundamentally different from that of other vaccines due to the new technologies being used, rapid development, and widespread global distribution. Attitudes on vaccines are largely driven by online information, particularly information on social media. The first step toward influencing attitudes about immunization is understanding the current patterns of communication that characterize the immunization debate on social media platforms. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate societal attitudes, communication trends, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake through social media content analysis to inform communication strategies promoting vaccine acceptance. METHODS: Social network analysis (SNA) and unsupervised machine learning were used to characterize COVID-19 vaccine content on Twitter globally. Tweets published in English and French were collected through the Twitter application programming interface between November 19 and 26, 2020, just following the announcement of initial COVID-19 vaccine trials. SNA was used to identify social media clusters expressing mistrustful opinions on COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the SNA results, an unsupervised machine learning approach to natural language processing using a sentence-level algorithm transfer function to detect semantic textual similarity was performed in order to identify the main themes of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: The tweets (n=636,516) identified that the main themes driving the vaccine hesitancy conversation were concerns of safety, efficacy, and freedom, and mistrust in institutions (either the government or multinational corporations). A main theme was the safety and efficacy of mRNA technology and side effects. The conversation around efficacy was that vaccines were unlikely to completely rid the population of COVID-19, polymerase chain reaction testing is flawed, and there is no indication of long-term T-cell immunity for COVID-19. Nearly one-third (45,628/146,191, 31.2%) of the conversations on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy clusters expressed concerns for freedom or mistrust of institutions (either the government or multinational corporations) and nearly a quarter (34,756/146,191, 23.8%) expressed criticism toward the government’s handling of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Social media content analysis combined with social network analysis provides insights into the themes of the vaccination conversation on Twitter. The themes of safety, efficacy, and trust in institutions will need to be considered, as targeted outreach programs and intervention strategies are deployed on Twitter to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.","Boucher, Jean-Christophe; Cornelson, Kirsten; Benham, Jamie L; Fullerton, Madison M; Tang, Theresa; Constantinescu, Cora; Mourali, Mehdi; Oxoby, Robert J; Marshall, Deborah A; Hemmati, Hadi; Badami, Abbas; Hu, Jia; Lang, Raynell",JMIR Infodemiology,51,16

We identified several ‘‘enabling pairs’’ of neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies, whose combination exhibited new functional profiles, including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer. Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2G4 or m8C4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody FVM09 (IC(50) >1 mM) to exhibit potent neutralization (IC(50) 1–10 nM). While FVM09 or m8C4 alone failed to protect Ebola-virus-infected mice, a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection. Furthermore, non-neutralizers FVM09 and FVM02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neu-tralizing antibodies against both Ebola and Sudan viruses. We identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and GP2. Enabling cooperativity may be an underappreciated phenomenon for viruses, with implications for the design and development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines.","Howell, Katie A.; Brannan, Jennifer M.; Bryan, Christopher; McNeal, Andrew; Davidson, Edgar; Turner, Hannah L.; Vu, Hong; Shulenin, Sergey; He, Shihua; Kuehne, Ana; Herbert, Andrew S.; Qiu, Xiangguo; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Holtsberg, Frederick W.; Ward, Andrew B.; Dye, John M.; Aman, M.

However, evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating long-term impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial. UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a living systematic review (LSR) of these projects. Methods: In-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa. Results: The limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United States-based funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data that has not been made publicly available. Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and five particular gaps in research funding were identified, namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans. Conclusions: We found significantly lower funding investments in COVID-19 research in Africa compared to high-income countries, seven months into the pandemic, indicating a paucity of research targeting the research priorities of relevance to Africa.","Antonio, Emilia; Alobo, Moses; Tufet Bayona, Marta; Marsh, Kevin; Norton, Alice",AAS Open Res,51,18

Methods: In this retrospective study, all cases were selected from Northwestern China, which has the lowest population density. As our study endpoints, the incubation period was defined as the date of departure from Wuhan City to the date of symptom onset; we defined the confirmed time as the interval from symptom onset to positive results (samples from the respiratory tract). Both of them were estimated by fitting a Weibull distribution on the departure date and symptom onset. The differences among the variables were analyzed. Results: A total of 139 patients were ultimately enrolled, and ~10.1% of patients (14 patients) had no symptoms during their disease course. We estimated the median incubation period to be 4.0 days (interquartile intervals, 2.0–8.0), and the 95th percentile of the distribution was 15.0 days. Moreover, ~5.6% of patients (7 patients) experienced symptoms 2 weeks after leaving. Furthermore, the estimation median interval from symptom onset to final diagnosis was 4.0 days (interquartile intervals, 2.0–6.0), and the 95th percentile of the distribution was 12.0 days. Finally, the median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 3.0 to 45.0 days. Univariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.021) and severity status (P = 0.001) were correlated significantly with hospitalization time. Conclusions: We provide evidence that departure time can be used to estimate the incubation and confirmed times of patients infected with COVID-19 when they leave an epidemic area.","Zhang, Qingqing; Zhu, Jianfei; Jia, Chenghui; Xu, Shuonan; Jiang, Tao; Wang, Shengyu",Front Med (Lausanne),51,32

METHODS: We retrospectively included 104 IPF patients and 52 controls who underwent baseline chest CT scans. Normal lungs below − 500 HU were segmented, and the boundary was three-dimensionally reconstructed using in-house software. Gaussian curvature analysis provided histogram features on the heterogeneity of the fibrosis boundary. We analyzed the correlations between histogram features and the gender-age-physiology (GAP) and CT fibrosis scores. We built a regression model to predict diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) using the histogram features and calculated the modified GAP (mGAP) score by replacing DLCO with the predicted DLCO. The performances of the GAP, CT-GAP, and mGAP scores were compared using 100 repeated random-split sets. RESULTS: Patients with moderate-to-severe IPF had more numerous Gaussian curvatures at the fibrosis boundary, lower uniformity, and lower 10th to 30th percentiles of Gaussian curvature than controls or patients with mild IPF (all p < 0.0033). The 20th percentile was most significantly correlated with the GAP score (r = − 0.357; p < 0.001) and the CT fibrosis score (r = − 0.343; p = 0.001). More numerous Gaussian curvatures, higher entropy, lower uniformity, and 10th to 30th percentiles (p < 0.001–0.041) were associated with mortality. The mGAP score was comparable to the GAP and CT-GAP scores for survival prediction (mean C-indices, 0.76 vs. 0.79 vs. 0.77, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Gaussian curvatures of fibrosis boundaries became more heterogeneous as the disease progressed, and heterogeneity was negatively associated with survival in IPF. KEY POINTS: • Gaussian curvature of the fibrotic lung boundary was more heterogeneous in patients with moderate-to-severe IPF than those with mild IPF or normal controls. • The 20th percentile of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary was linearly correlated with the GAP score and the CT fibrosis score. • A modified GAP score that replaced the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide with a composite measure using histogram features of the Gaussian curvature of the fibrosis boundary showed a comparable ability to predict survival to both the GAP and the CT-GAP score.

Overall, one out of two participants reported having to delay seeking needed help from a GP or a specialist for themselves, as well as for their relatives with dementia, during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Among the predisposing factor, education was associated with caregivers’ reports regarding forgone care for themselves as well as for their loved ones. Living with the care-receiver and income level were the enabling factors associated with forgone care for caregivers. Finally, feelings of burden were associated with caregivers’ forgone care and feelings of loneliness and perceptions of the care-receiver’s cognitive functioning were associated with care-receivers’ forgone care. Our findings show that it is essential that this population receive appropriate practical and emotional support at times of distress and crisis to enable them to continue with their caregiving role.","Werner, Perla; Tur-Sinai, Aviad; AboJabel, Hanan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,51,16

Relative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, has genomic organization, which is very similar. In this article, the function and structure of the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are described in great detail. The nsps are expressed as a single or two polyproteins, which are then cleaved into individual proteins using two proteases of the virus, a chymotrypsin-like protease and a papain-like protease. The released proteins serve as centers of virus replication and transcription. Some of these nsps modulate the host’s translation and immune systems, while others help the virus evade the host immune system. Some of the nsps help form replication-transcription complex at double-membrane vesicles. Others, including one RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and one exonuclease, help in the polymerization of newly synthesized RNA of the virus and help minimize the mutation rate by proofreading. After synthesis of the viral RNA, it gets capped. The capping consists of adding GMP and a methylation mark, called cap 0 and additionally adding a methyl group to the terminal ribose called cap1. Capping is accomplished with the help of a helicase, which also helps remove a phosphate, two methyltransferases, and a scaffolding factor. Among the structural proteins, S protein forms the receptor of the virus, which latches on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor of the host and N protein binds and protects the genomic RNA of the virus. The accessory proteins found in these viruses are small proteins with immune modulatory roles. Besides functions of these proteins, solved X-ray and cryogenic electron microscopy structures related to the function of the proteins along with comparisons to other coronavirus homologs have been described in the article. Finally, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 residues of the proteome during the 2020 pandemic has been described. Some proteins are mutated more often than other proteins, but the significance of these mutation rates is not fully understood.","Gorkhali, Ritesh; Koirala, Prashanna; Rijal, Sadikshya; Mainali, Ashmita; Baral, Adesh; Bhattarai, Hitesh Kumar",Bioinform Biol Insights,51,26

Here, we describe how a national network of acoustic tracking receivers can be leveraged to assess the effects of human activity on animal movement and space use during such global disruptions. We outline variation in restrictions on human activity across Australian states and describe four mechanisms affecting human interactions with the marine environment: 1) reduction in economy and trade changing shipping traffic; 2) changes in export markets affecting commercial fisheries; 3) alterations in recreational activities; and 4) decline in tourism. We develop a roadmap for the analysis of acoustic tracking data across various scales using Australia's national Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Facility as a case study. We illustrate the benefit of sustained observing systems and monitoring programs by assessing how a 51-day break in white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) cage-diving tourism due to COVID-19 restrictions affected the behaviour and space use of two resident species. This cessation of tourism activities represents the longest break since cage-diving vessels started day trips in this area in 2007. Long-term monitoring of the local environment reveals that the activity space of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) was reduced when cage-diving boats were absent compared to periods following standard tourism operations. However, white shark residency and movements were not affected. Our roadmap is globally applicable and will assist researchers in designing studies to assess how anthropogenic activities can impact animal movement and distributions during regional, short-term through to major, unexpected disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Huveneers, Charlie; Jaine, Fabrice R.A.; Barnett, Adam; Butcher, Paul A.; Clarke, Thomas M.; Currey-Randall, Leanne M.; Dwyer, Ross G.; Ferreira, Luciana C.; Gleiss, Adrian C.; Hoenner, Xavier; Ierodiaconou, Daniel; Lédée, Elodie J.I.; Meekan, Mark G.; Pederson, Hugh; Rizzari, Justin R.; van Ruth, Paul D.; Semmens, Jayson M.; Taylor, Matthew D.; Udyawer, Vinay; Walsh, Peter; Heupel, Michelle R.; Harcourt, Robert",Biol Conserv,51,20

As conventional CSF testing suffers from suboptimal sensitivity, this review aimed to evaluate the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the work-up of infectious, neoplastic, neuroimmunological, and neurodegenerative CNS diseases. Metagenomic NGS showed improved sensitivity—compared to traditional methods—to detect bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections, while the overall performance was maximized in some studies when all diagnostic modalities were used. In patients with primary CNS cancer, NGS findings in the CSF were largely concordant with the molecular signatures derived from tissue-based molecular analysis; of interest, additional mutations were identified in the CSF in some glioma studies, reflecting intratumoral heterogeneity. In patients with metastasis to the CNS, NGS facilitated diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic management, and monitoring, exhibiting higher sensitivity than neuroimaging, cytology, and plasma-based molecular analysis. Although evidence is still rudimentary, NGS could enhance the diagnosis and pathogenetic understanding of multiple sclerosis in addition to Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. To conclude, NGS has shown potential to aid the research, facilitate the diagnostic approach, and improve the management outcomes of all the aforementioned CNS diseases. However, to establish its role in clinical practice, the clinical validity and utility of each NGS protocol should be determined. Lastly, as most evidence has been derived from small and retrospective studies, results from randomized control trials could be of significant value.","Tsamis, Konstantinos I.; Sakkas, Hercules; Giannakis, Alexandros; Ryu, Han Suk; Gartzonika, Constantina; Nikas, Ilias P.",Mol Diagn Ther,51,1

Our aim was to demonstrate the endogenous presence of the putative ACE2 product [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) in human cardiovascular tissues and to confirm it retains significant biological activity for the apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. The minimum active apelin fragment was also investigated. Methods and Results: [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 incubated with recombinant human ACE2 resulted in de novo generation of [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) identified by mass spectrometry. Endogenous [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) was detected by immunostaining in human heart and lung localized to the endothelium. Expression was undetectable in lung from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In human heart [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) (pK(i) = 8.04 ± 0.06) and apelin-13(F13A) (pK(i) = 8.07 ± 0.24) competed with [(125)I]apelin-13 binding with nanomolar affinity, 4-fold lower than for [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 (pK(i) = 8.83 ± 0.06) whereas apelin-17 exhibited highest affinity (pK(i) = 9.63 ± 0.17). The rank order of potency of peptides to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP was apelin-17 (pD(2) = 10.31 ± 0.28) > [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 (pD(2) = 9.67 ± 0.04) ≥ apelin-13(F13A) (pD(2) = 9.54 ± 0.05) > [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) (pD(2) = 9.30 ± 0.06). The truncated peptide apelin-13(R10M) retained nanomolar potency (pD(2) = 8.70 ± 0.04) but shorter fragments exhibited low micromolar potency. In a β-arrestin recruitment assay the rank order of potency was apelin-17 (pD(2) = 10.26 ± 0.09) >> [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 (pD(2) = 8.43 ± 0.08) > apelin-13(R10M) (pD(2) = 8.26 ± 0.17) > apelin-13(F13A) (pD(2) = 7.98 ± 0.04) ≥ [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) (pD(2) = 7.84 ± 0.06) >> shorter fragments (pD(2) < 6). [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) and apelin-13(F13A) contracted human saphenous vein with similar sub-nanomolar potencies and [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) was a potent inotrope in paced mouse right ventricle and human atria. [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) elicited a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure in anesthetized rat and dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow in human volunteers. Conclusions: We provide evidence that ACE2 cleaves [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 to [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) and this cleavage product is expressed in human cardiovascular tissues. We have demonstrated biological activity of [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1–12)) at the human and rodent apelin receptor in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that reported enhanced ACE2 activity in cardiovascular disease should not significantly compromise the beneficial effects of apelin based therapies for example in PAH.","Yang, Peiran; Kuc, Rhoda E.; Brame, Aimée L.; Dyson, Alex; Singer, Mervyn; Glen, Robert C.; Cheriyan, Joseph; Wilkinson, Ian B.; Davenport, Anthony P.; Maguire, Janet J.",Front Neurosci,51,8

Inflammation is one of the major consequences of the host's immune response. For its orchestration, this process requires a fine-tuned interplay between interleukins, endothelial cells and various types of recruited immune cells. Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are crucially involved in the complex control of the inflammatory response through their actions on various signalling pathways including the JAK/STAT and NF-κB pathways. Due to their cytokine regulatory functions, they are frequent targets for exploitation by infectious agents trying to escape the host's immune response. This review article aims to summarize our current knowledge regarding SOCS family members in the different mammalian species studied so far, and to display their complex molecular interactions with microbial pathogens.","Delgado-Ortega, Mario; Marc, Daniel; Dupont, Joëlle; Trapp, Sascha; Berri, Mustapha; Meurens, François",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,51,16

This re-emerging virus gained attention during the outbreak in Brazil in 2016, where a considerable number of microcephaly cases in newborns was associated with ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Lacking a preventive vaccine or antiviral drugs, efforts have been made to better understand the viral life cycle. In light of this, the relevance of the endosomal–lysosomal compartment for the ZIKV life cycle was investigated. A549 and SH-SY5Y cells were infected with either the African strain (associated with mild symptoms) or the French Polynesia strain (associated with neurological complications). For both strains, the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, efficiently inhibited ZIKV entry and prevented the spread of the infection by interfering with viral maturation. Additionally, affecting cholesterol metabolism and transport with the drug U18666A, which inactivates late endosomes and lysosomes, impairs the viral life cycle. The data presented show a clear antiviral effect of two compounds that target the same compartments in different ways. This highlights the relevance of the endosomal–lysosomal compartment for the viral life cycle that should be considered as a target for antivirals.","Sabino, Catarina; Basic, Michael; Bender, Daniela; Elgner, Fabian; Himmelsbach, Kiyoshi; Hildt, Eberhard",Viruses,51,16

Zoonotic transmission events have increased in frequency in recent decades due to changes in human behavior, including increased international travel, the wildlife trade, deforestation, and the intensification of farming practices to meet demand for meat consumption. Influenza A viruses (IAV) possess a number of features which make them a pandemic threat and a major concern for human health. Their segmented genome and error-prone process of replication can lead to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses, for which the human population are immunologically naïve. In addition, the ability for IAVs to infect aquatic birds and domestic animals, as well as humans, increases the likelihood for reassortment and the subsequent emergence of novel viruses. Sporadic spillover events in the past few decades have resulted in human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, with high mortality. The application of conventional vaccine platforms used for the prevention of seasonal influenza viruses, such as inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs), in the development of vaccines for HPAI viruses is fraught with challenges. These issues are associated with manufacturing under enhanced biosafety containment, and difficulties in propagating HPAI viruses in embryonated eggs, due to their propensity for lethality in eggs. Overcoming manufacturing hurdles through the use of safer backbones, such as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAI), can also be a challenge if incompatible with master strain viruses. Non-replicating adenoviral (Ad) vectors offer a number of advantages for the development of vaccines against HPAI viruses. Their genome is stable and permits the insertion of HPAI virus antigens (Ag), which are expressed in vivo following vaccination. Therefore, their manufacture does not require enhanced biosafety facilities or procedures and is egg-independent. Importantly, Ad vaccines have an exemplary safety and immunogenicity profile in numerous human clinical trials, and can be thermostabilized for stockpiling and pandemic preparedness. This review will discuss the status of Ad-based vaccines designed to protect against avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential.","Kerstetter, Lucas J.; Buckley, Stephen; Bliss, Carly M.; Coughlan, Lynda",Front Immunol,51,26

This induces a need for the development of an analytical method for the quantification of camostat and its metabolites in plasma samples. Camostat is, however, very unstable in whole blood and plasma due to its two ester bonds. The molecule is readily hydrolysed by esterases to 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) and further to 4-guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA). For reliable quantification of camostat, a technique is required that can instantly inhibit esterases when blood samples are collected. DESIGN AND METHODS: An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) using stable isotopically labelled analogues as internal standards was developed and validated. Different esterase inhibitors were tested for their ability to stop the hydrolysis of camostat ester bonds. RESULTS: Both diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and paraoxon were discovered as efficient inhibitors of camostat metabolism at 10 mM concentrations. No significant changes in camostat and GBPA concentrations were observed in fluoride-citrate-DFP/paraoxon-preserved plasma after 24 h of storage at room temperature or 4 months of storage at -20 °C and -80 °C. The lower limits of quantification were 0.1 ng/mL for camostat and GBPA and 0.2 ng/mL for GBA. The mean true extraction recoveries were greater than 90%. The relative intra-laboratory reproducibility standard deviations were at a maximum of 8% at concentrations of 1-800 ng/mL. The trueness expressed as the relative bias of the test results was within ±3% at concentrations of 1-800 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: A methodology was developed that preserves camostat and GBPA in plasma samples and provides accurate and sensitive quantification of camostat, GBPA and GBA by UHPLC-MS/MS.","Sørensen, Lambert K; Hasselstrøm, Jørgen B; Gunst, Jesper D; Søgaard, Ole S; Kjolby, Mads",Clin. biochem,51,33

OBJECTIVES: Compare the clinical features of ECoV infection with enteric salmonellosis and establish a disease signature to increase clinical suspicion of ECoV infection in adult horses. ANIMALS: Forty‐three horses >1 year of age with results of CBC, serum biochemistry, and fecal diagnostic testing for ECoV and Salmonella spp. METHODS: Medical records of horses presented to the North Carolina State University Equine and Farm Animal Veterinary Center (2003‐016) were retrospectively reviewed. Horses were divided into 3 groups based on fecal diagnostic test results: ECoV‐positive, Salmonella‐positive, or unknown diagnosis (UNK). Time of year presented, clinical signs, CBC, and serum biochemistry test results were recorded. Data were analyzed by 1‐way analysis of variance, Kruskal‐Wallis test, or Fisher's exact test with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: Most common presenting complaints were fever and colic and were similar across groups. Horses with ECoV had significantly decreased neutrophil counts when compared to those with no diagnosis but were not different from horses with Salmonella. Horses with Salmonella had significantly lower mean leukocyte counts compared to those with UNK. No significant differences were found among groups for any other examined variable.

The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to the introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, although not with increased disease severity.

Vitamin D affects the immune system in many different ways, and other authors already found that COVID-19 patients have low levels of vitamin D. In our retrospective study, we evaluated the vitamin D status at the time of hospital admission in 50 COVID-19 patients in Sicily, which is the southernmost region of Italy, and compared them with 100 control subjects matched for age and sex. Our data showed markedly low levels of vitamin D in patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but no association was found with inflammation markers or clinical severity. Vitamin D levels were reduced at the time of hospital admission in Sicilian SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, but it is not clear whether this condition has an impact on the clinical course of COVID-19.","Gaudio, Agostino; Murabito, Andrea Ruben; Agodi, Antonella; Montineri, Arturo; Castellino, Pietro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,51,16

However, variation in population size poses a challenge to the triggering of public health interventions using wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. This is especially important for near-to-source sites that are subject to significant daily variability in upstream populations. Focusing on a university campus in England, this study investigates methods to account for variation in upstream populations at a site with highly transient footfall and provides a better understanding of the impact of variable populations on the SARS-CoV-2 trends provided by wastewater-based epidemiology. The potential for complementary data to help direct response activities within the near-to-source population is also explored, and potential concerns arising due to the presence of heavily diluted samples during wet weather are addressed. Using wastewater biomarkers, it is demonstrated that population normalisation can reveal significant differences between days where SARS-CoV-2 concentrations are very similar. Confidence in the trends identified is strongest when samples are collected during dry weather periods; however, wet weather samples can still provide valuable information. It is also shown that building-level occupancy estimates based on complementary data aid identification of potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 and can enable targeted actions to be taken to identify and manage potential sources of pathogen transmission in localised communities.","Sweetapple, Chris; Melville-Shreeve, Peter; Chen, Albert S.; Grimsley, Jasmine M.S.; Bunce, Joshua T.; Gaze, William; Fielding, Sean; Wade, Matthew J.",Sci Total Environ,51,1

Lack of targeted therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-2019 have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or drugs against this novel virus. Many synthetic compounds and antimalarial drugs are undergoing clinical trials. The traditional medical practitioners widely use Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) natural constituents, called withanolides for curing various diseases. The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a vital role in disease propagation by processing the polyproteins which are required for its replication. Hence, it denotes a significant target for drug discovery. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of 40 natural chemical constituents of Ashwagandha to explore a possible inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by adopting the computational approach. The docking study revealed that four constituents of Ashwagandha; Withanoside II (-11.30 Kcal/mol), Withanoside IV (-11.02 Kcal/mol), Withanoside V (-8.96 Kcal/mol) and Sitoindoside IX (-8.37 Kcal/mol) exhibited the highest docking energy among the selected natural constituents. Further, MD simulation study of 100 ns predicts Withanoside V possess strong binding affinity and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and indicates its stability in the active site. The binding free energy score also correlates with the highest score of −87.01 ± 5.01 Kcal/mol as compared to other selected compounds. In conclusion, our study suggests that Withanoside V in Ashwagandha may be serve as a potential inhibitor against M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 to combat COVID-19 and may have an antiviral effect on nCoV.

The 674–685 fragment of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein is homologous to the fragment of α-cobratoxin underlying its interaction with α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The interaction of 674–685 peptide with α7 nAChR has been predicted in silico. In the present paper we confirm this prediction experimentally and investigate the effect of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide on mitochondria, which express α7 nAChRs to regulate apoptosis-related events. We demonstrate that SARS-Cov-2 spike protein peptide 674–685 competes with the antibody against 179–190 fragment of α7 nAChR subunit for the binding to α7-expressing cells and mitochondria and prevents the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria in response to 0.5 mM H(2)O(2) but does not protect intact U373 cells against apoptogenic effect of H(2)O(2.) Our data suggest that the α7 nAChR-binding portion of SARS-Cov-2 spike protein prevents mitochondria-driven apoptosis when the virus is uncoated inside the cell and, therefore, supports the infected cell viability before the virus replication cycle is complete.","Kalashnyk, Olena; Lykhmus, Olena; Izmailov, Mykhailo; Koval, Lyudmyla; Komisarenko, Serhiy; Skok, Maryna",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,51,1

We assessed whether seasonal respiratory illness patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We categorized emergency department (ED) visits reported to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program according to chief complaints and diagnosis codes, excluding visits with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. For each week during March 1, 2020 through December 26, 2020 (“pandemic period”), we compared the proportion of ED visits in each respiratory category with the proportion of visits in that category during the corresponding weeks of 2017–2019 (“pre-pandemic period”). We analyzed positivity of respiratory viral tests from two independent clinical laboratories. RESULTS: During March 2020, cough, shortness of breath, and influenza-like illness accounted for twice as many ED visits compared with the pre-pandemic period. During the last four months of 2020, all respiratory conditions, except shortness of breath, accounted for a smaller proportion of ED visits than during the pre-pandemic period. Percent positivity for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, and human metapneumovirus were lower in 2020 than 2019. Although test volume decreased, percent positivity was higher for rhinovirus/enterovirus during the final weeks of 2020 compared with 2019; with ED visits similar to the pre-pandemic period. DISCUSSION: Broad reductions in respiratory test positivity and respiratory emergency department visits (excluding COVID-19) occurred during 2020. Interventions for mitigating spread of SARS-CoV-2 likely also reduced transmission of other pathogens. Timely surveillance is needed to understand community health threats, particularly when current trends deviate from seasonal norms.","Rodgers, Loren; Sheppard, Michael; Smith, Amanda; Dietz, Stephanie; Jayanthi, Praveena; Yuan, Yan; Bull, Lara; Wotiz, Samantha; Schwarze, Tessa; Azondekon, Roseric; Hartnett, Kathleen; Adjemian, Jennifer; Kirking, Hannah L; Kite Powell, Aaron",Clin Infect Dis,51,24

To help control the infection, we developed the Coronavirus GenBrowser (CGB) to monitor the pandemic. CGB allows visualization and analysis of the latest viral genomic data. Distributed genome alignments and an evolutionary tree built on the existing subtree are implemented for easy and frequent updates. The tree-based data are compressed at a ratio of 2,760:1, enabling fast access and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants. CGB can effectively detect adaptive evolution of specific alleles, such as D614G of the spike protein, in their early stage of spreading. By lineage tracing, the most recent common ancestor, dated in early March 2020, of nine strains collected from six different regions in three continents was found to cause the outbreak in Xinfadi, Beijing, China in June 2020. CGB also revealed that the first COVID-19 outbreak in Washington State was caused by multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2. To encourage data sharing, CGB credits the person who first discovers any SARS-CoV-2 variant. As CGB is developed with eight different languages, it allows the general public in many regions of the world to easily access pre-analyzed results of more than 132,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Opinions were also solicited from applicants and PDs on the status of medical physics residencies and the selection process, such as the availability of residency positions and satisfaction with the match process. METHODS: A survey was sent to all applicants registered for the 2015–2018 MPM and to all PDs registered for the 2015–2017 MPM. Survey questions asked about the pre‐interview screening, interview, and ranking stages of the residency match process. Survey data were analyzed using graphical methods and spreadsheet tools. RESULTS: An increasing percentage of applicants are female and/or hold a PhD as their highest degree. The over all number of interview invitations per applicant has increased, leading some applicants to decline interviews with the top reasons being cost of travel and scheduling conflicts. The top considerations for applicants in ranking programs were residency program/institution reputation, program structure/organization, and facilities/equipment available. The primary considerations identified by PDs for ranking applicants included impressions from the interview, personality fit, and clinical potential. While two‐thirds of applicants agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that a residency position was difficult to obtain, roughly one‐third of PDs agree that the current residency placement rate is a problem. CONCLUSION: Four years of survey data on the experiences of applicants and PDs participating in the MPM is useful to future participants navigating the residency match system. It is hoped that the data will be helpful to inform improvements and to enhance understanding of the residency match system and how it shapes our profession.","Hendrickson, Kristi R.

Various methods were used to identify the Schiff base ligand and complexes. Characterization techniques such as infrared, UV, and (1)H NMR spectral tests, elemental analysis, molar conductivity, magnetic properties, thermal analysis, BET surface area, and theoretically by DFT were used to help further understanding of the complex structures. For all complexes, the ligand behaved as a neutral tetradentate ligand with NOON donor atoms and spectroscopic studies indicated an octahedral structure. The electrolytic behavior of the complexes was revealed by the molar conductivity measurements. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis was used to investigate the decomposition of the complexes and Schiff base ligand. According to the results obtained, the antibacterial activity of the metal complexes is higher than that of the Schiff base ligand against one or more bacterial species. The results showed that Cd(II) complex exhibits enhanced activity against Aspergillus flavus and Ni(II) complex against Candida albicans than the standard drug ketoconazole.

This call has particular relevance to scholars who are closely aligned with struggles for food justice and food sovereignty. In this discussion piece, I suggest additional nuance that builds and expands on Anderson’s three opportunities for “pushing beyond the boundaries”. First, collaborations for social and ecological change must be willing to expand predominant ideas to the varied ways that people engage with food systems (e.g., consider the role of harvesting non-domesticated foods and migrant/undocumented workers across the food chain). Second, interactions with global social movements demands grounding our work in the hearts and minds of individuals and communities while also addressing structural concerns at the levels of governance that enable and constrain food system functions. Third, food systems thinking and action must begin with our relationships to the land and its original inhabitants. The settler colonial project is integrally connected to the dominant food system that is premised on exploitation and control of land, water and people. As scholar allies, “pushing the boundaries” demands acknowledging ways that we are complicit in unjust systems and ways that we benefit from them; doing the personal work required for unlearning and relearning; being prepared to take actions that move towards more equitable and sustainable food systems; and, accepting the potential risks and material consequences that equity demands.","Levkoe, Charles Z.",Agric Human Values,51,15

The mental health outcomes of the second wave of the pandemic remain unclear, especially those of patients with an infection. Thus, this study aims to explore the prevalence of and related risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms among patients infected with COVID-19 during the second wave. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five isolated wards of a designated hospital in Beijing, China, from July 1 to July 15, 2020. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted to assess psychiatric disorders, and a series of scales were used to measure self-reported psychopathological symptoms and psychosomatic factors. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms. RESULTS: Among 119 participants with infections, the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms (51.3%), depressive symptoms (41.2%), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (33.6%) was observed. Loneliness, hope, coping strategies, and history of mental disorders were the shared risk or protective factors across several psychopathological symptoms. The perceived impact of COVID-19 is the specific risk factor associated with state anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSS/PTSD is high among patients with infections during the second wave of the pandemic in Beijing. Clinical doctors must realize that these patients will probably experience depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSS/PTSD, as well as some neuropsychiatric syndromes.

In this review, we focus on strategies for the detection of nucleic acids, using G-quadruplexes as detection labels or as enzyme labels that amplify detection signals. Methods to detect other analytes are briefly mentioned. We highlight various strategies, including split G-quadruplex, hemin–G-quadruplex conjugates, molecular beacon G-quadruplex or inhibited G-quadruplex probes. The tandem use of G-quadruplex labels with various DNA-modifying enzymes, such as polymerases (used for rolling circle amplification), exonucleases and endonucleases, is also discussed. Some of the detection modalities that are discussed in this review include fluorescence, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical methods.","Roembke, Benjamin T.; Nakayama, Shizuka; Sintim, Herman O.",Methods,51,8

The Cognitive Load Scale (CLS) developed by Leppink and colleagues has emerged as one of the most validated and widely used self-report measures of intrinsic load (IL), extraneous load (EL), and germane load (GL). In this paper we investigated an expansion of the CLS by using a multidimensional conceptualization of the EL construct that is relevant for physical and online teaching environments. The Multidimensional Cognitive Load Scale for Physical and Online Lectures (MCLS-POL) goes beyond the CLS's operationalization of EL by expanding the EL component which originally included factors related to instructions/explanations with sub-dimensions including EL stemming from noises, and EL stemming from both media and devices within the environment. Through three studies, we investigated the reliability, and internal and external validity of the MCLS-POL using the Partial Credit Model, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and differences between students either attending a lecture physically or online (Study 2 and 3). The results of Study 1 (N = 250) provide initial evidence for the validity and reliability of the MCLS-POL within a higher education sample, but also highlighted several potential improvements which could be made to the measure. These changes were made before re-evaluating the validity and reliability of the measure in a new sample of higher education psychology students (N = 140, Study 2), and psychological testing students (N = 119, Study 3). Together the studies provide evidence for a multidimensional conceptualization cognitive load and provide evidence of the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of the MCLS-POL and provide suggestions for future research directions.","Andersen, Martin S.; Makransky, Guido",Front Psychol,51,16

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2(1–5). Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal neutralizing titers ranging from undetectable in 33% to below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody cloning revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","Robbiani, Davide F.; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C.

Using US county-level data from July 5 and December 28, 2020, the effect of 19 high-risk factors on COVID-19 mortality rate was quantified at each time point with negative binomial mixed models. Then, these high-risk factors were used as controls in two association studies between 40 social determinants and COVID-19 mortality rates using data from the same time points. The results indicate that counties with certain ethnic minorities and age groups, immigrants, prevalence of diseases like pediatric asthma and diabetes and cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic inequalities, and higher social association are associated with increased COVID-19 mortality rates. Meanwhile, more mental health providers, access to exercise, higher income, chronic lung disease in adults, suicide, and excessive drinking are associated with decreased mortality. Our temporal analysis also reveals a possible decreasing impact of socioeconomic disadvantage and air quality, and an increasing effect of factors like age, which suggests that public health policies may have been effective in protecting disadvantaged populations over time or that analysis utilizing earlier data may have exaggerated certain effects. Overall, we continue to recognize that social inequality still places disadvantaged groups at risk, and we identify possible relationships between lung disease, mental health, and COVID-19 that need to be explored on a clinical level.","Debopadhaya, S.; Erickson, J.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater need to encourage participation in the SDM process. The pandemic has created both challenges and opportunities for delivering care, as system adaptations influence the physician-patient relationship. While social distancing and health service reallocation can interfere with preference for an in-person visit, these measures also provide an avenue to study and implement virtual SDM processes. Communicating risk at a time of heightened uncertainty may pose a barrier to SDM engagement but provides the opportunity to foster a patient-centered approach within a more personalized context. Social media influence during COVID-19 has resulted in an ‘infodemic’ but highlights the importance of patient engagement. The pandemic has changed how we deliver care but allows us to re-evaluate common practices and enhance effectiveness of our management strategies. Navigating the uncertainty of subsequent pandemic waves creates confusion about how to safely reinitiate clinical service. This will require ongoing SDM with our patients and amongst colleagues through current—and future—challenges.

To overcome this challenge, we propose fitting a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission jointly across multiple locations. We apply the model to COVID-19 case data from Spain, UK, Germany, France, Denmark, and New York to estimate the time needed for social distancing to end to be around October 2020.

The infectious nature of COVID‐19 poses an additional risk of transmission to healthcare workers that should be taken into consideration. METHODS: We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID‐19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS‐CoV‐1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. RESULTS: Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID‐19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy. If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure. CONCLUSION: Thorough preprocedural planning, use of experienced personnel, enhanced personal protective equipment where available, and a thoughtful anesthesia approach are instrumental in maximizing positive patient outcomes while successfully protecting the safety of healthcare personnel.

In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.

We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25–75)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.","Kumar, Prawin; Mukherjee, Aparna; Randev, Shivani; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Jat, Kana Ram; Kapil, Arti; Lodha, Rakesh; Kabra, Sushil Kumar",BMJ Open Respir Res,51,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Twitter search features, all tweets containing keywords from both “radiology” and “COVID-19” were collected for the period January 01, 2020 up to April 24, 2020. The resulting dataset comprised of 8354 tweets. Images were classified as (i) images with text (ii) radiological content (e.g., CT scan snapshots, X-ray images), and (iii) non-medical content like personal images or memes. We trained our deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on training dataset of 1040 labeled images drawn from all three classes. We then trained another DL classifier for segmenting images into categories based on human anatomy. All software used is open-source and adapted for this research. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm was assessed by comparing results on a test set of 1885 images. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that in COVID-19 related tweets on radiology, nearly 32% had textual images, another 24% had radiological content, and 44% were not of radiological significance. Our results indicated a 92% accuracy in classifying images originally labeled as chest X-ray or chest CT and a nearly 99% accurate classification of images containing medically relevant text. With larger training dataset and algorithmic tweaks, the accuracy can be further improved. CONCLUSION: Applying DL on rich textual images and other metadata in tweets we can process and classify content for radiological significance in real time.

This study sought to document COVID‐19's impact on eating disorders (ED) research, which may be particularly susceptible to such disruptions, given its focus on individuals who are physically and emotionally vulnerable. We invited ED researchers from editorial boards and scientific organizations to complete a quantitative/qualitative survey about: COVID‐19's current and future impact on ED research; areas of concern about research disruptions; and effective strategies for conducting and supporting research during and after COVID‐19. Among 187 participants, many had moved studies online and/or shutdown part of their research. Across position types (permanent, 52.7%; temporary, 47.3%), participants reported high concern about data collection, recruitment, and securing future funding. Those holding temporary positions reported significantly greater concern about COVID‐19's impact on their career and greater stress than participants in permanent positions. Strategies for dealing with research disruptions included: employing technology; reprioritizing goals/tasks; and encouraging collaboration.

It is abundant in milk and in most biological fluids and is a cell-secreted molecule that bridges innate and adaptive immune function in mammals. Its protective effects range from anticancer, anti-inflammatory and immune modulator activities to antimicrobial activities against a large number of microorganisms. This wide range of activities is made possible by mechanisms of action involving not only the capacity of Lf to bind iron but also interactions of Lf with molecular and cellular components of both hosts and pathogens. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the activities of Lf, its regulation and potential applications. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The extensive uses of Lf in the treatment of various infectious diseases in animals and humans has been the driving force in Lf research however, a lot of work is required to obtain a better understanding of its activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The large potential applications of Lf have led scientists to develop this nutraceutical protein for use in feed, food and pharmaceutical applications.

This post-COVID condition is sometimes called ‘post-COVID syndrome’, ‘long COVID’ or ‘post-acute COVID-19’. Persistent psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 survivors such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms and cognitive impairment may be related to psychological factors and neurobiological injury. COVID-19 related neurological symptoms including anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, headache and seizures may persist for a long time after the acute COVID-19 illness. Many COVID-19 survivors experience persistent physical symptoms such as cough, fatigue, dyspnea and pain after recovering from their initial illness. There is a high probability that symptoms of psychiatric, neurological and physical illnesses, as well as inflammatory damage to the brain in individuals with post-COVID syndrome increase suicidal ideation and behavior in this patient population. COVID-19 survivors without post-COVID syndrome may also be at elevated suicide risk. Studies of suicidality in COVID-19 survivors are urgently needed and will be a new area of suicide research. An appropriate management of psychiatric, neurological and medical conditions may reduce suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors with or without post-COVID syndrome.","Sher, L",QJM,51,20

In the majority of cases patients are either asymptomatic or show mild to moderate symptoms and signs of a common cold. A subset of patients, however, develop a severe atypical pneumonia, with the characteristic ground-glass appearance on chest x-ray and computerized tomography, which evolves into an acute respiratory distress syndrome, that requires mechanical ventilation and eventually results in multiple organ failure and death. The Molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unknown. Aim of the study In the present work we performed a stringent metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from bronchoalveolar cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to elucidate molecular alterations and cellular deconvolution to identify immune cell profiles. Results Alterations in genes involved in hyaluronan, glycosaminoglycan and mucopolysaccharides metabolism were over-represented in bronchoalveolar cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, as well as potential lung infiltration with neutrophils, NK cells, T CD4+ cell and macrophages. The blood mononuclear cells presented a proliferative state. Dramatic reduction of neutrophils, NK and T lymphocytes, whereas an exacerbated increase in monocytes. Conclusions In summary our results revealed molecular pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection to bronchoalveolar cells inducing the hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan metabolism that could shape partially the components of the ground-glass opacities observed in CT.

This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.

Fat grafting to the scalp has also been utilized in the past to improve the quality of hair and the possibility of successful hair transplant. The novel therapy reported in this case series combines the natural progression of these two techniques and utilizes synergistic effects to improve the quality of hair, either in preparation for micrografting or without hair transplant. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the principles behind the novel approach to restoration of hair and the rationale for its use. METHODS: A review of the evidence for PRP and fat transfer for non-scarring alopecia serves as the foundation for the combination treatment reported herein. Through presentation of three cases in this series, we provide examples of the utility of this approach for non-scarring alopecia. This report includes a female who suffered non-scarring alopecia following COVID-19 hospitalization and intensive care stay where she lost a large percentage of her hair, in addition to two male patients suffering from androgenic alopecia. RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma-hybridized adipose transplant hair was shown in these three cases to improve both the quality and density of hair. It improved the density of hair in all patients and was characterized first by a short period of transient hair loss followed by new hair growth which develops starting at 4 weeks and was readily apparent at 12-week follow-up. Results were maintained at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: PHAT hair offers a combination of beneficial effects—namely the unique healing properties and growth signaling provided by PRP, along with adipocyte angiogenic and growth signaling, which both work to improve scalp quality. The combination of these effects is better than previously characterized PRP injections alone in the hands of these individual practices. This may be due to synergistic interactions at a cellular level, but additional clinical studies are needed to better understand this novel treatment and the observed effects.

The primary aim of CEST was to produce and sustain the best available COVID‐19 evidence to facilitate decision‐making in Saskatchewan, Canada. To achieve this objective, four provincial organizations partnered to establish a single, data‐driven system. METHODS: The CEST partnership was driven by COVID‐19 questions from Emergency Operational Committee (EOC) of the Saskatchewan Health Authority. CEST included three processes: (a) clarifying the nature and priority of COVID‐19 policy and clinical questions; (b) providing Rapid Reviews (RRR) and Evidence Search Reports (ESR); and (c) seeking the requestors' evaluation of the product. A web‐based repository, including a dashboard and database, was designed to house ESRs and RRRs and offered a common platform for clinicians, academics, leaders, and policymakers to find COVID‐19 evidence. RESULTS: In CEST's first year, 114 clinical and policy questions have been posed resulting in 135 ESRs and 108 RRRs. While most questions (41.3%) originated with the EOC, several other teams were assembled to address a myriad of questions related to areas such as long‐term care, public health and prevention, infectious diseases, personal protective equipment, vulnerable populations, and Indigenous health. Initial challenges were mobilization of diverse partners and teams, remote work, lack of public access, and quality of emerging COVID‐19 literature. Current challenges indicate the need for institutional commitment for CEST sustainability. Despite these challenges, the CEST provided the Saskatchewan LHS with a template for successful collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: The urgency of COVID‐19 pandemic and the implementation of the CEST served to catalyze collaboration between different levels of a Saskatchewan LHS.","Groot, Gary; Baer, Susan; Badea, Andreea; Dalidowicz, Michelle; Yasinian, Maryam; Ali, Anum; Carr, Tracey; Reeder, Bruce",Learn Health Syst,51,1

The study is a cross-sectional, correlational type. The study was conducted with 1,274 students receiving education in a district located in the western region of Turkey. For the collection of the data, a Descriptive Information Form, the Social Media Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SMASA), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), the Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) and the Sleep Variables Questionnaire (SVQ) were used. Among the high school students who participated in the research, 49.3% stated that they had been using social media for 1–3 years, 53.9% reported that they spent 1–3 h per day on social media, and 42.8% stated that they placed their telephone under their pillow or beside their bed while sleeping. Students’ mean scores were 16.59 ± 6.79 (range: 9–45) for the SMASA, 16.54 ± 4.27 (range: 0–40) for total difficulties, and 14.18 ± 1.56 (range: 7–21) for the SQS, while their sleep efficiency value was 97.9%. According to the research model, difficulties experienced by high school students increase their social media addiction, while they decrease prosocial behaviours. Social media addiction in high school students decreases students’ sleep efficiency (p < 0.05). It is considered important to conduct further public health studies for children and adolescents related to the risks caused by the excessive use of technology, the consequences of social media addiction, measures to protect psychological health, sleep programmes and the importance of sleep quality.","Sümen, Adem; Evgin, Derya",Child Indic Res,51,1

Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, strict infection control measures were in force in long-term residential care in Germany that burdened staff and isolated residents socially. Both are considered risk factors for violence in long-term residential care. Questions: How does violence develop in nursing homes under pandemic conditions from the point of view of managers and how do strategies for preventing violence change? Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with staff in 43 nursing homes: 25 with service managers, 15 with nurse managers, 28 with nursing team leaders and 10 with registered nurses with extended tasks. The interviews were recorded as audio, transcribed and analysed in five steps following the ""Thematic Framework Analysis"". Results: The infection control measures were partly perceived as deprivation of freedom. Residents, relatives and staff partly reacted most with verbal violence. Nevertheless, the issue of violence was not a major concern for management and preventive measures were not carried out. Conclusions: The results show that strategies to prevent violence might not be sufficiently established in the institutions involved and would have to be adapted to the conditions of the pandemic. Further research is needed to evaluate infection control measures in their potential to increase the incidence of violence.","Freytag, Stefanie; Dammermann, Anna; Schultes, Kristin; Bieber, Anja; Fleischer, Steffen; Sander, Marco; Piotrowski, Alexandra; Blättner, Beate",Pflege (Bern),51,26

The cardinal features are fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance. Vitamin D is known to have pleotropic effects far beyond bone health and is associated with immune modulation and autoimmunity. We hypothesize that vitamin D levels are associated with persistent symptoms following COVID-19. Herein, we investigate the relationship between vitamin D and fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, assessed by the Chalder Fatigue Score, six-minute walk test and modified Borg scale. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationships. A total of 149 patients were recruited at a median of 79 days after COVID-19 illness. The median vitamin D level was 62 nmol/L, with n = 36 (24%) having levels 30–49 nmol/L and n = 14 (9%) with levels <30 nmol/L. Fatigue was common, with n = 86 (58%) meeting the case definition. The median Borg score was 3, while the median distance covered for the walk test was 450 m. No relationship between vitamin D and the measures of ongoing ill-health assessed in the study was found following multivariable regression analysis.

Objective: To see whether cohorts born when Spain had a program of universal BCG vaccination had lower rates of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and mortality (relative to similar cohorts in Italy). Methods: We compare COVID-19 mortality and confirmed cases for those born roughly a decade before and after 1981. We compare the outcomes to the same age cohorts in Italy, which never had universal BCG vaccination. Results: The Spanish cohort that received BCG had a relative risk of 0.962 of having a confirmed case of COVID-19. This risk is statistically significantly below unity (95% CI 0.952 to 0.972, P< 0.001). There is also suggestive evidence the BCG cohort in Spain had lower mortality (relative risk 0.929, CI 0.850 to 1.01, P = 0.11). The small sample size makes this test underpowered.

WHO declared a state of pandemic (11th March, 2020), which has caused more than 1 million infected and more than 110,000 deaths; it was observed that up to 29% of those infected were health care personnel. The main route of transmission of SARS-CoV2 is through respiratory secretions and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and material. The pandemic induced an international saturation of health care services and a rupture in the supply chain of protective equipment for healthcare personnel, which poses a high occupational risk to all.

Protein purification of these recombinantly expressed viral antigens [e.g., spike and its receptor binding domain (RBD)] is an important step in the manufacturing process. Simple and high-capacity protein purification schemes for spike, RBD, and CR3022 mAb, recombinantly expressed in CHO and HEK293 cells, are reported in this article. The schemes consist of an affinity chromatography step and a desalting step. Purified proteins were validated in ELISA-based serological tests.

The improvement of indoor air quality (IAQ) is ensured by frequent changes of the air that must be carried out in healthcare areas and with assistance from special devices that undertake the filtration of the air and its purification through special filters and lamps. In this research, the performance of air purifiers is assessed in terms of the limitation of PM(2.5), PM(10), VOCs and CO(2) in a postgraduate clinic of the Dentistry School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in parallel with mechanical ventilation.

Analysis of hospital discharge data showed an increased length of stay among alcohol-consuming pneumonia patients. Increased alcohol and cannabis sales during the early months of 2020 suggest that consumption of both substances has increased significantly during the pandemic, potentially representing an increased risk of severe COVID-19 mediated by lung inflammation. ABSTRACT: Risk factors for severe COVID-19 pathology are currently being investigated worldwide. The emergence of this highly infectious respiratory disease has plagued the world, with varying severity across populations of different age, race, and socio-economic level. These data suggest that other environmental or social factors may contribute to this disease’s severity. Using a mouse model, we identify heavy alcohol and cannabinoid consumption as risk factors for increased pulmonary pathology in the setting of exposure to a microbial pulmonary pathogen (K. pneumoniae). We present observational evidence that pneumonia patients admitted to North Carolina hospitals have longer lengths of stay when they endorse alcohol use or have conditions considered alcohol attributable. We are concerned that the observed increase in alcohol and legal cannabinoid sales during lockdown and quarantine may contribute to increased pulmonary pathology among patients who become infected with COVID-19.","Sivaraman, Vijay; Richey, Morgan M.; Nasir, ABM",Biology (Basel),51,22

Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC). METHODS: Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients’ hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways. RESULT: The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality. CONCLUSION: TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients’ recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.","Luo, Erdan; Zhang, Daiyan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Bowen; Zhao, Keming; Zhao, Yonghua; Bian, Ying; Wang, Yitao",Chin Med,51,8

The first architecture is able to decide whether a given chest X-ray image of a patient contains COVID-19 or not with 98.92% average accuracy. The second CNN architecture is able to divide a given chest X-ray image of a patient into three classes (COVID-19 versus normal versus pneumonia) with 98.27% average accuracy. The hyperparameters of both CNN models are automatically determined using Grid Search. Experimental results on large clinical data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed architectures and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can overcome the disadvantages mentioned above. Moreover, the proposed CNN models are fully automatic in terms of not requiring the extraction of diseased tissue, which is a great improvement of available automatic methods in the literature. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study is the first study to detect COVID-19 disease from given chest X-ray images, using CNN, whose hyperparameters are automatically determined by the Grid Search. Another important contribution of this study is that it is the first CNN-based COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification study that uses the largest possible clinical data set. A total of 1,524 COVID-19, 1,527 pneumonia, and 1524 normal X-ray images are collected.

Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs.

The aim of the study was to study and to compare simple infections and viral coinfections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children. From September 2005 to August 2013, a prospective study was conducted on children younger than 14 years of age, admitted with respiratory infection to the Pediatric Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital, in Spain. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were taken for virological study by using polymerase chain reaction, and clinical data were recorded. Simple RSV infections were selected and compared with double infections of RSV with rhinovirus (RV) or with human bocavirus (HBoV). In this study, 2993 episodes corresponding to 2525 children were analyzed. At least 1 virus was detected in 77% (2312) of the episodes. Single infections (599 RSV, 513 RV, and 81 HBoV) were compared with 120 RSV-RV and 60 RSV-HBoV double infections. The RSV-RV coinfections had fever (63% vs 43%; P < 0.001) and hypoxia (70% vs 43%; P < 0.001) more often than RV infections. Hypoxia was similar between single or dual infections (71%). Bronchiolitis was more frequent in the RSV simple group (P < 0.001). Pediatric intensive care unit admission was more common in RSV simple or RSV-RV groups than in the RV monoinfection (P = 0.042). Hospitalization was longer for both RSV simple group and RSV-HBoV coinfection, lasting about 1 day (4.7 vs 3.8 days; P < 0.001) longer than in simple HBoV infections. There were no differences in PICU admission. RSV single group was of a younger age than the other groups. Coinfections between RSV-RV and RSV-HBoV are frequent. Overall viral coinfections do not present greater severity, but have mixed clinical features.","Calvo, Cristina; García-García, María Luz; Pozo, Francisco; Paula, Gallardo; Molinero, Mar; Calderón, Ana; González-Esguevillas, Mónica; Casas, Inmaculada",Medicine (Baltimore),51,26

Using enzymatic assays, we characterized inhibition of TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsins B/K/L by more than a dozen of previously developed M(Pro) inhibitors including MPI1‐9, GC376, 11a, 10–1, 10–2, and 10–3. MPI1‐9, GC376 and 11a all contain an aldehyde for the formation of a reversible covalent hemiacetal adduct with the M(Pro) active site cysteine and 10–1, 10–2 and 10–3 contain a labile ester to exchange with the M(Pro) active site cysteine for the formation of a thioester. Our data revealed that all these inhibitors are inert toward TMPRSS2 and furin. Diaryl esters also showed low inhibition of cathepsins. However, all aldehyde inhibitors displayed high potency in inhibiting three cathepsins. Their determined IC(50) values vary from 4.1 to 380 nM for cathepsin B, 0.079 to 2.3 nM for cathepsin L, and 0.35 to 180 nM for cathepsin K. All aldehyde inhibitors showed similar inhibition levels toward cathepsin L. A cellular analysis indicated high potency of MPI5 and MPI8 in inhibiting lysosomal activity, which is probably attributed to their inhibition of cathepsins. Among all aldehyde inhibitors, MPI8 shows the best selectivity toward cathepsin L. With respect to cathepsins B and K, the selective indices are 192 and 150, respectively. MPI8 is the most potent compound among all aldehyde inhibitors in cellular M(Pro) inhibition potency and anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity in Vero E6 cells. Cathepsin L has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the SARS‐CoV‐2 cell entry. By selectively inhibiting both SARS‐CoV‐2 M(Pro) and the host cathepsin L, MPI8 potentiates dual inhibition effects to synergize its overall antiviral potency and efficacy. Due to its high selectivity toward cathepsin L that reduces potential toxicity toward host cells and high cellular and antiviral potency, we urge serious consideration of MPI8 for preclinical and clinical investigations for treating COVID‐19.","Ma, Xinyu R.; Alugubelli, Yugendar R.; Ma, Yuying; Vatansever, Erol C.; Scott, Danielle A.; Qiao, Yuchen; Yu, Ge; Xu, Shiqing; Liu, Wenshe Ray",ChemMedChem,51,16

One possible way to treat patients, when no other treatment is yet developed, is passive immunization performed by transfusing blood, plasma or plasma immunoglobulin fractions obtained from convalescent donors who have recovered from the disease and have developed protective antibodies. The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease. This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach. In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma. In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins.

On the other hand, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has determined a dramatic worldwide reconfiguration of the healthcare systems, with rapid redeployment of resources towards this emergency. Italy was the first Western country affected by a large-scale spread of coronavirus disease 2019. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on in-hospital care of patients with CHD in an Italian tertiary centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed data on CHD hospital admissions in our centre since 1 March, 2020, when the adoption of a strict infection containment policy throughout the country resulted in limited access of patients to routine hospital care and resources reallocation to the care of infected patients. Comparison with data from the previous year was performed in order to identify any relevant differences attributable to the outbreak. Despite cancellation of all elective procedures, the overall number of urgent hospital admission remained stable throughout the period of study. Patients admitted during the pandemic had greater disease complexity (p = 0.001) with longer length of in-hospital stay (p = 0.01). No adverse events or positive swabs were reported among CHD patients who were admitted to hospital or medical personnel caring for these patients.

We investigated the relationship between the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and subsequent infection in this population. Methods Prospective cohort study of infection in staff and residents in 100 LTCFs in England between October 2020 and February 2021. Blood samples were collected at baseline (June 2020), 2 and 4 months and tested for IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike protein. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken weekly in staff and monthly in residents. The primary analysis estimated the relative hazard of a PCR-positive test by baseline antibody status, from Cox regression adjusted for age and gender, and stratified by LTCF. Findings Study inclusion criteria were met by 682 residents and 1429 staff. Baseline IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 residents (33%) and 408 staff (29%). A total of 93 antibody-negative residents had a PCR-positive test (0.054 per month at risk) compared to 4 antibody-positive residents (0.007 per month at risk). There were 111 PCR-positive tests in antibody-negative staff (0.042 per month at risk) compared to 10 in antibody-positive staff (0.009 per month at risk). The adjusted hazard ratios for reinfection in staff and residents with a baseline positive versus negative antibody test were 0.13 (95% CI 0.05-0.40) and 0.39 ((95% CI: 0.19-0.77) respectively. Of 12 reinfected participants with data on symptoms, 11 were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. Interpretation The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

We sought to determine the cytokines that reduce airflow, and the influence of respiratory viral infections on these relationships. METHODS: Children underwent home collections of nasal lavage during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses. We studied 53 children for one year, analyzing 392 surveillance samples and 203 samples from 85 respiratory illnesses. Generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between nasal lavage biomarkers (7 mRNAs, 10 proteins), lung function and viral infection. RESULTS: As anticipated, viral infection was associated with increased cytokines and reduced FVC and FEV(1). However, we found frequent and strong interactions between biomarkers and virus on lung function. For example, in the absence of viral infection, CXCL10 mRNA, MDA5 mRNA, CXCL10, IL-4, IL-13, CCL4, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 were negatively associated with FVC. In contrast, during infection, the opposite relationship was frequently found, with IL-4, IL-13, CCL5, CCL20 and CCL24 levels associated with less severe reductions in both FVC and FEV(1). CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatic children, airflow obstruction is driven by specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the absence of viral infection, higher cytokine levels are associated with decreasing lung function. However, with infection, there is a reversal in this relationship, with cytokine abundance associated with reduced lung function decline. While nasal samples may not reflect lower airway responses, these data suggest that some aspects of the inflammatory response may be protective against viral infection. This study may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations.

In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases? To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes. Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population. Monitoring the development of a COVID-19 vaccine using the matrix (modified as necessary) could help identify which of the approaches speeding development and deployment could be usefully applied more widely in the future.","Hanney, Stephen R.; Wooding, Steven; Sussex, Jon; Grant, Jonathan",Health Res Policy Syst,51,10

Results: A total of 400 dentists from Galicia responded to the survey. Only 12.3% of the participants could obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks. Of the male respondents, 33.1% suffered losses >€15,000 compared to 19.4% of female respondents (OR = 3.121, p < 0.001). Economic losses seem to have contributed to the applications for economic help as 29.5% of the respondents who applied for this measure recorded losses in excess of €15,000 (p = 0.03). Patients complained more about the fact that only emergency care was available during the State of Alarm, in dental surgeries that do not work with insurance companies or franchises. Only 4 professionals tested positive, 50% of whom worked exclusively in private practice and the other 50% who practised in both private and public surgeries. Dentists who practise in the public sector saw more urgent patients per week than those practising in private surgeries (p = 0.013). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had economic repercussions in dentistry as only urgent treatment was available during the State of Alarm. These repercussions seem to be higher in male participants, as the majority of the participants have revealed higher economic losses than females. The level of assistance has also been affected, reducing the number of treated patients, although this quantity has been different in private and public surgeries. By presenting these findings we look to highlight the role that dentists play in society in treating dental emergencies in our surgeries, and this must be recognised and addressed by the relevant authorities, who must provide PPEs as a priority to this group as well as providing special economic aid in accordance with the losses incurred by the sector.","Chamorro-Petronacci, Cintia; Martin Carreras-Presas, Carmen; Sanz-Marchena, Adriana; A Rodríguez-Fernández, María; María Suárez-Quintanilla, José; Rivas-Mundiña, Berta; Suárez-Quintanilla, Juan; Pérez-Sayáns, Mario",Int J Environ Res Public Health,51,15

We aimed to distinguish clinical data and computed tomography (CT) images between COVID-19 and other lung diseases in an advanced care hospital. METHODS: We assessed clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 between February 20 and May 21, 2020, at the University of Tokyo Hospital. RESULTS: Typical appearance for COVID-19 on CT images were found in 24 of 29 COVID-19 cases and 21 of 168 non-COVID-19 cases, according to the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Statement (for predicting COVID-19, sensitivity 0.828, specificity 0.875, positive predictive value 0.533, negative predictive value 0.967). When we focused on cases with typical CT images, loss of taste or smell, and close contact with COVID-19 patients were exclusive characteristics for the COVID-19 cases. Among laboratory data, high fibrinogen (P < 0.01) and low white blood cell count (P < 0.01) were good predictors for COVID-19 with typical CT images in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a relatively low prevalence region, CT screening has high sensitivity to COVID-19 in patients with suspected symptoms. When chest CT findings are typical for COVID-19, close contact, loss of taste or smell, lower white blood cell count, and higher fibrinogen are good predictors for COVID-19.","Amano, Yosuke; Kage, Hidenori; Tanaka, Goh; Gonoi, Wataru; Nakai, Yudai; Kurokawa, Ryo; Inui, Shohei; Okamoto, Koh; Harada, Sohei; Iwabu, Masato; Morizaki, Yutaka; Abe, Osamu; Moriya, Kyoji; Nagase, Takahide",Respir Investig,51,20

Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies and publicly available data to quantify the association between predisposing health conditions, demographics, and behavioural factors with hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death from COVID-19. We provided ranges of reported and calculated effect estimates and pooled relative risks derived from a meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results 75 studies were included into qualitative and 74 into quantitative synthesis, with study populations ranging from 19 - 44,672 COVID-19 cases. The risk of dying from COVID-19 was significantly associated with cerebrovascular [pooled RR 2.7 (95% CI 1.7-4.1)] and cardiovascular [RR 3.2 (CI 2.3-4.5)] diseases, hypertension [RR 2.6 (CI 2.0-3.4)], and renal disease [RR 2.5 (CI 1.8-3.4)]. Health care workers had lower risk for death and severe outcomes of disease (RR 0.1 (CI 0.1-0.3). Our meta-regression showed a decrease of the effect of some comorbidities on severity of disease with higher median age of study populations. Associations between comorbidities and hospitalisation and ICU admission were less strong than for death. Conclusions We obtained robust estimates on the magnitude of risk for COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death associated with comorbidities, demographic, and behavioural risk factors. We identified and confirmed population groups that are vulnerable and that require targeted prevention approaches.","Fernandez Villalobos, N. V.; Ott, J. J.; Klett-Tammen, C.

Several pathogenic mechanisms have been hypothesized, without conclusive results. In this study, we evaluated the most frequent neurological symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and also investigated the possible relationship between plasmatic inflammatory indices and olfactory disorders (ODs) and between muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A structured questionnaire concerning typical and neurological symptoms, focusing on headache, dizziness, ODs, taste disorders (TDs), and muscle pain, was administrated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Common neurological symptoms were reported in the early phase of the disease, with a median onset ranging from 1 to 3 days. Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs. Muscle pain did not show any association with CK level but was more frequently associated with arthralgia and headache. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, ODs were an early symptom of COVID-19, more frequently reported by patients with milder forms of disease. Headache in association with arthralgia and muscle pain seems to reflect the common symptoms of the flu-like syndrome, and not COVID-19 infection-specific.","Vacchiano, Veria; Riguzzi, P.; Volpi, L.; Tappatà, M.; Avoni, P.; Rizzo, G.; Guerra, L.; Zaccaroni, S.; Cortelli, P.; Michelucci, R.; Liguori, R.",Neurol Sci,51,20

Since then, many countries have joined efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. A central task for governments is the rapid and effective identification of COVID-19 positive patients. While many molecular tests currently exist, not all hospitals have immediate access to these. However, CT scans, which are readily available at most hospitals, offer an additional method to diagnose COVID-19. As a result, hospitals lacking molecular tests can benefit from it as a way of mitigating said shortage. Furthermore, radiologists have come to achieve accuracy levels over 80% on identifying COVID-19 cases by CT scan image analysis. This paper adds to the existing literature a model based on ensemble methods and 2-stage transfer learning to detect COVID-19 cases based on CT scan images, relying on a simple architecture, yet complex enough model definition, to attain a competitive performance. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 86.70%, an F1 score of 85.86% and an AUC of 90.82%, proving capable of assisting radiologists with COVID-19 diagnosis.

Model the effect of partial and full reversal of containment measures on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Ecuador. Methods. Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 before and after the implementation (and reversal) of containment measures. A Healthcare Compartmental Epidemic Model (HeCEM), which accounts for Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission rates, was developed to also simulate the effect of reversing social distancing containment measures. Reported COVID-19 cases between February 29th and April 23rd, 2020 were obtained from the Servicio Nacional de Gesti&oacuten de Riesgos y Emergencia, the national emergency management office of Ecuador. An ARIMA model was used to forecast reported number of cases based on the reported number of cases. SIR, HeCEM, and ARIMA model prediction errors were estimated. Results. SIR and HeCEM models predict that, at the moment, hospital and ICU bed needs for COVID-19 patients exceed the capacity in Ecuador. Partial or full reversal of containment measures before reaching the point where hospital and ICU beds are enough to meet the expected demand will result in secondary waves that delay reaching this equilibrium, resulting in thousands of excess deaths. Forecasts predict over 50,000 reported COVID-19 cases by July 25th, 2020. Conclusion. Partial reversal of containment measures should occur only after enough hospital and beds are available to meet the demand.","Reina Ortiz, M.; Sharma, V.",,51,1

However, the U.S. physician workforce has relatively few Black physicians. Blacks comprise approximately 13% of the U.S. population but only 5% of practicing physicians. In this Invited Commentary, the authors caution that the COVID-19 pandemic may erode the meager progress that has been made in increasing the number of Black physicians. This loss of Black physicians may happen because Black patients are overrepresented among cases of COVID-19, Black physicians care for relatively more Black patients often in settings with less access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and personal protective equipment, and Black physicians have more comorbid chronic conditions that increase their own susceptibility to mortality from COVID-19. All organizations in which physicians train and practice must redouble their efforts to recruit, train, and retain Black physicians. If nothing else, the COVID-19 pandemic must make academic health centers and health care systems recognize Black physicians as the precious resource they are and protect and reward them accordingly.","Filut, Amarette; Carnes, Molly",Acad Med,51,1

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is safe and effective for the treatment of COVID‐19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS and LOVE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to 2 March evaluating the effects of vitamin D for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19). Two authors selected the studies and analysed the data evidence following Cochrane Recommendations. RESULTS: We included three RCTs with a total of 385 participants. We found low certainty evidence indicating that hospitalised patients under calcifediol plus standard care (SC) treatment seem to present a significantly lower risk of being admitted to ICU but no difference in mortality. We found low to very low certainty evidence that the improvement in fibrinogen levels is slightly greater in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with COVID‐19 that used cholecalciferol plus SC than in those treated with placebo plus SC (mean difference), and the patients who used cholecalciferol plus SC achieved more SARS‐CoV‐2 negativity, but not on d‐dimer, c‐reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin compared with the patients in the placebo plus SC group. We also found low to moderate certainty evidence that a single high dose of vitamin D does not seem to be effective for reducing mortality, length of hospital stay, ICU admissions and d‐dimer or CRP levels when used in patients with moderate to severe COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: As a practical implication, the use of vitamin D associated with SC seems to provide some benefit to patients with COVID‐19. However, the evidence is currently insufficient to support the routine use of vitamin D for the management of COVID‐19, as its effectiveness seems to depend on the dosage, on the baseline vitamin D levels, and on the degree of COVID‐19 severity.","da Rocha, Aline Pereira; Atallah, Alvaro Nagib; Aldrighi, José Mendes; Pires, Andréa Larissa Ribeiro; dos Santos Puga, Maria Eduarda; Pinto, Ana Carolina Pereira Nunes",Int J Clin Pract,51,28

The cohort of COVID-19 patients consisted of groups of subjects with mild, moderate, and severe illness, 50 examinees each. Forty-four healthy subjects of the respective age were involved in the current study as the control group. Serum metal levels were evaluated using inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Examination of COVID-19 patients demonstrated that heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, C-reactive protein levels, as well as lung damage increased significantly with COVID-19 severity, whereas SpO(2) decreased gradually. Increasing COVID-19 severity was also associated with a significant gradual decrease in serum Ca, Fe, Se, Zn levels as compared to controls, whereas serum Cu and especially Cu/Zn ratio were elevated. No significant group differences in serum Mg and Mn levels were observed. Serum Ca, Fe, Se, Zn correlated positively with SpO(2), being inversely associated with fever, lung damage, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Opposite correlations were observed for Cu and Cu/Zn ratio. In regression models, serum Se levels were inversely associated with lung damage independently of other markers of disease severity, anthropometric, biochemical, and hemostatic parameters. Cu/Zn ratio was also considered as a significant predictor of lower SpO(2) in adjusted regression models. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that metal metabolism significantly interferes with COVID-19 pathogenesis, although the causal relations as well as precise mechanisms are yet to be characterized.","Skalny, Anatoly V.; Timashev, Peter S.; Aschner, Michael; Aaseth, Jan; Chernova, Lyubov N.; Belyaev, Vladimir E.; Grabeklis, Andrey R.; Notova, Svetlana V.; Lobinski, Ryszard; Tsatsakis, Aristides; Svistunov, Andrey A.; Fomin, Victor V.; Tinkov, Alexey A.; Glybochko, Peter V.",Metabolites,51,24

This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. METHODS: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. FINDINGS: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would ‘somewhat’ affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84·9% had performed ≥1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93·4% performed ≥1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI 2.6–11·0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4·0, 95% CI: 1·8–8·7), higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1·5–9.3), higher trust in government (aOR: 6.0, 95% CI: 2.6–11.0) and higher level of concern if self-isolated (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1–3.0). INTERPRETATION: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","Seale, Holly; Heywood, Anita E.; Leask, Julie; Sheel, Meru; Thomas, Susan; Durrheim, David N.; Bolsewicz, Katarzyna; Kaur, Rajneesh",PLoS One,51,1

A unique packaging strategy, involving recognition of briding viral RNA by both Pol precursor and Gag as well as potential Gag-Pol protein interactions, ensures Pol particle encapsidation. RESULTS: Several Prototype FV (PFV) Gag-Pol fusion protein constructs were generated to examine whether PFV replication is compatible with an orthoretroviral-like Pol expression. During their analysis, non-particle-associated secreted Pol precursor protein was discovered in extracellular wild type PFV particle preparations of different origin, copurifying in simple virion enrichment protocols. Different analysis methods suggest that extracellular wild type PFV particles contain predominantly mature p85(PR-RT )and p40(IN )Pol subunits. Characterization of various PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs revealed that PFV Pol expression in an orthoretroviral manner is compatible with PFV replication as long as a proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol proteins is possible. PFV Gag-Pol translation by a HIV-1 like ribosomal frameshift signal resulted in production of replication-competent virions, although cell- and particle-associated Pol levels were reduced in comparison to wild type. In-frame fusion of PFV Gag and Pol ORFs led to increased cellular Pol levels, but particle incorporation was only marginally elevated. Unlike that reported for similar orthoretroviral constructs, a full-length in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion construct showed wildtype-like particle release and infectivity characteristics. In contrast, in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion with C-terminal Gag ORF truncations or non-removable Gag peptide addition to Pol displayed wildtype particle release, but reduced particle infectivity. PFV Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins with inactivated protease were highly deficient in regular particle release, although coexpression of p71(Gag )resulted in a significant copackaging of these proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Non-particle associated PFV Pol appears to be naturally released from infected cells by a yet unknown mechanism. The absence of particle-associated Pol precursor suggests its rapid processing upon particle incorporation. Analysis of different PFV Gag-Pol fusion constructs demonstrates that orthoretroviral-like Pol expression is compatible with FV replication in principal as long as fusion protein processing is possible. Furthermore, unlike orthoretroviruses, PFV particle release and infectivity tolerate larger differences in relative cellular Gag/Pol levels.","Swiersy, Anka; Wiek, Constanze; Reh, Juliane; Zentgraf, Hanswalter; Lindemann, Dirk",Retrovirology,51,1

No epidemic has ever been truly predicted, rather than being merely noticed when it was already ongoing. Modelling the future course of an epidemic is similarly tenuous, as exemplified by ominous predictions during the last influenza pandemic leading to exaggerated national responses. The continuous evolution of microorganisms, the introduction of new pathogens into the human population and the interactions of a specific pathogen with the environment, vectors, intermediate hosts, reservoir animals and other microorganisms are far too complex to be predictable. Our environment is changing at an unprecedented rate, and human-related factors, which are essential components of any epidemic prediction model, are difficult to foresee in our increasingly dynamic societies. Any epidemiological model is, by definition, an abstraction of the real world, and fundamental assumptions and simplifications are therefore required. Indicator-based surveillance methods and, more recently, Internet biosurveillance systems can detect and monitor outbreaks of infections more rapidly and accurately than ever before. As the interactions between microorganisms, humans and the environment are too numerous and unexpected to be accurately represented in a mathematical model, we argue that prediction and model-based management of epidemics in their early phase are quite unlikely to become the norm.","Neuberger, A.; Paul, M.; Nizar, A.; Raoult, D.",Clin Microbiol Infect,51,24

It reveals that the bilayer with ~ 500 nm thick PVDF-HFP layer and ~ 50 nm thin layer of Teflon results in the maximum value of effective dielectric constant, ε ≈ 8. Besides this gain, dc-voltage EW response exhibits hysteresis mainly due to polarization in the ferroelectric layer such that, hysteretic offset voltage was found to depend on the applied voltage amplitude and thickness of the dielectrics. Finally, bilayer was subjected to ac-voltage EW in silicone oil for ambient temperature ranging from − 25 to 70 °C. The consistent EW response in this ambient without any degradation/delamination of polymer surface confirmed the durability of the bilayer on the transparent ITO electrodes.

In response to the growing number of infections, some countries have introduced restrictions that may have resulted in the change of the lifestyle. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of the lockdown on body weight, physical activity and some eating habits of the society. The survey involving 183 people was conducted using a proprietary questionnaire. The mean age of the study participants was 33 ± 11 and mean height 169 ± 8 cm. An average increase in body weight was observed in 49.18% by 0.63 ± 3.7 kg which was the result of a decrease in physical activity and an increase in food consumption. We also observed a decrease in PAL from 1.64 ± 0.15 to 1.58 ± 0.13 and changes in the amount of food and individual groups of products consumption, including alcohol. Among the study participants who did not lose body mass, there was an average weight gain of 2.25 ± 2.5 kg. In conclusion, an increase of weight was shown in about half of the respondents in the study group which was associated with a decrease in physical activity and an increase in the consumption of total food and high energy density products.","Dobrowolski, Hubert; Włodarek, Dariusz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,51,22

Steroids (Methylprednislone or Dexamethasone) and Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, are approved for treatment of CRS in India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of TCZ and steroid in COVID-19 associated CRS. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Noble hospital and Research Centre (NHRC), Pune, India between April 2 and November 2, 2020. All patients administered TCZ and steroids during this period were included. The primary endpoint was incidence of all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were need for mechanical ventilation and incidence of systemic and infectious complications. Baseline and time dependent risk factors significantly associated with death were identified by Relative risk estimation. Out of 2831 admitted patients, 515 (24.3% females) were administered TCZ and steroids. There were 135 deaths (26.2%), while 380 patients (73.8%) had clinical improvement. Mechanical ventilation was required in 242 (47%) patients. Of these, 44.2% (107/242) recovered and were weaned off the ventilator. Thirty seven percent patients were managed in wards and did not need intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Infectious complications like hospital acquired pneumonia, blood stream bacterial and fungal infections were observed in 2.13%, 2.13% and 0.06% patients respectively. Age ≥ 60 years (P = .014), presence of co-morbidities like hypertension (P = .011), IL-6 ≥ 100 pg/ml (P = .002), D-dimer ≥ 1000 ng/ml (P < .0001), CT severity index ≥ 18 (P < .0001) and systemic complications like lung fibrosis (P = .019), cardiac arrhythmia (P < .0001), hypotension (P < .0001) and encephalopathy (P < .0001) were associated with increased risk of death. Combination therapy of TCZ and steroids is likely to be safe and effective in management of COVID-19 associated cytokine release syndrome.

Sex workers in Africa are among one of the vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent. Sex workers are excluded from African government safety net, and this may force some sex workers back to sex work amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the nature of sex work, physical distancing and other precautionary measures are impossible to observe, further compromising COVID-19 response. Sex workers in Africa have been known to face high levels of stigma and discrimination, including limited access to healthcare services. Disruption in HIV care and prevention services due to the pandemic among this key population may have negative impacts on the hard-won achievements in HIV response in Africa. In addition, stigma and discrimination toward sex workers could also make contact tracing challenging and limit access to COVID-19 testing among this vulnerable group. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for the UN Development Program, UN member states all pledged to ensure “no one will be left behind” and to “endeavor to reach the furthest behind first.” This could not be more important than now as sex workers as a part of the population are left behind in COVID-19 response in Africa. It is important that the African government should ensure collective and inclusive response in the fight against COVID-19. Sex workers should not be forgotten in Africa’s COVID-19 response because no one is safe, until all are safe.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Akinokun, Rafiat Tolulope; Micheal, Alumuku Iordepuun; Ilesanmi, Esther Bosede; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am J Trop Med Hyg,51,22

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted healthcare in the United States, including cardiovascular services. The impact of COVID‐19 on IC fellow training in the United States has not been assessed. METHODS: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) surveyed IC fellows training in both accredited and advanced non‐accredited programs, as well as their program directors (PD). RESULTS: 135 IC fellows and 152 PD responded. All respondents noted reductions in procedural volumes beginning in March 2020. At that time, only 43% of IC fellows had performed > 250 PCI. If restrictions were lifted by May 15, 2020 78% of IC fellows believed they would perform > 250 PCI, but fell to only 70% if restrictions persisted until the end of the academic year. 49% of IC fellows felt that their procedural competency was impaired by COVID‐19, while 97% of PD believed that IC fellows would be procedurally competent at the end of their training. Most IC fellows (65%) noted increased stress at work and at home, and many felt that job searches and/or existing offers were adversely affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has substantially affected IC training in the United States, with many fellows at risk of not satisfying current program procedural requirements. These observations support a move to review current IC program requirements and develop mitigation strategies to supplement gaps in education related to reduced procedural volume.

Stock volatility forecasts play a key role in the estimation of equity risk and, thus, in the management actions carried out by financial institutions. Therefore, this paper has the aim of proposing more accurate stock volatility models based on novel machine and deep learning techniques. This paper introduces a neural network-based architecture, called Multi-Transformer. Multi-Transformer is a variant of Transformer models, which have already been successfully applied in the field of natural language processing. Indeed, this paper also adapts traditional Transformer layers in order to be used in volatility forecasting models. The empirical results obtained in this paper suggest that the hybrid models based on Multi-Transformer and Transformer layers are more accurate and, hence, they lead to more appropriate risk measures than other autoregressive algorithms or hybrid models based on feed forward layers or long short term memory cells.","Ramos-P'erez, Eduardo; Alonso-Gonz'alez, Pablo J.; N'unez-Vel'azquez, Jos'e Javier",Mathematics,51,16

By taking advantage of the characteristic of a high angle of view, this paper demonstrates a system that recognizes micro-behaviors and a small group discussion with a single 360 degree camera towards quantified meeting analysis. We propose a method that recognizes speaking and nodding, which have often been overlooked in existing research, from a video stream of face images and a random forest classifier. The proposed approach was evaluated on our three datasets. In order to create the first and the second datasets, we asked participants to meet physically: 16 sets of five minutes data from 21 unique participants and seven sets of 10 min meeting data from 12 unique participants. The experimental results showed that our approach could detect speaking and nodding with a macro average f1-score of 67.9% in a 10-fold random split cross-validation and a macro average f1-score of 62.5% in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. By considering the increased demand for an online meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also record faces on a screen that are captured by web cameras as the third dataset and discussed the potential and challenges of applying our ideas to virtual video conferences.","Watanabe, Ko; Soneda, Yusuke; Matsuda, Yuki; Nakamura, Yugo; Arakawa, Yutaka; Dengel, Andreas; Ishimaru, Shoya",Sensors (Basel),51,6

In this study, we show for the first time the functional surface modification of E. coli OMVs with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, exploiting a process variably described as molecular painting or protein engineering in eukaryotic membranes, whereby the lipid part of the GPI anchor inserts in cell membranes. By transferring the process to bacterial vesicles, we can generate a hybrid of perfectly eukaryotic proteins (in terms of folding and post-translational modifications) on a prokaryotic platform. We could demonstrate that two different GPI proteins can be displayed on the same OMV. In addition to fluorescent marker proteins, cytokines, growth factors and antigens canb be potentially transferred, generating a versatile modular platform for a novel vaccine strategy.","Zaruba, Marianne; Roschitz, Lena; Sami, Haider; Ogris, Manfred; Gerner, Wilhelm; Metzner, Christoph",Membranes (Basel),51,29

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study was performed including newborns with NEC and newborns without NEC, examining demographic factors and exposures to medications, staff members, and procedures before illness. Stool samples from affected newborns were collected and tested for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. RESULTS: We confirmed a NEC outbreak in the NICU in January 1998 with 8 cases, including 2 deaths, clustered in time and space. Norovirus-like particles were identified in all available stools from cases; norovirus (NoV) was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 4 of 6 samples. NEC cases were younger, had lower Apgar scores, and received antibiotics longer than 25 control subjects. Three NICU health care personnel had more contact with cases than control subjects; 1 staff member recalled having gastroenteritis symptoms around the time of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: This report associates NoV with NEC. NoV appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants. Spatial clustering and epidemiologic links between cases and a health care worker with gastroenteritis suggests that NoV should be investigated among the etiologies of NEC outbreaks and that interventions targeted to interruption of NoV transmission should be considered.","Turcios-Ruiz, Reina M.; Axelrod, Peter; St. John, Keith; Bullitt, Esther; Donahue, Joan; Robinson, Nancy; Friss, Helena E.",J Pediatr,51,21

Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide consistent results. We investigate several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, whereas methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence.","Pipes, Lenore; Wang, Hongru; Huelsenbeck, John P; Nielsen, Rasmus",Mol Biol Evol,51,4

Using a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach, the present systematic review compared and ranked psychosocial interventions for the treatment of PTSD in adult refugees and asylum seekers. METHODS: Randomised studies of psychosocial interventions for adult refugees and asylum seekers with PTSD were systematically identified. PTSD symptoms at postintervention was the primary outcome. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and ORs were pooled using pairwise and NMA. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed through the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis application. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies with 2308 participants were included. Sixteen studies were conducted in high-income countries, and seven in low-income or middle-income countries. Most studies were at low risk of bias according to the Cochrane RoB tool. NMA on PTSD symptoms showed that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (SMD=−1.41; 95% CI −2.43 to −0.38) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) (SMD=−1.30; 95% CI −2.40 to −0.20) were significantly more effective than waitlist (WL). CBT was also associated with a higher decrease in PTSD symptoms than treatment as usual (TAU) (SMD −1.51; 95% CI −2.67 to −0.36). For all other interventions, the difference with WL and TAU was not significant. CBT and EMDR ranked best according to the mean surface under the cumulative ranking. Regarding acceptability, no intervention had less dropouts than inactive interventions. CONCLUSION: CBT and EMDR appeared to have the greatest effects in reducing PTSD symptoms in asylum seekers and refugees. This evidence should be considered in guidelines and implementation packages to facilitate dissemination and uptake in refugee settings.","Turrini, Giulia; Tedeschi, Federico; Cuijpers, Pim; Del Giovane, Cinzia; Kip, Ahlke; Morina, Nexhmedin; Nosè, Michela; Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Purgato, Marianna; Ricciardi, Chiara; Sijbrandij, Marit; Tol, Wietse; Barbui, Corrado",BMJ Glob Health,51,28

Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 × 10(−5)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.","Lewandowski, Kuiama; Xu, Yifei; Pullan, Steven T.; Lumley, Sheila F.; Foster, Dona; Sanderson, Nicholas; Vaughan, Alison; Morgan, Marcus; Bright, Nicole; Kavanagh, James; Vipond, Richard; Carroll, Miles; Marriott, Anthony C.; Gooch, Karen E.; Andersson, Monique; Jeffery, Katie; Peto, Timothy E.

Quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to measure PCBP2 messenger RNA and protein expression in glioma tissues or cells. Cell transfection was completed using Lipofectamine 2000. 3‐(4,5‐Dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry assay were used to explore the effects of PCBP2 expression on biological behaviors of glioma cells. Western blot assay was used for the detection of pathway related proteins. Expression of PCBP2 in glioma tissues and cells were higher than that in paracancerous tissues and normal cells (both p < .01). Moreover, the elevated expression of PCBP2 was significantly correlated with tumor size (p = .001) and WHO stage (p = .010). Knockdown of PCBP2 could suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells and promote apoptosis. Besides, the expression of transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) pathway related proteins TGF‐β1, p‐Smad2 and p‐Smad7 were decreased following the downregulation of PCBP2. PCBP2 also inhibited FHL3 expression by binding to FHL3‐3′UTR. The inhibition of FHL3 could reverse the antitumor action caused by PCBP2 silencing. In vivo assay, PCBP2 was also found to inhibit the tumor growth of glioma. PCBP2 activates TGF‐β/Smad signaling pathway by inhibiting FHL3 expression, thus promoting the development and progression of glioma.","Mao, Jianhui; Sun, Zhaosheng; Cui, Yongjian; Du, Naiyi; Guo, Hong; Wei, Jianhui; Hao, Zhenmin; Zheng, Lei",J Cell Physiol,51,20

In addition, effects of working in private practice or governmental practice in terms of pandemic are also evaluated in the manuscript. METHODS: A questionnaire was prepared to elicit dentists' working conditions during the pandemic and analyze and evaluate the policies implemented for dentistry. The questionnaires were sent to the dentists registered in the Turkish Dental Association (TDA) via e‐mail, and collected between September 30, 2020, and October 20, 2020. Descriptive statistical methods, validity and reliability analysis, and regression analysis were applied for data analysis. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty‐four dentists registered in the Turkish Dental Association took part in the study. 47% of respondents examined five or fewer patients per day during the pandemic. Dentists working in private practice examine more patients per day during the pandemic. 80.8% of the respondents experienced anxiety while examining patients during the pandemic. While the dentist's anxiety level increased with increasing the number of patients examined per day (β: 0.399), it decreased with increasing the dentist's age (β: −0.065). Respondents were not satisfied with the pandemic's management, with the decisions taken regarding dentistry, and with the supports provided to the dentists. 85.8% of the respondents were concerned about their professional future, which is higher among dentists who work in governmental practice (p < 0.05, ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing dentists' representation in the management of the pandemic and the future policy‐making process, taking steps for the future by creating planning processes will eliminate the uncertainties and dissatisfaction and ensure to be ready for new pandemics.","Çelik, Osman Evren; Cansever, İbrahim Hüseyin",Clin Exp Dent Res,51,5

In this article, we have fished and compiled the needed information on the drug, that will help readers and prospective investigators in having a quick overview. Though the primordial biological action of the drug is allosteric modulation of helminthic ion channel receptor, its in vitro activity against both RNA and DNA viruses is known for almost a decade. In the past two years, efficacy study in animal models of pseudorabies and zika virus was found to be favourable and unfavourable respectively. Only one clinical study evaluated the drug in dengue virus infection without any clinical efficacy. However, the proposed mechanism of drug action, by inhibiting the importin family of nucleus-cytoplasmic transporters along with favourable pharmacokinetics, warrants exploration of its role in COVID 19 through safely conducted clinical trials. Being an available and affordable drug, enlisted in WHO List of Essential Medicine, and a long track record of clinical safety, the drug is already in clinical trials the world over.

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, CD8(+) T lymphocytes are found in spinal cord and brainstem lesions. However, the exact phenotype of central nervous system-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the mechanism by which these cells cross the blood–brain barrier remain largely unknown. Using cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and coronavirus-induced encephalitis, we demonstrate that central nervous system-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes are mostly of the effector memory phenotype (CD62L(−) CCR7(−) granzymeB(hi)). We further show that purified human effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes transmigrate more readily across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells than non-effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and that blood-brain barrier endothelium promotes the selective recruitment of effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the recruitment of interferon-γ- and interleukin-17-secreting CD8(+) T lymphocytes by human and mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium. Finally, we show that in vitro migration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells is dependent on α4 integrin, but independent of intercellular adhesion molecule-1/leucocyte function-associated antigen-1, activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule/CD6 and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2. We also demonstrate that in vivo neutralization of very late antigen-4 restricts central nervous system infiltration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in active immunization and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Our study thus demonstrates an active role of the blood-brain barrier in the recruitment of effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment and defines α4 integrin as a major contributor of CD8(+) T lymphocyte entry into the brain.","Ifergan, Igal; Kebir, Hania; Alvarez, Jorge I.; Marceau, Gabriel; Bernard, Monique; Bourbonnière, Lyne; Poirier, Josée; Duquette, Pierre; Talbot, Pierre J.; Arbour, Nathalie; Prat, Alexandre",Brain,51,20

Outcomes were compared using contingency table and quantile regression to test the equality of medians between the pandemic waves and by viral load groups. RESULTS: Of the 11,564 samples tested, 1,319 (11.4%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. An increase in weekly median viral load occurred in the second wave of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. This population was more likely to be women, outpatients, symptomatic and have an extremely high or high viral load. In patients with multiple RT-PCR positive tests, the duration of viral shedding was comparable between individuals with asymptomatic/mild and mild/moderate illness severity. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a small group of individuals with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 viral load with mild illness.

At present, although the global epidemic situation is leveling off and vaccine doses have been administered in a large amount, confirmed cases are still emerging around the world. To make up for the missed diagnosis caused by the uncertainty of nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, utilizing lung CT examination as a combined detection method to improve the diagnostic rate becomes a necessity. Our research considered the time-consuming and labor-intensive characteristics of the traditional CT analyzing process, and developed an efficient deep learning framework named CSGBBNet to solve the binary classification task of COVID-19 images based on a COVID-Seg model for image preprocessing and a GBBNet for classification. The five runs with random seed on the test set showed our novel framework can rapidly analyze CT scan images and give out effective results for assisting COVID-19 detection, with the mean accuracy of 98.49 ± 1.23%, the sensitivity of 99.00 ± 2.00%, the specificity of 97.95 ± 2.51%, the precision of 98.10 ± 2.61%, and the F1 score of 98.51 ± 1.22%.

We determined the differences in SARS-CoV-2 viral load dynamics between nasopharyngeal samples of infected asymptomatic and symptomatic children. Serial cycle threshold values of SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx of a cohort of infected children were collected for analysis. Among 17 infected children, 10 (58.8%) were symptomatic. Symptomatic children, when compared to asymptomatic children, had higher viral loads (mean cycle threshold on day 7 of illness 28.6 vs. 36.7, P = 0.02). Peak SARS-CoV-2 viral loads occurred around day 2 of illness in infected children. Although we were unable to directly demonstrate infectivity, the detection of significant amount of virus in the upper airway of asymptomatic children suggest that they have the potential to shed and transmit SARS-CoV-2.

As countries around the world battle this outbreak, mass media has played an active role in disseminating public health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of the role that the Canadian media played during the pandemic and to investigate the patterns of topics covered by media news reporting. METHODS: We used a data set consisting of news articles published on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) website between December 2019 and May 2020. We then used Python software to analyze the data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling. Subsequently, we used the pyLDAvis tool to plot these topics on a 2D plane through multidimensional scaling and divided these topics into different themes. RESULTS: After removing articles that were published before the year 2019, we identified 6771 relevant news articles. According to the CV coherence value, we divided these articles into 15 topics, which were categorized into 6 themes. The three most popular themes were case reporting and testing (n=1738), Canadian response to the pandemic (n=1259), and changes to social life (n=1171), which accounted for 25.67%, 18.59%, and 17.29% of the total articles, respectively.

However, depending on the family and molecular function, they can also display substrate promiscuity which can also be essential. Databases compiling specificity matrices derived from experimental assays have provided valuable insights into protease substrate recognition. Despite this, there are still gaps in our knowledge of the structural determinants. Here, we compile a set of protease crystal structures with bound peptide-like ligands to create a protocol for modelling substrates bound to protease structures, and for studying observables associated to the binding recognition. RESULTS: As an application, we modelled a subset of protease–peptide complexes for which experimental cleavage data are available to compare with informational entropies obtained from protease–specificity matrices. The modelled complexes were subjected to conformational sampling using the Backrub method in Rosetta, and multiple observables from the simulations were calculated and compared per peptide position. We found that some of the calculated structural observables, such as the relative accessible surface area and the interaction energy, can help characterize a protease’s substrate recognition, giving insights for the potential prediction of novel substrates by combining additional approaches. CONCLUSION: Overall, our approach provides a repository of protease structures with annotated data, and an open source computational protocol to reproduce the modelling and dynamic analysis of the protease–peptide complexes.","Ochoa, Rodrigo; Magnitov, Mikhail; Laskowski, Roman A.; Cossio, Pilar; Thornton, Janet M.",BMC Bioinformatics,51,20

Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, with sufficient data in their medical records for grading of clinical suspicion were eligible. In addition to examining the first RT-PCR test of repeat-tested individuals, we also used high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 as the reference standard for calculating the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: All 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2% women) admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1% women) was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. The sensitivity (95% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases (repeat-tested patients) was 85.7% (81.5–89.1%) inpatients; 95.5% (92.2–97.5%) outpatients, 89.9% (88.2–92.1%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the sensitivity (95% CI) was: 67.5% (62.9–71.9%) inpatients; 34.9% (31.4–38.5%) outpatients; 47.3% (44.4–50.3%) all. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best.

Although rapid antigen test is not as sensitive as the gold standard RT-PCR, the time to result is decreased by day(s), strengthening the effectiveness of contact tracing. Methods The Roche/SD Biosensor lateral flow antigen rapid test was evaluated in a mild symptomatic population at a large drive through testing site. A second nasopharyngeal swab was directly tested with the rapid test on site and results were compared to RT-PCR and virus culture. Date of onset and symptoms were analysed using data from a clinical questionnaire. Results We included 970 persons with complete data. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 84.9% (CI95% 79.1-89.4) and 99.5% (CI95% 98.7-99.8) which translated into a positive predictive value of 97.5% (CI95% 94.0-99.5) under the current regional PCR positivity of 19.2%. Sensitivity for people with high loads of viral RNA (ct <30, 2.17E+05 E gene copy/ml) and who presented within 7 days since symptom onset increased to 95.8% (CI95% 90.5-98.2). Band intensity and time to result correlated strongly with viral load thus strong positive bands could be read before the recommended time. Around 98% of all viable specimen with ct <30 were detected successfully indicating that the large majority of infectious people can be captured with this test.

Neutralization by 47D1 is achieved independent of interfering RBD-ACE2 binding. A crystal structure of the mAb-RBD complex shows that the IF motif at the tip of 47D1 CDR H2 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the RBD.

Aucun patient n’avait de signes IRM d’encéphalite ni de pléiocytose à la ponction lombaire. La PCR SARS-CoV-2 dans le liquide céphalorachidien (LCR) était négative dans les 4 cas. Les taux d’interleukine-6 dans le LCR étaient élevés dans 2 cas. Les 4 patients présentaient des anomalies identiques du métabolisme cérébral à la TEP-FDG, à savoir un hypométabolisme orbito-frontal associé à un hypermétabolisme cérébelleux. Nous avons noté une amélioration clinique neurologique chez les 4 patients suite à l’instauration d’un traitement immunomodulateur (corticothérapie systémique et/ou immunoglobulines intraveineuses). Conclusion Malgré des présentations cliniques neurologiques variables, les exploration TEP-FDG cérébrales ont révélé des anomalies du métabolisme cérébral, qui pourrait être le reflet d’un mécanisme immunologique para- ou post-infectieux. La TEP-FDG cérébrale pourrait dans ce contexte guider l’instauration d’un traitement immunomodulateur.","Delorme, C.; Paccoud, O.; Kas, A.; Hesters, A.; Bombois, S.; Maatoug, R.; Navarro, V.; Bruneteau, G.; Demeret, S.; Pourcher, V.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,51,29

In addition, there is a lack of data for young adults. This study was conducted to assess risk factors predicting COVID-19 severity and mortality in hospitalized young adults. A retrospective observational study was conducted at two centers from China and India on COVID-19 patients aged 20-50 years. Regression analysis to predict adverse outcomes was performed using parameters including age, sex, country of origin, hospitalization duration, comorbidities, lymphocyte count, and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) score at admission. A total of 420 patients (172 East Asians and 248 South Asians) were included. The predictive model for intensive care unit (ICU) admission with variables NEWS2 Category II and higher, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, and low lymphocyte counts had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.930 with a sensitivity of 0.931 and a specificity of 0.784. The predictive model for mortality with NEWS2 Category III, cancer, and decreasing lymphocyte count had an AUC value of 0.883 with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.701. A combined predictive model with bronchial asthma and low lymphocyte count, in contrast, had an AUC value of 0.768 with a sensitivity of 0.828 and a specificity of 0.719 for NEWS2 score (5 or above) at presentation. NEWS2 supplemented with comorbidity profile and lymphocyte count could help identify hospitalized young adults at risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.","Panda, Smriti; Roy, Sankanika; Garg, Rohit K; Hui, Gan; Gorard, Jack; Bhutada, Mayank; Sun, Yuanli; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Mohan, Anant; Dar, Lalit; Liu, Mao",J. med. virol,51,2
