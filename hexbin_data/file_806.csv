So it becomes obligatory to assess the costs and benefits of a new technology, before defining its clinical value. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as compared to 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2-DRT) and 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treating head and neck cancers (HNC) in India. The cost-effectiveness of 3-DCRT as compared to 2-DRT was also estimated. METHODS A probabilistic Markov model was designed. Using a disaggregated societal perspective, lifetime study horizon and 3 percent discount rate, future costs and health outcomes were compared for a cohort of 1000 patients treated with any of the three radiation techniques. Data on health system cost, out of pocket expenditure, and quality of life was assessed through primary data collected from a large tertiary care public sector hospital in India. Data on xerostomia rates following each of the radiation techniques was extracted from the existing randomized controlled trials. RESULTS IMRT incurs an incremental cost of $7,072 (2,932-13,258) and $5,164 (463-10,954) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to 2-DRT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Further, 3D-CRT as compared to 2-DRT requires an incremental cost of $8,946 (1,996-19,313) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION Both IMRT and 3D-CRT are not cost-effective at 1 times GDP per capita for treating HNC in India. The costs and benefits of using IMRT for other potential indications (e.g. prostate, lung) require to be assessed before considering its introduction in India.","Chauhan, Akashdeep Singh; Prinja, Shankar; Ghoshal, Sushmita; Verma, Roshan",International journal of technology assessment in health care,806,1

We hypothesize that the vascular response is dependent on FD design, and CD34+ progenitor cells play an important role in the endothelialization of the implant. METHODS Sixteen rabbit aneurysms were randomly treated with two different single-layer braided FDs made of cobalt-chrome alloys. The FD-48 and FD-72 devices had 48 and 72 wires, respectively. Aneurysm occlusion rate was assessed during the final digital subtraction angiogram at 10, 20, 30, and 60 days (n=2 per device per time point). Implanted vessels were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy for tissue coverage, endothelialization, and immuno-gold labeling for CD34+ cells. RESULTS Complete aneurysm occlusion rates were similar between the devices; however, complete or near complete occlusion was more frequently observed in aneurysms with neck ≤4.2 mm (p=0.008). Total tissue coverage at 10 days over the surface of the FD-48 and FD-72 devices was 56.4±11.6% and 76.6±3.6%, respectively. Endothelial cell growth over the surface was time-dependent for the FD-72 device (Spearman's r=0.86, p=0.013) but not for the FD-48 device (Spearman's r=-0.59, p=0.094). The endothelialization score was marginally correlated with the distance from the aneurysm neck for the FD-48 device (Spearman's r=1, p=0.083) but not for the FD-72 device (Spearman's r=0.8, p=0.33). CD34+ cells were present along the entirety of both devices at all time points. CONCLUSIONS This study gives preliminary evidence that temporal and spatial endothelialization is dependent on FD design. Circulating CD34+ progenitor cells contribute to endothelialization throughout the healing process.","Marosfoi, Miklos; Langan, Erin T; Strittmatter, Lara; van der Marel, Kajo; Vedantham, Srinivasan; Arends, Jennifer; Lylyk, Ivan R; Loganathan, Siddharth; Hendricks, Gregory M; Szikora, Istvan; Puri, Ajit S; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Gounis, Matthew J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,806,24

Canada reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020. By March 2020 the virus had spread within Canadian communities reaching the most frail and vulnerable elderly population in long-term care facilities. The majority of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia and the highest mortality was seen among individuals aged 65 years or older. Canada has the highest prevalence and incidence rates of several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease. Many elderly Canadians also live with comorbid medical illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease and are more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 with a poor prognosis. It is becoming increasingly evident that underlying inflammatory disease contributes to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we review the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host inflammatory responses that lead to resolution or progression to severe COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we discuss the landscape of COVID-19 therapeutics that are currently in development in Canada.","Willows, Steven Derald; Alam, Syed Benazir; Sandhu, Jagdeep K; Kulka, Marianna",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,806,16

Cilia are involved in a variety of cellular functions and perceptions, with one of them being the sense of smell. Hyposmia is a typical feature found in patients with BBS. However, reports of olfactory dysfunction in other cystic kidney diseases are sparse. Here we provide a systematic survey on olfaction in a large cohort of patients displaying genetically determined renal ciliopathies. METHODS We performed a match-controlled systematic olfactory evaluation in a group of 75 patients with a defined genetic background using age adapted and validated odour identification tests. RESULTS Test results revealed a significant olfactory deficit in patients carrying TMEM67 variants (n=4), while all other genetic disorders causing nephronophthisis (n=25) or polycystic kidney disease (n=18) were not associated with an impaired sense of smell. Also in patients with BBS, olfactory performance was depending on the underlying molecular defect. While defects in the BBS1 gene (n=9) had no impact on the sense of smell, all other BBS gene disorders (n=19) were associated with significant hyposmia. Noteworthy, there was no correlation of the olfactory deficit with the level of renal impairment. CONCLUSION Hyposmia is a part of the clinical spectrum of BBS and of other renal ciliopathies. Depending on the genetic background, clinicians should be aware of this subtle and so far underappreciated symptom when clinically assessing patients with BBS or TMEM67 gene variants.","Dahmer-Heath, Mareike; Schriever, Valentin; Kollmann, Sabine; Schleithoff, Carolin; Titieni, Andrea; Cetiner, Metin; Patzer, Ludwig; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Hansen, Matthias; Pennekamp, Petra; Gerß, Joachim; Konrad, Martin; König, Jens",Journal of medical genetics,806,1

While there is medical advice relating to stages in the female lifecycle, it neglects women-specific practical aspects despite their ability to harm travellers' health and cause inconvenience. This paper discusses comprehensively three major aspects of travel as they relate to women. First, it suggests the management of personal hygiene, bodily functions, menstruation and sexual behaviour, and alerts to the limited knowledge on travel mental health issues.Second, apart from travelling in a female body with its specific demands, being a woman requires special attention to safety and security. Within various travel contexts, women have many opportunities for minimising potential risks.Finally, guided by travel medicine's acknowledgment of its role in the concept of responsible travel, this article goes beyond the usual general statements and broad advice and offers detailed and practical suggestions on how the female traveller can contribute to the overall goal of minimising any potential harm to fellow humans and the natural environment. Recognising the scarcity of women-specific travel information, pathways to better education, and a range of suggestions for urgent research facilitate the provision of high-quality travel health care tailored specifically to women's needs.","Bauer, Irmgard L","Tropical diseases, travel medicine and vaccines",806,24

Previous studies have shown that BIV Rev localizes in the nucleus and nucleolus of infected cells. Here we report the characterization of the nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS) of this protein. Through transfection of a series of deletion mutants of BIV Rev fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein and fluorescence microscopy analyses, we were able to map the NLS region between aa 71 and 110 of the protein. Remarkably, by conducting alanine substitution of basic residues within the aa 71 to 110 sequence, we demonstrated that the BIV Rev NLS is bipartite, maps to aa 71 to 74 and 95 to 101, and is predominantly composed of arginine residues. This is the first report of a bipartite Rev (or Rev-like) NLS in a lentivirus/retrovirus. Moreover, this NLS is atypical, as the length of the sequence between the motifs composing the bipartite NLS, e.g., the spacer sequence, is 20 aa. Further mutagenesis experiments also identified the NoLS region of BIV Rev. It localizes mainly within the NLS spacer sequence. In addition, the BIV Rev NoLS sequence differs from the consensus sequence reported for other viral and cellular nucleolar proteins. In summary, we conclude that the nucleolar and nuclear localizations of BIV Rev are mediated via novel NLS and NoLS motifs.","Gomez Corredor, Andrea; Archambault, Denis",Journal of virology,806,31

The chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and turkey parvovirus (TuPV) belong to the Aveparvovirus genus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. Poultry parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses consisting of three open reading frames, the first two encoding the non-structural protein (NS) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP) and the third encoding the viral capsid proteins 1 (VP1 and VP2). In contrast to other parvoviruses, the VP1-unique region does not contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies suggested the parvoviruses to be the candidate pathogens in cases of enteric disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for poultry parvovirus detection include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Moreover, sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms have allowed rapid and simultaneous detection of the parvovirus from affected and healthy birds. There is no commercial vaccine; hence, the development of an effective vaccine to control the spread of infection should be of primary importance. This review presents the current knowledge on poultry parvoviruses with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship, genomic analysis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods.","Kapgate, Sunil S; Kumanan, K; Vijayarani, K; Barbuddhe, Sukhadeo B",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,806,1

The population and health care system in Mexico City experienced the first and greatest early burden of critical illness. OBJECTIVE To describe baseline characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of consecutive critically ill patients in Mexico hospitals that treated the majority of such patients with confirmed, probable, or suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Observational study of 58 critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at 6 hospitals between March 24 and June 1, 2009. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, illness progression, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected using a piloted case report form. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included rate of 2009 influenza (A)H1N1-related critical illness and mechanical ventilation as well as intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay. RESULTS Critical illness occurred in 58 of 899 patients (6.5%) admitted to the hospital with confirmed, probable, or suspected 2009 influenza (A)H1N1. Patients were young (median, 44.0 [range, 10-83] years); all presented with fever and all but 1 with respiratory symptoms. Few patients had comorbid respiratory disorders, but 21 (36%) were obese. Time from hospital to ICU admission was short (median, 1 day [interquartile range {IQR}, 0-3 days]), and all patients but 2 received mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory hypoxemia (median day 1 ratio of Pao(2) to fraction of inspired oxygen, 83 [IQR, 59-145] mm Hg). By 60 days, 24 patients had died (41.4%; 95% confidence interval, 28.9%-55.0%). Patients who died had greater initial severity of illness, worse hypoxemia, higher creatine kinase levels, higher creatinine levels, and ongoing organ dysfunction. After adjusting for a reduced opportunity of patients dying early to receive neuraminidase inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (vs no treatment) was associated with improved survival (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-62.8). CONCLUSION Critical illness from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Mexico occurred in young individuals, was associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock, and had a high case-fatality rate.","Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Lapinsky, Stephen E; Macias, Alejandro E; Pinto, Ruxandra; Espinosa-Perez, Lourdes; de la Torre, Alethse; Poblano-Morales, Manuel; Baltazar-Torres, Jose A; Bautista, Edgar; Martinez, Abril; Martinez, Marco A; Rivero, Eduardo; Valdez, Rafael; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo; Hernández, Martín; Stewart, Thomas E; Fowler, Robert A",JAMA,806,1

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of NESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection for early gastric cancer (EGC). Materials and Methods This was the prospective SENORITA 3 pilot. From July 2017 to January 2018, 20 patients with EGC smaller than 3 cm without an absolute indication for endoscopic submucosal dissection were enrolled. The sentinel basin was detected using Tc99m-phytate and indocyanine green, and the NESS-EFTR procedure was performed when all sentinel basin nodes were tumor-free on frozen pathologic examination. We evaluated the complete resection and intraoperative perforation rates as well as the incidence of postoperative complications. Results Among the 20 enrolled patients, one dropped out due to large tumor size, while another underwent conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy due to metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. All NESS-EFTR procedures were performed in 17 of the 18 other patients (94.4%) without conversion, and the complete resection rate was 83.3% (15/18). The intraoperative perforation rate was 27.8% (5/18), and endoscopic clipping or laparoscopic suturing or stapling was performed at the perforation site. There was one case of postoperative complications treated with endoscopic clipping; the others were discharged without any event. Conclusions NESS-EFTR with sentinel basin dissection is a technically challenging procedure that obtains safe margins, prevents intraoperative perforation, and may be a treatment option for EGC after additional experience.

This instrument assesses the individual's ability to withstand stressors, thrive and make sense of vital challenges. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample included 511 Portuguese physicians. Both versions were validated through the study of internal structure validity, reliability, and convergent validity. The validity of the internal structure was analysed using the principal component analysis technique. Reliability was verified by the internal consistency study. For convergent validity, the correlation coefficients between these versions of the Resilience Scale and other scales validated to measure depression, anxiety, stress, and life satisfaction were calculated. RESULTS Both versions of Resilience Scale showed good internal consistency. For each of the versions, one factor was retained in the principal component analysis. Convergent validity was verified by significant positive correlations between Resilience Scale (25 and 14) and a life satisfaction scale and significant negative correlations between Resilience Scale and depression, anxiety, and stress subscales. DISCUSSION The results show the one-dimensional character of both versions of the Resilience Scale and support their usefulness and validity in the physician's class. CONCLUSION This is the first validation study of this scale in a group of physicians. Its results are very satisfactory, and its use in this specific group is recommended.","Serrão, Carla; Castro, Luísa; Teixeira, Andreia; Rodrigues, Ana Rita; Duarte, Ivone",Acta medica portuguesa,806,33

AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Several lymph node staging strategies have been proposed as a response to the high morbidity seen after standard inguinal lymphadenectomy for penile cancer. A video-endoscopic (laparoscopic and robotic) approach has been proposed as a less morbid procedure in several retrospective studies. To date, none has evaluated the oncological adequacy with regard to whether all relevant nodes have been removed. To the authors' knowledge this is the first prospective study of a robotic or laparoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy that evaluates the oncological adequacy of this approach for penile cancer. The study shows that robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region by removing all relevant lymph nodes as assessed by an independent evaluating urological oncologist. OBJECTIVE To prospectively determine the oncological adequacy of robotic assisted video-endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy (RAVEIL). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with T1-3N0 penile cancer were enrolled into a prospective phase I trial at a tertiary care institution from March 2010 to January 2012. All patients underwent an initial RAVEIL approach. Verification of adequacy of dissection was performed by an independent surgeon via a separate open incision at the conclusion of the RAVEIL procedure. Out of 10 patients, if more than two superficial inguinal fields with ≥2 nodes or more than four with ≥1 node remained within the superficial dissection field, the study would not proceed to phase II. RESULTS Of 10 enrolled patients two had inguinal metastases and all positive nodes were detected by RAVEIL. The remaining eight patients had no metastases, with a mean of nine (range 5-21) left and nine (range 6-17) right nodes removed. One inguinal field RAVEIL was converted to an open dissection. The verifying surgeon confirmed that 18 of 19 inguinal fields (94.7% in nine patients) had an adequate dissection. Two benign nodes were found just beneath Scarpa's fascia above the inguinal dissection field. Limitations of the study include an inability to determine decisively what specific wound complications were related to RAVEIL because of the protocol-specified creation of a small inguinal incision for verification of adequate dissection. CONCLUSION RAVEIL allowed adequate staging of disease in the inguinal region among patients with penile cancer at risk for inguinal metastases.","Matin, Surena F; Cormier, Janice N; Ward, John F; Pisters, Louis L; Wood, Christopher G; Dinney, Colin P N; Royal, Richard E; Huang, Xuelin; Pettaway, Curtis A",BJU international,806,1

DATA SOURCES De-identified summary data derived from medical claims and eligibility files were provided by Independence Blue Cross for women receiving mammograms. STUDY DESIGN We used a difference-in-differences approach to characterize the change in mammograms performed over time and a queueing formula to estimate the time to clear the queue of missed mammograms. DATA COLLECTION We used data from the first 30 weeks of each year from 2018 to 2020. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Over the 20 weeks following March 11, 2020, the volume of screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms fell by 58% and 38% of expected levels, on average. Lowest volumes were observed in week 15 (April 8 to 14), when screening and diagnostic mammograms fell by 99% and 74%, respectively. Volumes began to rebound in week 19 (May), with diagnostic mammograms reaching levels to similar to previous years' and screening mammograms remaining 14% below expectations. We estimate it will take a minimum of 22 weeks to clear the queue of missed mammograms in our study sample.

These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the Covid-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for the entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the down-regulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of Covid-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the Covid-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of Covid-19 strongly depends on the age of a patient. The age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially that of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs careful clinical trials.","Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna",Endokrynologia Polska,806,16

However, chemotherapy has limited therapeutic effects in bladder cancer. One of the reasons of this resistance to chemotherapy is that higher levels of glutathione in invasive bladder cancer cells. We have fabricated nanoparticles that respond to high concentrations of glutathione and near-infrared laser irradiation in order to increase the drug accumulation at the tumor sites and combine chemotherapy with photothermal therapy to overcome the challenges of bladder cancer treatment. METHODS The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were prepared by co-precipitation method. We investigated the tumor targeting capability of NPs in vitro and in vivo. The orthotopic bladder cancer model in C57BL/6 mice was established for in vivo study and the photothermal effects and therapeutic efficacy of NPs were evaluated. RESULTS The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were synthesized using internal cross-linking strategy to increase the stability of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can be ingested by tumor cells in a short time. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have dual sensitivity to high levels of glutathione in bladder cancer cells and near-infrared laser irradiation. Glutathione triggers chemical structural changes of nanoparticles and preliminarily releases drugs, Near-infrared laser irradiation can promote the complete release of the drugs from the nanoparticles and induce a photothermal effect, leading to destroying the tumor cells. Given the excellent tumor-targeting ability and negligible toxicity to normal tissue, DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can greatly increase the concentration of the anti-cancer drugs in tumor cells. The mice treated with DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have a significant reduction in tumor volume. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can be tracked by in vivo imaging system and have good tumor targeting ability, to facilitate our assessment during the experiment. CONCLUSION A nanoparticle delivery system with dual sensitivity to glutathione and near-infrared laser irradiation was developed for delivering IR780 and DOX. Chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of both primary bladder cancer and their metastases was achieved using this advanced delivery system.","Zhu, Guanchen; Wang, Kaikai; Qin, Haixiang; Zhao, Xiaozhi; Chen, Wei; Xu, Linfeng; Cao, Wenmin; Guo, Hongqian",Journal of nanobiotechnology,806,25

Although the fascial tissues used in these procedures are referred to as ""postauricular/retroauricular fascia,"" the sparse anatomical studies that exist use this terminology to describe what is the adjacent thicker and more fibrous structure of the superficial temporal area continuous with the mastoid region, rather than the tissue actually used in these procedures which is adherent to the posterior surface of the ear. There are clear clinical differences in the properties of these two structures, and this study set out to identify the anatomical nature of these differences, looking in detail at the anatomy and vascularity of the fascia directly posterior and adherent to the ear itself, highlighting its unique properties, and how it interfaces with the rest of the fascia. We provide a nomenclature to differentiate the fascia adherent to the posterior of the ear (the intrinsic postauricular fascia) from the more fibrous tissues continuous with the scalp fascia (the extrinsic postauricular fascia). Clinical applications for the fascia are suggested based on the vascularity and anatomy described, and our clinical experience.","Shokrollahi, Kayvan; Taylor, James Paul; Le Roux, Cara M; Ashton, Mark W; Rozen, Warren M; Jones, Nicholas S; Payne, Anthony",Annals of plastic surgery,806,1

This study estimates the rates and educational impacts of experiencing the deaths of immediate (siblings, parents) and extended family members (aunts and uncles, cousins, and grandparents) during childhood and adolescence for Black and White Americans. We find that family death is associated with educational attainment, but the associations differ by family member type and gender, and child's race. Experiences of family death are unequally distributed by race and demonstrate complex associations with educational attainment.

METHODS Patients (n = 29 984) treated for gastric adenocarcinoma at two high-volume centers (Severance Hospital [SH] and Gangnam Severance Hospital [GSH]) in Korea and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were retrospectively analyzed. Survival curves, the performance of tumor staging, and the homogeneity of modified subgroups were compared. RESULTS Minute changes were noted in the stage IIB subgroup; most changes were noted in stage III. Applying the 8th staging system facilitated better prediction of survival than applying the 7th version for SH data according to the log-rank test, C-index, and AIC (8444.5 vs 9263.8, 0.796 vs 0.798, and 104152 vs 103909, respectively). Its performance was also superior for GSH and SEER data. In a subgroup analysis of stages IIB to IIIC in SH, GSH, and SEER data, the 8th staging system showed similar or more homogeneous survival for each sub-classification than the 7th version. CONCLUSION Compared with the 7th gastric cancer staging system, the newer version more accurately predicted prognosis and stratified subgroups more homogeneously.","Son, Taeil; Sun, Jiyu; Choi, Seohee; Cho, Minah; Kwon, In Gyu; Kim, Hyoung-Il; Cheong, Jae-Ho; Choi, Seung Ho; Noh, Sung Hoon; Woo, Yanghee; Fong, Yuman; Park, Sohee; Hyung, Woo Jin",Journal of surgical oncology,806,12

More recently, three novel coronaviruses associated with severe human respiratory disease were found, including (i) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, associated with a significant atypical pneumonia and 10% mortality; (ii) HKU-1, associated with chronic pulmonary disease; and (iii) NL63, associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease in children and adults worldwide. These discoveries establish coronaviruses as important human pathogens and underscore the need for continued research toward the development of platforms that will enable genetic manipulation of the viral genome, allowing for rapid and rational development and testing of candidate vaccines, vaccine vectors, and therapeutics. In this report, we describe a reverse genetics system for NL63, whereby five contiguous cDNAs that span the entire genome were used to generate a full-length cDNA. Recombinant NL63 viruses which contained the expected marker mutations replicated as efficiently as the wild-type NL63 virus. In addition, we engineered the heterologous green fluorescent protein gene in place of open reading frame 3 (ORF3) of the NL63 clone, simultaneously creating a unique marker for NL63 infection and demonstrating that the ORF3 protein product is nonessential for the replication of NL63 in cell culture. The availability of the NL63 and NL63gfp clones and recombinant viruses provides powerful tools that will help advance our understanding of this important human pathogen.","Donaldson, Eric F; Yount, Boyd; Sims, Amy C; Burkett, Susan; Pickles, Raymond J; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,806,12

For PRO data to influence practice, well-designed and reported studies are required. A systematic review identified prospective bariatric surgery studies that used validated PRO measures. Risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed, and papers were examined for reporting of (i) who completed PRO measures; (ii) missing PRO data and (iii) clinical interpretation of PRO data. Studies meeting all criteria were classified as robust. Eighty-six studies were identified. Of the eight RCTs, risk of bias was high in one and unclear in seven. Sixty-eight different PRO measures were identified, with the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire most commonly used. Forty-one (48%) studies explicitly stated measures were completed by patients, 63 (73%) documented missing PRO data and 50 (58%) interpreted PRO data clinically. Twenty-six (30%) met all criteria. Although many bariatric surgery studies assess PROs, study design and reporting is often poor, limiting data interpretation and synthesis.

Modern endovascular techniques, such as flow diversion, are associated with high aneurysm occlusion rates and have become a popular treatment modality for many types of aneurysms. However, the safety and effectiveness of flow diversion has not yet been established in trials comparing it with traditional aneurysm treatments. Moreover, there are some types of aneurysms that may not be appropriate for endovascular coiling, such as wide-necked aneurysms located at branch points of major vessels, large saccular aneurysms with multiple efferent arteries, dolichoectatic aneurysms, large aneurysms with mass effect, when there are technical complications with endovascular treatment, when patients cannot tolerate or have contraindications to antiplatelet therapy or in the setting of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. For these cases, open cerebrovascular surgery remains important. This review provides a discussion on the current trends and evidence for both flow diversion and open cerebrovascular surgery for complex aneurysms that may not be suitable for coiling. We emphasise a continued important role for surgical treatment in certain situations.","Mazur, Marcus D; Taussky, Philipp; Park, Min S; Couldwell, William T","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",806,1

DESIGN AND SETTING A randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) in two German gynecology departments. PATIENTS 74 patients scheduled to undergo TLH for a symptomatic fibroid uterus, adenomyosis or severe meno-metrorrhagia. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to receive a TLH with either the MS or the LS device. 27 variables were prospectively collected to address potential confounding issues. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Operating time, defined as the time period between the first (round ligament dissection) and the last (uterine vessels sealing) use of the device, estimated and calculated intraoperative blood loss. The mean operating time (95% confidence interval, CI) was 22.7 min (95% CI 17.6-27.7) for LS and 26.4 min (95% CI 20-32.8) for the MS device (p = .89). The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 164 ml (95% CI 110-217) for LS and 160 ml (95% CI 116-203) for the MS device (p = .36). The multivariate analyses accounting for BMI, endometriosis, uterine weight and appearance of fibroids did not reveal any significant effect of the type of device used on operating time and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSION In this RCT, both devices provided reliable and effective sealing and dissection. The reusable MS showed non-inferiority against the disposable LS device with regard to operating time and estimated intraoperative blood loss.","Hasanov, M; Denschlag, D; Seemann, E; Gitsch, G; Woll, J; Klar, Maximilian",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,806,8

PROPOSAL Addressing calls in the literature, we introduce three examples of contemporary organizational theory which can be used to understand and operationalise change within medical education. These theories - institutional logics, paradox theory, and complexity leadership theory - are relatively unknown in medical education. However, they provide a way of making sense of the complexity of change creatively. Specifically, they cross-cut different levels of analysis and allow us to 'zoom in' to the micro levels as well as 'zoom out' and connect what is happening at the individual level (the micro-level) to what happens at a wider institutional and even national/international level (the macro-level), thus providing a means of understanding the interactions between individuals, teams, organizations and systems. We highlight the potential value of these theories, provide a brief discussion of the few studies that have used them in medical education, and then briefly critique each theory. CONCLUSIONS We hope that by drawing attention of readers to the potential of these management theories we can unlock some of the complexity of change in medical education, support new ways of thinking and open new avenues for research.","Gordon, Lisi; Cleland, Jennifer A",Medical education,806,31

Infection due to S. aureus imposes a high and increasing burden on health care resources. A growing concern is the emergence of MRSA infections in patients with no apparent risk factors. MRSA infection in community settings involves considerable morbidity and mortality, as does nosocomial MRSA infection. For community-associated MRSA, person-to-person transmission has been reported, and several factors have been shown to predict disease.

Current tendencies, such as the growing concentration of populations in large urban conurbations, climate change, aging of existing infrastructures, and emerging pathogens, indicate that the management of water resources will become increasingly challenging in the near future. In this context, there is an urgent need to control the fate of fecal microorganisms in wastewater to avoid the negative health consequences of releasing treated effluents into surface waters (rivers, lakes, etc.) or marine coastal water. On the other hand, the measurement of bacterial indicators yields insufficient information to gauge the human health risk associated with viral infections. It would therefore seem advisable to include a viral indicator—for example, somatic coliphages—to monitor the functioning of wastewater treatments. As indicated in the studies reviewed herein, the concentrations of somatic coliphages in raw sewage remain consistently high throughout the year worldwide, as occurs with bacterial indicators. The removal process for bacterial indicators and coliphages in traditional sewage treatments is similar, the concentrations in secondary effluents remaining sufficiently high for enumeration, without the need for cumbersome and costly concentration procedures. Additionally, according to the available data on indicator behavior, which is still limited for sewers but abundant for surface waters, coliphages persist longer than bacterial indicators once outside the gut. Based on these data, coliphages can be recommended as indicators to assess the efficiency of wastewater management procedures with the aim of minimizing the health impact of urban wastewater release in surface waters.","Jofre, Juan Lucena Francisco Blanch Anicet R.",Water,806,1

Few patients develop severe disease with progression after admission to a healthcare facility. Multiple parameters have been investigated to identify a marker to predict disease progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR) ratio has shown some promise. The current investigation explores the role of NLR and PLR to predict the disease progression. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval, 608 patients were screened for inclusion in the prospective observational study, and 201 patients were included in the final analysis. The NLR and PLR were derived from routinely obtained complete blood count analysis. The patients were followed to determine the development of severity of the disease during the course. The NLR and PLR were analyzed in both univariate and multivariable models to assess the association and prediction. Results: In nonsevere (NS) group, the mean age of patients was 50.9 ± 16.3 years, and 66 (61.2%) were male, while in severe group (S), the mean age of patients was 53.7 ± 16.4 years, and 65 (69.89%) were male. NLR at day 1 and day 3 was significantly lower in survivors as compared to nonsurvivors, while the relation of PLR in both the groups was not statistically significant. The NLR is better in predicting the severity of disease as well as mortality than PLR.

This paper describes an RT-nested PCR test that can reliably detect between 2 and 6 copies of a synthetic MoV RNA. Total RNA isolated from the lymphoid organ, gills and haemocytes of P. monodon with moderate infections gave comparable amplicon yields in the RT-PCR step of the test. However, in prawns with extremely low-level infections, haemocytes and gill tissue proved slightly more reliable in detecting MoV RNA following nested PCR. The distribution of MoV in tissues of healthy and moribund P. monodon was examined by in situ hybridisation (ISH) using a digoxigenin-labelled DNA probe to a approximately 0.8 kb M RNA segment cDNA insert in clone pMoV4.1. The DNA probe targeted a region in the MoV M RNA segment containing a coding sequence with homology to the C-terminus of the G2 glycoprotein of phleboviruses. In healthy prawns harbouring an unapparent MoV infection, ISH signal primarily occurred in the lymphoid organ, where it was more prominent in hypertrophied cells of 'spheroids' than within cells of normal tubules. ISH signal was also sometimes detected in cells of cuticular epithelium, segmental nerve ganglion and the antennal and tegmental glands. MoV was distributed widely throughout these and other cephalothoracic tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin in moribund P. monodon following experimental infection or collected from farm pond edges during disease episodes.

DESIGN AND SETTING A qualitative study was performed among South Australian GPs between March and October 2007. A semi-structured interview was carried out with each participant in his or her practice, and the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS 10 GPs were recruited: five from a metropolitan Division and five from a rural Division of General Practice. RESULTS Some participants felt they would not be able to cope with an influenza pandemic, while others felt it would simply mean an increase in their workloads. Most respondents considered creating separate waiting rooms, moving the reception desk outside of the practice and delaying all non-urgent consultations in order to deal with a pandemic more effectively. Respondents mentioned the conflict between their various roles and responsibilities as a primary source of tension when thinking about the way they would organise their work in the event of a pandemic. A number of GPs said they would not practise in the event of a pandemic, as they felt their responsibility to their families outweighed that to their patients. CONCLUSIONS Professional codes of ethics should include guidance about the scope of the duty to treat during infectious disease outbreaks. The community has to uphold the value of reciprocity, and ensure that GPs and their families are provided with support during a pandemic and are given the opportunity to be actively involved in pandemic preparedness planning.","Anikeeva, Olga; Braunack-Mayer, Annette J; Street, Jackie M",The Medical journal of Australia,806,1

Bariatric surgery is currently offered to individuals with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m or greater than 35 kg/m with obesity-related comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes. Endoscopic bariatric therapies, with their reduced invasiveness and potential reversibility, may complement surgical approaches for achieving weight loss. RECENT FINDINGS At the time of this writing, two endoscopically placed intragastric balloons and an endoscopically placed aspiration tube have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight loss purposes. Some devices employ a suturing platform to create plications or to appose two surfaces. Other endoscopic strategies under investigation to treat obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes include duodenal mucosal resurfacing and creation of a partial jejunoileal diversion using self-assembling magnets. SUMMARY Current endoscopic methods for the treatment of obesity utilize various mechanisms, including occupying gastric volume, reducing gastric capacity, altering caloric absorption, or aspirating gastric contents. The long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these strategies remain to be fully elucidated. The landscape of endoscopic bariatric therapies continues to evolve.","Chiang, Austin L; Ryou, Marvin",Current opinion in gastroenterology,806,1

In plaque neutralization assays, antisera prepared against multiple sclerosis isolates SK and SD demonstrated significant cross-reactivity to each other and to murine coronavirus A59, weak cross-reactivity to murine coronavirus JHM, but no cross-reactivity to the human coronavirus 229E. Antiserum to SK or SD failed to inhibit hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes by the human coronavirus OC43. However, OC43 antiserum neutralized both SD and SK. Specific coronavirus polypeptides were identified and compared by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Infected and mock-infected 17Cl-1 cells were pretreated with actinomycin D and labeled with [35S]methionine. Polypeptides in Nonidet P-40 cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with homologous and heterologous antisera. Identical polypeptides were precipitated from A59-, SD-, or SK-infected cell extracts by SD, SK, OC43, or A59 antisera. The polypeptides of human virus 229E were antigenically distinct, with the exception of weak recognition of a polypeptide of 50,000 molecular weight. We conclude that the two multiple sclerosis virus isolates SK and SD are closely related serologically to the murine coronavirus A59 and the human coronavirus OC43.","Gerdes, J C; Klein, I; DeVald, B L; Burks, J S",Journal of virology,806,1

Methods of recruiting and training additional staff and the issues of bed capacity, stockpiling, triage and ethics are discussed. SUMMARY Extensive preparation is needed in advance of an epidemic. This should include occupational safety measures, stockpiling of equipment and drugs, staff training, development of triage policies, and discussion of the limits of duty of care to patients.

Our recent publication (Jackson et al. PLoS Biol 2005; 3:861-71) chronicled several similarities between poliovirus-induced membranes and autophagosomes, including induced co-localization of GFP-LC3 and LAMP1. Occasionally, the cytosolic lumen of these structures also contains viral particles; this likely results from wrapping of cytosol, which can contain high viral concentrations late in infection, by newly formed double membranes. Interestingly, RNAi treatment to reduce LC3 or Atg12p concentrations reduced yields of extracellular virus even more than intracellular virus. It is often assumed that exit of non-enveloped viruses such as poliovirus requires cell lysis. However, we hypothesize that autophagosome-like double-membranes, which can become single-membraned upon maturation, provide a long-sought mechanism for the observed non-lytic release of cytoplasmic viruses and possibly other cytoplasmic material resistant to the environment of maturing autophagosomes.","Kirkegaard, Karla; Jackson, William T",Autophagy,806,17

The acute effects of allergen-challenge on nasal interleukin-8 (IL-8), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and alpha2-macroglobulin were examined in atopic subjects with common cold symptoms. Twenty-three patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16 outside the pollen season. Diluent and allergen challenges, followed by nasal lavages, were carried out about 3 months before and 4 days after virus inoculation. Seventeen patients developed significant common cold symptoms with increased nasal lavage fluid levels of alpha2-macroglobulin, IL-8, and ECP at baseline (p<0.001-0.05 versus before inoculation), and were further increased by allergen challenge (p< 0.001-0.05); IL-8 and ECP levels were correlated (r = 0.63, p<0.001). Before inoculation, the six patients who later did not develop common cold symptoms had high levels of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and exhibited strong allergen-induced plasma exudation responses (alpha2-macroglobulin). After inoculation, IL-8 and ECP did not increase in these symptomless subjects. In conclusion, high nasal interleukin-8 and myeloperoxidase levels and exudative hyperresponsiveness may protect against infection. The association between nasal interleukin-8 and eosinophil cationic protein in common cold, particularly that observed in nasal lavage fluids after allergen-induced acute exudation of plasma, suggests the involvement of interleukin-8 in exacerbation of airway mucosal eosinophil activity.","Greiff, L; Andersson, M; Svensson, C; Linden, M; Myint, S; Persson, C G",The European respiratory journal,806,33

Alternative devices for airway protection have been developed that can be used by untrained personnel, by those with less experience, and for when ETI is not possible. The main goals of our study were to evaluate the success rate and speed of insertion of different supraglottic airway devices and to determine whether the devices could be properly inserted under simulated critical conditions. METHODS Fifty medical students used an airway simulation trainer (Laerdal SimMan 3G) to assess the success rate and time used to insert seven different supraglottic airway devices under simulated physiologic and pathologic conditions in two different runs. RESULTS Although all airway devices could be inserted without problems, only the Combitube and the EasyTube could be successfully inserted in simulations of trismus, limited mobility of the cervical spine, or a combination of pathologic conditions such as trismus plus limited mobility of the spine and trismus plus tongue edema. The insertion time was significantly longer with LMA Unique, Fastrach, and I-Gel devices in both the first and second runs. CONCLUSION The Combitube and the EasyTube were most easily inserted under simulated conditions such as trismus, limited mobility of the cervical spine, and combined pathologic conditions. Although all devices are useful for establishing an airway by nontrained medical students in standard simulations, we suggest that the Combitube and the EasyTube may offer advantages in difficult airway situations.","Robak, Oliver; Leonardelli, Marco; Zedtwitz-Liebenstein, Konstantin; Rützler, Kurt; Schuster, Ernst; Vaida, Sonia; Salem, Ramez; Frass, Michael",CJEM,806,1

Five complications (17.1%) were observed, all in the older age group: 3 dural tears, one root injury, and one subcutaneous collection requiring re-operation. The difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.0521). Moreover, comparable or higher complication rates were noted after alternative techniques. The CRP level, obtained one day postoperatively, was lower than after alternative procedures, pleading for the limited invasiveness of ULBD.

Persons meeting the case definition were asked to provide nasopharyngeal specimens. On the basis of clinical and epidemiological information, specimens were tested using conventional RT-PCR for the M gene of the influenza viruses and hemagglutinin H5 of avian influenza A (H5N1), virus; negative samples were tested for other respiratory viruses. Specimens from healthy animals were also collected. RESULTS Between October 2006, and February 2007, 104 suspected cases of Acute Respiratory Disease that included; 31 deaths recorded.

Despite the approval of mRNA vaccines to prevent the spread of infection, long-term immunity must still be monitored. Targeting and modifying virus receptor binding regions to activate B cell receptors (BCRs) is a promising way to develop long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2. After the interaction of antigens, BCRs undergo series of signal transduction events through phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) to produce neutralizing antibodies against pathogens. BCRs intricate entity displays remarkable capability to translate the external mechanosensing cues to reshape the immune mechanism. However, potential investigations suggesting how SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells respond to mechanosensing cues remain obscure. This study proposes a sophisticated hypothesis explaining how B cells isolated from the CP of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may undergo a triggered series of B cell activation, BCR dynamics, proximal signalling, and antibody production on PDMS-embedded in-vitro antigen-presenting structures (APCs). These studies could provide detailed insights in the future for the development of structural and therapeutic entanglements to fight against pathogens.","Haneef, Kabeer; Ghaffar Memon, Abdul; Saleem, Rabia; Batool, Farwa; Sadeeq, Mohd",Med Hypotheses,806,20
