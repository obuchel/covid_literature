METHODS Consecutive patients with obstructed defecation symptoms (ODS) associated with rectocele who had the TRREMS procedure were included. Each patient was assessed by echodefecography, manometry, and colonic transit time as well as the Cleveland Clinic constipation score (CCS) before therapy and at follow-up after 6 months. Reduction in the CCS score was calculated as a ratio. Factors correlated with a decrease in the CCS were analyzed in a univariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included. Nineteen patients had postoperative complications that were not severe: 7 (8.6%) had tenesmus, 6 (7.4%) stenosis (4 treated with digital dilatation and 2 with endoscopic stricturectomy), 4 (4.9%) residual mucosal prolapse treated with rubber band ligation, 1 (1.2%) early bleeding, and 1(1.2%) thrombosis. Seventy-nine (97.5%) patients had a significant clinical response with significant reduction of the CCS constipation score from median 13 (range 17-10) to 4 (range, 8-2) (p = 0.0001); only 2 patients (2.5%) had an unsatisfactory response, complaining of straining and vaginal digitation during the evacuatory effort. Patients with anismus previously treated with biofeedback had a lower reduction ratio of the CCS score compared with patients without anismus (61.2 ± 2.8% versus 70.9% ± 1.5, p = 0.0006). There were no significant differences in the reduction of the CCS according to age, parity, type of delivery, previous hysterectomy, post-menopausal status, rectal mucosal prolapse and/or associated rectal intussusception, grade of rectocele and presence of complications. CONCLUSIONS The TRREMS procedure significantly improved evacuation disorders in this study. Appropriate selection of patients is key for the success of this approach. Anismus even if previously treated with biofeedback, was the main predictive factor of unsuccessful treatment.","Regadas, F S P; Murad-Regadas, S M; Rodrigues, L V; Regadas Filho, F S P; Vilarinho, A S; Morano, D P",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-02131-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828573/,848

Using secondary data, we conducted a cross-sectional ecological study adop ting a time-series design. The unit of analysis was Brazil's primary care centers (PCCs). A four-step analysis was performed to estimate the popula tion in PCC catchment areas using artificial in telligence algorithms and satellite imagery. We also assessed internet access in each PCC and con ducted a space-time cluster analysis of trends in cases of SARS linked to COVID-19 at municipal level. Around 18% of Brazil's elderly population live more than 4 kilometer from a vaccination point. A total of 4,790 municipalities showed an upward trend in SARS cases. The number of PCCs located more than 5 kilometer from cell towers was largest in the North and Northeast regions.

Yet in critically ill patients, it is controversial whether it increases mortality rates above that of comparator anesthetic induction agents. We postulated that etomidate would increase relative mortality rates correspondingly to the severity of illness as defined by SAPS or APACHE scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature search was performed on Pub Med, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Reviews for human studies, regardless of language, between 1983 and February 2020. The search strategy used keywords, ""etomidate,"" ""adrenal insufficiency,"" ""glucocorticoid,"" and ""intensive care."" Both authors reviewed electronic data search titles, abstracts and extracted data, which were checked by the other reviewer. Primary outcome was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome was adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS There were 29 trials of etomidate versus comparators in 8584 patients. Etomidate was associated with adrenal insufficiency (risk ratio (rr) = 1·54, 95% CI; 1·42, 1·67, p < 0.001) and increased overall relative mortality rates (rr = 1.09, CI;1.04,1.16, p = 0.001). Meta-regression showed that with etomidate there was a continuous progressive relative risk of mortality associated with increasing severity of illness (predefined in each article by standard critical illness scores). In those patients who had a predicted mortality rate > the median for this analysis (predicted mortality 44%) the relative mortality rate (rr) = 1.20, Ci;1.12,1.29, p < 0.001, the absolute risk difference (rd) = 0.08, CI;0.05,0.11, p < 0.0001 and the number needed to harm (1/rd) was 12.5. In those with a calculated predicted mortality <44% there was no increase in relative mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS Whereas etomidate causes adrenal insufficiency, it was not shown to increase mortality in many analyzed here in ICU settings. However, etomidate associated relative mortality rates increased progressively and correlated with the severity of critical illness scores. Intensivists should anticipate the need for glucocorticoid supplementation after etomidate in those with severe critical illness and in those with acute deterioration of vital signs.","Albert, Stewart G; Sitaula, Sujata",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620957596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912050/,848

METHODS Healthy adults (n = 8) were recruited to investigate the impact of the short-term exposure of lithium heparin samples (centrifuged and uncentrifuged) inside 2 LabLocker-KF300 courier lockboxes placed outside in direct sunlight during summer. Each courier lockbox was monitored every 5 minutes with a temperature data logger and contained either the standard number (n = 2) of cold packs (cold) or no standard cold packs (warm). Acceptable tolerance limits were defined for each analyte by significant change limit (SCL) analysis (P < .05), as previously described. RESULTS Significant changes were identified in each study condition for warm and cold lockbox conditions. Aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium commonly crossed SCLs from mean baseline (t0) in the majority of conditions. CONCLUSIONS Outdoor courier lockboxes are an underrecognized source of preanalytical error.","Dibbern, Megan E; Pierre, Christina C; Wiencek, Joesph R",American journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151359/,848

184852,"Surveillance for travel-related disease--GeoSentinel Surveillance System, United States, 1997-2011.",2013,"With the COVID-19 pandemic, distributed and remote working became a necessity but in agile project management, social interactions like daily standup meetings in Scrum are vital for the project success. Mixed reality can provide a new way of combining remote collaboration with innovative 3D visualizations to analyze the project status. In this paper, we present a visual immersive analytics framework for project management (VIAProMa). It imports data from project management tools like the GitHub issue tracker for open-source projects. With these task data as the basis, it can generate three-dimensional visualizations, e.g. about the overall progress or the competences of individual developers. Developers, stakeholders and end users can meet in the collaborative virtual environment as avatars and establish a spatial structure with the task cards and visualizations. Therefore, VIAProMa with its adapted and customized mixed reality project management features supports both the shared meetings and the information flow in the project. The shared environment makes it a suitable tool for DevOpsUseXR, an extension to the DevOps workflow, where end users are able to participate in the development process in mixed reality. The resulting implementation is available as an open-source project with cross-platform capabilities targeting the Microsoft HoloLens, HTC VIVE and Android smartphones, as well as tablets. The framework is applied in university teaching classes to convey agile methodology in mixed reality programming practices. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hensen, B.; Klamma, R.","8th International Conference on Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Graphics, AVR 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87595-4_19,848
187196,"Prevalence and awareness of HIV infection among men who have sex with men --- 21 cities, United States, 2008.",2010,"Rotavirus infection is known to regulate transcriptional changes in many cellular genes. The transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1 are activated by rotavirus infection, but the upstream processes leading to these events are largely unidentified. We therefore studied the activation state during rotavirus infection of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, which are kinases known to activate AP-1. As assessed by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies, infection with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) or exposure to UV-psoralen-inactivated RRV (I-RRV) resulted in the activation of JNK in HT-29, Caco-2, and MA104 cells. Activation of p38 during RRV infection was observed in Caco-2 and MA104 cells but not in HT-29 cells, whereas exposure to I-RRV did not lead to p38 activation in these cell lines. Rotavirus strains SA11, CRW-8, Wa, and UK also activated JNK and p38. Consistent with the activation of JNK, a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the AP-1 component c-Jun was shown. The interleukin-8 (IL-8) and c-jun promoters contain AP-1 binding sequences, and these genes have been shown previously to be transcriptionally up-regulated during rotavirus infection. Using specific inhibitors of JNK (SP600125) and p38 (SB203580) and real-time PCR, we showed that maximal RRV-induced IL-8 and c-jun transcription required JNK and p38 activity. This highlights the importance of JNK and p38 in RRV-induced, AP-1-driven gene expression. Significantly, inhibition of p38 or JNK in Caco-2 cells reduced RRV growth but not viral structural antigen expression, demonstrating the potential importance of JNK and p38 activation for optimal rotavirus replication.","Holloway, Gavan; Coulson, Barbara S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16928761/,848

HCV-371 displayed broad inhibitory activities against the NS5B RdRp enzyme, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 microM for 90% of the isolates derived from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 3a. HCV-371 showed no inhibitory activity against a panel of human polymerases, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, and other unrelated viral polymerases, demonstrating its specificity for the HCV polymerase. A single administration of HCV-371 to cells containing the HCV subgenomic replicon for 3 days resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the steady-state levels of viral RNA and protein. Multiple treatments with HCV-371 for 16 days led to a >3-log10 reduction in the HCV RNA level. In comparison, multiple treatments with a similar inhibitory dose of alpha interferon resulted in a 2-log10 reduction of the viral RNA level. In addition, treatment of cells with a combination of HCV-371 and pegylated alpha interferon resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Within the effective antiviral concentrations of HCV-371, there was no effect on cell viability and metabolism. The intracellular antiviral specificity of HCV-371 was demonstrated by its lack of activity in cells infected with several DNA or RNA viruses. Fluorescence binding studies show that HCV-371 binds the NS5B with an apparent dissociation constant of 150 nM, leading to high selectivity and lack of cytotoxicity in the antiviral assays.","Howe, Anita Y M; Bloom, Johnathan; Baldick, Carl J; Benetatos, Christopher A; Cheng, Huiming; Christensen, Joel S; Chunduru, Srinivas K; Coburn, Glen A; Feld, Boris; Gopalsamy, Ariamala; Gorczyca, William P; Herrmann, Steve; Johann, Stephen; Jiang, Xiaoqun; Kimberland, Michelle L; Krisnamurthy, Girija; Olson, Matthew; Orlowski, Mark; Swanberg, Steve; Thompson, Ian; Thorn, Megan; Del Vecchio, Alfred; Young, Dorothy C; van Zeijl, Marja; Ellingboe, John W; Upeslacis, Janis; Collett, Marc; Mansour, Tarek S; O'Connell, John F",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561861/,848

198162,"Update: mumps outbreak - New York and New Jersey, June 2009-January 2010.",2010,"Viral encephalitis is a medical emergency. The spectrum of brain involvement and the prognosis are dependent mainly on the specific pathogen and the immunological state of the host. Although specific therapy is limited to only several viral agents, correct immediate diagnosis and introduction of symptomatic and specific therapy has a dramatic influence upon survival and reduces the extent of permanent brain injury in survivors. We searched MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine) for relevant literature from 1966 to May 2004. Review articles and book chapters were also included. Recommendations are based on this literature based on our judgment of the relevance of the references to the subject. Recommendations were reached by consensus. Where there was lack of evidence but consensus was clear we have stated our opinion as good practice points. Diagnosis should be based on medical history, examination followed by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for protein and glucose contents, cellular analysis and identification of the pathogen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification (recommendation level A) and serology (recommendation level B). Neuroimaging, preferably by magnetic resonance imaging, is an essential aspect of evaluation (recommendation level B). Lumbar puncture can follow neuroimaging when immediately available, but if this cannot be obtained at the shortest span of time it should be delayed only in the presence of strict contraindications. Brain biopsy should be reserved only for unusual and diagnostically difficult cases. All encephalitis cases must be hospitalized with an access to intensive care units. Supportive therapy is an important basis of management. Specific, evidence-based, anti-viral therapy, acyclovir, is available for herpes encephalitis (recommendation level A). Acyclovir might also be effective for varicella-zoster virus encephalitis, gancyclovir and foscarnet for cytomegalovirus encephalitis and pleconaril for enterovirus encephalitis (IV class of evidence). Corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for acute viral encephalitis are not generally considered to be effective and their use is controversial. Surgical decompression is indicated for impending uncal herniation or increased intracranial pressure refractory to medical management.","Steiner, I; Budka, H; Chaudhuri, A; Koskiniemi, M; Sainio, K; Salonen, O; Kennedy, P G E",European journal of neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15804262/,848

The pandemic, however, has brought the industry to an abrupt halt. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to explore the impact the pandemic has had so far on German coworking spaces. Design/methodology/approach: Using an online questionnaire, quantitative data from 38 coworking space owners, operators and employees of a total of 77 spaces in Germany has been collected regarding their situation before, during and after the peak of the first wave of the pandemic from Spring until Summer 2020. The data has been analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings: The reported income losses significantly outweigh a decrease in costs of the spaces. Nevertheless, the member base seems rather unaffected, and coworking spaces are exploring adaptations to their businesses with a strong shift to the digital environment. Fear of re-imposed governmental restrictions is evident, as well as justified with a looming second infection wave. Research limitations/implications: Due to the sample size, the data may lack generalizability. Therefore, recommendations for future research are provided.

Study 1A, 1B, and Study 2 provided naturalistic evidence that mixed emotions predicted legitimate virus-prevention behaviors and eudaimonic functioning in the USA and Singapore, and Study 2 also supported receptivity as a mediator. Finally, Study 3 provided experimental evidence that mixed emotions causally increased legitimate virus-prevention behaviors relative to neutral, positive emotion, and negative emotion conditions, whereas eudaimonic functioning was increased only relative to the neutral condition. Across all studies, positive and negative emotions were unrelated to legitimate virus-prevention behaviors, while relationships with eudaimonic functioning were inconsistent. While self-reported measures do not represent actual behaviors, the findings suggest a potential role for mixed emotions in pandemic-related outcomes.

As the exponent of the distance dependence grows, the resulting networks smoothly transition from the random network limit to the regular lattice limit. We show that despite keeping the average number of contacts constant, the increasing exponent hampers the epidemic spreading as it makes long-distance connections less frequent. The growth of the number of infections is also influenced by the exponent value and changes from exponential growth to power-law growth. The resulting growth is compatible with recent analyses of the COVID-19 spreading in most countries.","Medo, Mat'uvs",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13160v1.pdf,848

Still, such exploration is challenging as there is a need for visualizations that are tailored for the purpose. RESULTS: The OmicLoupe software was developed to facilitate visual data exploration and provides more than 15 interactive cross-dataset visualizations for omics data. It expands visualizations to multiple datasets for quality control, statistical comparisons and overlap and correlation analyses, while allowing for rapid inspection and downloading of selected features. The usage of OmicLoupe is demonstrated in three different studies, where it allowed for detection of both technical data limitations and biological trends across different omic layers. An example is an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on two previously published studies, where OmicLoupe facilitated the identification of gene products with consistent expression changes across datasets at both the transcript and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: OmicLoupe provides fast exploration of omics data with tailored visualizations for comparisons within and across data layers. The interactive visualizations are highly informative and are expected to be useful in various analyses of both newly generated and previously published data.

We start expanding a previous statistical analysis based on the official data provided by the Italian Civil Protection during 100 days, from March 2nd to June 9th. As the total number of people infected with the virus is uncertain, we have considered the trend of ICU patients and the sum of hospitalized patients and the deceased. Both the corresponding curves are well approximated by the same function depending on four free parameters. The model allows to predict the short-term behavior of the pandemic and to estimate the benefits due to lockdown measures.","Feoli, A.; Iannella, A. L.; Benedetto, E.",Eur. Phys. J. Plus,,848

The main objective of this work is to explore the various fundamental feature extraction techniques that can be used to identify whether a person’s face is covered by a mask or not. Although face covering or wearing a mask is recommended during this global COVID-19 pandemic, deliberate face occlusion is considered to be a suspicious activity in a normal scenario. Even during this pandemic, it may be considered suspicious if someone is covering his/her face inside an ATM booth or an apartment complex during odd hours, for instance. Our proposed framework detects such intrusion activity by combining a traditional face detection algorithm with KOAD. Comparative analysis is performed for each filter used and we show that our proposed system achieves high detection accuracy with low computational complexity, while also providing the added benefits of being adaptive, portable, and involving low infrastructural costs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alvi, A.; Ahmed, T.; Uddin, M.

The timescales of such processes are investigated in collisions of atomic nuclei using fully microscopic approaches. Results from time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and time-dependent random-phase approximation (TDRPA) calculations are compared for 13 systems over a broad range of energies. The timescale for full mass equilibration ($\sim2\times10^{-20}$s) is found to be much larger than timescales for neutron-to-proton equilibration, kinetic energy and angular momentum dissipations which are on the order of $10^{-21}$s. Fluctuations of mass numbers in the fragments and correlations between their neutron and proton numbers build up within only a few $10^{-21}$s. This indicates that dissipation is basically not impacted by mass equilibration, but is mostly driven by the exchange of nucleons between the fragments.","Simenel, C.; Godbey, K.; Umar, A.

The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08802v2.pdf,848
625220,"Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication — Afghanistan, January 2019–July 2020",2020-10-09,"INTRODUCTION: It is unclear if research published in primary care journals aligns with the broad spectrum of problems managed in primary care practice. The aim of this study was to analyse publication trends concerning the burden of medical conditions reported in primary care journals, and to compare these findings with the burden of problems seen in clinical practice, in order to identify research gaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Scientometric tools were used to analyse 9956 articles of primary care journals indexed in MEDLINE. Through keyword analysis, a relations map was built. Literature review and a primary care database were used to identify active problems and reasons for visiting a family physician. Rankings and frequencies of research output and conditions were compared. RESULTS: Keyword analysis identified five clusters of publication trends: cardiovascular conditions and conditions related with unhealthy lifestyles; mental disorders; infections; oncology and health management. By comparing publications with clinical problems, the fields of orthopaedics, endocrinology/metabolism, gastroenterology/hepatology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and the respiratory system show the biggest gaps. Through the relations map, more concrete potential research topics were identified such as palliative care, chronic pain, insomnia, antibiotic prescribing, burnout, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The present study acknowledged potential research and publication gaps in Primary Care journals. The findings might help to direct continuing medical education and help with guideline development. CONCLUSION: The distribution of publications in primary care journals is distinct from the burden of problems faced in clinical practice and reasons for visiting a family physician. The use of scientometric tools to identify publication trends and their comparison with common problems could be a strategy to identify areas with research gaps in primary care.","Apitz, Salomé; Fontoura, Pedro",Acta med. port,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34543181/; https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.15262,848

In this cross-sectional study, 490 adolescents reported having FPVEs (prevalence, 4.2%; mean age, 13.40 ± 1.38 years old; 52.2% male) completed a series of surveys to evaluate their demographic factors and mental health status. The results showed that the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were 50.3%, 33.8%, and 40.2%, respectively. Older age, being female, being left behind, and more adverse childhood experiences were correlated with more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among adolescents with FPVEs. At the same time, social support and self-compassion were good for ameliorating these mental health problems. Implications for intervention programs designed to improve the mental health of adolescents with FPVEs were also discussed.","Huang, Liuyue; Liang, Kaixin; Jiang, Weiwei; Huang, Qiaomin; Gong, Na; Chi, Xinli",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8050403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067610/,848
