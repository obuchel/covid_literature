3279,Red blood cell-hitchhiking boosts delivery of nanocarriers to chosen organs by orders of magnitude,2018-07-11,"Drug delivery by nanocarriers (NCs) has long been stymied by dominant liver uptake and limited target organ deposition, even when NCs are targeted using affinity moieties. Here we report a universal solution: red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking (RH), in which NCs adsorbed onto the RBCs transfer from RBCs to the first organ downstream of the intravascular injection. RH improves delivery for a wide range of NCs and even viral vectors. For example, RH injected intravenously increases liposome uptake in the first downstream organ, lungs, by ~40-fold compared with free NCs. Intra-carotid artery injection of RH NCs delivers >10% of the injected NC dose to the brain, ~10× higher than that achieved with affinity moieties. Further, RH works in mice, pigs, and ex vivo human lungs without causing RBC or end-organ toxicities. Thus, RH is a clinically translatable platform technology poised to augment drug delivery in acute lung disease, stroke, and several other diseases.","Brenner, Jacob S.; Pan, Daniel C.; Myerson, Jacob W.; Marcos-Contreras, Oscar A.; Villa, Carlos H.; Patel, Priyal; Hekierski, Hugh; Chatterjee, Shampa; Tao, Jian-Qin; Parhiz, Hamideh; Bhamidipati, Kartik; Uhler, Thomas G.; Hood, Elizabeth D.; Kiseleva, Raisa Yu.; Shuvaev, Vladimir S.; Shuvaeva, Tea; Khoshnejad, Makan; Johnston, Ian; Gregory, Jason V.; Lahann, Joerg; Wang, Tao; Cantu, Edward; Armstead, William M.; Mitragotri, Samir; Muzykantov, Vladimir",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041332/,268

A high percentage (60.8%) of cows had various reproductive disorders. The results showed that seroprevalence of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) was 85.8% and that of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was 79.2% in tested cows. Antibodies to both viruses were found in 80.8% of cows with reproductive disorders but in only 46.8% of cows without reproductive disorders. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.01), and indicated a connection between reproductive disorders and simultaneous infections with IBR and BVD viruses in dairy cows.","Biuk-Rudan, N; Cvetnić, S; Madic, J; Rudan, D",Theriogenology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130171/,268

9767,Do sensational media reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome affect the mindset of healthcare workers?,2007-01-02,"AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apnoeas in previously healthy young infants with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) and correlate their occurrence with isolated micro‐organisms, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome. METHODS: We performed reverse transcriptase real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) on the nasal wash specimens of a prospective cohort study of 582 children with ARI. Clinical data on a subgroup of 241 infants under three months of age, with and without apnoeas, were compared. RESULTS: Our study found that 19 (7.9%) of the 241 infants under three months old had a history of apnoeas: eight had a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), five had a different virus than RSV and seven RT‐PCR results were negative. Infants with apnoeas were more likely to have cyanosis, had longer hospital stays and required extra oxygen for a longer period. Most patients with parental reported apnoeas also experienced apnoeas during hospitalisation. CONCLUSION: This study observed apnoeas irrespective of the isolated micro‐organism, and we hypothesise that they were related to the pathophysiology of the respiratory infection and not to the micro‐organism itself. Parental reported apnoeas were a major warning sign and predicted that apnoeas would occur in hospital.","Wishaupt, JO; van den Berg, EAN; van Wijk, T; van der Ploeg, T; Versteegh, FGA; Hartwig, NG",Acta Paediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159689/,268
9799,"Epidemiological and molecular characterization of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage strains in pre-school children in Arkhangelsk, northern European Russia, prior to the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccines",2020-04-15,"Immune responses following Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection or vaccination are frequently assessed by measuring T-cell recognition of crude Mtb antigens, recombinant proteins, or peptide epitopes. We previously showed that not all Mtb-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, an important question is what proportion of T cells elicited by Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We address this question by developing a modified elispot assay using viable Mtb-infected macrophages, a low multiplicity of infection and purified T cells. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 and CD8 T cells were classically MHC restricted. Comparable frequencies of T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages were determined using interferon-γ elispot and intracellular cytokine staining, and lung CD4 T cells more sensitively recognized Mtb-infected macrophages than lung CD8 T cells. Compared to the relatively high frequencies of T cells specific for antigens such as ESAT-6 and TB10.4, low frequencies of total pulmonary T cells elicited by aerosolized Mtb infection recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate that BCG vaccination elicits T cells that recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. We propose that the frequency of T cells that recognize infected macrophages could correlate with protective immunity and may be an alternative approach to measuring T-cell responses to Mtb antigens.","Patankar, Yash R.; Sutiwisesak, Rujapak; Boyce, Shayla; Lai, Rocky; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S.; Sette, Alessandro; Behar, Samuel M.",Mucosal Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161428/,268

10312,Viral attacks on the blood supply: the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing,2004-03-24,"I used cluster analysis to examine associations among 20 fish species to develop a classification scheme for 132 large Texas reservoirs. Five major groups of reservoirs were identified by cluster analysis based on species associations. Of 29 reservoirs surveyed previously, 76% were classified into the same species associations from one survey to the next. When 19 environmental variables were used in canonical correlation analysis of the five reservoir groups, I found a general east‐to‐west separation of species associations by water quality and a northwest‐to‐southeast separation by surface elevation and growing season. A discriminant functions model based on a reduced set of nine environmental variables had an unbiased error rate of 18% for predicting the species association in unclassified reservoirs. A stratified sampling scheme based on the classification model decreased the variance of statewide electrofishing catch per effort up to 43% for bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and 23% for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides over a simple random sample of reservoirs.","Dolman, William B.",Trans Am Fish Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169796/,268
11993,Reshaping neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to avoid the spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to high-risk infants,2020-06-24,"Gene annotation in viruses often relies upon similarity search methods. These methods possess high specificity but some genes may be missed, either those unique to a particular genome or those highly divergent from known homologs. To identify potentially missing viral genes we have analyzed all complete viral genomes currently available in GenBank with a specialized and augmented version of the gene finding program GeneMarkS. In particular, by implementing genome-specific self-training protocols we have better adjusted the GeneMarkS statistical models to sequences of viral genomes. Hundreds of new genes were identified, some in well studied viral genomes. For example, a new gene predicted in the genome of the Epstein–Barr virus was shown to encode a protein similar to α-herpesvirus minor tegument protein UL14 with heat shock functions. Convincing evidence of this similarity was obtained after only 12 PSI-BLAST iterations. In another example, several iterations of PSI-BLAST were required to demonstrate that a gene predicted in the genome of Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 encodes a BALF1-like protein which is thought to be involved in apoptosis regulation and, potentially, carcinogenesis. New predictions were used to refine annotations of viral genomes in the RefSeq collection curated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Importantly, even in those cases where no sequence similarities were detected, GeneMarkS significantly reduced the number of primary targets for experimental characterization by identifying the most probable candidate genes. The new genome annotations were stored in VIOLIN, an interactive database which provides access to similarity search tools for up-to-date analysis of predicted viral proteins.","Mills, Ryan; Rozanov, Michael; Lomsadze, Alexandre; Tatusova, Tatiana; Borodovsky, Mark",Nucleic Acids Research,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/31/23/7041/9488296/gkg878.pdf,268

OBJECTIVE: In this communication, we reflect on our previous research, and that of other authors, to identify and explore key ethical and methodological considerations. DISCUSSION: Focus groups are a widely implemented qualitative methodology, but their use, particularly in vulnerable neurodegenerative disease populations, is not straightforward. Although the risk of harm is generally low in focus group research, neurodegenerative disease populations are particularly vulnerable to issues relating to comprehension and their capacity to consent. Physical and cognitive impairments may also affect social interactions among participants and therefore impact data collection and analyses. CONCLUSION: We offer a number of ethical and methodological recommendations to facilitate the processes of recruitment and data collection when conducting focus groups with neurodegenerative disease populations.","Jones, Annabel; Morgan-Jones, Philippa; Busse, Monica; Shepherd, Victoria; Wood, Fiona",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7812104/,268

However, the openness of such systems allows destructive patterns to form through actors’ dynamics. As a result, the collective effort of actors may not achieve the targeted objective due to lower engagement and lower quality contributions. There are varying forms of actor dynamics that can lead to suboptimal outcomes and this paper provides a systematic analysis of these in the form of a collection of patterns, derived from both the literature and from our own experiences with crowdsourcing systems. This collection of so-called co-destruction patterns allows for an-depth analysis of corwdsourcing systems which can benefit a comparative analysis and also assist with improvements of existing systems or the set-up of new ones.

Durations of time were framed as calendar units (e.g., days, weeks, months, years) and calendar dates (i.e., specific dates the policies would extent to). Levels of compliance across durations of time were used to calculate the area under the curve (AuC) for each condition. Social-distancing policies framed in calendar dates yielded significantly greater AuC values compared to social-distancing policies framed in calendar units. Participants’ self-reported political affiliation yielded a significant main effect: Conservative participants’ AuC values were significantly lower than liberal participants’ AuC values.

44038,501. Serum IgG Antibody Testing Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Healthcare Workers,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In April 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak at a rural, resource-limited Department of Corrections on a Native American reservation in Arizona led to multiple epidemiologically linked cases to household contacts of recently incarcerated individuals. We describe the role of a medical recovery site for isolation of recently released inmates with active COVID-19 infection in reducing household transmission of cases tied to the correctional facility. METHODS: On April 16(th), an individual was contact traced to the correctional facility and was laboratory-confirmed positive, an asymptomatic index case in the jail. Testing of all inmates continued from April 16(th)-30(th). On April 24(th), decarceration began. All inmates released from facility April 24(th)-April 30(th) were contact traced for 14 days to monitor for new household cases. On April 30(th), the tribe opened a medical recovery site for isolation. After opening, all individuals with active infection agreed to go to site after release. RESULTS: Between April 24(th)-30(th), 16 inmates were released from facility, seven were laboratory-confirmed positive. Secondary infections only occurred in households of positives. Of the seven households, four experienced secondary transmission of virus. There were 27 household contacts, six secondary infections (secondary attack rate of 30.0%). There were four hospitalizations and one death, though cause of death was not due to COVID-19 despite incidental finding. After opening of medical recovery site, all individuals with active infection (12 cases) agreed to isolation at site. This intervention resulted in no further epidemiologically linked cases from recently released incarcerated individuals to community. Figure 1: Household Secondary Infections with Epidemiological Links to Previously Incarcerated Inmates Before and After Opening of Medical Recovery Site [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Prior to establishment of a medical recovery site on a Native American reservation, a significant burden of disease in the community was linked to recently incarcerated individuals. After opening, all actively infected individuals agreed to isolation at site, resulting in no further household transmission of COVID-19 from an actively infected recently incarcerated case. This outbreak highlights porous boundaries between correctional facilities and surrounding communities, requiring attention and resources to limit transmission of disease to protect local populations.

However, there is little evidence about the effects of pathways used in oncological care. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to identify and synthesize existing literature on the effects of pathways in oncological care. METHODS All patients diagnosed with cancer in primary and secondary/tertiary care whose treatment can be characterized as the strategy ""care pathways"" are included in this review. A systematic search in seven databases was conducted to gather evidence. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers. Study outcomes regarding patients, professionals, and system level were extracted from each study. RESULTS Out of 13,847 search results, we selected 158 articles eligible for full text assessment. One hundred fifty studies were excluded and the remaining eight studies represented 4786 patients. Most studies were conducted in secondary/tertiary care. Length of stay (LOS) was the most common used indicator, and was reported in five studies. Meta-analysis based on subgroups showed an overall shorter LOS regarding gastric cancer (weighted mean difference (WMD)): - 2.75, CI: - 4.67 to - 0.83) and gynecological cancer (WMD: - 1.58, CI: - 2.10 to - 1.05). Costs were reported in six studies and most studies reported lower costs for pathway groups. CONCLUSIONS Despite the differences between the included studies, we were able to present an evidence base for cancer care pathways performed in secondary/tertiary care regarding the positive effects of LOS in favor of cancer care pathways.

67564,Severe hyperphosphatasemia and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children.,2020-09-03,"INTRODUCTION Hyperthermia is common in brain-injured patients and associated with a worse outcome. As brain rather than body temperature reduction, theoretically, is the most important in cerebral protection, there is logic in targeting cooling at the brain. Selective brain cooling can, in theory, be obtained by cooling the skull or by heat loss from the upper airways. In this preliminary safety and efficacy study, we report clinical data from brain-injured patients who because of hyperthermia were treated with intranasal cooling. METHODS Nine intubated brain-injured patients with hyperthermia were treated using a prototype intranasal balloon system perfused with cold saline. Temperature in the cerebrum, esophagus, and bladder was monitored together with intracranial pressure. RESULTS In only two of nine patients, normothermia was reached in the esophagus and in only four of nine patients it was reached in the bladder. When normothermia was reached, the time to normothermia was delayed. In the brain, normothermia was reached in two of five patients after approximately 72 h. Median temperature curves from the first 72 h of cooling showed that normothermia was not reached in any of the three compartments. The temperature in the brain and bladder were on average 0.6 and 0.5 °C higher than in the esophagus. ICP increased with increasing brain temperature. We found no signs of clinical important injury to the nasal mucosa from the cold saline or pressure in the balloons. CONCLUSION In brain-injured patients with hyperthermia, cooling with a prototype intranasal balloon system was clinically inadequate as the effect was delayed and not brain selective.","Springborg, Jacob Bertram; Springborg, Karoline Kanstrup; Romner, Bertil",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-012-9806-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23345077/,268
71099,ACE2 the Janus-faced protein - from cardiovascular protection to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and COVID-19.,2020-04-17,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached nearly every country in the world with extraordinary person-to-person transmission. The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is probable that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats developed a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented reinfection following a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection but do seroconvert and mount an antiviral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human infection; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets to the virus during acute infection. Resistance to reinfection holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats and, by extension, humans.","Bosco-Lauth, Angela M; Hartwig, Airn E; Porter, Stephanie M; Gordy, Paul W; Nehring, Mary; Byas, Alex D; VandeWoude, Sue; Ragan, Izabela K; Maison, Rachel M; Bowen, Richard A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013102117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994343/,268
73164,Pandemic planning in China: applying lessons from severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2008,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Over the past two decades, lung transplant has become the mainstay of treatment for several end-stage lung diseases. As the field continues to evolve, the criteria for referral and listing have also changed. The last update to these guidelines was in 2014 and several studies since then have changed how patients are transplanted. Our article aims to briefly discuss these updates in lung transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS This article discusses the importance of early referral of patients for lung transplantation and the concept of the 'transplant window'. We review the referral and listing criteria for some common pulmonary diseases and also cite the updated literature surrounding the absolute and relative contraindications keeping in mind that they are a constantly moving target. Frailty and psychosocial barriers are difficult to assess with the current assessment tools but continue to impact posttransplant outcomes. Finally, we discuss the limited data on transplantation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID19 as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation bridge to transplantation. SUMMARY The findings discussed in this article will strongly impact, if not already, how we select candidates for lung transplantation. It also addresses some aspects of lung transplant such as frailty and ARDS, which need better assessment tools and clinical data.","Shah, Purav; Neujahr, David C",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009817/,268
76381,Correction: Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis to Prevent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,2021-03-01,"This work investigates the formulation and in vivo efficacy of dendritic cell (DC) targeted plasmid DNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles for nasal immunization against nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as antigen. The induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune response at the site of virus entry is a major challenge for vaccine design. Here, we designed a strategy for noninvasive receptor mediated gene delivery to nasal resident DCs. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a complex coacervation process and characterized for size, shape, surface charge, plasmid DNA loading and protection against nuclease digestion. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector for achieving DC selective targeting. The bfFp is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of truncated core-streptavidin fused with anti-DEC-205 single chain antibody (scFv). The core-streptavidin arm of fusion protein binds with biotinylated nanoparticles, while anti-DEC-205 scFv imparts targeting specificity to DC DEC-205 receptor. We demonstrate that intranasal administration of bfFp targeted formulations along with anti-CD40 DC maturation stimuli enhanced magnitude of mucosal IgA as well as systemic IgG against N protein. The strategy led to the detection of augmented levels of N protein specific systemic IgG and nasal IgA antibodies. However, following intranasal delivery of naked pDNA no mucosal and systemic immune responses were detected. A parallel comparison of targeted formulations using intramuscular and intranasal routes showed that the intramuscular route is superior for induction of systemic IgG responses compared with the intranasal route. Our results suggest that targeted pDNA delivery through a noninvasive intranasal route can be a strategy for designing low-dose vaccines.","Raghuwanshi, Dharmendra; Mishra, Vivek; Das, Dipankar; Kaur, Kamaljit; Suresh, Mavanur R",Molecular pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1021/mp200553x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22356166/,268
77928,Lessons from the past: perspectives on severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2010,"The enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) catalyzes the first committed step of glycolysis and is regulated by a complex array of allosteric effectors that integrate glycolytic flux with cellular bioenergetics. Here, we demonstrate the direct, potent, and reversible inhibition of purified rabbit muscle PFK-1 by low micromolar concentrations of long chain fatty acyl-CoAs (apparent Ki∼1 μM). In sharp contrast, short chain acyl-CoAs, palmitoylcarnitine, and palmitic acid in the presence of CoASH were without effect. Remarkably, MgAMP and MgADP but not MgATP protected PFK-1 against inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA indicating that acyl-CoAs regulate PFK-1 activity in concert with cellular high energy phosphate status. Furthermore, incubation of PFK-1 with [1-(14)C]palmitoyl-CoA resulted in robust acylation of the enzyme that was reversible by incubation with acyl-protein thioesterase-1 (APT1). Importantly, APT1 reversed palmitoyl-CoA-mediated inhibition of PFK-1 activity. Mass spectrometric analyses of palmitoylated PFK-1 revealed four sites of acylation, including Cys-114, Cys-170, Cys-351, and Cys-577. PFK-1 in both skeletal muscle extracts and in purified form was inhibited by S-hexadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable palmitoyl-CoA analog, demonstrating that covalent acylation of PFK-1 was not required for inhibition. Tryptic footprinting suggested that S-hexadecyl-CoA induced a conformational change in PFK-1. Both palmitoyl-CoA and S-hexadecyl-CoA increased the association of PFK-1 with Ca2+/calmodulin, which attenuated the binding of palmitoylated PFK-1 to membrane vesicles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that fatty acyl-CoA modulates phosphofructokinase activity through both covalent and noncovalent interactions to regulate glycolytic flux and enzyme membrane localization via the branch point metabolic node that mediates lipid flux through anabolic and catabolic pathways.","Jenkins, Christopher M; Yang, Jingyue; Sims, Harold F; Gross, Richard W",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m110.203661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21258134/,268

The question of how to give HCWs the best protection against infection is a priority. Our literature review has indicated that the degree of protection required in looking after people with COVID-19 infection, is dependent on the particular environment to which the HCW is exposed. Covering more of the body could provide better protection for HCWs. Of importance, it is not just the provision of PPE but the skills in donning and doffing of PPE that are important, this being a key time for potential transmission of pathogen to the HCW and in due time from them to others. In relation to face masks, the evidence indicates that a higher-level specification of face masks (N95) seems to be essential to protect HCWs from Coronavirus infection. Evidence specifically around PPE and protection from the COVID-19 virus is minimal and at the level of anecdotal reports only.","Tian, Zixing; Stedman, Michael; Whyte, Martin; Anderson, Simon G; Thomson, George; Heald, Adrian",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734641/,268

To compare this technique with the current method of 'sequential sector conjunctival epitheliectomy' (SSCE). METHODS 26 patients with total limbal stem cell deficiency who underwent ocular surface reconstruction with limbal stem cells transplantation were retrospectively studied. Patients were categorised into group A (11) in which AM was used to direct the conjunctival epithelial cells away from the corneal surface so that the latter could be covered by the limbal explant-derived epithelial cells-the procedure was termed 'amnion-assisted conjunctival epithelial redirection' (ACER)-and group B (15) in which the conjunctival epithelium was prevented from migrating on to the corneal surface by SSCE. RESULTS In nine eyes of group A, the conjunctival epithelium was successfully directed on to the AM, preventing admixture with limbal explant-derived corneal epithelial cells. The AM was removed or it came off spontaneously within 1-4 weeks. Patients treated with SSCE (group B) underwent two to four interventions until complete re-epithelialisation. 12 patients had pain or discomfort. 11 patients had conjunctival haemorrhage during SSCE. The cornea was epithelised from the limbal explant-derived epithelium in all patients. CONCLUSIONS ACER is a viable option in limbal transplantation that reduces multiple patient visits, bleeding and pain that can be associated with SSCE.","Dua, Harminder S; Miri, Ammar; Elalfy, Mohamed S; Lencova, Anna; Said, Dalia G",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2015-307935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27888184/,268

METHOD A qualitative comparative case study approach was employed in the present study, using a set of 8 risk communication principles selected from international literature to suit the Chinese context for the comparative analysis of emergency responses of SARS and H7N9. RESULTS The study found significant differences in the risk communication conducted in the 2 cases. The SARS outbreak fully exposed China's lack of experience in public health risk communication. By contrast, the Chinese government's risk communication strategies had improved significantly during the H7N9 outbreak.DiscussionTrust is the basis for communication. Maintaining an open and honest attitude and actively engaging stakeholders to address their risk information needs will serve to build trust and facilitate multi-sector collaborations in dealing with a public health crisis.

METHODS One-hundred and fifty patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms were enrolled at 21 US and six international centers. Angiograms from the index procedure, and 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits were all reviewed by a core laboratory. All adverse events were reviewed and adjudicated by a clinical events adjudicator. A data monitoring committee provided oversight during the trial to ensure subject safety. RESULTS One-hundred and forty-eight patients received the WEB implant. One (0.7%) primary safety event occurred during the study-a delayed ipsilateral parenchymal hemorrhage-on postoperative day 22. No primary safety events occurred after 30 days through 1 year. At the 12-month angiographic follow-up, 77/143 patients (53.8%) had complete aneurysm occlusion. Adequate occlusion was achieved in 121/143 (84.6%) subjects. CONCLUSIONS The prespecified safety and effectiveness endpoints for the aneurysms studied in the WEB-IT trial were met. The results of this trial suggest that the WEB device provides an option for patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms that is as effective as currently available therapies and markedly safer.

100391,Role of two-way airflow owing to temperature difference in severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission: revisiting the largest nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Hong Kong.,2011,"BACKGROUND In-hospital stroke death rate is an important sanitary issue. Despite advances in the acute phase management of stroke patients, mortality and disability rates remain high. In aging populations and with different mortality between the sexes in general, the study of sex- and age-related differences becomes increasingly relevant for optimization of post-acute clinical care of stroke patients. METHODS We designed a cohort follow-up study with 13,932 consecutive ischemic stroke (IS) patients from 19 Spanish hospitals. Data was obtained from the Spanish Stroke Registry; transient ischemic attacks and ages <18 years were excluded. Patients were organised by age group and sex. We compared female and male patient cohorts within and across age groups univariately and used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders in differential in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The median (percentiles 2.5 and 97.5%) age was 78 (41-92) years old for women and 71 (41-92) for men. IS women were more likely to be older, to exhibit cardio-embolic aetiology, and less likely to have been admitted to a stroke unit or to have had a stroke code activated. Both pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at admission increased significantly with age and were higher in women than those in men. Differences in distributions of common risk factors for IS and of in-hospital outcomes between women and men actually changed with patient's age. It is to be noted here that although there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the sexes within any age group, in-hospital mortality appeared significantly higher in women than that in men when analysed overall, due to confounding. Death was more closely related to stroke in women than in men and occurred earlier. Although there were some age-specific sex differences between the predictors for in-hospital mortality, stroke severity measured by NIHSS was the main predictor of in-hospital mortality for both sexes. Topographic classifications - partial anterior circulatory infarct and total anterior circulatory infarct - were significant prognostic factors for men aged <60 years and for those in the 60-69 years range respectively. CONCLUSION Although most of our findings were consistent with previous studies, it is important to take into account and highlight differences in in-hospital mortality between the sex and age group. Not to account for age-related differences between the sexes can give false results that may mislead management decisions. As most deaths in women were related to stroke, it is important to improve their early management, stroke code activation, access to stroke units and/or revascularisation therapies, especially in the older age groups.","Purroy, Francisco; Vena, Ana; Forné, Carles; de Arce, Ana María; Dávalos, Antonio; Fuentes, Blanca; Arenillas, Juan Francisco; Krupinski, Jerzy; Gómez-Choco, Manuel; Palomeras, Ernest; Martí-Fábregas, Joan; Castillo, José; Ustrell, Xavier; Tejada, Javier; Masjuan, Jaime; Garcés, Moisés; Benabdelhak, Ikram; Serena, Joaquin",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000500205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055571/,268

102672,Singapore's response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak: what do Singapore physicians think?,2010,"PURPOSE Symmetric-tip dialysis catheters have become alternative devices because of low access recirculation and ease of tip positioning. Flow characteristics of three symmetric catheters were compared based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as they relate to catheter function. MATERIALS AND METHODS In Palindrome, GlidePath, and VectorFlow catheters, a computational fluid dynamics-based approach was used to assess (i) regions of flow separation, which are prone to thrombus development; (ii) shear-induced platelet activation potency; (iii) recirculation; and (iv) venous outflow deflection. A steady-state, laminar flow model simulated catheter tip position within the superior vena cava. Catheter performance was investigated at high hemodialysis flow rate (400 mL/min). Blood was assumed as a Newtonian fluid. RESULTS Wide regions of flow separation downstream of the Palindrome side slot and close to the distal tip were observed in forward and reversed line configurations. Geometric asymmetry of the distal guide wire aperture of the GlidePath catheter produced the highest levels of inverted velocity flow when run in reversed configuration. The lowest mean shear-induced platelet activation was exhibited by GlidePath and VectorFlow catheters; the Palindrome catheter exhibited 152% higher overall platelet activation potency. All catheters were associated with a recirculation close to zero; the helically contoured lumens of the VectorFlow catheter produced the greatest amount of deflection of venous flow away from the arterial lumen. CONCLUSIONS The VectorFlow catheter produced less shear-induced platelet activation than the Palindrome catheter and less flow separation than the Palindrome and GlidePath catheters irrespective of line configuration. These findings have potential implications for differences in thrombogenic risk during clinical performance of these catheters.","Clark, Timothy W I; Isu, Giuseppe; Gallo, Diego; Verdonck, Pascal; Morbiducci, Umberto",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25645414/,268
107769,New mothers' experiences of social disruption and isolation during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Hong Kong.,2010,"Atypical porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by a highly pathogenic PRRS virus (HP-PRRSV) is characterized by high fever, high morbidity, high mortality, and associated with severe neurological symptoms. Microglia are the resident innate immune cells in central nervous system (CNS), and their activation has been implicated as an important contributor to the pathogenesis of CNS diseases. In the present study, we successfully cultured porcine microglia and demonstrated that microglia could support PRRSV infection and replication in vitro. We further showed that HP-PRRSV infection significantly up-regulated the key inflammatory factors including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, CXCL10, MCP-1, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 in cultured microglia as well as in the CNS of HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. The transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, which are widely reported to regulate cytokine and chemokine productions, were activated by HP-PRRSV infection in microglia. Meanwhile, we found that HP-PRRSV induced cellular ROS formation in microglia and ROS scavenger was proved to significantly abolish the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8), suggesting that ROS are crucial for pro-inflammatory gene production. Importantly, incubation with supernatants from HP-PRRSV-infected microglia cell culture remarkably induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell death. Collectively, these results showed that PRRSV infection induced cytokine and ROS up-regulation in microglia, which might contribute to neurotoxicity. These data have implications for us to understand the neuropathogenesis of HP-PRRSV in pigs.","Chen, Xin-Xin; Quan, Rong; Guo, Xue-Kun; Gao, Li; Shi, Jishu; Feng, Wen-Hai",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.01.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581811/,268

The tumescentless mechanochemical ablation (MOCA) technique has become an alternative treatment modality, but its outcome with regard to endothermal techniques is still unclear. METHODS A multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial was designed comparing MOCA with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat great saphenous vein incompetence with the hypothesis that MOCA is associated with less postprocedural pain and a comparable anatomic and clinical success rate at 1-year follow-up. Disease-specific quality of life and general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured using questionnaires. Inclusion was terminated prematurely because reimbursement was suspended. RESULTS A total of 213 patients (46.3% of intended number of patients) were randomized, of whom 209 were treated (105 in the MOCA group and 104 in the RFA group). Overall median pain scores during the first 14 days were lower after MOCA (0.2 vs 0.5 after RFA; P = .010), although the absolute difference was small. At 30 days, similar complication numbers (MOCA, n = 62; RFA, n = 63) and HRQoL scores (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire: MOCA, 8.9; RFA, 7.6; P = .233) were observed. Hyperpigmentation was reported in seven patients in the MOCA group and two patients in the RFA group (P = .038). In the MOCA group, there were four complete failures (3.8%) compared with none in the RFA group (P = .045), although in one patient at 1 year, the vein showed occlusion. Median 30-day Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) was significantly lower at 30 days after MOCA (1.0 vs 2.0 in the RFA group; P = .001), whereas VCSS was comparable at baseline (MOCA, 4.0; RFA, 5.0; P = .155). The 1- and 2-year anatomic success rate was lower after MOCA (83.5% and 80.0%) compared with RFA (94.2% and 88.3%; P = .025 and .066), mainly driven by partial recanalizations. After 2 years of follow-up, no differences were observed in the number of complete failures. Similar clinical success rates at 1 year (MOCA, 88.7%; RFA, 93.2%; P = .315) and 2 years (MOCA, 93.0%; RFA, 90.4%; P = .699) and no differences in HRQoL scores on the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire at 1 year (MOCA, 7.5; RFA, 7.0; P = .753) and 2 years (MOCA, 5.0%; RFA, 4.8%; P = .573) were observed. There were two cardiac serious adverse events, a ventricular fibrillation in the MOCA group (1 year) and an unstable angina in the RFA group (2 years). One deep venous thrombosis occurred in the RFA group on 1-year duplex ultrasound, without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSIONS Unilateral treatment with MOCA in the short term resulted in less postoperative pain but more hyperpigmentation compared with RFA and a faster improvement in VCSS. More anatomic failures were reported after MOCA, mostly driven by partial recanalizations, but both techniques were associated with similar clinical outcomes at 1 year and 2 years.","Holewijn, Suzanne; van Eekeren, Ramon R J P; Vahl, Anco; de Vries, Jean Paul P M; Reijnen, Michel M P J",Journal of vascular surgery.

In order to assess whether B. dendrobatidis is present on the native amphibians of Hong Kong, we sampled wild populations of Amolops hongkongensis, Paa exilispinosa, P. spinosa and Rana chloronota during 2005-2006. Amphibians infected with B. dendrobatidis have been found in the international trade, so we also examined the extent and nature of the amphibian trade in Hong Kong during 2005-2006, and assessed whether B. dendrobatidis was present in imported amphibians. All 274 individuals of 4 native amphibian species sampled tested negative for B. dendrobatidis, giving an upper 95% confidence limit for prevalence of 1.3%. Approximately 4.3 million amphibians of 45 species from 11 countries were imported into Hong Kong via air over 12 mo; we did not detect B. dendrobatidis on any of 137 imported amphibians sampled. As B. dendrobatidis generally occurs at greater than 5% prevalence in infected populations during favorable environmental conditions, native amphibians in Hong Kong appear free of B. dendrobatidis, and may be at severe risk of impact if it is introduced. Until it is established that the pathogen is present in Hong Kong, management strategies should focus on preventing it from being imported and decreasing the risk of it escaping into the wild amphibian populations if imported. Further research is needed to determine the status of B. dendrobatidis in Hong Kong with greater certainty.","Rowley, Jodi J L; Chan, Simon Kin Fung; Tang, Wing Sze; Speare, Richard; Skerratt, Lee F; Alford, Ross A; Cheung, Ka Shing; Ho, Ching Yee; Campbell, Ruth",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://doi.org/10.3354/dao01861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18286805/,268

PIM administration may result in iatrogenic disorders and adverse consequences may be attenuated by limiting PIM intake.Areas coveredThe goal of this review article is to discuss the trends, risks, and concerns regarding PIM administration with focus on cardiovascular patients. To find data, we searched literature using electronic databases (Pubmed/Medline 1966-2021 and Web of Science 1975-2021). The data search terms were cardiovascular diseases, potentially inappropriate medication, potentially harmful drug-drug combination, potentially harmful drug-disease combination, drug interaction, deprescribing, and electronic health record.Expert opinionDrugs for heart diseases are the most commonly prescribed medications in older individuals. Despite the availability of explicit and implicit PIM criteria, the incidence of PIM use in cardiovascular patients remains high ranging from 7 to 85% in different patient categories. Physician-induced disorders often occur when PIM is administered and adverse effects may be reduced by limiting PIM intake. Main strategies promising for addressing PIM use include deprescribing, implementation of systematic electronic records, pharmacist medication review, and collaboration among cardiologists, internists, geriatricians, clinical pharmacologists, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals as basis of multidisciplinary assessment teams.","Anfinogenova, Nina D; Trubacheva, Irina A; Popov, Sergey V; Efimova, Elena V; Ussov, Wladimir Y",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2021.1928632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970732/,268

To illustrate the value and promise of this concept, the paper reflects on an approach to achieving practical justice in health biotechnology research that is grounded in a commitment to offer technical assistance to developing and under-resourced nations.","Ogbogu, Ubaka; Hardcastle, Lorian",Developing world bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210409/,268

Lack of a powerful animal model for human ischemic stroke could be a major reason for the failure to develop successful neuroprotective drugs for ischemic stroke. This review recapitulates the available cerebral ischemia animal models, provides an anatomical comparison of the circle of Willis of each species, and describes the functional assessment tests used in these ischemic stroke models. The distinct differences between human ischemic stroke and experimental stroke in available animal models is explored. Innovative animal models more closely resembling human strokes, better techniques in functional outcome assessment and better experimental designs generating clearer and stronger evidence may help realise the development of truly neuroprotective drugs that will benefit human ischemic stroke patients. This may involve use of newer molecules or revisiting earlier studies with new experimental designs. Translation of any resultant successes may then be tested in human clinical trials with greater confidence and optimism.","Narayan, Sunil K; Grace Cherian, Simy; Babu Phaniti, Prakash; Babu Chidambaram, Saravana; Rachel Vasanthi, A Hannah; Arumugam, Murugesan",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179718/,268
150646,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): lessons learnt in Hong Kong.,2013,"BACKGROUND Numerous models, of variable quality, exist to impart the complex skills required to perform vascular anastomosis. These models differ with regard to the kinds of materials used, as well as their sizes, the time needed for their preparation, their availability, and the associated costs. The present study describes a bench model that uses formalin-fixed porcine aorta, and its evaluation by young surgical residents during a recent skills course. FINDINGS The aortic segments used were a by-product of slaughtering. They were fixed and stored after harvesting for eventual use. Ten young surgical residents participated, and each performed one end-to-side vascular anastomosis. The evaluation was a questionnaire maintaining anonymity of the participant containing questions addressing particular aspects of the model and the experiences of the trainee, along with their ratings concerning the need for a training course to learn vascular anastomosis techniques. The scoring on the survey was done using a global 6-point rating scale (Likert Scale). In addition, we ranked the present model by reviewing the current literature for models that address vascular anastomosis skills.The trainees who participated were within their first two years of training (1.25 +/- 0.46). A strong agreement in terms of the necessity of training for vascular anastomosis techniques was evident among the participating trainees (5.90 +/- 0.32), who had only few prior manual experiences (total number 1.50 +/- 0.53). The query revealed a strong agreement that porcine aorta is a suitable model that fits the needs for training vascular anastomosis skills (5.70 +/- 0.48). Only a few bench models designed to teach surgical residents vascular anastomosis techniques were available in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The preparatory and financial resources needed to perform anastomosis skills training using porcine aorta are few. The presented bench model appears to be appropriate for learning vascular anastomosis skills, as rated by the surgical trainees themselves.","Khalil, Philipe N; Kleespies, Axel; Rentsch, Markus; Thasler, Wolfgang E; Jauch, Karl-Walter; Bruns, Christiane J",BMC research notes,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626856/,268

A novel saline-filled laparoscopic surgery (SAFLS) is proposed, and the technical feasibility of performing saline-filled laparoscopic partial hepatectomy (LPH) was evaluated in a rabbit model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve LPH were performed in rabbits, with six procedures performed using an ultrasonic device with CO2 pneumoperitoneum (CO2 group) and six procedures performed using a bipolar resectoscope (RS) in a saline-filled environment (saline group). Resection time, CO2 and saline consumption, vital signs, blood gas analysis, complications, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured. The effectiveness of the resections was evaluated by the pathological findings. RESULTS LPH was successfully performed with clear observation by irrigation and good control of bleeding by coagulation with RS. There were no significant differences in all perioperative values, IL-1βand CRP levels between the two groups. All pathological specimens of the saline group showed that the resected lesions were coagulated and regenerated as well as in the CO2 group.

METHODS Likert scale ratings and semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with parents who were selected from a representative sample and previously participated in the program. Five-point Likert scale ratings from 1 (not helpful) to 5 (very helpful) were obtained for 11 program components. Interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory participatory approach. Data were analyzed and themes were identified by two different coders using Dedoose software. RESULTS A total of 22 participants were enrolled and 20 participants completed Likert scale ratings and qualitative interviews. Likert scale ratings (mean standard deviation [SD]) show that program strengths include asthma education (4.75 [0.55]), supplies (4.65 [0.99]), help with housing conditions (3.94 [1.56], pest management (3.79 [1.69]) and greater access to community resources (3.70 [1.30]). The ratings suggest that families need more help with other social determinants of health, such as school, lack of enough money or food, and mental health and behavioral concerns (3.05 [1.78]). Interviews echoed these ratings and revealed several themes about family and parental stress, children's activity limitations, desire for outreach after the 12-month intervention, a need for help with other social determinants and more emotional support. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the program was well received and reveals the importance of addressing social determinants of health and behavioral health concerns.","Penzias, Rebecca E; Sanabia, Virginia; Bhaumik, Urmi; Sommer, Susan J; Shreeve, Kyra M; Woods, Elizabeth R",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2018.1536144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395749/,268

A high level of unemployment becomes the most significant stressor of this anxiety. In 2019, the department of communication became the department with the highest unemployment rate in the world. The students of Communication and Islamic Broadcasting Department feel this phenomenon and find difficulties in finding a job. This condition triggers the students' concerns about the future. In this case, future anxiety can be influenced by one of the protective factors, namely resilience. This study aims to identify the correlation between resilience and future anxiety of the Communication and Islamic Broadcasting Department students. DESIGN AND METHODS This study was conducted by employing a cross-sectional design and involving students of the Communication and Islamic Broadcasting Department (n = 238) of Universitas Ibn Khaldun, Bogor. This study used the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10 questionnaire to measure the resilience and Future Anxiety Scale to measure future anxiety. Meanwhile, the bivariate analysis between resilience and future anxiety was conducted by employing the Pearson product-moment correlation. RESULTS This reveals a negative correlation between resilience and future anxiety (-0.379) with a moderate correlation. CONCLUSIONS This study recommends several efforts to increase resilience for stress management, possibly guided by nurses. Moreover, higher education institutions can facilitate students by providing counseling and training in time management, enhancing adaptive coping, and developing the alumni association as media of future planning discussion for students.","Mutia, Hana; Hargiana, Giur",Journal of public health research,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060751/,268

We aimed to compare patient/carer and CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) experiences of virtual consultations. Methods: A questionnaire survey was distributed to most families in the King's College Hospital regional paediatric CF network and all MDT members in July 2020, 4 months after the move to telemedicine consultations. Consultations were done by both telephone and video-link. Results: 40/165 (24%) questionnaires were returned from patients/carers. Median age of responders was 8.5 years (9 months–17 years). 32% (13) of responders preferred FTF consultations, 28% (11) preferred virtual, 35% (14) had no preference and 5% (2) did not answer this question. The majority (82%) were satisfied with the assessment and treatment, and would consider telemedicine consultations in the future. One family reported a lack of necessary equipment. 17/20 (85%) MDT members responded and all 17 preferred FTF appointments. The majority favoured using telemedicine appointments for stable patients in between face-to-face appointments. Conclusion: Although MDT members expressed a clear preference for FTF appointments, patient preference was evenly split between virtual or FTF consultations. This single centre survey highlights the challenge for CF professionals to adapt standard practices to changing patient/carer choice and expectation without any loss of effectiveness, also preventing a digital divide.","Kavaliunaite, E.; Ruiz, G.; Smith, B.; Dignan, J.; Gupta, A.; Bossley, C.

166798,APPENDIX A CDC™ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,2006-12-31,"Importance. The outbreak of Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) disease has increased demand for N95 respirators, surgical masks, and other facial coverings in an effort to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Research shows that N95 respirators perform the best at filtering viral droplets and aerosols, however these masks are much more difficult to manufacture and expensive to distribute on a large scale, which led to shortages during the early phases of the pandemic. Surgical masks, on the other hand, were more widely available and have been previously used to mitigate the spread of tuberculosis and influenza. However, surgical masks are not designed to filter aerosols because unlike the N95, they do not fit tightly around the nose and mouth, and often have reduced filtration efficiency. Objectives. To evaluate the filter filtration efficiency (FFE) of three elastomeric face harness designs in hospital and research settings in order to improve facemask seal and preserve comfort. Design, setting and participants. A multi-institutional collaboration between engineers and health professionals, conducted between November 2020 and March 2021, was set up to design an elastomeric harness to improve the face seal of a surgical mask. Three elastomeric harness designs were created with harness designs 1 and 2 tested in a research laboratory setting and harness design 2.1 tested in a hospital setting. The harness can be manufactured from a single sheet of elastomer and can be used with a surgical mask to provide a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, reusable alternative to an N95 respirator. The initial harness design 1 was laser cut for testing and design 2 was developed to improve the detected particle leakage around the nose bridge area by introducing more material in that region. The extra material is looped multiple times and secured, forming a more secure seal between the nose and the surgical mask. Due to expressed discomfort levels and vision disruption, harness design 2.1 is developed for hospital settings with shorter looping material around the nose bridge. The designs were tested on mannequins and human volunteers using IR imaging and standard fit testing equipment to help optimize face seal and comfort. Main Outcomes and Measures. Our elastomeric harness can improve the seal of a surgical mask allowing it to pass the fit test used to evaluate N95 respirators. When tested with human volunteers we find that all participants fitted with an elastomeric harness increase their scores on the NIOSH fit test used to evaluate N95 aerosol filtration efficiency. Of this group, 24/39 participants achieved a passing score of 100 or more while wearing the second harness design. By studying the location of air leakage using IR imaging we were able to determine the nose bridge region of the masks is most prone to leakage when using our first elastomeric harness. Further optimization of the harness may increase the percentage of those who pass the NIOSH fitness test. Conclusions and Relevance. Overall, these results confirm that elastomeric harnesses combined with surgical masks improve their ability to filter aerosolized particles, which is especially important when in close proximity to individuals who are infectious or while performing aerosol-generating medical procedures.","Ingabire, J.; McKenney, H.; Sebesta, C.; Badhiwala, K.; Avants, B.; Kemere, C.; Kapur, S.; Robinson, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.31.21262838v1?rss=1,268

Beyond these measures, cancer patients have faced up to the threat of the risk of severe COVID-19 infections and the adaptations of medical oncology practices, with potential impact on their psychological well-being. We aimed to follow Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms and other Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) over this period among cancer patients from the French COVIPACT study. Methods: The COVIPACT study (NCT04366154) included patients with solid/hematologic malignancy receiving medical treatment during the first lockdown in outpatient departments of two cancer centers. Patients were asked to fulfill validated questionnaires on PTSD symptoms (IES-R), insomnia (ISI), quality of life (FACT-G) and cognition (FACT-Cog) at baseline (M0, first lockdown, Apr/May 2020), 3 months (M3, postlockdown, Jul/Aug 2020) and 6 months (M6, second lockdown, Oct/Nov 2020). PTSD was defined as an IES-R score ≥33 and moderate/severe insomnia as an ISI score ≥15. Higher values on the FACT-G (range 0-108) and FACT-Cog (PCI subscale range 0-72) indicated better quality of life and cognition, respectively. Changes in PROs over time were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures. Results:Among the 734 patients included in COVIPACT, 579, 347 and 328 completed the questionnaires at M0, M3 and M6, respectively: median age, 64 years, 72% women, 59% metastatic status. Patients were mostly treated for breast (44%), lung, head and neck (20%), digestive (16%) and gynecologic cancers (11%). We observed a J-shaped evolution of PTSD over time, affecting 21.2% of patients during the first lockdown, 13.6% the post-lockdown and 23.6% during the second lockdown (p for time &lt; 0.001). Moreover, patients reported linear deterioration of cognitive function over follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). No change was observed in any dimension of quality of life (p for time = 0.06). 24.3%, 27.1% and 28.1% of the patients reported insomnia at M0,M3 and M6 (p for time = 0.35). At each time, PTSD was associated with more insomnia, worst quality of life and cognitive complain. At all the times, ≥50% of patients with PTSD reported insomnia compared to ≤23% in non-PTSD patients (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, there was a clinically significant difference of ≥16 points on the FACT-G and ≥8 points on the FACT-Cog PCI between PTSD and non-PTSD patients (p &lt; 0.001) at the all times. Conclusions: More than 20% of patients have developed PTSD during the different periods of lockdown, with strong association with poor quality of life, cognitive complain and insomnia. Psychosocial support promoting emotional resilience should be largely offered to cancer patients to prevent and/or reduce PTSD.","Joly, F.; Lefèvre-Arbogast, S.; Rigal, O.; Bastien, E.; Guittet, L.; Grellard, J.

The etiology of WAD is still not fully understood. Women are affected more often and more severely than men. A frontal-oblique collision direction leads to WAD relatively frequently, but is poorly investigated as compared to rear-end or frontal collision directions. An oblique impact direction is assumed to strain the contralateral neck side more than the ipsilateral side, provoking an asymmetrical response pattern of the left and right cervical muscles. In this study, we examined the muscle reflex responses of the sternocleidomastoid, the paraspinal, and the trapezius muscles as well as the kinematic responses of 60 subjects during left-frontal-oblique collisions. Neither the reflex delay nor the peak head acceleration revealed significant sex differences. Thus, the elsewhere reported higher injury risk of females as compared to males cannot be explained by the electromyographic and kinematic results of this study. In females as well as in males the right muscle responses revealed shorter onset times than the left muscle responses. Thus, cervical muscles seem to be activated depending on the specific direction of the impact. Moreover, the difference between right and left muscle responses cannot be explained by a startle reflex. The movement of the head in relation to the torso (female mean ± SD: 92 ± 16 ms; male: 87 ± 16 ms) started almost simultaneously to the onset of the first muscle activation (right paraspinal muscles: female mean: 95 ms and 95%-CI 82 − 109; male mean: 95 ms and 95%-CI 84 − 108) indicating that the initial muscle activity seems not to be triggered by a stretch reflex in the PARA muscles.","Mühlbeier, Andreas; Boström, Kim Joris; de Lussanet, Marc H.

METHODS: We used data from a community-based cohort study conducted in 23 provinces of China including 13,125 adults age 65 years or older (mean age: 83.8 years [SD: 11.1]). We created the window opening index (WOI) as a proxy of window-view and window-ventilation, leveraging relevant data on self-reported frequencies of manual window opening at home. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 10-item version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale no fewer than 10. We used multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association between window opening and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In the multivariate logistic regression model controlling for a set of well-designed mood-influencing environmental and individual-level covariates, a protective effect of window opening on depressive symptoms was observed, with 16% lower odds per interquartile increment in WOI (odds ratio: 0.84, 95%-CI: 0.81-0.87). Subgroup analyses indicated that the beneficial effects were more pronounced among those with higher socioeconomic status (higher levels of education, urban residents) and better surrounding environments (lower exposure of ambient fine particular matter, proximity to park, or higher levels of residential greenness). DISCUSSION: The results point to the benefits of well-designed household window-opening environments on the mental health of older populations and suggest a synergistic effect of window-opening and favorable surrounding natural environment.","Jin, X.; Zhang, H.; Zhang, K.; Leng, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Zeng, Y.; Zhang, J.

This survey was carried out in India to understand the practice patterns of diabetologists and obstetricians (OBs) during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was designed, and the link to the survey was shared with doctors through email. Questions were related to the diagnosis and management of GDM both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 117 diabetologists and 90 OBs from different parts of India participated in the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, diabetologists carried out higher random glucose and HbA1c tests and lower numbers of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), but differences compared with before COVID-19 were nonsignificant. The OBs reported doing a significantly lower number of OGTTs (85.6% vs. 95.6%, P = 0.02) and significantly more HbA1c tests (16.7% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.03) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (59.4% vs. 37.1%, P < 0.0001) during the pandemic, than earlier.

Our climate is changing in ways that will have serious consequences for humans, and it may even profoundly affect the ability of the planet to support life. All around us, other species are disappearing at a rate between several hundred and several thousand times the normal background rate of extinction. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has wreaked social and economic havoc, is merely the latest model off a blossoming production line of newly emerging infectious diseases, many of which have the potential to be far worse. At the heart of these problems lies an ancient habit: eating animals. This habit is the most significant driver of species extinction and of newly emerging infectious diseases, and one of the most important drivers of climate change. This is a habit we can no longer afford to indulge. Breaking it will substantially reduce climate emissions. It will stem our insatiable hunger for land that is at the heart of both the problems of extinction and pestilence. Most importantly, breaking this habit will make available vast areas of land suitable for afforestation: the return of forests to where they once grew. Afforestation will significantly mitigate all three problems.

Tissue-specific differentiation and survival of alveolar macrophages relies on niche-derived factors, such as colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF-2) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). However, the nature of the downstream molecular pathways that regulate the identity and function of alveolar macrophages and their response to injury remains poorly understood. Here, we identify that the transcriptional factor EGR2 is an evolutionarily conserved feature of lung alveolar macrophages and show that cell-intrinsic EGR2 is indispensable for the tissue-specific identity of alveolar macrophages. Mechanistically, we show that EGR2 is driven by TGF-β and CSF-2 in a PPAR-γ-dependent manner to control alveolar macrophage differentiation. Functionally, EGR2 was dispensable for lipid handling, but crucial for the effective elimination of the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Finally, we show that EGR2 is required for repopulation of the alveolar niche following sterile, bleomycin-induced lung injury and demonstrate that EGR2-dependent, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages are vital for effective tissue repair following injury. Collectively, we demonstrate that EGR2 is an indispensable component of the transcriptional network controlling the identity and function of alveolar macrophages in health and disease.

There has also been an observed increase in Cyber attacks, that risk taking advantage of these sudden changes. This paper analyzes the effect of Covid-19 on remote working practices and the Cybersecurity threat landscape. The research has shown an indication that Cybercriminals and Advanced Persistent Threat actors have adapted common attacks such as phishing and teleconferencing vulnerabilities, to take advantage of the confusion and fear surrounding Covid-19. There is a suggestion that the larger or more technically focused organizations within the UK were best prepared and least affected by the move to remote work yet also had a general lack of policies and plans in the event of pandemics and natural disasters that might affect security operations. Based on these observations, it is recommended that organizations collaborate more and aim to explore the possibility of creating regional cyber first responder groups to help organizations in future situations like Covid-19. It can also be recommended that organizations introduce more tailored cyber security awareness training based around threats of remote working. Also to introduce pandemic related policies and plans into business continuity strategies, as standard.

To prevent this, everyone must wear a mask, wash their hands and maintain social distancing. Hand washing can be done with a hand sanitizer that contains up to 70% alcohol so that it has the potential to kill bacteria and the COVID-19 virus. However, alcohol has some disadvantages such as being flammable, leading to dry skin and removing the protective film of skin. For this reason, the formulation of an alcohol-free antiseptic liquid such as green leaves of Piper betle Linn can be an alternative solution because it contains various substances that are useful for human health, including essential oils, carvacrol and tannins which function as antiseptics, antiviral and antimicrobial. This study reports the antimicrobial activity of Piper betle Linn leaves extract from three districts: Nganjuk, Sidoarjo and Batu with a concentration of 50% to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aim was to compare the ability of the three extracts in inhibiting the growth of each bacterium. The extracts were prepared by maceration method using 96% ethanol. The evaluation was performed by agar diffusion method based on the Indonesian Pharmacopeia IV. Streptomycin 100 ppm, 50 μL was used as the positive control.

184742,A probe into a suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Akola Village.,2007,"The native horse population of Iceland has remained free of major infectious diseases. Between May and July 2010 an epidemic of respiratory disease swept through the population. Initial microbiological investigations ruled out known equine viral agents as the cause of the infections, but identified the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus zooepidemicus as being frequently isolated from diseased animals. This diverse bacterial species has a broad host range and is usually regarded as a commensal of horses. By genome sequencing S. zooepidemicus recovered from horses during the epidemic we show that although multiple clones of S. zooepidemicus were present in the population, one particular clone, ST209, was responsible for the epidemic. Concurrent with the epidemic, ST209 caused zoonotic infections, highlighting the pathogenic potential of this clone. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the original ST209 strain entered Iceland in late 2008 or early 2009. Epidemiological investigation revealed that the incursion of this strain into a training yard that utilized a submerged treadmill between the 5th and 19th of February 2010 was a critical trigger for the ensuing epidemic of disease, provided a nidus for the infection of multiple horses, and subsequent distribution of these animals to multiple sites in Iceland.","Björnsdóttir, Sigríður; Harris, Simon R.; Svansson, Vilhjálmur; Gunnarsson, Eggert; Sigurðardóttirr, Ólöf G.; Gammeljord, Kristina; Steward, Karen F.; Newton, J.

In doing so, it revisits the core ideas put forward in the literature in support of showcasing the sector more prominently in the region's rural development strategies. For decades, scholars have been gathering evidence that points to ASM being the most important rural nonfarm activity in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as how, in providing a supplementary source of income, the sector helps millions of the region's impoverished farm-dependent families cope with unexpected economic stresses and shocks. Sub-Saharan Africa has managed to avoid high numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths thus far but it has already felt the economic impacts of the pandemic, perhaps nowhere more than in its remote rural areas, which are already poverty-stricken and produce food at mostly subsistence levels. Intensifying support for ASM, an economic activity which again, many rural Africans are already involved in and familiar with the benefits it provides, in rural development and adaptation plans linked to COVID-19, should be prioritized by the region's governments and donors. Findings from ongoing research in Mali, Liberia and Ghana - the locations of three of the largest and most dynamic ASM economies in sub-Saharan Africa - reveal that despite its proven ability to stabilize and catalyze development in the region's rural economies, that even this sector has been affected by COVID-19. They more importantly shed light on how the pandemic has impacted ASM-dependent communities, and importantly, offer clues on how to make the sector more robust and better position it to steer rural communities through the crisis.","Hilson, G.; Bockstael, S. van Sauerwein T.; Hilson, A.; McQuilken, J.",World Development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105315,268

In this paper, we develop a two-module model to forecast the effects of relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention and vaccine uptake on daily incidence, and the cascade effects on healthcare demand. The first module is a simple epidemiological model which incorporates non-pharmaceutical intervention, the relaxation of such measures and vaccination campaigns to predict caseloads into the the Fall of 2021. This module is then fed into a healthcare module which can forecast the number of doctor visits, the number of occupied hospital beds, number of occupied ICU beds and any excess demand of these. From this module we can also estimate the length of stay of individuals in ICU.

185610,Facing the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.,2003,"Background: Many patients with rheumatic disease require immunosuppressive medication putting them at high risk of COVID-19 infection. Reduced staffing in rheumatology due to redeployment to COVID-19 work, limited out patient capacity and patient vulnerability have had a major impact on our ability to review our patients to assess their condition and treatment (by face-to-face, video or telephone consultations). Novel strategies are essential to safely and effectively treat patients with rheumatic disease whilst minimising their risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection. Objectives: The objective was to develop a digital solution to help deliver safe, efficient and effective care for patients with rheumatic diseases. The aim was to produce a system that allowed us to integrate data recorded directly by patients with information held in our electronic health records to provide a virtual review of care. Methods: An online questionnaire was used to collect clinical information, including validated disease activity measures, to conduct a remote assessment in 175 patients awaiting follow-up appointments. This assessment was integrated within our electronic health records (EHR). The questionnaire contained measures of disease activity (DAS28 or BASDAI);patient reported outcomes;patient preferences regarding the urgency and type of appointment;any recent problems or changes in medication. This information was imported into a database for clinician review, together with previous clinical records and results of relevant investigations, to inform clinical decisions and to decide on the safest and most appropriate timing for follow-up. Report letters were sent to the patient and their primary care providers. Results: Of the 175 patients (149 with RA and 26 with AS), 108 patients (89/149 [60%] with RA [mean age=64;female=65%] and 19/26 [73%] with AS [mean age=45;female=54%]) submitted responses over a 6-week period based on which clinical decisions were made. The mean questionnaire completion time was 19 minutes for RA responders and 16 minutes for AS responders. Non responders (67/175 [mean age=61;female=63%]) remained on our list of patients awaiting follow-up arrangements to be made. Sixty-nine responders (64%) had stable disease therefore did not require any changes to their treatment and were offered an appointment within the next 6 months, of whom 12 (11%) requested face-to-face follow-up. Of the remaining 39 -with less stable disease -requiring more rapid follow-up assessment, 22 patients (56%) required a face-to-face consultation to consider treatment change. So far 9 of these patients have had follow-up, of whom 6 necessitated treatment escalation (Methotrexate increase n=2;anti-inflammatory increase n=2;intramuscular steroid n=1;anti-TNF escalation n=1). Thirty-nine patients (36%) provided feedback on the process of completing the questionnaire, 85% of whom used a mobile phone and the remainder used a computer or tablet. The majority (70%) found it “extremely easy” or 'somewhat“extremely difficult” 0%. Conclusion: We have created and tested a system of remote clinical management for patients with RA and AS. Amongst the 108 responders, just 31% required a face-to-face appointment, with treatment changes made accordingly. With a backlog of 3,800 awaiting allocation to follow-up appointments, remote clinical management will allow us to safely and efficiently prioritise patients requiring urgent follow-up for treatment optimisation. We will integrate this system into our standard care pathway beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to streamline our service, deliver effective care and provide evidence to support the use of costly biologic drugs.1 We plan to investigate the barriers for non-responders.","Malley, T.; Jackman, J.; Manderson, S.; Saldana Pena, L.; Evans, E.; Barrett, J.; Soni, A.; Luqmani, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.309,268

To localize sequences involved in translocation of NS28, we constructed a series of mutations in the coding regions for the hydrophobic domains of the protein. Mutant protein products were studied by in vitro translation and by transfection in vivo. In transfected cells, all mutant forms localize to the ER, and none are secreted. In vitro, each of the three hydrophobic domains is able to associate with microsomes. However, glycosylation and proteolysis of wild-type and mutant forms of NS28 indicates that the wild-type protein is anchored in the membrane only by the second hydrophobic domain, leaving approximately 131 residues exposed on the cytoplasmic side for receptor - ligand interaction.","Bergmann, C C; Maass, D; Poruchynsky, M S; Atkinson, P H; Bellamy, A R",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC401011/,268

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs METHODS: The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 Å. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy; therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. RESULTS: The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (-187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the four selected FDA approved drugs can be potent inhibitors against COVID-19; among them, Temoporfin may be more potent for the treatment of the disease. Based on the findings, it is recommended that in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations be conducted to determine the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19.","Absalan, Abdorrahim; Doroud, Delaram; Salehi-Vaziri, Mostafa; Kaghazian, Hooman; Ahmadi, Nayebali; Zali, Fatemeh; Pouriavali's, Mohamamd Hassan; Mousavi-Nasab, Seyed Dawood",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682959/,268

There were 12 cases (15.3%) with WBCs < 4.0 x 10(9) /L, 49 cases (62.8%) ranging between (4.0 -10.0) x 10(9) /L and 17 cases (21.8%) over 10.0 x 10(9) /L. The average was (7.58 +/- 4.96) x 10(9) /L, with 0.75 +/- 0.14 (neutrophil) and 0.18 +/- 0.11 (lymphocyte). Chest films and CT scanning revealed changes related to pneumonia. The transmission of the disease was likely via close contact with contagious droplets. The prevalences of acute lung injury (ALI, in 37 cases) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 21 out of 37 cases) were considerably high among the patients. Seven patients who developed ARDS complicated with multiple organs dysfunction syndrome (MODS) died. CONCLUSIONS A history of close contact, fever, sign of pneumonia by X-ray and normal-to-lowered WBC counts are favorable for the diagnosis of SARS. Recognition of ALI as the important index for critical SARS and comprehensive supportive management are of paramount in decreasing the mortality of the disease.","Xiao, Zhenglun; Li, Yimin; Chen, Rongchang; Li, Shiyue; Zhong, Shuqing; Zhong, Nanshan",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12877784/,268

As it is a home-based modality, PD should be considered as a preferred mode of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for patients with kidney failure during this COVID-19 pandemic as it avoids frequent visits to hospitals and/or satellite dialysis centres. The highly infectious nature of this virus has led to the implementation of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition orange status in Singapore since early February 2020. This paper summarises the strategies for management of several aspects of PD in Singapore during this COVID-19 pandemic, including PD catheter insertion, PD training, home visit and assisted PD, outpatient PD clinic, inpatient management of PD patients with or without COVID-19 infection, PD as KRT for COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury, management of common complications in PD (peritonitis and fluid overload), and management of PD inventory.","Htay, Htay; Wong, Penelope Maxine P K; Choo, Rui-En Ryan; Dawood, Ubaidullah S; Foo, Marjorie Wai Yin; Jayaballa, Mathini; Lee, Grace; Lee, Martin Beng-Huat; Liu, Ya Lun Allen; Low, Sanmay; Ng, Alvin Kok Heong; Oei, Elizabeth Ley; See, Yong Pey; Tagore, Rajat; Tai, Yinxia; Liew, Adrian","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463662/,268

One day old mouse pups were inoculated intranasally with respiratory MHV-S, enteric MHV-Y, rat sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCV-OC43) or bovine coronavirus (BCV). Twenty-four hours later, they were placed in direct contact with age matched sham inoculated pups. Indices of infection in virus inoculated mice included lesions by histopathology and viral antigen by immunoperoxidase histochemistry in brain, lung, liver and intestine at 3 days after inoculation. Indices of infection in contact mice included mortality or seroconversion by 21 days after exposure. Infant mice were susceptible to infection with all five viruses. Transmission by direct contact exposure occurred with MHV and SDAV, but not HCV or BCV. Furthermore, adult mice were not susceptible to infection with HCV. Tissue distribution of lesions and antigen varied markedly among viruses, indicating that they do not induce the same disease as MHV. This study demonstrates that although these coronaviruses are antigenically closely related, they are biologically different viruses and disease patterns in susceptible infant mice can be used to differentiate viruses.","Barthold, S W; de Souza, M S; Smith, A L",Laboratory animal science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2170746/,268

METHODS Biochemical changes in SARS patients were summarized and compared with other viral pneumonias. Serum total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), calcium (Ca), ferrum (Fe), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) between SARS and other viral pneumonias were examined by Roche Diagnostics assay, HITACHI7600 automatic analyzer. Clinically confirmed SARS patients, patients with other viral pneumonias, and healthy controls were included in the study. RESULTS Compared with healthy person, the levels of serum TC, Fe, Ca, Alb were significantly lowered (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while the activity of LDH, CK, ALT, AST were elevated, the increase of CK and the decrease of Fe were the most significant (P<0.05 or P<0.01), the changes of TP and TG were not obvious. In the other viral pneumonias patients, ALT, AST, LDH were elevated slightly than those of healthy person, while Fe, Ca, Alb, TC, CK were a little reduced, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In convalescent stage, all the tests were returned to normal ranges except ALT, AST were still elevated in SARS patients. CONCLUSION The changes in serum biochemistry are more marked in SARS patients compared with patients suffering from other viral pneumonias, the decrease of Fe as well as the inhibition of TC may be caused by the treatment of anti-virus.","Song, Shu-Zhen; Liu, Hong-Ying; Shen, Hong; Yuan, Bin; Dong, Zhen-Nan; Jia, Xing-Wang; Tian, Ya-Ping",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15535901/,268

To provide a more comprehensive description of the epidemiological characteristics of cluster transmission and the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 carried by asymptomatic carriers, we studied the epidemiological characteristics of 70 clusters. 70 clusters including 311 consecutive subjects from January 20, 2020, to March 10, 2020, were enrolled. Of 70 clusters, 5 were infected by asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers. We gathered and analyzed information about their demographic, epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic classification, and cluster characteristics. Among the 66 asymptomatic carriers in Jiangsu Province, 49 asymptomatic were observed in 311 subjects distributed in 70 clusters. We demonstrated that there is a significance between the severity of cases infected by asymptomatic carriers and cases infected by symptomatic patients (P=0.033) and the former usually presented with milder symptoms. A significant difference was shown regarding the level distribution of age (P=0.006) and the frequency distribution of gender (P=0.014) and disease severity of COVID-19 (P=0.008) among the seven groups classified by the relationship with the index cases. The average age of infected medical staff was the youngest and the majority of infected medical are females while the infected patients were generally oldest and usually accompanied by severest symptoms. We concluded that asymptomatic carriers are mainly screened out of clusters and the patients infected by asymptomatic carriers present with milder symptoms than those infected by symptomatic patients, which indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 shares decreased virulence among asymptomatic carriers. Effective measures should be taken to prevent transmission in hospitals to protect doctors, nurses, and patients.","Han, Tao; Hua, Lei; He, Shu; Zhou, Yaqing; Hou, Can; Chen, Jiaxin; Yuan, Jinxia; Guo, Yi; Zhang, Sheng; Jia, Qiaowei; Zhao, Chenhui; Zhang, Jing; Cao, Quan; Jia, Enzhi",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194041/,268

Makino, et al., J. Virol. 57, 729-737, 1986). To better define the mechanism of RNA recombination, we have performed additional crosses involving different MHV strains. We have obtained recombinant viruses with multiple cross-overs. The isolation of such recombinants further indicates the high frequency of coronavirus RNA recombination. By using cell fusion as a selection marker, we have also obtained recombinants between MHV-2 and A59 strains. Some of these recombinants have cross-overs in the 3'-end genes of the genome, thus demonstrating that recombination could occur along the entire genome. Finally, we have obtained recombinants by selecting with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. These recombinants have cross-overs within gene C which encodes the peplomer protein. The genetic structure of these recombinants allowed us to determine the important domains of the peplomer proteins.","Keck, J G; Makino, S; Soe, L H; Fleming, J O; Stohlman, S A; Lai, M M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2829575/,268
189171,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,2003,"Rapid evolution of RNA viruses with mRNA-sense genomes is a major concern to health and economic welfare because of the devastating diseases these viruses inflict on humans, animals, and plants. To test whether host genes can affect the evolution of RNA viruses, we used a Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-gene deletion library, which includes approximately 80% of yeast genes, in RNA recombination studies based on a small viral replicon RNA derived from tomato bushy stunt virus. The genome-wide screen led to the identification of five host genes whose absence resulted in the rapid generation of new viral RNA recombinants. Thus, these genes normally suppress viral RNA recombination, but in their absence, hosts become viral recombination ""hotbeds."" Four of the five suppressor genes are likely involved in RNA degradation, suggesting that RNA degradation could play a role in viral RNA recombination. In contrast, deletion of four other host genes inhibited virus recombination, indicating that these genes normally accelerate the RNA recombination process. A comparison of deletion strains with the lowest and the highest recombination rate revealed that host genes could affect recombinant accumulation by up to 80-fold. Overall, our results demonstrate that a set of host genes have a major effect on RNA virus recombination and evolution.","Serviene, Elena; Shapka, Natalia; Cheng, Chi-Ping; Panavas, Tadas; Phuangrat, Bencharong; Baker, Jannine; Nagy, Peter D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16027361/,268
189248,Global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome: measures to prevent importation into Saudi Arabia.,2004,"The CEACAM1 glycoproteins (formerly called biliary glycoproteins; BGP, C-CAM, CD66a, or MHVR) are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family of cell adhesion molecules. In the mouse, splice variants of CEACAM1 have either two or four immunoglobulin (Ig) domains linked through a transmembrane domain to either a short or a long cytoplasmic tail. CEACAM1 has cell adhesion activity and acts as a signaling molecule, and long-tail isoforms inhibit the growth of colon and prostate tumor cells in rodents. CEACAM1 isoforms serve as receptors for several viral and bacterial pathogens, including the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis in humans. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the many biological activities of CEACAM1, we modified the expression of the mouse Ceacam1 gene in vivo. Manipulation of the Ceacam1 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells that contained the Ceacam1a allele yielded a partial knockout. We obtained one line of mice in which the insert in the Ceacam1a gene had sustained a recombination event. This resulted in the markedly reduced expression of the two CEACAM1a isoforms with four Ig domains, whereas the expression of the two isoforms with two Ig domains was doubled relative to that in wild-type BALB/c (+/+) mice. Homozygous (p/p) Ceacam1a-targeted mice (Ceacam1aDelta4D) had no gross tissue abnormalities and were viable and fertile; however, they were more resistant to MHV A59 infection and death than normal (+/+) mice. Following intranasal inoculation with MHV A59, p/p mice developed markedly fewer and smaller lesions in the liver than +/+ or heterozygous (+/p) mice. The titers of virus produced in the livers were 50- to 100-fold lower in p/p mice than in +/p or +/+ mice. p/p mice survived a dose 100-fold higher than the lethal dose of virus for +/+ mice. +/p mice were intermediate between +/+ and p/p mice in susceptibility to liver damage, virus growth in liver, and susceptibility to killing by MHV. Ceacam1a-targeted mice provide a new model to study the effects of modulation of receptor expression on susceptibility to MHV infection in vivo.","Blau, D M; Turbide, C; Tremblay, M; Olson, M; Létourneau, S; Michaliszyn, E; Jothy, S; Holmes, K V; Beauchemin, N",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11483763/,268

When 80R IgG1 was given prophylactically to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans, viral replication was reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude to below assay limits. The essential core region of S protein required for 80R binding was identified as a conformationally sensitive fragment (residues 324 to 503) that overlaps the receptor ACE2-binding domain. Amino acids critical for 80R binding were identified. In addition, the effects of various 80R-binding domain amino acid substitutions which occur in SARS-like-CoV from civet cats, and which evolved during the 2002/2003 outbreak and in a 2003/2004 Guangdong index patient, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the vast majority of SARS-CoVs are sensitive to 80R. We propose that by establishing the susceptibility and resistance profiles of newly emerging SARS-CoVs through early S1 genotyping of the core 180-amino-acid neutralizing epitope of 80R, an effective immunoprophylaxis strategy with 80R should be possible in an outbreak setting. Our study also cautions that for any prophylaxis strategy based on neutralizing antibody responses, whether by passive or active immunization, a genotyping monitor will be necessary for effective use.","Sui, Jianhua; Li, Wenhui; Roberts, Anjeanette; Matthews, Leslie J; Murakami, Akikazu; Vogel, Leatrice; Wong, Swee Kee; Subbarao, Kanta; Farzan, Michael; Marasco, Wayne A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857975/,268

MATERIAL OF STUDY A 58-years male patient presented to our department one year after synthetic mesh repair of large incisional hernia with mesh infection and enterocutaneous fistula. The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound guided drainage and CT scans with oral contrast. A multiple-step surgical approach has been adopted: first, the mesh was removed, intestinal resection performed and posterior fascial closure obtained by bilateral transversus abdominis release (TAR) and supra-fascial NPWT (negative pressure wound therapy) was positioned and maintained for one week; second, a definitive repair was obtained by a biological prothesis fixed to posterior fascia and covered by anterior fascia closure. Then, new NPWT was positioned and maintained for 6 days on the skin closure. At 18-months follow-up, the patient showed no clinical or radiological signs of recurrence or reinfection. DISCUSSION Surgical strategies to face enterocutaneous fistula after prosthesis ventral hernia repair are not standardized. After bowel fistula treatment and mesh removal, the challenge of abdominal wall closure stay unsolved because of the high rate of complication and failure of a new prosthetic repair. A case-by-case management plan, often with the use of a multi-step strategy, may be an option.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fecal samples from 935 dogs with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea were examined by electron microscopy. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively evaluated for clinical and laboratory parameters. RESULTS Virus was detected in 44.2% of the dogs presented with acute bloody diarrhea. The highest prevalence for a virus infection was demonstrated for canine parvovirus (19.9%), followed by coronavirus (17.3%), and paramyxovirus (13.9%). More than one virus species was detected in 6.5% of all fecal samples. Dogs with a virus-positive fecal sample were significantly younger than dogs that tested negative on electron microscopy. Among virus-positive dogs, dogs with parvovirus infection were significantly younger when compared to dogs infected with other enteric viruses. Parvovirus-infected patients also showed significantly lower leukocyte and erythrocyte counts as well as hematocrit, total protein, and albumin levels compared to all other groups. No significant differences were seen when evaluating sex, clinical parameters, character of diarrhea or vomiting among all groups. CONCLUSION Young dogs are more likely to suffer from viral enteritis.

Short-acting opioids, titrated to need, may cause less desaturation than longer-acting opioids. We thus tested the primary hypothesis that long-acting patient-controlled intravenous opioids are associated with more hypoxemia (defined as an integrated area under a postoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation of 95%) than short-acting opioids. METHODS This analysis was a substudy of VISION, a prospective cohort study focused on perioperative cardiovascular events (NCT00512109). After excluding for predefined criteria, 191 patients were included in our final analysis, with 75 (39%) patients being given fentanyl (short-acting opioid group) and 116 (61%) patients being given morphine and/or hydromorphone (long-acting opioid group). The difference in the median areas under a postoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation of 95% between short-acting and long-acting opioids was compared using multivariable median quantile regression. RESULTS The short-acting opioid median area under a postoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation of 95% per hour was 1.08 (q1, q3: 0.62, 2.26) %-h, whereas the long-acting opioid median was 1.28 (0.50, 2.23) %-h. No significant association was detected between long-acting and short-acting opioids and median area under a postoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation of 95% per hour (P = .66) with estimated change in the medians of -0.14 (95% CI, -0.75, 0.47) %-h for the patients given long-acting versus short-acting IV patient-controlled analgesia opioids. CONCLUSIONS Long-acting patient-controlled opioids were not associated with the increased hypoxemia during the first 2 postoperative days.","Belcher, Allan W; Khanna, Ashish K; Leung, Steve; Naylor, Amanda J; Hutcherson, Matthew T; Nguyen, Bianka M; Makarova, Natalya; Sessler, Daniel I; Devereaux, P J; Saager, Leif",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27607476/,268

Public health surveillance was performed by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Collaboration between the HPA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was established for the detection and assessment of significant infectious disease events (SIDEs) occurring outside the UK during the time of the Games. Additionally, ECDC undertook an internal prioritisation exercise to facilitate ECDC’s decisions on which SIDEs should have preferentially enhanced monitoring through epidemic intelligence activities for detection and reporting in daily surveillance in the European Union (EU). A team of ECDC experts evaluated potential public health risks to the Games, selecting and prioritising SIDEs for event-based surveillance with regard to their potential for importation to the Games, occurrence during the Games or export to the EU/European Economic Area from the Games. The team opted for a multilevel approach including comprehensive disease selection, development and use of a qualitative matrix scoring system and a Delphi method for disease prioritisation. The experts selected 71 infectious diseases to enter the prioritisation exercise of which 27 were considered as priority for epidemic intelligence activities by ECDC for the EU for the Games.","Economopoulou, A; Kinross, P; Domanovic, D; Coulombier, D",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762663/,268

In this article, we report our success in developing a novel red-shifted (RS) fluorescence-based assay for 3CLpro and its application for identifying small-molecule anti-SARS agents from marine organisms. We have synthesised and characterised the first generation of a red-shifted internally quenched fluorogenic substrate (RS-IQFS) for 3CLpro based on resonance energy transfer between the donor and acceptor pair CAL Fluor Red 610 and Black Hole Quencher-1 (Km and kcat values of 14 microM and 0.65 min-1). The RS-IQFS primary sequence was selected based on the results of our screening analysis of 3CLpro performed using a series of blue-shifted (BS)-IQFSs corresponding to the 3CLpro-mediated cleavage junctions of the SARS-CoV polyproteins. In contrast to BS-IQFSs, the RS-IQFS was not susceptible to fluorescence interference from coloured samples and allowed for successful screening of marine natural products and identification of a coumarin derivative, esculetin-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, a novel 3CLpro inhibitor (IC50=46 microM) and anti-SARS agent (EC50=112 microM; median toxic concentration>800 microM) from the tropical marine sponge Axinella corrugata.","Hamill, Pamela; Hudson, Derek; Kao, Richard Y; Chow, Polly; Raj, Meera; Xu, Hongyan; Richer, Martin J; Jean, François",Biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16895476/,268

METHODS We enrolled 66 patients who underwent thoracic surgery requiring at least 1 hour of OLV and aged above 65 years into the study. Patients were classified into VCV, PCV and PCV-VG groups according to a controlled, randomized design. Patients were ventilated to obtain a tidal volume (TV) of 8 mL/kg with three different ventilatory modes during OLV. The Hemodynamic and respiratory data had been recorded during intraoperation and arterial blood gases were obtained at baseline, 20, 40, 60 minutes after OLV, end of surgery. RESULTS Compared with VCV group, Ppeak was significantly lower in PCV and PCV-VG group (P<0.05), and the difference was not found between the PCV and PCV-VG group. PaO2 in PCV and PCV-VG group were higher than VCV group after the point of OLV+40 (P<0.05). Comparison of PCV group, PaO2 in PCV-VG group was higher, but did not show a significantly improved during OLV (P>0.05).

191299,Clinical prognostic rules for severe acute respiratory syndrome in low- and high-resource settings.,2006,"In 2002, a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged in the People's Republic of China, associated with a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and mortality in humans. The epidemic rapidly spread throughout the world before being contained in 2003, although sporadic cases occurred thereafter in Asia. The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin from a wild animal reservoir (Himalayan palm civets [Paguma larvata] are suspected), but the definitive host is unknown. There is concern about possible transmission of SARS CoV to rodents or domestic cats (as proven experimentally) with perpetuation of the disease in these species. In livestock and poultry, CoVs are recognised causes of enteric and respiratory infections that are often fatal in young animals. Although the emergence of SARS surprised the medical community, veterinary coronavirologists had previously isolated CoVs from wildlife and documented their interspecies transmission to livestock. Furthermore, scientists were aware of compelling evidence pointing to the emergence of new CoV strains and the mutation of existing strains resulting in new disease syndromes in animals, but the evolution and disease impact of CoVs was not widely appreciated before SARS. This review focuses on the comparative pathogenesis of CoV infections, including the factors that accentuate CoV respiratory disease, with emphasis on livestock and poultry. The goal is to provide insights into CoV transmission and disease mechanisms that could potentially be applicable to SARS, highlighting the contributions of veterinary scientists to this area of study. Such examples illustrate the need for communication and collaboration between the veterinary and medical communities to understand and control emerging zoonotic diseases of the 21st Century.","Saif, L J",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702725/,268

Delivery of excessive inhalation anesthetics based on minimum alveolar concentration produces greater deep hypnotic times, which may contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study tested the impact on cognitive function of balanced anesthetic using electroencephalographic (EEG) guidance vs usual anesthesia. We studied 88 surgical patients: 45 randomly assigned to balanced anesthetic technique with EEG guidance and 43 to standard treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery-Mild Cognitive Impairment at 3 intervals (preoperatively, 3-5 days postoperatively, and 3-5 months postoperatively). Additionally, 37 age- and sex-matched individuals not undergoing surgery or anesthesia were evaluated at the same intervals. Better outcomes were seen in the intervention group compared with usual care in the short-term/visual memory cognitive domain (P = .02) at 3 to 5 days, but not at 3 to 5 months. Delivery of anesthesia using EEG monitoring systems can reduce cumulative deep hypnotic time without negatively affecting patient physiologic stress, surgical conditions, or cognitive function. Our findings provide data to support optimal anesthetic approaches to improve cognitive function after anesthesia with volatile anesthetics.","Centimole, Zohn; Eichhorn, John; Frazier, Susan K; Jicha, Gregory A; Rayens, Mary Kay; Watkins, John F; Centimole, Sarah F; Moser, Debra K",AANA journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587724/,268

The indirect fluorescent antibody assay was validated by Western blots, which showed that all indirect fluorescent antibody-positive cheetah sera detected both domestic cat and cheetah coronavirus structural proteins. There was a poor correlation between indirect fluorescent antibody results and the presence of coronaviruslike particles in cheetah feces, suggesting that electron microscopic detection of shed particles may not be an easily interpreted diagnostic parameter for FIP disease. Low, but verifiable (by Western blots [immunoblots]) antibody titers against coronavirus were detected in eight free-ranging cheetahs from east Africa as well as from captive cheetahs throughout the world. Of 20 North American cheetah facilities screened, 9 had cheetahs with measurable antibodies to feline coronavirus. Five facilities showed patterns of an ongoing epizootic. Retrospective FIP virus titers of an FIP outbreak in a cheetah-breeding facility in Oregon were monitored over a 5-year period and are interpreted here in terms of clinical disease progression. During that outbreak the morbidity was over 90% and the mortality was 60%, far greater than any previously reported epizootic of FIP in any cat species. Age of infection was a significant risk factor in this epizootic, with infants (less than 3 months old) displaying significantly higher risk for mortality than subadults or adults. Based upon these observations, empirical generalizations are drawn which address epidemiologic concerns for cheetahs in the context of this lethal infectious agent.","Heeney, J L; Evermann, J F; McKeirnan, A J; Marker-Kraus, L; Roelke, M E; Bush, M; Wildt, D E; Meltzer, D G; Colly, L; Lukas, J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2157864/,268

Objectives To review the literature on the infection control practices in health care facilities against COVID-19 and put forward practical solutions, in addition to personnel protective equipments that may be adopted for health care personnel and patient safety in the Indian setting. Conclusions We are now amidst of COVID-19 pandemic and we need to focus on 'Risk reduction as much as possible'. The facilities and resources should transform to meet the challenges within the shortest time frame. The concept of patient care needs to balance with the safety of the healthcare, patient and society.

192053,[Severe acute respiratory syndrome--SARS].,2003,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Low rates of influenza immunization among health care workers (HCWs) pose a potential health risk to patients in primary care practices. Despite previous educational efforts and programs to reduce financial barriers, HCW influenza immunization rates remain low. Variation in practice-level organizational culture may affect immunization rates. To explore this relationship, we examined organizational cultures and HCWs' influenza immunization behaviors in three family medicine practices. METHODS We used a multi-method comparative case study. A field researcher used participant observation, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews to collect data in each practice in November-December 2003. A diverse team used grounded theory to analyze text data. RESULTS Organizational culture varied among practices and differing HCW immunization rates were observed. The most structured and business-like practice achieved immunization of all HCWs, while the other two practices exhibited greater variation in HCW immunization rates. Physicians in the practices characterized as chaotic/disorganized or divided were immunized at higher rates than other members of the practices. CONCLUSIONS In these practices, organizational culture was associated with varying rates of influenza immunization for HCWs, especially among nonphysicians. Addressing elements of organizational culture such as beliefs regarding influenza immunization and office policies may facilitate the immunization of all staff members.","Isaacson, Nicole; Roemheld-Hamm, Beatrix; Crosson, Jesse C; Dicicco-Bloom, Barbara; Winston, Carla A",Family medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19259843/,268
192438,Severe acute respiratory syndrome and its effects on health care: how Canada has dealt with this ordeal.,2005,"BACKGROUND Recent evidence that early, active mobilization protocols after Achilles tendon repairs increase recovery speed and strength make operative repair strength critical to positive outcomes after Achilles tendon ruptures. While previous research has focused on core (tendon proper) repair techniques, no previous literature has reported testing of core repairs augmented with epitenon sutures, which have been shown to increase the strength of repairs of flexor tendons of the hand. METHODS Five matched pairs of fresh frozen human Achilles tendons were tested with and without the addition of an epitenon suture to the core repair suture. All specimens were repaired using a No. 2 Ethibond Krakow locking loop core suture. The epitenon suture was added to one tendon randomly chosen from each pair, using a 4-0 nylon suture. All specimens were mounted on an MTS testing machine (MTS Systems Corp., Eden Prairie, MN) and loaded to failure, which was defined as a 1-cm gap formation. RESULTS The addition of epitenon sutures significantly increased the force necessary to produce a 2-mm gap as compared to core sutures alone by 74%, and it increased the average load to failure by 119%. Also, initial tendon stiffness was 173% greater in tendons reinforced with epitenon sutures. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that greater resistance to gap formation, approximation of tissue ends, and tensile strength were achieved by the addition of an epitenon suture. Clinical relevance may improve healing by decreased gap formation at the repair site and a lower risk of adhesion formation.","Shepard, Michelle E; Lindsey, Derek P; Chou, Loretta B",Foot & ankle international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17923058/,268

To enable clinicians to appropriately profile and treat suspected COVID-19 patients at the emergency department (ED), externally validated models that predict poor outcome are desperately needed. OBJECTIVE Our aims were to identify predictors of poor outcome, defined as mortality or ICU admission within 30 days, in patients presenting to the ED with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19, and to develop and externally validate a prediction model for poor outcome. METHODS In this prospective, multi-center study, we enrolled suspected COVID-19 patients presenting at the EDs of two hospitals in the Netherlands. We used backward logistic regression to develop a prediction model. We used the area under the curve (AUC), Brier score and pseudo-R2 to assess model performance. The model was externally validated in an Italian cohort. RESULTS We included 1193 patients between March 12 and May 27 2020, of whom 196 (16.4%) had a poor outcome. We identified 10 predictors of poor outcome: current malignancy (OR 2.774; 95%CI 1.682-4.576), systolic blood pressure (OR 0.981; 95%CI 0.964-0.998), heart rate (OR 1.001; 95%CI 0.97-1.028), respiratory rate (OR 1.078; 95%CI 1.046-1.111), oxygen saturation (OR 0.899; 95%CI 0.850-0.952), body temperature (OR 0.505; 95%CI 0.359-0.710), serum urea (OR 1.404; 95%CI 1.198-1.645), C-reactive protein (OR 1.013; 95%CI 1.001-1.024), lactate dehydrogenase (OR 1.007; 95%CI 1.002-1.013) and SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.456; 95%CI 1.526-3.953).

193618,Alternative methods of estimating an incubation distribution: examples from severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2007,"BACKGROUND Intra-arterial treatment of aneurysms by redirecting blood flow is a newer method. The redirection is based on a significantly more densely braided wire stent. The stent wall keeps the blood in the lumen of the stent and slows down the turbulent flow in the aneurysms. Stagnation of blood in the aneurysm sac leads to the formation of thrombus and subsequent exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. The aim of the study was to evaluate flow diverter device Pipeline for broad neck and giant aneurysm treatment. METHODS Fifteen patients with discovered aneurysm of the internal carotid artery were treated between November 2010 and February 2014. The majority of aneurysms of the internal carotid artery were located intradural at the ophthalmic part of the artery. The patients were treated using a flow diverter device Pipeline, which was placed over the aneurysm neck. Treatment success was assessed clinically and angiographically using O'Kelly Marotta scale. RESULTS Control angiography immediately after the release of the stent showed stagnation of the blood flow in the aneurysm sac. In none of the patients procedural and periprocedural complications were observed. 6 months after the procedure, control CT or MR angiography showed in almost all cases exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation and normal blood flow in the treated artery. Neurological status six months after the procedure was normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of aneurysms with flow diverter Pipeline device is a safe and significantly less time consuming method in comparison with standard techniques. This new method is a promising approach in treatment of broad neck aneurysms.","Jevsek, Marko; Mounayer, Charbel; Seruga, Tomaz",Radiology and oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27904445/,268

Makino, M. Joo, and J. K. Makino, J. Virol. 66:6031-6041, 1991). In this study, the subgenomic DI RNA system was used to determine how sequences flanking the intergenic region affect MHV RNA transcription and to identify the minimum intergenic sequence required for MHV transcription. DI cDNAs containing the intergenic region between genes 6 and 7, but with different lengths of upstream or downstream flanking sequences, were constructed. All DI cDNAs had an 18-nucleotide-long intergenic region that was identical to the 3' region of the genomic leader sequence, which contains two UCUAA repeat sequences. These constructs included 0 to 1,440 nucleotides of upstream flanking sequence and 0 to 1,671 nucleotides of downstream flanking sequence. An analysis of intracellular genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA species revealed that there were no significant differences in the ratios of subgenomic to genomic DI RNA for any of the DI RNA constructs. DI cDNAs which lacked the intergenic region flanking sequences and contained a series of deletions within the 18-nucleotide-long intergenic sequence were constructed to determine the minimum sequence necessary for subgenomic DI RNA transcription. Small amounts of subgenomic DI RNA were synthesized from genomic DI RNAs with the intergenic consensus sequences UCUAAAC and GCUAAAC, whereas no subgenomic DI RNA transcription was observed from DI RNAs containing UCUAAAG and GCTAAAG sequences. These analyses demonstrated that the sequences flanking the intergenic sequence between genes 6 and 7 did not play a role in subgenomic DI RNA transcription regulation and that the UCUAAAC consensus sequence was sufficient for subgenomic DI RNA transcription.","Makino, S; Joo, M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8388500/,268

Zika virus is a Flavivirus, and is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. In May 2015, the World Health Organization reported the first locally acquired transmission of ZIKV in Brazil, the first case in the Western Hemisphere. There have also been reports of increased incidence of microcephaly and other neurologic complications associated with ZIKV infection, as well as a 20-fold increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome during ZIKV outbreaks. In light of the clusters of microcephaly and neurologic manifestations in areas of ZIKV transmission, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV and associated complications an international public health emergency. The clinical presentations of ZIKV disease resemble many common infections, making the diagnosis of ZIKV disease a clinical challenge. Patients with ZIKV infection may have other coinfections that can distract clinicians from suspecting ZIKV disease in their patients. Complications from ZIKV, although uncommon, may be severe. Therefore, it is important for health care providers to remain alert and up to date in the efforts to control this emerging global health crisis. It is critical for physicians and other providers to know the growing list of countries and territories on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of nations with endemic ZIKV disease and to work closely with local health departments to prevent spread.

Infectious IBV RNA was generated in situ after the transfection of restricted recombinant vaccinia virus DNA into primary chick kidney cells previously infected with a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Recombinant IBV, containing two marker mutations, was recovered from the transfected cells. These results describe a reverse-genetics system for studying the molecular biology of IBV and establish a paradigm for generating genetically defined vaccines for IBV.","Casais, R; Thiel, V; Siddell, S G; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11711626/,268

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 4 focus group interviews were conducted in residents of Ukraine, with a total quantity of 48 people aged 16-70 years questioned and an anonymous questionnaire was conducted in 1,700 respondents, representing the adult population aged 18 years and older from all over Ukraine. The representative error of the study with probability of 0.95 does not exceed 4%. The processing of questionnaires was carried out by SDU Center of Social Researches (SDUCSR) employees, using the OSA program. RESULTS Results: 28.5% of respondents believe that politicians and media underestimate the danger of the COVID-19 epidemic, while other 28.1% believe that politicians and media adequately assess its danger. 18.9% of respondents are sure that the danger is exaggerated. As much as 24.5% of Ukrainian respondents could not decide on such assessment. The most common sources of information about disease/treatment are Internet and social media. Traditional media and relatives/acquaints who endured the COVID-19 also gain population`s confidence. A family doctor is the least popular source of information. 42.1% of respondents do not trust official information on the number of infected people and severity of the disease, and another 40% are not sure whether they should trust or not. Only 17.9% of respondents trust official information. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Within informing the society about public health in conditions of a COVID-19 pandemic it is better to provide communication strategy for various target audiences: for youth which is inclined to underestimate threats of epidemic and obtains information on social networks; for people of a retirement age (as risk group) who lack information because they use only traditional media (mainly TV); for women who need psychological support to decrease in level of stress in the family more often and also to overcome the negative post-stressful situations (connected with the death of the family/relatives); for men who are inclined to neglect their own health, etc.; for the people who have endured COVID-19 to prevent possible reinfection in them.","Kostenko, Andriana M; Yasenok, Viktoriia O; Svitailo, Nina D; Nazarov, Mykola S; Teslyk, Nataliia М; Smiianova, Olha I; Huschuk, Ihor V",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090276/,268

Weeks later, many retinas have foci of moderate to severe atrophy. The effect of coronavirus infection (after intravitreal inoculation) was examined on interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), the glycolipoprotein in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) thought to transport retinoids between the photoreceptors and the RPE. Changes in IRBP distribution accompanied virus-associated retinal pathology, including photoreceptor loss and RPE abnormalities. Immunohistochemistry on days 3 and 6 showed that IRBP had diffused into the neural retina away from the IPM. The IRBP became localized abnormally in the same areas as virus-induced lesions, shown by staining adjacent sections with a monoclonal antibody specific for the viral nucleocapsid protein. Moreover, the level of IRBP in isolated retinas, measured in an immunoslot-blot assay, decreased significantly by day 3 and remained low through day 23. This decrease was confirmed in eyecups isolated on day 6. It may be caused in part by loss of photoreceptors and diffusion of IRBP through the retina into the vitreous. These studies show that a virus may induce an acute, limited infection in the retina that can be cleared by the host. However, the infection initiated a series of events resulting in long-term reduction and redistribution of a critical photoreceptor protein.","Robbins, S G; Wiggert, B; Kutty, G; Chader, G J; Detrick, B; Hooks, J J",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1309730/,268

Under this policy, the economic burden on dental professionals and their employees was immense. With the prolonged duration of coronavirus health crisis, it was clear that dentists and associated workers and companies cannot bear the cost of longer suspension of regular dental services. At this point, calls have been made for gradual return to regular dental clinical practice. However, dental health professionals around the world realized that oral care services should be tailored to fit the time of COVID-19 pandemic. An important question to be raised here is regarding planning the dental treatment during the time of coronavirus pandemic. Should a dentist plan the dental treatment in a different way to that at a normal time? This paper aims to propose a simple strategy to plan the restorative dental treatment at the time of coronavirus pandemic. The aim of this strategy is to expand the range of oral care services and minimize the risk of infection with this deadly virus.

We constructed recombinant forms of the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) containing the gene encoding full-length SARS-CoV S with and without a C-terminal epitope tag called MVA/S-HA and MVA/S, respectively. Cells infected with MVA/Sor MVA/S-HA synthesized a 200-kDa protein, which was recognized by antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of SARS-CoV S or the epitope tag in Western blot analyses. Further studies indicated that S was N-glycosylated and migrated in SDS polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass of approximately 160 kDa after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F. The acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H indicated trafficking of S to the medial Golgi compartment, and confocal microscopy showed that S was transported to the cell surface. Intranasal or intramuscular inoculations of BALB/c mice with MVA/S produced serum antibodies that recognized the SARS S in ELISA and neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. Moreover, MVA/S administered by either route elicited protective immunity, as shown by reduced titers of SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice after challenge. Passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with MVA/S to naïve mice also reduced the replication of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract after challenge, demonstrating a role for antibody to S in protection. The attenuated nature of MVA and the ability of MVA/S to induce neutralizing antibody that protects mice support further development of this candidate vaccine.","Bisht, Himani; Roberts, Anjeanette; Vogel, Leatrice; Bukreyev, Alexander; Collins, Peter L; Murphy, Brian R; Subbarao, Kanta; Moss, Bernard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15096611/,268

Faecal samples of 78 dogs that have been vaccinated against CPV and later presented with clinical signs suspected of parvovirus infection were used. Fifty (64.1 per cent) samples tested positive by PCR for CPV. No CPV vaccine type was detected. The disease by CPV-2b occurred in older and female dogs when compared with that by CPV-2c. The clinical signs presented by infected dogs were similar when any of both variants were involved. In most cases of disease, the resulting infection by field variants occurred shortly after CPV vaccination. Two dogs that had been subjected to a complete vaccination schedule and presented with clinical signs after 10 days of vaccination, had the CPV-2c variant associated. The phylogenetic studies showed a close relationship of the isolates in vaccinated dogs to European field strains. Despite the limited sample size in this study, the findings point to the significance of the continuous molecular typing of the virus as a tool to monitor the prevalent circulating CPV strains and access the efficacy of current vaccines. Adjustments on the vaccine types to be used may have to be evaluated again according to each epidemiological situation in order to achieve the dog's optimal immune protection against CPV.","Miranda, C; Thompson, G",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960988/,268

Some of these entities are quite common, but are often misdiagnosed. Herpes simplex appears to be the most common viral infection involving the hand. These and other viral infections can have much graver consequences in immunosuppressed patients. Recurrent episodes are common in herpetic and other viral infections. Health care workers have long been at risk, but improved compliance with prophylactic measures would seem to be decreasing the number of cases in this population. A plea has been made to disregard the term herpetic whitlow because it is an inaccurate description of the lesion and implies that an inappropriate type of treatment is required. Bacterial whitlows or felons require incision and drainage of the deep pulp space. Herpetic infections in this area do not. Less common infections such as cowpox, pseudocowpox (milkers nodules), ORF, and coxsackievirus (HFMD) infection of the hand have been brought to the attention of the reader. The bothersome warts caused by the human papillomavirus have been described and the systemic ramifications of hand-to-hand contact and hand injury causing more serious viral problems has been mentioned.

In this study, we constructed an attenuated S. enterica serovar Typhi strain stably expressing conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by integrating the N gene into the pilV gene, which was under the control of the type IVB pilus operon promoter in S. enterica serovar Typhi. BALB/c mice were immunized with this recombinant strain through different routes: intranasally, orogastrically, intraperitoneally, and intravenously. Results showed that the intranasal route caused the highest production of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG2a, and secretory IgA, where IgG2a was imprinted as a Th1 cell bias. Moreover, this recombinant live vaccine induced significantly high levels of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activities and increased gamma interferon-producing T cells compared with the parental strain. Our work provides insights into how the type IVB pilus operon promoter controlling SARS-CoV N gene expression in Salmonella might be attractive for a live-vector vaccine against SRAS-CoV infection, for it could induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses.

According to a prevailing hypothesis, the viral membrane protein, which is a heterodimeric protein unit, is transported to the plasma membrane (PM), where it awaits binding to the viral nucleocapsid (NC). This hypothesis predicts that the viral membrane protein heterodimers accumulate at the cell surface when expressed in the absence of NCs. We have tested this prediction by analyzing the spike protein expression phenotype of a Semliki Forest virus (SFV) variant which contains a capsid gene deletion. We found that viral membrane protein heterodimers were formed and transported to the cell surface normally. However, instead of accumulating at the PM as expected, the membrane proteins were rapidly degraded. In the case of the E1 subunit, degradation resulted in the release of a soluble E1 fragment into the medium. The fact that this pathway of protein degradation is mostly inhibited during wild-type virus infection suggests that viral membrane proteins are very efficiently captured by NCs into budding complexes and that normally no sizeable pool of free membrane protein complexes exists at the PM.","Zhao, H; Garoff, H",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1331511/,268
197325,Risk of ruling out severe acute respiratory syndrome by ruling in another diagnosis: variable incidence of atypical bacteria coinfection based on diagnostic assays.,2006,"The aim of the present study was to define the site of replication of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Antibodies directed against several proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein, including the 3C-like protease (3CLpro), the putative polymerase (POL), helicase, and a recently described protein (p22) derived from the C terminus of the open reading frame 1a protein (CT1a), were used to probe MHV-infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM). At early times of infection, all of these proteins showed a distinct punctate labeling by IF. Antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein also displayed a punctate labeling that largely colocalized with the replicase proteins. When infected cells were metabolically labeled with 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate (BrUTP), the site of viral RNA synthesis was shown by IF to colocalize with CT1a and the 3CLpro. As shown by EM, CT1a localized to LAMP-1 positive late endosomes/lysosomes while POL accumulated predominantly in multilayered structures with the appearance of endocytic carrier vesicles. These latter structures were also labeled to some extent with both anti-CT1a and LAMP-1 antibodies and could be filled with fluid phase endocytic tracers. When EM was used to determine sites of BrUTP incorporation into viral RNA at early times of infection, the viral RNA localized to late endosomal membranes as well. These results demonstrate that MHV replication occurs on late endosomal membranes and that several nonstructural proteins derived from the gene 1 polyprotein may participate in the formation and function of the viral replication complexes.","van der Meer, Y; Snijder, E J; Dobbe, J C; Schleich, S; Denison, M R; Spaan, W J; Locker, J K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438855/,268

To study associations of severity of COVID-19 disease with clinical features and laboratory markers. 2. To develop a model to predict the need for ICU treatment. METHODS This is an analysis of clinical course in 800 consecutive patients from a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital in Pune, India (8th April to 15th June 2020). We obtained clinical and laboratory information, severity grading and progress from hospital records. We studied associations of these characteristics with need for ICU management. We developed a predictive model of need for ICU treatment among first 500 patients and tested its sensitivity and specificity in the following 300 patients. RESULTS Average age was 41 years, 16% were 20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines, 73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older (56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in subsequent 300 patients; exclusion of expensive laboratory tests (Ferritin, C- Reactive Protein) did not affect accuracy. CONCLUSION In the early phase of COVID- 19 pendemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients were young and asymptomatic. Need for ICU treatment was predicted by simple measures including higher age, symptomatic onset, low SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray.

The full-length CKLF1 cDNA contains 530 bp encoding 99 amino acid residues with a CC motif similar to that of other CC family chemokines. Recombinant CKLF1 exhibits chemotactic activity on leucocytes and stimulates proliferation of murine skeletal muscle cells. We questioned whether CKLF1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation and proliferation in the lung. Therefore we used efficient in vivo gene delivery method to investigate the biological effect of CKLF1 in the murine lung. METHODS CKLF1-expressing plasmid, pCDI-CKLF1, was constructed and injected into the skeletal muscles followed by electroporation. Lung tissues were obtained at the end of week 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively after injection. The pathological changes in the lungs were observed by light microscope. RESULTS A single intramuscular injection of CKLF1 plasmid DNA into BALB/c mice caused dramatic pathological changes in the lungs of treated mice. These changes included peribronchial leukocyte infiltration, epithelial shedding, collagen deposition, proliferation of bronchial smooth muscle cells and fibrosis of the lung. CONCLUSIONS The sustained morphological abnormalities of the bronchial and bronchiolar wall, the acute pneumonitis and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis induced by CKLF1 were similar to phenomena observed in chronic persistent asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome.

It requires a comprehensive approach, as well as careful postoperative monitoring. We present here the first case of a transperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy (TLRN) for renal cell carcinoma, of the clear-cell type, performed in a hemophilia B patient. The level of factor IX clotting activity before surgery and on postoperative days 1-6 was maintained at 65-130% and at 30-40% on subsequent days until healing of the post-operative wound was achieved. The intraoperative and postoperative courses were uneventful. TLRN can therefore be considered safe and effective for renal cell carcinoma. In hemophilia patients, the TLRN procedure requires proper preparation, as well as adequate substitution therapy for the deficient coagulation factor provided by a multidisciplinary team in a comprehensive center.","Gajda, Slawomir; Szopiński, Tomasz; Szczepanik, Andrzej B; Sosnowski, Roman; Szczepanik, Anna M",Central European journal of urology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27729993/,268

OBJECTIVE To study the local therapeutic efficacy, side effects and complications of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases. This is the first reported experience of radiofrequency ablation for treating malignant hepatic tumors in Israel. METHODS Fifteen consecutive patients, aged 53-73 years, with 23 lesions (8 patients with HCC and 7 with secondary liver tumors) underwent radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia. RITA nine-array 5 cm thermal ablation catheter and the model 1500 generator were used. The mean diameter of all tumors was 4.28 cm (range 1-10 cm). Three lesions were 1-3 cm in diameter (small), 17 lesions measured 3.1-5 cm (medium), and 3 measured 5.1-10 cm (large). RESULTS Complete necrosis was found in 8 (66%) of 12 HCCs by computed tomography scan. Of the remainder, diffuse tumor recurrence was demonstrated in three lesions (25%) after lipiodol injection and there was one local tumor recurrence. In the metastases group complete necrosis was found in 5 of 11 lesions (45%). One major complication (peritonitis) was treated with antibiotics and four (26%) minor complications (right pleural effusion, small subcapsular hematoma) were monitored. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation appears to be an effective, safe and relatively simple procedure for the treatment of liver tumors.","Bachar, Gil N; Greif, Franklin; Mor, Eytan; Tur-Kaspa, Ran; Belenky, Alexander",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12901246/,268

203106,Environmental surface testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during prolonged isolation of an asymptomatic carrier,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To 1) analyze the short-term biochemical improvements and clinical outcomes following treatment of children with post-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 inflammatory syndrome (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) admitted to U.K. PICUs and 2) collate current treatment guidance from U.K. PICUs. DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments. Retaining clinical equipoise regarding treatment will allow clinicians to enroll children in robust clinical trials to determine the optimal treatment for this novel important condition.","Davies, Patrick; Lillie, Jon; Prayle, Andrew; Evans, Claire; Griffiths, Benedict; du Pré, Pascale; Johnson, Mae; Krishnan Kanthimathinathan, Hari; Playfor, Stephen; Deep, Akash; Brierley, Joe; Waters, Gareth; Mohammad, Zoha; Singh, Davinder; Jardine, Michelle; Ross, Oliver; Shetty, Nayan; Worrall, Mark; Sinha, Ruchi; Koul, Ashwani; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Vyas, Harish; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Scholefield, Barnaby R",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,268
205369,Atypical Manifestations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Children: A Review,2021,"Maternal immune adaptation to accommodate pregnancy depends on sufficient availability of regulatory T (Treg) cells to enable embryo implantation. Toll-like receptor 4 is implicated as a key upstream driver of a controlled inflammatory response, elicited by signals in male partner seminal fluid, to initiate expansion of the maternal Treg cell pool after mating. Here, we report that mice with null mutation in Tlr4 (Tlr4-/-) exhibit impaired reproductive outcomes after allogeneic mating, with reduced pregnancy rate, elevated mid-gestation fetal loss, and fetal growth restriction, compared to Tlr4+/+ wild-type controls. To investigate the effects of TLR4 deficiency on early events of maternal immune adaptation, TLR4-regulated cytokines and immune regulatory microRNAs were measured in the uterus at 8 h post-mating by qPCR, and Treg cells in uterus-draining lymph nodes were evaluated by flow cytometry on day 3.5 post-coitum. Ptgs2 encoding prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, cytokines Csf2, Il6, Lif, and Tnf, chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10, and microRNAs miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-223 were induced by mating in wild-type mice, but not, or to a lesser extent, in Tlr4-/- mice. CD4+ T cells were expanded after mating in Tlr4+/+ but not Tlr4-/- mice, with failure to expand peripheral CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1- or thymic CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1+ Treg cell populations, and fewer Treg cells expressed Ki67 proliferation marker and suppressive function marker CTLA4. We conclude that TLR4 is an essential mediator of the inflammation-like response in the pre-implantation uterus that induces generation of Treg cells to support robust pregnancy tolerance and ensure optimal fetal growth and survival.","Chan, Hon Y; Moldenhauer, Lachlan M; Groome, Holly M; Schjenken, John E; Robertson, Sarah A",Sci Rep,,268
206145,Dysregulated Host Response in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Induced Critical Illness,2021,"Micro-organisms form the first pioneer community in the history of biological life, thought to be present in the primordial soup and evolving later with more complex life-forms. Among micro-organisms, viruses form a separate taxon of organisms. Viruses are obligate parasites, being inactive without a host and becoming active once in contact with specific hosts. Viruses, with an inherent ability to infect and hijack cellular structures, have been utilised as vectors to introduce foreign genetic material in a variety of biological species, e.g. adenoviral vectors. However, viruses have also been the root cause of many infectious diseases, most notable being HIV-AIDS, for its resistance to treatment and omnipresent occurrence. There are many families of viruses like retroviridae, picornaviridae and poxviridae. This review focuses on a specific member of the coronaviridae, the SARS-CoV-2. This virus is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarises its transmission, molecular mechanism by which it causes disease, associated clinical symptoms and the strategies available to control it from sources like PubMed, Google Scholar, webservers of National Institute of Health (NIH), European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), World Health Organisation (WHO), United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) available as on 1st May 2021.","Mohanty, Swaraj; Paul, Subhojit; Ahmad, Yasmin",Virusdisease,,268

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an important tumor marker, whose level in patients is of great significance for diagnosis of many diseases. Here, we report the identification of LDH aptamers by 9 rounds of screening from a length-mixed single-stranded DNA library using the SELEX technology. After the 3rd and 7th rounds of aptamer screening, affinity was significantly improved, and fluorescence quantitative analysis showed stronger affinity for the aptamers selected from the 7th to 9th rounds of screening. After high-throughput sequencing, motif analysis, and secondary structure prediction, we finally chose and further investigated 15 candidate LDH aptamer sequences with obvious differences in secondary structure in the 7th to 9th rounds of screening. Among them, LDH7-1, LDH7-9, LDH8-2, and LDH9-1 were shown to bind to LDH protein with high affinity and specificity with Kd < 25 nM. This study provides new ideas for rapid detection of LDH protein content and enzyme activity, thus contributing to the development of rapid medical detection.","Guo, Linghui; Song, Ying; Yuan, Yanwen; Chen, Jinlei; Liang, Haifeng; Guo, Fei; Yu, Zhi; Liang, Pei; Wang, Yapei; Wang, Pu",Anal Bioanal Chem,,268

Anticipation of future reward, such as an upcoming vacation, can often be more gratifying than the experience itself. Theories suggest the utility of anticipation underpins various behaviors, ranging from beneficial information-seeking to harmful addiction. However, how neural systems compute anticipatory utility remains unclear. We analyzed the brain activity of human participants as they performed a task involving choosing whether to receive information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model, we show three brain regions orchestrate anticipatory utility. Specifically, ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks the value of anticipatory utility, dopaminergic midbrain correlates with information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity mediates a functional coupling between these regions. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified neural underpinning for anticipation's influence over decision-making and unify a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.","Iigaya, Kiyohito; Hauser, Tobias U; Kurth-Nelson, Zeb; O039,; Doherty, John P; Dayan, Peter; Dolan, Raymond J",Sci.

This shift in education from traditional class-room learning to computer-based learning might be one of the largest edu-cational experiments to date. As the online teaching-learning process has become more prevalent in India due to COVID 19 pandemic, it becomes par-ticularly important to know its growth and to know whether it’s actually help-ing the students achieve what they expect out of college. The present study was therefore designed to understand the student’s perspective, attitudes, and readiness about online classes being conducted at the University level. An Observational, Descriptive study was conducted. The data was collected using a Questionnaire. The present study was carried out amongst 200 stu-dents. After analyzing the results, it was found that 74% of the students liked studying through online classes. The most common reason (49%) as to why the students like studying online were that the study time becomes lexible, and they can study anytime they want. Lack of co-curricular activity was the most common issue (34%) of online classes, as reported by the students. Most of the students were found satisied with the content and procedure of online teaching. About 30% of the students reported that they prefer their lecture being delivered through a PPT with an audio recording. The present study that was conducted among college students revealed that maximum students are in favor of studying through online classes, but they feel that there is a lack of co-curricular activities in the online mode of conducting classes. As the students are in favor of online classes, such classes must be continued with some interventions.

233595,Retesting for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Patterns of testing from a large US healthcare system,2020,"Background: The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly understood and to date has generally been characterised by a lower number of declared cases and deaths as compared to other regions of the world. Paucity of reliable information, with insights largely derived from limited RT-PCR testing in high-risk and urban populations, has been one of the biggest barriers to understanding the course of the pandemic and informed policy-making. Here we estimate seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Ethiopia during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods: We undertook a population-based household seroprevalence serosurvey based on 1856 participants in Ethiopia, in the capital city Addis Ababa, and in Jimma, a middle-sized town in the Oromia region, and its rural surroundings (districts of Seka and Mana), between 22 July and 02 September 2020. We tested one random participant per household for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a high specificity rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and evaluated population seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance as well as age and sex of the participants. Findings: In total, 2304 random households were visited, with 1856 individuals consenting to participate. This produced a sample of 956 participants in Addis Ababa and 900 participants in Jimma. IgG prevalence was estimated at 1.9% (95% CI 0.4–3.7%), and combined IgM/IgG prevalence at 3.5% (95% CI 1.7–5.4%) for Addis Ababa in early August 2020, with higher prevalence in central sub-cities. Prevalence in Jimma town was lower at 0.5% (95% CI 0–1.8%) for IgG and 1.6% (95%CI 0–4.1%) for IgM/IgG, while in rural Jimma IgG prevalence was 0.2% and IgM/IgG 0.4% in early September. Interpretation: More than four months after the first cases were detected in Ethiopia, Addis Ababa displayed a prevalence under 5% and likely as low as 2%, while rural Jimma displayed a prevalence of 0.2%. A 2% seroprevalence figure for the capital translated to a number of cases at least five times larger than those reported for the country as a whole. At the same time, it contrasts with significantly higher seroprevalence figures in large cities in Europe and America only two to three months after the first cases. This population-based seroepidemiological study thus provides evidence of a slower spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Ethiopian population during the first wave of the pandemic and does not appear to support the notion that lower case numbers were simply a reflection of limited testing and surveillance.

237056,Alert to Potential Contagiousness: A Case of Lung Cancer With Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed at risk the kidney transplant (KT) population. We describe clinical pictures, risk factors for death, and chances to recovery in a large cohort of KT recipients with COVID-19. METHODS: Inclusion in a Spanish prospectively filled registry was allowed for KT cases with confirmed COVID-19. Outcomes were assessed as in-hospital mortality or recovery. RESULTS: The study population comprised of 414 patients. Fever, respiratory symptoms, and dyspnea were the most frequent COVID-19-related symptoms, and 81.4% of them had pneumonia. More than one-third of patients showed digestive symptoms at diagnosis, combinations of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most patients were hospitalized, 12.1% in intensive care units, and 17.6% needed ventilator support. Treatment for COVID-19 included frequently hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, high-dose steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab. After a mean follow-up of 44 days, the fatality rate was 26.3%. Pneumonia without gastrointestinal symptoms was associated with a 36.3% mortality (respiratory phenotype), and gastrointestinal symptoms without pneumonia with a 5.3% mortality (gastrointestinal phenotype). The mixed pneumonia and gastrointestinal phenotype showed an intermediate mortality of 19.5% (mixed phenotype). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and pneumonia were independently associated with death, whereas the gastrointestinal phenotype was associated with recovery. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is frequent among the KT population. Advanced age and pneumonia are the main clinical features associated with a high-mortality rate. Gastrointestinal disease is associated with a more benign course and lower mortality.","Crespo, Marta; Mazuecos, Auxiliadora; Rodrigo, Emilio; Gavela, Eva; Villanego, Florentino; Sánchez-Alvarez, Emilio; González-Monte, Esther; Jiménez-Martín, Carlos; Melilli, Edoardo; Diekman, Fritz; Zárraga, Sofía; Hernández, Domingo; Pascual, Julio",Transplantation,,268

The disease has affected more than 7,500,000 individuals globally and killed approximately 450,000 individuals. The disease is caused by a very small virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus with a spike-like structure on its envelope that can interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor after cleavage. ACE2 receptors are present in the human lungs and other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus; viruses in this subgenus have spread widely in the previous years and caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndromes.","Khashkhosha, Hind Khairi; Elhadi, Muhammed",Med Hypotheses,,268

OBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. SETTING: A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). RESULTS: Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction<0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P = 0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings.","Ebinger, Joseph E; Achamallah, Natalie; Ji, Hongwei; Claggett, Brian L; Sun, Nancy; Botting, Patrick; Nguyen, Trevor-Trung; Luong, Eric; Kim, Elizabeth H; Park, Eunice; Liu, Yunxian; Rosenberry, Ryan; Matusov, Yuri; Zhao, Steven; Pedraza, Isabel; Zaman, Tanzira; Thompson, Michael; Raedschelders, Koen; Berg, Anders H; Grein, Jonathan D; Noble, Paul W; Chugh, Sumeet S; Bairey Merz, C Noel; Marbán, Eduardo; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Solomon, Scott D; Albert, Christine M; Chen, Peter; Cheng, Susan",PLoS One,,268

Since its origin, the number of infected and deceased cases has been growing exponentially in almost all the affected countries of the world. The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world results in the scarcity of medical resources and overburdened hospitals. As a result, the researchers and technocrats are continuously working across the world for the inculcation of efficient strategies which may assist the government and healthcare system in controlling and managing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study provides an extensive review of the ongoing strategies such as diagnosis, prediction, drug and vaccine development and preventive measures used in combating the COVID-19 along with technologies used and limitations. Moreover, this review also provides a comparative analysis of the distinct type of data, emerging technologies, approaches used in diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19, statistics of contact tracing apps, vaccine production platforms used in the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the study highlights some challenges and pitfalls observed in the systematic review which may assist the researchers to develop more efficient strategies used in controlling and managing the spread of COVID-19.","Ding, Weiping; Nayak, Janmenjoy; Swapnarekha, H; Abraham, Ajith; Naik, Bighnaraj; Pelusi, Danilo",,,268
243661,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and critically ill children,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In the stressful context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some reports have raised concerns regarding psychiatric disorders with the use of hydroxychloroquine. In this study, we reviewed all psychiatric adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, as well as in other indications, reported in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports. METHODS: First, we analyzed all psychiatric adverse effects, including suicide, of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients reported to 16 June 2020. We also performed disproportionality analysis to investigate the risk of reporting psychiatric disorders with hydroxychloroquine compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. We used reporting odds ratios (RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate disproportionality. Second, we sought to examine the psychiatric safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in other indications (before 2020). RESULTS: Among the 1754 reports with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we found 56 psychiatric adverse effects. Half of these adverse effects were serious, including four completed suicides, three cases of intentional self-injury, and 12 cases of psychotic disorders with hallucinations. Compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir, the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of reporting psychiatric disorders (ROR 6.27, 95% CI 2.74-14.35). Before 2020, suicide was the main cause of death among all adverse drug reactions reported with hydroxychloroquine, followed by cardiac adverse effects (cardiomyopathy) and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine experienced serious psychiatric disorders, and, among these patients, some committed suicide. Further real-world studies are needed to quantify the psychiatric risk associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Garcia, Philippe; Revet, Alexis; Yrondi, Antoine; Rousseau, Vanessa; Degboe, Yannick; Montastruc, François",Drug Saf,,268
244115,"Risk Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Homeless Shelters in Chicago, Illinois-March-May, 2020",2020,"How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation. Often the decisions made are necessitated by events, social pressure, or the need of the hour, which may not represent the will of the nation. While some are pleased with it, others might show resentment. Coronavirus (COVID-19) brought a mix of similar emotions from the nations towards the decisions taken by their respective governments. Social media was bombarded with posts containing both positive and negative sentiments on the COVID-19, pandemic, lockdown, hashtags past couple of months. Despite geographically close, many neighboring countries reacted differently to one another. For instance, Denmark and Sweden, which share many similarities, stood poles apart on the decision taken by their respective governments. Yet, their nation's support was mostly unanimous, unlike the South Asian neighboring countries where people showed a lot of anxiety and resentment. This study tends to detect and analyze sentiment polarity and emotions demonstrated during the initial phase of the pandemic and the lockdown period employing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques on Twitter posts. Deep long short-term memory (LSTM) models used for estimating the sentiment polarity and emotions from extracted tweets have been trained to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the sentiment140 dataset. The use of emoticons showed a unique and novel way of validating the supervised deep learning models on tweets extracted from Twitter.","Imran, Ali Shariq; Doudpota, Sher Mohammad; Kastrati, Zenun; Bhatra, Rakhi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10031v1.pdf,268
244564,Severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in asymptomatic vaccinated healthcare workers,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced infection can be associated with a coagulopathy, findings consistent with infection-induced inflammatory changes as observed in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.","Connors, Jean M; Levy, Jerrold H",Blood,,268
245056,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 in cervico-vaginal secretion of COVID-19-affected female: A prospective observational study from India,2021,"Importance: Cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN) is a common generalized slowly progressive neuropathy, second in prevalence only to diabetic neuropathy. Most patients with CSPN have significant pain. Many medications have been tried for pain reduction in CSPN, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN. Objective: To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN. Design, Setting, and Participants: From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics. The trial included response adaptive randomization. Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power). Patient engagement was maintained throughout the trial, which helped guide the study and identify ways to communicate and disseminate information. Analysis was performed from December 11, 2015, to January 19, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive nortriptyline (n = 134), duloxetine (n = 126), pregabalin (n = 73), or mexiletine (n = 69). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a utility function that was a composite of the efficacy (participant reported pain reduction of &#8805;50% from baseline to week 12) and quit (participants who discontinued medication) rates. Results: Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69-0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68-0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55-0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42-0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

We report data from 29 whole-body autopsies of COVID-19 deaths occurring in hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia - the first large autopsy case series from Africa. METHODS: We performed a descriptive post-mortem examination study of inpatient COVID-19 related deaths at two hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. Whole-body autopsies were conducted according to Standard Operating Procedures. Gross and histopathological examinations of all organs were performed. Patient demographics, history, co-morbidities, autopsy gross and microscopic findings, and cause(s) of death were recorded and analyzed using STATA version 14. Variables were grouped and presented as frequencies and percentages. FINDINGS: Autopsies were performed on 29 decedents (mean age = 44 ± 15.8years; age range = 19-82; 17/29 [58.8%] males). 22/29 [75.9%] cases were <55 years of age. A spectrum of pathological manifestations of COVID-19 were seen in all organs. The commonest causes of death were pulmonary thromboembolism (13/29, 45%), Diffuse Alveolar Damage (9/29, 31%), and COVID-19 pneumonia (7/29, 25%). 22/29 (76%) had co-morbidities. Common co-morbidities included HIV (8/29, 28%), Hypertension (6/29, 20%) Tuberculosis (3/29, 10%), Diabetes (3/29, 10%). CONCLUSIONS: A spectrum of gross anatomical and histopathological findings are seen in COVID-19 deaths in hospitalized decedents. These appear broadly similar to those reported from China, Europe and USA. Differences include a younger age group, and co-morbidities of HIV and TB co-infection which require further investigation.","Himwaze, Cordilia Maria; Telendiy, Viktor; Maate, Fred; Mupeta, Songwe; Chitalu, Chanda; Chanda, Duncan; Julius, Peter; Mumba, Chibamba; Marimo, Clemence; Hamukale, Amos; Mulenga, Llyod; Shibemba, Aaron Lunda; Zumla, Alimuddin; Mucheleng039,; anga, Luchenga Adam",Int J Infect Dis,,268

248523,Countermeasures for Home Infection of Novel Coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore mechanistic benefits of glucose-lowering agents that extend beyond glycemic control with the potential to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complications. DATA SOURCES: The following PubMed literature search terms were used from July 2020 to January 2, 2021: diabetes, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), glucose-lowering agents, and pharmacology. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies reporting on the association between diabetes, COVID-19 adverse outcomes, and the potential roles of glucose-lowering agents were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Selected glucose-lowering agents have benefits beyond glycemic control, with the potential to reduce the risks of severe complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key benefits include anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, immune modulating, and enzyme/receptor effects. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review summarizes the current knowledge of glucose-lowering agents and their potential roles in COVID-19 outcomes. Considering beneficial mechanisms on COVID-19 outcomes that extend beyond glycemic control as well as safety profiles, current data suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors and metformin may have the most promise and warrant further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Certain glucose-lowering agents may offer additional benefits beyond glucose control-namely, by modulating the mechanisms contributing to adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. DPP-IV inhibitors and metformin appear to have the most promise. However, current published literature on diabetes medications and COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution. Most published studies are retrospective and consist of convenience samples, and some lack adequate analytical approaches with confounding biases. Ongoing trials aim to evaluate the effects of glucose-lowering agents in reducing the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.","Berlie, Helen D; Kale-Pradhan, Pramodini B; Orzechowski, Tara; Jaber, Linda A",Ann Pharmacother,,268
248945,Partner testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive women presenting for delivery,2021,"Contaminant levels are lower in Antarctica than elsewhere in the world because of its low anthropogenic activities. However, the northern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, is close to South America and experiences the greatest anthropogenic pressure in Antarctica. Here, we investigated, in two Antarctic Peninsula islands, intra and interspecific factors that influence the concentrations of 17 trace elements (TEs) in blood and feathers of three penguin species breeding sympatrically in relation to their trophic ecology assessed via a stable isotopic approach (C, N and S). Geographical location, foraging zone (Î´13C and Î´34S) and diet influences the interspecific difference, and sex and maturity stage diet influence the intraspecific difference of Pygoscelis penguins. Penguins from Livingston showed higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dry weight - dw) of Zn (103), Mn (0.3), and Fe (95) than those from King George Island (Zn: 80, Mn: 1.9, and Fe: 11). Gender-related differences were observed, as males showed significantly higher values (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Rb (3.4) and Î´15N in blood of gentoo, and Ca (1344) in Adélie feathers. Chicks of gentoo and Adélie presented higher Zn, Mg, Ca, and Sr and lower 13C values in blood than adults. The highest concentrations (mean, ng. g-1, dw) of Cd (0.2) and Cu (26), and the lowest Î´15N values were found in chinstrap. Geographical, intraspecific (i.e., ontogenetic and gender-related) and interspecific differences in feeding seemed to have influenced TE and stable isotope values in these animals. The TE bioaccumulation by penguins may have also been influenced by natural enrichment in environmental levels of these elements, which seems to be the case for Fe, Zn, and Mn. However, the high level of some of the TEs (Mn, Cd, and Cr) may reflect the increase of local and global human activities.","Padilha, J A; Carvalho, G O; Espejo, W; Souza, J S; Pizzochero, A C; Cunha, L S T; Costa, E S; Pessôa, A R L; Almeida, A P; Torres, J P M; Lepoint, G; Michel, L N; Das, K; Dorneles, P R",Environ Pollut,,268

248947,Partner testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive women presenting for delivery,2021,"BACKGROUND: Management of disease-modifying therapies in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) during the COVID-19 pandemic is a controversial issue. Alemtuzumab is an immunosuppressive drug that induces lymphocytes depletion. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency and severity of COVID-19 in a case series of patients treated with alemtuzumab in our center. METHODS: Ten patients with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS were phoned and asked about symptoms suggestive and COVID-19 using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age was 43.7 ± 9.65 years old, and 8 (80%) were females. The mean time since disease diagnosis was 17.30 ± 8.59 years, and all were patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Mean time from the last dose of Alemtuzumab was 9.80 ± 6.64 months, and last lymphocyte count was 760 ± 231 / µL. Two patients (20%) developed symptoms highly suggestive of COVID-19. Disease duration was 2 and 7 days. None patient required hospital admission. Patients with COVID-19 symptoms had longer clinical course of MS. Conversely, we did not find statistically significant differences regarding age, EDSS, last lymphocyte count, and months since the last dose of alemtuzumab administered between patients having or not symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients receiving alemtuzumab showed very mild symptoms of COVID-19. We speculate that immune reconstitution induced by treatment may induce positive changes in the immune system in the defense against SARS-CoV2. Further research about alemtuzumab and their role in COVID-infection is necessary to confirm these preliminary findings.","Matías-Guiu, Jorge; Montero-Escribano, Paloma; Pytel, Vanesa; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; Matias-Guiu, Jordi A",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,268
250408,Trophoblast damage with acute and chronic intervillositis: disruption of the placental barrier by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide in 2020. Coronaviruses could mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans and multiple system infections in many animals. The coronavirus enters the host cell through the binding of surface spike glycoprotein (S Protein) with host angiotensin-converting enzyme-â ¡ (ACE2) protein. METHODS: ACE2 sequences of various species were aligned with human ACE2, accordingly, homology models for different species were constructed. Then, S-protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans.

255657,"Excess Deaths during Influenza and Coronavirus Disease and Infection-Fatality Rate for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, the Netherlands",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is the standard of care for hematologic disorders requiring splenectomy. Less is known about the outcomes following robotic-assisted splenectomy (RS) for this indication. Our aim was to describe outcomes of RS to LS in pediatric patients with hematologic disorders in our institution. METHODS: A single institution retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients undergoing LS vs. RS from 2014 to 2019. Patient demographics, diagnosis, spleen size, hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, post-operative opioid use, and hospital charges were evaluated. Standard univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included in the study (14 LS, 10 RS). The mean spleen size at the time of surgery was larger in the RS group compared to LS (14.5â¯cm vs. 12.2â¯cm, pâ¯=â¯0.03). Operative time between the two cohorts was comparable (RS 140.5 vs LS 154.9â¯min). Median LOS for RS was shorter than LS (2.1 vs. 3.2â¯days, pâ¯=â¯0.02). Cumulative postoperative opioid analgesic requirements were not significantly different between the groups (17.4â¯mg vs. 30.5â¯mg). The median hospital charges, including the surgical procedure and hospital stay were higher in the RS group ($44,724 RS vs $30,255 LS, pâ¯=â¯0.01). CONCLUSION: Robotic splenectomy is a safe and feasible option for pediatric patients with hematologic disorders, and was associated with decreased LOS but higher charges compared to laparoscopic splenectomy. Further studies are required to delineate the optimal use and potential benefits of robot-assisted surgical techniques in children.

258913,Journal Club-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2: Impact on COPD Patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was defined as a species of beta coronavirus causing atypical respiratory disease in humans. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented health and economic crisis worldwide. Little is known about the specifics of its influence on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). In this study, we aim to investigate the prevalence and mortality in PLWHA co-infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The databases PUBMED, EMBASE, BioRxiv, and medRxiv were searched up to 9 March 2021 to explore the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA. Cohort studies and case series meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified 14 eligible studies, 9 of which were cohort and 5 were case series. A total of 203,761 patients with COVID-19 were identified (7718 PLWHA vs. 196,043 non-PLWHA). Meta-analyses estimated the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA was 0.774% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00393-0.01517] and 8.814% (95% CI 0.05766-0.13245) respectively. COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA do not seem to be associated with higher mortality, as compared to non-PLWHA [relative risk (RR) 0.96 (95% CI 0.88-1.06)]. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, RR 5.2 (95% CI 4.25-6.36), hypertension and chronic cardiac disease, RR 4.2 (95% CI 1.09-16.10), and chronic kidney disease, RR 8.43 (95% CI 5.49-12.93) were associated with an increased mortality in COVID-19 co-infected PLWHA. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in PLWHA were 0.774% and 8.814%, respectively. Since most of the included studies used unmatched populations, comparisons between PLWHA and non-PLWHA should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between cluster of differentiation 4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and COVID-19 related prognosis in PLWHA.","Liang, Min; Luo, Ning; Chen, Mafeng; Chen, Chunna; Singh, Shivank; Singh, Shantanu; Tan, Shifan",Infect Dis Ther,,268

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have unprecedented and unforeseeable consequences, from those on a worldwide/global level to those at the local level - at the level of local communities and families, and individuals (and not just humans, but all other living beings), of which the future will testify in various ways. The consequences will be political, economic, social, but probably to the greatest degree, the consequences of a health nature - systemic and individual. The death toll is high, despite the therapy being applied. We do not currently have a specific and effective therapy against COVID-19. In addition, we do not have a single clinical study that would support prophylactic therapy that could affect COVID-19. All of the therapeutic options now available to us are based on the experience we have gained in treating SARS and MERS. When the vaccine is discovered, at that moment we will be able to say that we have an appropriate and effective method in fighting against COVID-19. Some historians of medicine believe that voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 would be, not only less politically risky but also more effective in protecting the population from coronavirus.

Research about the impact of mask-wearing in the COVID-19 pandemic has raised formidable interest across multiple disciplines. In this paper, we investigate the impact of mask-wearing in spreading processes over complex networks. This is done by studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network model, where nodes can be one of two types (mask-wearing, and not-mask-wearing). We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al.","Tian, Yurun; Sridhar, Anirudh; Yagan, Osman; Poor, H.

282585,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as an atypical cause of Bell's palsy in a patient experiencing homelessness,2020,"Increasing the productivity of flexible working during working hours is a common concern for employers. Employees working in different sectors use various tools to carry out their tasks and work in different working environments. With the Covid-19 pandemic that began in the beginning of 2020, remote working has become an essential part of life. However, one of the biggest problems faced by managers and employers is how to control remote workers. In this study, SmartRadar software was developed to track employee computer use behavior and detect anomalous behavior. Anomalous behavior is defined as computer-based activities or processes carried out during work time which are not related to the tasks for which the employee is responsible. Clicking, mouse wheel scrolling, copying and other similar actions by the user are processed, a summary of the data is generated, and a multi-dimensional dataset is created. Anomalous behavior can then be detected using support vector machines. The proposed software has been shown to detect anomalous computer use behavior by employees with a high degree of accuracy. The favorable results of the study show that the proposed method and the software could be used for tracking and reporting purposes both in workplaces and in flexible working conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Akpinar, M.; Adak, M.

Extraordinary shortages of medical resources have been observed in many parts of the world. Some attributing factors include the lack of sufficient stockpiles and the lack of coordinated efforts to deploy existing resources to the location of greatest needs. The paper investigates contingency planning and resources allocation from a risk management perspective, as opposed to the prevailing supply chain perspective. The key idea is that the competition of limited critical resources is not only present in different geographical locations but also at different stages of a pandemic. This paper draws on an analogy between risk aggregation and capital allocation in finance and pandemic resources planning and allocation for healthcare systems. The main contribution is to introduce new strategies for optimal stockpiling and allocation balancing spatio-temporal competitions of medical supply and demand.","Chen, Xiaowei; Chong, Wing Fung; Feng, Runhuan; Zhang, Linfeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03200v1.pdf,268

289563,Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Medications on the Outcome of Hospitalized Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2,2021,"The relationship between a pandemic and the concurrent economy is quite comparable to the relation observed among health and wealth in general. Since 25th March 2020, India has been under a nation-wide lockdown. This work attempts to examine the effect of COVID-19 on the foreign exchange rates and stock market performances of India using secondary data over a span of 48 days. The study explores whether the causal relationships among the growth rate of confirmed cases (GrowthC), exchange rate (GEX) and SENSEX value (GSENSEX) are remaining the same across different pre and post-lockdown phases, attempting to capture any potential changes over time via the Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) models. A positive correlation is found between the growth rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of exchange rate, and a negative correlation between the growth rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of SENSEX value. A naive interpretation from this could be that with the rising growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the economy took a toll, reflected by the Indian currency being depreciated while the stock exchange index suffered from a fall. However, on applying a VAR model, it is observed that an increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases causes no significant change in the values of the exchange rate and SENSEX index. The result varies if the analysis is split across different time periods - before lockdown, first phase of lockdown and extension of lockdown. To compare the three periods, we had undertaken five rounds of analyses. Nuanced and sensible interpretations of the numeric results indicate significant variability across time in terms of the relation between the variables of interest. This detailed knowledge about the varying patterns of dependence could potentially help the policy makers and investors of India in order to develop their policies to cope up the situation.","Banerjee, Indrajit; Kumar, Atul; Bhattacharyya, Rupam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14499v1.pdf,268

297694,Clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with false-negative severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test results,2021,"Understanding the factors that contribute to antibody escape of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants is key for the development of drugs and vaccines that provide broad protection against a variety of virus variants. Using microfluidic diffusional sizing, we determined the dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction between receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 in its original version (WT) as well as alpha and beta variants with the host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For RBD-alpha, the ACE2-binding affinity was increased by a factor of ten when compared with RBD-WT, while ACE2-binding of RBD-beta was largely unaffected. However, when challenged with a neutralizing antibody that binds to both RBD-WT and RBD-alpha with low nanomolar KD values, RBD-beta displayed no binding, suggesting a substantial epitope change. In SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera, RBD-binding antibodies showed low nanomolar affinities to both wild-type and variant RBD proteins--strikingly, the concentration of antibodies binding to RBD-beta was half that of RBD-WT and RBD-alpha, again indicating considerable epitope changes in the beta variant. Our data therefore suggests that one factor contributing to the higher transmissibility and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 alpha and beta is a larger fraction of viruses that can form a complex with ACE2. However, the two variants employ different mechanisms to achieve this goal. While SARS-CoV-2 alpha RBD binds with greater affinity to ACE2 and is thus more difficult to displace from the receptor by neutralizing antibodies, RBD-beta is less accessible to antibodies due to epitope changes which increases the chances of ACE2-binding and infection.","Fiedler, Sebastian; Denninger, Viola; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Ilsley, Alison; Worth, Roland; Meisl, Georg; Xu, Catherine K.; Piziorska, Monika A.; Ricci, Francesco; Malik, Anisa Y.; Devenish, Sean R.

In addition, colchicine and IL-1 inhibitors treatments that are effective in controlling inflammation in FMF patients have recently been proposed for off-label use in COVID-19 patients. Thus, FMF may resemble a milder recapitulation of the cytokine storm that is a hallmark of COVID-19 patients progressing to severe disease. We analyzed the sequence of the MEFV-encoded Pyrin protein - whose mutations cause FMF- in mammals, bats and pangolin.

Is it possible, for example, to confer sense of the experience of the suffering of families that lose the fight against COVID-19? If God is fair, how could he allow the suffering of innocent people? The first part of the text will present how Paul Ricoeur understands the problem of evil from three main dimensions: the ethic dimension of transgression, the religious dimension of sin, and the dimension of innocent suffering The second part will discuss the way Ricoeur regards suffering as challenge According to Ricoeur, traditional dialectics is not able to provide meaning to innocent suffering The problem of evil demands a convergence between thought and action, as well as the spiritual transformation of feelings That transformation, which should lead to a disinterested love of God, assumes a specific understanding of the relation between love and justice","de Oliveira, Cláudia Maria Rocha",Horizonte,,268

It applied the situational theory of problem solving (STOPS) and integrated the role of two negative emotions (i.e., fear and anger) and subjective norms into the framework. A survey of 627 South Korean adults was conducted in March 2020, when the country experienced an early but rapidly accelerating pandemic stage. The results of structural equation modeling demonstrated that in addition to confirming the major propositions of STOPS, three situational perception variables (i.e., problem recognition, involvement recognition, and constraint recognition) were highly associated with an individual's fear and anger regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. However, only fear significantly affected situational motivation in problem-solving and information behaviors (i.e., information-seeking, forwarding, and permitting).

METHODS: COVID-19-positive cases of Istanbul Morgue Department were retrospectively analyzed. Sampling indications for PCR tests in suspicious deaths, macroscopic and microscopic findings obtained in cases with positive PCR tests were evaluated. RESULTS: In the morgue department, 345(25.8%) of overall 1336 autopsy cases were tested for COVID-19. PCR test was found positive in 26 cases. Limited autopsy procedure was performed in 7 cases, while the cause of death was determined by external examination in the remaining 19 cases. Male-to-female ratio was found 3.3:1 and mean age was 60.0 ± 13.6 among all PCR-positive cases. Cause of death was determined as viral pneumonia in fully autopsied cases. Most common findings were sticky gelatinous fluid in cavities and firm and swollen lungs, varying degrees of consolidation. In microscopy, diffuse alveolar epithelial damage, type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, fibrinous exudate, and fibrinous plaques in the alveoli were the most common findings. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 autopsies, pulmonary findings were found to be prominent and the main pathology was pneumonia. Older age and findings of chronic diseases indicate that the cases were in the multirisk group in terms of COVID-19 mortality.","Arslan, Murat Nihat; Büyük, Yalçin; Ziyade, Nihan; Elgörmüs, Neval; Sirin, Gözde; Çoban, Ismail; Göksen, Muhammed Emin; Das, Taner; Akçay, Arzu",Ir. j. med. sci,,268

The objective of this study was to identify the kidney histopathologic characteristics of deceased patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 and evaluate the association between biopsy findings and clinical variables, including AKI severity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Our multicenter, observational study of deceased patients with COVID-19 in three third-level centers in Mexico City evaluated postmortem kidney biopsy by light and electron microscopy analysis in all cases. Descriptive and association statistics were performed between the clinical and histologic variables. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were included. Median age was 57 (49-66) years, 69% were men, body mass index was 29 (26-35) kg/m2, 51% had history of diabetes, 46% had history of hypertension, 98% received anticoagulation, 66% were on steroids, and 35% received at least one potential nephrotoxic medication. Severe AKI was present in 54% of patients. Biopsy findings included FSGS in 29%, diabetic nephropathy in 27%, and arteriosclerosis in 81%. Acute tubular injury grades 2-3 were observed in 49%. Histopathologic characteristics were not associated with severe AKI; however, pigment casts on the biopsy were associated with significantly lower probability of kidney function recovery (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.77). The use of aminoglycosides/colistin, levels of C-reactive protein and serum albumin, previous use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, antivirals, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants were associated with specific histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found on kidney biopsies. Nonrecovery from severe AKI was associated with the presence of pigmented casts. Inflammatory markers and medications were associated with specific histopathologic findings in patients dying from COVID-19.","Rivero, Jesús; Merino-López, Maribel; Olmedo, Rossana; Garrido-Roldan, Rubén; Moguel, Bernardo; Rojas, Gustavo; Chavez-Morales, Alfonso; Alvarez-Maldonado, Pablo; Duarte-Molina, Pablo; Castaño-Guerra, Rodolfo; Ruiz-Lopez, Ivon Karina; Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Luna, Cesar; Bonilla-Méndez, Alejandro; Baranda, Francisco; Zabal, Carlos; Madero, Magdalena; Valdez-Ortiz, Rafael; Soto-Abraham, Ma Virgilia; Vazquez-Rangel, Armando",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,,268

METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of all COVID-2019 cases in the only referral hospital in Shenzhen City, China, from January 11, 2020, to February 6, 2020, and followed until March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233 (81.5%) had been to Hubei, while 42 (14%) did not have a clear travel history. Only 218 (73.15%) cases had a fever as the initial symptom. Compared with the nonsevere cases, severe cases were associated with older age, those with underlying diseases, and higher levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Slower clearance of the virus was associated with a higher risk of progression to critical condition. As of March 6, 2020, 268 (89.9%) patients were discharged and the overall case fatality ratio was 1.0%.

Patients with both negative chest CT and absence of the novel coronavirus in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swabs were excluded from the study. A total of 462 patients with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia were included in the study (250 males and 212 females, mean age 57â±â17 years, range 18-89). Of these, 344 were positive to RT-PCR test, 118 were negative to double RT-PCR tests.CTs were analyzed for quantification of affected lung volume visually and by dedicated software. Statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between laboratory analyses and CT patterns and amount of damaged lung related with COVID-19 pneumonia was performed in 2 groups of patients: positive RT-PCR COVID-19 group and negative RT-PCR COVID-19 group, but both with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia.Lymphocytopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), d-dimer, and fibrinogen increased levels occurred in most patients without statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with CT scans suggestive for COVID-19. In fact, in both groups the volume of lung damage was strongly associated with altered laboratory test results, even for patients with negative RT-PCR test.The decreased number of lymphocytes, and the increased levels of CRP, LDH, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels are associated with SARS-CoV 2 related pneumonia. This may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool in patients with double negative RT-PCR assay and with highly suspected clinic and chest CT features for COVID-19 to isolate patients in a pandemic period.","Orlacchio, Antonio; Gasparrini, Fulvio; Roma, Silvia; Ravà, Matteo Santangelo; Salvatori, Eva; Morosetti, Daniele; Cossu, Elsa; Legramante, Jacopo Maria; Paganelli, Carla; Bernardini, Sergio; Minieri, Marilena",Medicine (Baltimore),,268

Methods: Data were collected through an online survey four weeks after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first case in South Korea; 973 subjects were included in the analysis. Results: Respondents' perceived risk of COVID-19 infection; the majority of respondents reported that their perceived chance of infection was ""neither high nor low"" (51.3%). The average perceived severity score was higher than perceived susceptibility; 48.6 % reported that the severity would be ""high,"" while 19.9% reported ""very high."" Many respondents reported taking precautions, 67.8% reported always practicing hand hygiene, and 63.2% reported always wearing a facial mask when outside. Approximately 50% reported postponing or canceling social events, and 41.5% were avoiding crowded places. Practicing precautionary behaviors associated strongly with perceived risk and response efficacy of the behavior.

The key-residues of RBD responsible for the human transmission are recognized to be blocked in a heterogeneous manner with the favorable formation of key-residue:HCQ (1:1) complex. Such heterogeneity in binding was identified to be governed by the differential life-time of the hydrogen bonded water network anchoring HCQ and the key-residues. The intermolecular proton transfer facilitates the most favorable Lys417:HCQ complexation. The study demonstrates that off-target bindings of HCQ need to be minimized to efficiently prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,"Santra, Santanu; Giri, Santanab; Jana, Madhurima",Chem Phys Lett,,268

Para tal, utilizou-se 84 tilápias do Nilo distribuídas em 4 tratamentos: controle, CCl4, DEX e CCl4+DEX. Sendo amostrados 7 animais por tratamento em três períodos, isto é: seis, 24 e 48h após indução de inflamação. Utilizou-se CCl4 em dose única de 0,5mL/kg, via intraperitoneal para causar o transtorno hepático. Para indução da aerocistite utilizou-se inóculo de Aeromonas hydrophila. A dexametasona foi administrada via intramuscular na dose de 2 mg/kg de peso vivo. Os resultados revelaram que quanto maior foi à atividade sérica de aspartato aminotransferase (AST) maior foi a alteração somática do fígado, sendo estes achados inversamente proporcionais ao acúmulo celular no foco inflamatório, demonstrando menor número de células inflamatórias nos animais acometidos com maior grau de distúrbios hepáticos induzidos pelo CCl4. O estudo histopatológico revelou alterações degenerativas transitórias na fase mais aguda, pois os fígados das tilápias revelaram o acúmulo lipídeos nos hepatócitos 6h após administração de CCl4, sendo esta degeneração gordurosa não mais observada nos tempos de 24 e 48h. Contudo, a administração de CCl4 em tilápias do Nilo resultou em degeneração hepática aguda e transitória, caracterizada pelo acúmulo de gordura nos hepatócitos, aumento de AST no sangue e hepatomegalia. Com a disfunção hepática houve comprometimento do recrutamento celular em aerocistite infecciosa, indicando que há participação do fígado na resposta imune inata em peixes.(AU)","Moraes, Alessandra C; Prado, Ed J.

As of August 22, 2020, the pandemic infected more than 23,329,752 including 807,054 patients who have died. Although the main clinical features of the pandemic disease are respiratory, cerebrovascular comorbidities emerged as one of the leading causes of death associated with COVID-19. Different case reports have indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (pro-inflammatory biomarkers) were elevated in COVID-19 patients, which can significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Available data on cerebrovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were collected and a meta-analysis was designed and carried out to evaluate the risk of severity and mortality associated with high levels of CRP and D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we aimed to describe the overall event rate of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. In our analysis, 5,614 cases have been studied, out of these patients 164 cases have developed cerebrovascular comorbities. Cerebrovascular comorbidity increased the risk of disease severity (odd ratioâ=â4.4; 95% CI: 1.48 to 12.84) and mortality (odd ratioâ=â7.0; 95% CI: 2.56 to 18.99). Statistical analyses showed that CRP and D-dimer serum levels were elevated by six-folds in the severe cases of COVID-19 patients. This significant increase in these two proteins levels can serve as a vital indicator for COVID-19 patients who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 cerebrovascular complications, such as stroke.","Alzoughool, Foad; Alanagreh, Lo039; ai,; Abumweis, Suhad; Atoum, Manar",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,,268
356022,A new protocol for monitoring operational outcomes of environmental management in commercial forestry plantations,2020,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults and individuals with cardiovascular co-morbidities. This report presents fifteen patients who had COVID-19 respiratory illness followed by cerebrovascular events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A call by the Iranian Neurological Association gathered cases across the country who developed neurological symptoms attributed to hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke after a definite or probable Covid-19 respiratory illness. Definite cases were those with a typical respiratory illness, positive nasopharyngeal Covid-19 PCR test, and chest CT consistent with Covid-19 infection. Probable cases were defined by a typical respiratory illness, history of contacts with a Covid-19 case, and chest CT characteristic for Covid-19 infection. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (12 men and 3 women) with an age range of 38 to 93 years old (median: 65 years old) were included. Fourteen patients had a first-ever acute ischemic stroke and one patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients (73%) had previous cardiovascular comorbidities. The median time between respiratory symptoms and neurological symptoms was seven days (range 1-16 days). Stroke severity in two patients was mild (NIHSS &#8804; 6), in six patients moderate (NIHSS: 7-12), and in seven patients severe (NIHSS &#8805;13). One patient received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( IV-tPA) with improved neurological symptoms. Six out of 15 patients (40%) died. All but one of those who survived had significant disability assessed by a modified ranking scale >2. The majority of patients in this case series had vascular risk factors and their stroke was associated with severe disability and death. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the need for further investigation of the links between Covid-19 and cerebrovascular events.","Sabayan, Behnam; Moghadami, Mohsen; Assarzadegan, Farhad; Komachali, Sahar Hojjat-Anasri; Poorsaadat, Leila; Babaeepour, Zabihollah; Ebrahimzadeh, Seyed Amir; Hamidi, Ava; Hasheminejad, Zeinab Sadat; Mohammadi-Vosough, Elahe; Mirkarimi, Hamid Reza; Paybast, Sepideh; Rahimian, Nasrin; Safari, Anahid; Sepehrnia, Mersedeh; Nematollahi, Reza; Shahripour, Reza Bavarsad; Batra, Ayush; Sorond, Farzaneh; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,268
356815,Mucosal immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,2021,"Multidimensional NOESY experiments targeting correlations between exchangeable imino and amino protons provide valuable information about base pairing in nucleic acids. It has been recently shown that the sensitivity of homonuclear correlations involving RNA's labile imino protons can be significantly enhanced, by exploiting the repolarization brought about by solvent exchanges. Homonuclear correlations, however, are of limited spectral resolution, and usually incapable of tackling relatively large homopolymers with repeating structures like RNAs. This study presents a heteronuclear-resolved version of those NOESY experiments, in which magnetization transfers between the aqueous solvent and the nucleic acid protons are controlled by selecting specific chemical shift combinations of a coupled 1H-15N spin pair. This selective control effectively leads to a pseudo-3D version of HSQC-NOESY, but with cross-peaks enhanced by â¼2-5× as compared with conventional 2D NOESY counterparts. The enhanced signal sensitivity as well as access to both 15N-1H and 1H-1H NOESY dimensions can greatly facilitate RNA assignments and secondary structure determinations, as demonstrated here with the analysis of genome fragments derived from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Kim, Jihyun; Novakovic, Mihajlo; Jayanthi, Sundaresan; Lupulescu, Adonis; Kupce, Eriks; Grün, J Tassilo; Mertinkus, Klara; Oxenfarth, Andreas; Richter, Christian; Schnieders, Robbin; Wirmer-Bartoschek, Julia; Schwalbe, Harald; Frydman, Lucio",J Am Chem Soc,,268

While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution sentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems. Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and models are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will spur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in realistic settings.","Levy, Shahar; Lazar, Koren; Stanovsky, Gabriel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03858v2.pdf,268

We sought to compare the characteristics and survival of patients diagnosed with triple-negative apocrine adenocarcinoma to those of patients diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. Utilizing data from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2013, 70 524 eligible female patients with triple-negative breast cancer were identified including 566 patients with apocrine adenocarcinomas and 69 958 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Descriptive statistics for each variable were reported. A comparison of each covariate between the study cohorts was assessed in univariate and multivariate analysis. Cox proportional models were used to calculate hazard ratios. Additionally, the propensity score matching method was implemented to reduce treatment selection bias. RESULTS: Patients with triple-negative apocrine tumors were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and have smaller, moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Multivariable analysis noted a significantly improved survival for patients with triple-negative apocrine carcinoma (TNAC) vs triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma (TNBC) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65 [95% confidence interval [CI] [0.53-0.81], P = 0 < .001). Propensity score matching analysis confirmed a significant difference in overall survival for patients with TNAC in comparison to TNBC (HR 0.79 [95% CI [0.63-1.00], P = .05). DISCUSSION: Triple-negative apocrine adenocarcinomas have a modestly improved long-term survival when compared with triple-negative invasive ductal cancers.","Arciero, Cletus A; Diehl, Albert H; Liu, Yuan; Sun, Qin; Gillespie, Theresa; Li, Xiaoxian; Subhedar, Preeti",J. surg. oncol,,268

Due to the unstable nature of the virus, leading to the emergence of new variants that are claimed to be more and rapidly transmissible, there is a need for further consideration of the alternative potential pathways of the virus transmissions to provide the needed and effective control measures. This review aims to address this important issue by examining the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 via indirect contacts such as fomites and aerosols, extending to water, food, and other environmental compartments. This is essentially required to shed more light regarding the speculation of the virus spread through these media as the available information regarding this is fragmented in the literature. The existing state of the information on the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water-food-environmental compartments is essential for cause-and-effect relationships of human interactions and environmental samples to safeguard the possible transmission and associated risks through these media. Furthermore, the integration of effective remedial measures previously used to tackle the viral outbreaks and pandemics, and the development of new sustainable measures targeting at monitoring and curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. This study concluded that alternative transmission pathways via human interactions with environmental samples should not be ignored due to the evolving of more infectious and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Adelodun, Bashir; Ajibade, Fidelis Odedishemi; Tiamiyu, AbdulGafar Olatunji; Nwogwu, Nathaniel Azubuike; Ibrahim, Rahmat Gbemisola; Kumar, Pankaj; Kumar, Vinod; Odey, Golden; Yadav, Krishna Kumar; Khan, Afzal Husain; Cabral-Pinto, Marina M S; Kareem, Kola Yusuff; Bakare, Hashim Olalekan; Ajibade, Temitope Fausat; Naveed, Quadri Noorulhasan; Islam, Saiful; Fadare, Oluniyi Olatunji; Choi, Kyung Sook",Environ Res,,268

We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic.","Margraf, Jürgen; Brailovskaia, Julia; Schneider, Silvia",PLoS One,,268

Concerning the novelty of the disease, diagnostic methods based on radiological images suffer from shortcomings despite their many applications in diagnostic centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tend to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images. Material and Methods. The present systematic review was conducted by searching the three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020, based on a search strategy. A total of 168 articles were extracted and, by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 37 articles were selected as the research population. Result: This review study provides an overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep learning. According to the findings, deep learning-based models have an extraordinary capacity to offer an accurate and efficient system for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19, the use of which in the processing of modalities would lead to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values. Conclusion: The application of deep learning in the field of COVID-19 radiologic image processing reduces false-positive and negative errors in the detection and diagnosis of this disease and offers a unique opportunity to provide fast, cheap, and safe diagnostic services to patients.","Ghaderzadeh, Mustafa; Asadi, Farkhondeh",J Healthc Eng,,268
386315,Genomic Analyses Reveal Mutational Signatures and Frequently Altered Genes in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, and it was officially declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Most countries over the entire globe have reported some COVID-19 cases. The current study aimed to assess student knowledge about COVID-19 at different Jordanian universities and determine where they sourced their information. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2,083 undergraduate or postgraduate students from different governmental and private universities during the initial stage of the disease in Jordan (March 19–21, 2020) using a validated, structured, self-administered, online questionnaire. The survey was structured to assess their knowledge about viral sources, incubation period, mortality rate, transmission, symptoms and complications as well as the source of information about COVID-19. Results:Overall, 56.5% of the respondents showed good knowledge and almost 40.5% showed moderate knowledge. On the other hand, 3.0% of the participants showed poor knowledge about COVID-19. The average knowledge score of students was 80.1%, which is considered to be within the scale of good knowledge. Both the college of study and educational level significantly (P &lt; 0.05) associated with student knowledge. Students who majored in medical sciences showed the highest mean score of 82.8%, with 69.0% displaying a good knowledge level. Postgraduate students had significantly higher knowledge scores compared to undergraduate students. The majority of students used the internet, social media and mass media as sources of information about COVID-19. Scientific websites and articles were used more commonly by medical and postgraduate students. Conclusions:The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to the health of the world population; therefore, these results assessing students' knowledge provide an important baseline for planning required educational interventions such as contact tracing and self-quarantine. These results may also help public health authorities by engaging communities in implementation of protective health measures, including positive hygienic practices such as hand washing to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","Olaimat, Amin N.; Aolymat, Iman; Shahbaz, Hafiz M.; Holley, Richard A.",Front.

There are several types of bioprinters, especially inkjet-based bioprinter, which can be used not only as a printer for arranging cells but also as a precision cell-dispensing device with controlled cell numbers similar to a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Precise cell dispensers are expected to be useful in the fields of drug discovery and single-cell analysis. However, there are enduring concerns about the impacts of cell dispensers on cell integrity, particularly on sensitive cells, such as stem cells. In response to the concerns stated above, we developed a stress-free and media-direct-dispensing inkjet bioprinter. In the present study, in addition to conventional viability assessments, we evaluated the gene expression using RNA-seq to investigate whether the developed bioprinter influenced cell integrity in mouse embryonic stem cells. We evaluated the developed bioprinter based on three dispensing methods: manual operation using a micropipette, FACS and the developed inkjet bioprinter. According to the results, the developed inkjet bioprinter exhibited cell-friendly dispensing performance, which was similar to the manual dispensing operation, based not only on cell viability but also on gene expression levels.","Yumoto, Masayuki; Hemmi, Natsuko; Sato, Naoki; Kawashima, Yudai; Arikawa, Koji; Ide, Keigo; Hosokawa, Masahito; Seo, Manabu; Takeyama, Haruko",Sci Rep,,268

Biological disasters like this can generate immense prejudice, xenophobia, stigma and othering, all of which have adverse consequences on health and well-being. In a country as diverse and populous in India, such crisis can trigger communalism and mutual blame. Keeping this in context, this study explored the relationship between well-being and xenophobic attitudes towards Muslims, collectivism and fear of COVID-19 in India. METHODS: The study was carried out on 600 non-Islamic Indians (231 males, 366 females and 3 others; mean age: 38.76 years), using convenience sampling. An online survey containing Fear of Coronavirus scale, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and Collectivism Scale was used. Xenophobia was assessed using two scales: generalized prejudice towards Muslims and specific xenophobic tendencies towards Muslims during COVID-19. The data were analysed using correlational methods and multiple regression. RESULTS: The findings showed that positively significant relationship exists between well-being and age as well as with collectivism, while an inversely significant relationship between well-being and fear of COVID-19 was found. The results of the multiple regression analysis shows that fear of COVID-19, age, collectivism and generalized xenophobia, in the order of their importance, together contributed to nearly 20% of variance in well-being. CONCLUSION: The findings are reflective of the importance of collectivism in enhancing well-being in these times of uncertainty. Xenophobia, one of the common offshoots of pandemics, can also harm the overall well-being. Implications are discussed in the light of India's diverse socio-religious background and global context.","Ahuja, Kanika K; Banerjee, Debanjan; Chaudhary, Kritika; Gidwani, Chehak",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,268

The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. Methods: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. Results: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively. Eight (16%) apps had a contact tracing and hotspot identification function. Interpretation & conclusions: Our study highlights the current emphasis on the development of self-testing, quarantine monitoring, and contact tracing apps. India's response to COVID-19 can be strengthened by developing comprehensive mHealth solutions for frontline healthcare workers, rapid response teams and public health authorities. Among this unprecedented global health emergency, the Governments must ensure the necessary but least intrusive measures for disease surveillance.","Bassi, Abhinav; Arfin, Sumaiya; John, Oommen; Jha, Vivekanand",Indian J Med Res,,268

This realist review will examine the existing evidence on the types of interventions or aspects of routine care in general practice that are likely to decrease or increase health inequalities (ie, inequality-generating interventions) across cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our realist review will follow Pawson's five iterative stages. We will start by developing an initial programme theory based on existing theories and discussions with stakeholders. To navigate the large volume of literature, we will access the primary studies through the identification of published systematic reviews of interventions delivered in general practice across the four key conditions. We will examine the primary studies included within each systematic review to identify those reporting on inequalities across PROGRESS-Plus categories. We will collect data on a range of clinical outcomes including prevention, diagnosis, follow-up and treatment. The data will be synthesised using a realist logic of analysis. The findings will be a description and explanation of the general practice interventions which are likely to increase or decrease inequalities across the major conditions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required because this study does not include any primary research. The findings will be integrated into a series of guiding principles and a toolkit for healthcare organisations to reduce health inequalities. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and user-friendly summaries.

High viral loads are found at the sewage pipeline or at the entrance of wastewater treatment plants from cities where the number of COVID-19 cases are significant. In Quito (Ecuador) as in many other cities worldwide, wastewater is directly discharged into natural waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 presence in urban streams from a low sanitation context. Three river locations along the urban rivers of Quito were sampled on the 5th of June during a peak of COVID-19 cases. River samples were evaluated for water quality parameters and afterwards, concentrated for viral analysis using skimmed milk flocculation method. The viral concentrates were quantified for SARS-CoV-2 (N1 and N2 target regions) and Human Adenovirus as a human viral indicator. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected for both target regions in all samples analyzed in a range of 2,91E+05 to 3,19E+06 GC/L for N1 and from 2,07E+05 to 2,22E+06 GC/L for N2. The high values detected in natural waters from a low sanitation region have several implications in health and ecology that should be further assessed.","Guerrero-Latorre, Laura; Ballesteros, Isabel; Villacrés-Granda, Irina; Granda, M Genoveva; Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Ríos-Touma, Blanca",Sci Total Environ,,268
401457,Vertical transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A scoping review,2021,"[ ]like the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change is recognized as a truly global problem, yet one with myriad distinctive impacts and policy responses in different regions, countries, and localities 2 The systemic nature and impacts of environmental problems are some of the features of environmental research that prompted the development of the new discipline of transnational environmental law 3 Research in this area simultaneously requires a broader lens to take into account many different branches of law and policy, and a deepening of study to understand how problems manifest at multiple levels of governance For some, what is important is that culprits are held responsible for climate change harm, including displacement (the ‘ethicist approach’ to corrective justice) 8 Pertinent examples in this regard include the claim by Peruvian farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya against German energy producer RWE, the investigation by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights into the human rights responsibilities of carbon majors, and the claim by a group of Torres Strait Islanders against the Australian government for failure to take action on climate change 9 For others, identifying the ‘culprit’ of climate harm matters less than achieving rectification or reversal of the harm itself (the ‘instrumentalist approach’ to corrective justice) 10 Examples that Thornton discusses here span from the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage Associated with Climate Change Impacts11 and dedicated provisions of the Paris Agreement12 for loss and damage, to the climate finance architecture set up to provide funding that addresses climate change harm in developing countries 13 Thornton's ‘corrective justice’ approach to analyzing these examples sheds light on other recent developments involving redress for climate change displacement (and potentially other climate injustices) and also facilitates exploration of ongoing challenges in this domain, as Thornton touches on in her piece 14 These include difficult questions in climate litigation and rectification claims about what ‘harm’ means and how it can be quantified, how causation can be established between the actions of some and the harm suffered by others, and how redress mechanisms can be enforced and against whom In particular, they focus on the tensions that have become apparent through climate change-related disputes arising from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in Kenya and Pakistan 17 The authors’ aim is both to make infrastructure projects, and the contestation that they create in local contexts, more visible in environmental law,18 and to show that law provides an important ‘stabilizing’ mechanism for such friction 19 Bogojević and Zou start with the premise that infrastructure, defined as ‘a variety of networks used to provide services and facilitate communication and connections that are essential for the operation of societies and enterprises’,20 is seen largely in a positive light at a macro level, especially in terms of its role in promoting global connectivity [ ]the idea of ‘promoting global connectivity’ is essential for the conceptualization of the BRI 21 More recently, the BRI has employed the use of a ‘green development’ narrative to portray its infrastructure projects 22 However, as Bogojević and Zou highlight, these broader ‘global’ and ‘green’ narratives render invisible the frictions created by infrastructure in local contexts 23 It is climate change, the authors contend, that has the potential to create these large-scale but localized frictions under the BRI 24 Using the case studies of Lamu25 – the community-led challenge to the environmental impact assessment for Kenya's first coal-fired power station decided by the Kenyan National Environmental Tribunal – and Ali v Pakistan26 – a seven-year old's legal challenge to the coal-field development and construction of plants in Pakistan currently pending before the Supreme Court – Bogojević and Zou provide an in-depth analysis of how BRI-related infrastructure causes climate change-related friction in local communities 27 Environmental law, in these circumstances, provides a forum through which ‘such disputes are vocalized and eventually stabilized through adjudication’ 28 While the authors express uncertainty as to whether adjudication by courts will contribute to a long-term ‘greening’ of BRI projects, they suggest that adjudication ‘offers a much-needed platform where local and global infrastructure-related visions and concerns can be vocalized and potentially resolved’ 29 Domestic court challenges to coal-related BRI infrastructure potentially provide a new avenue for transnational climate litigation as this begins to emerge in the global south 30 While Bogojević and Zou qualify their analysis by noting the modest size of their case study sample, their contribution lies in depth of analysis and nuance","Thijs, Etty Heyvaert Veerle Carlarne Cinnamon Huber Bruce Peel Jacqueline Josephine van

The goal of this study was to create a ""simulated"" daily readout (SDR) to restore the educational value of the daily readout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To create the SDR the following tasks were performed; selection of cases for a daily worklist for each resident rotation, comprising a combination of normal and abnormal cases; determination of the correct number of cases and the appropriate mix of imaging modalities for each worklist; development of an ""educational"" environment consisting of separate ""instances"" of both our Picture Archive Communication System and reporting systems; and the anonymization of all of the cases on the worklists. Surveys of both residents and faculty involved in the SDR were performed to assess its effectiveness. RESULTS: Thirty-two residents participated in the SDR. The daily worklists for the first 20 days of the SDR included 3682 cases. An average of 480 cases per day was dictated by the residents. Surveys of the residents and the faculty involved in the SDR demonstrated that both agreed that the SDR effectively mimics a resident's daily work on rotations and preserves resident education during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSION: The development of the SDR provided an effective method of preserving the educational value of the daily readout experience of radiology residents, despite severe decreases in imaging exam volume and case mix diversity during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic.","Recht, Michael P; Fefferman, Nancy R; Bittman, Mark E; Dane, Bari; Fritz, Jan; Hoffmann, Jason C; Hood, Joseph; Mercado, Cecilia L; Mahajan, Sonia; Sheth, Monica M",Acad. radiol,,268

410230,Infection prevention measures in acute care settings based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission patterns and risk: a review,2021,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is largely driven by pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals who transmit the virus. Serological tests to identify antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an important tool to characterize subclinical infection exposure, which is critical in determining transmission trajectories and consequent population immunity. During the summer of 2020, a mail-based serological survey with self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples was implemented among university affiliates and their household members in Massachusetts, USA. Described here are some of the challenges faced and novel procedures used during the implementation of this study to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies amid the global pandemic. Important challenges included remote and contact-minimized participant recruitment, limited availability of commodities and laboratory capacity, a potentially biased sample population, and policy changes impacting the distribution of clinical results to study participants. Methods used to surmount these challenges and lessons learned are presented to inform similar studies. Key lessons relate to the acceptability and feasibility of DBS sampling, supply requirements, the logistics of packing and shipping packages, data linkages to enrolled household members, and the utility of having an on-call nurse available for participant concerns during sample collection. Future studies might consider additional recruitment techniques such as conducting studies during academic semesters when recruiting in a university setting, partnerships with supply and shipping specialists, and using a stratified sampling approach to minimize potential biases in recruitment. This study design highlights the feasibility and acceptability of self-collected bio-samples and has broad applicability for other serological surveys for a range of pathogens.","Cramer, Estee Y.; Snyder, Teah; Ravenhurst, Johanna; Lover, Andrew A.",,,268

All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased. We found no evidence of an increase in complications.","van de Pol, Alma C; Boeijen, Josi A; Venekamp, Roderick P; Platteel, Tamara; Damoiseaux, Roger A M J; Kortekaas, Marlous F; van der Velden, Alike W",,,268

Methods: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R0 in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. Results: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling. Future curbing scenarios require a combination of NPIs. A Delphi-panel-based NPI assessment and modelling might support public health policy decision making by informing sequence and number of needed public health measures.

423811,"Gastrointestinal symptoms as the first, atypical indication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection",2020,"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.","Palmer, Mitchell V; Martins, Mathias; Falkenberg, Shollie; Buckley, Alexandra; Caserta, Leonardo C; Mitchell, Patrick K; Cassmann, Eric D; Rollins, Alicia; Zylich, Nancy C; Renshaw, Randall W; Guarino, Cassandra; Wagner, Bettina; Lager, Kelly; Diel, Diego G",J. virol,,268

Deficiency of zinc has been supposed to contribute to loss of smell and taste in COVID-19 patients. Our study aimed to assess the serum zinc levels among patients with COVID-19 of various severities, with and without olfaction dysfunction, and to evaluate the effect of zinc therapy in recovery of smell dysfunction among such patients. This study included 134 patients; real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) proved SARS-CoV-2. Serum zinc levels were measured for all infected patients. One hundred and five patients were detected to have anosmia and/or hyposmia and were categorized randomly into 2 groups; the first group included 49 patients who received zinc therapy and the second group included 56 patients who did not received zinc. All patients were followed up for the recovery duration of olfactory and gustatory symptoms and duration of complete recovery of COVID-19. Olfactory dysfunction was reported in 105 patients (78.4%). Serum zinc levels were not significantly different between the patient subgroups regarding disease severity or the presence or absence of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction (p Ë 0.05). The median duration of recovery of gustatory and/or olfactory function was significantly shorter among patients who received zinc therapy than those who did not received zinc (p < 0.001), while the median duration of complete recovery from COVID-19 was not significantly different among the two groups (p Ë 0.05). Although the zinc status of COVID-19 patients did not exhibit a significant role in development of anosmia and/or hyposmia or disease severity, zinc therapy may have a significant role in shortening the duration of smell recovery in those patients without affecting the total recovery duration from COVID-19.","Abdelmaksoud, Aida A; Ghweil, Ali A; Hassan, Mohammed H; Rashad, Alaa; Khodeary, Ashraf; Aref, Zaky F; Sayed, Mennatallah Ali Abdelrhman; Elsamman, Mahmoud K; Bazeed, Shamardan E S",Biol. trace elem. res,,268

We evaluated Panbio and SD-Biosensor Ag-RDTs. We employed 186 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative samples to evaluate the specificity and 170 PCR positive samples to assess the sensitivity. We evaluated their sensitivity according to Cycle threshold (Ct ) values and days post onset of symptoms (d.p.o.). Tests were compared using the McNemar's test. Agreement was evaluated using the kappa score. Specificity was 100% for Panbio and 97.3% for SD-Biosensor. Sensitivity for samples with Ct &#8804; 20 was 100% for both assays and for samples with Ct = 20-25 was 93.0% (Panbio) and 95.3% (SD-Biosensor) (p = 1.000).

Initial SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing was negative, but in light of high community prevalence, he was diagnosed with COVID-19, treated with supportive care and self-quarantined at home. Three days after resolution of all symptoms, he developed sudden onset chest pain. Chest imaging revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax and patchy subpleural ground glass opacities. IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. His pneumothorax resolved after placement of a small-bore chest tube, which was removed after 2 days.This case demonstrates that patients with COVID-19 can develop a significant pulmonary complication, a large pneumothorax, despite only minimal lower respiratory tract symptoms and after resolution of the original illness.

428011,Perinatal management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reduced use of the emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased disease acuity when patients do seek health care services. We sought to evaluate emergency department visits for common abdominal and gynecologic conditions before and at the beginning of the pandemic to determine whether changes in emergency department attendance had serious consequences for patients. METHODS: We conducted a population-based analysis using administrative data to evaluate the weekly rate of emergency department visits pre-COVID-19 (Jan. 1-Mar. 10, 2020) and during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar. 11-June 30, 2020), compared with a historical control period (Jan. 1-July 1, 2019). All residents of Ontario, Canada, presenting to the emergency department with appendicitis, cholecystitis, ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage were included. We evaluated weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of emergency department visits, management strategies and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Across all study periods, 39 691 emergency department visits met inclusion criteria (40.2 % appendicitis, 32.1% miscarriage, 21.3% cholecystitis, 6.4% ectopic pregnancy). Baseline characteristics of patients presenting to the emergency department did not vary across study periods. After an initial reduction in emergency department visits, presentations for cholecystitis and ectopic pregnancy quickly returned to expected levels. However, presentations for appendicitis and miscarriage showed sustained reductions (IRR 0.61-0.80), with 1087 and 984 fewer visits, respectively, after the start of the pandemic, relative to 2019. Management strategies, complications and mortality rates were similar across study periods for all conditions. INTERPRETATION: Although our study showed evidence of emergency department avoidance in Ontario during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, no adverse consequences were evident. Emergency care and outcomes for patients were similar before and during the pandemic.","Gomez, David; Simpson, Andrea N; Sue-Chue-Lam, Colin; de Mestral, Charles; Dossa, Fahima; Nantais, Jordan; Wilton, Andrew S; Urbach, David; Austin, Peter C; Baxter, Nancy N",CMAJ,,268

Due to the cessation of all non-emergent surgical cases in the USA and worldwide, the professional lives and practices of many physicians have been negatively affected. However, among different physicians and specifically plastic surgeons, cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the majority of their cases are semi-elective and elective. The ability to perform semi-elective and elective cases is dependent on state and local authorities' regulations, and it is currently uncertain when the ban, if ever, will be completely lifted. Financial constraints on patients and their future inability to pay for these procedures due to the COVID-19-related economic recession are things to consider. Overall, the goal of this unprecedented time for cosmetic/aesthetic plastic surgeons is for their medical practices to survive, to conserve cash flow although income is low to none, and to maintain their personal finances. In this paper, the authors review the financial impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the practices of cosmetic plastic surgeons in the USA and worldwide, along with some potential approaches to maintain their practices and financial livelihoods.

With this corpus, which we sample to be related to COVID-19, measles, cystic fibrosis, and depression, we develop baseline models which detect tweets that contain a claim automatically. Our analyses reveal that biomedical tweets are densely populated with claims (45 % in a corpus sampled to contain 1200 tweets focused on the domains mentioned above). Baseline classification experiments with embedding-based classifiers and BERT-based transfer learning demonstrate that the detection is challenging, however, shows acceptable performance for the identification of explicit expressions of claims.

436883,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in placental and fetal membrane samples,2020,"BACKGROUND: Communication between clinicians, patients, and families is a core component of medical care that requires deliberate practice and feedback to improve. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sudden transformation in communication practices because of new physical distancing requirements, necessitating physicians to communicate bad news via telephone and video-mediated communication (VMC). This study investigated students' experience with a simulation-based communications training for having difficult conversations using VMC. METHODS: Thirty-eight fourth-year medical students preparing for their surgical residency participated in a simulated scenario where students discussed a new COVID-19 diagnosis with a standardised family member (SFM) of a sick patient via VMC. Learners were introduced to an established communications model (SPIKES) by an educational video. After the simulation, SFM and course facilitators guided a debrief and provided feedback. Learners completed surveys evaluating reactions to the training, preparedness to deliver bad news, and attitudes about telehealth. RESULTS: Twenty-three students completed evaluation surveys (response rate=61%). Few students had prior formal training (17%) or experience communicating bad news using telehealth (13%). Most respondents rated the session beneficial (96%) and felt they could express empathy using the VMC format (83%). However, only 57% felt ready to deliver bad news independently after the training and 52% reported it was more difficult to communicate without physical presence. Comments highlighted the need for additional practice. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the value and feasibility of teaching medical students to break bad news using VMC as well as demonstrating the need for additional training.","Rivet, Emily Burke; Cholyway, Renee; Edwards, Cherie; Wishnoff, Matthew; Raza, Omar; Haynes, Susan; Feldman, Moshe",Clin Teach,,268

The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.","Yin, Changchuan",Genomics,,268

441929,Pregnancy alters interleukin-1 beta expression and antiviral antibody responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To perform a prospective longitudinal analysis of lung ultrasound findings in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Eighty-nine intensive care unit (ICU) patients with confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled and tracked. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) examinations were performed with phased array, convex, and linear transducers using portable machines. The thorax was scanned in 12 lung areas: anterior, lateral, and posterior (superior/inferior) bilaterally. Lower limbs were scanned for deep venous thrombosis and chest computed tomographic angiography was performed to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Follow-up POCUS was performed weekly and before hospital discharge. RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (84.2%), with a median age of 43 years. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 17 (interquartile range, 10-22) days; the ICU length of stay was 22 (interquartile range, 20.2-25.2) days; and the 28-day mortality rate was 28.1%. On ICU admission, POCUS detected bilateral irregular pleural lines (78.6%) with accompanying confluent and separate B-lines (100%), variable consolidations (61.7%), and pleural and cardiac effusions (22.4% and 13.4%, respectively). These findings appeared to signify a late stage of COVID-19 pneumonia. Deep venous thrombosis was identified in 16.8% of patients, whereas chest computed tomographic angiography confirmed PE in 24.7% of patients. Five to six weeks after ICU admission, follow-up POCUS examinations detected significantly lower rates (P < .05) of lung abnormalities in survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care ultrasound depicted B-lines, pleural line irregularities, and variable consolidations. Lung ultrasound findings were significantly decreased by ICU discharge, suggesting persistent but slow resolution of at least some COVID-19 lung lesions. Although POCUS identified deep venous thrombosis in less than 20% of patients at the bedside, nearly one-fourth of all patients were found to have computed tomography-proven PE.","Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Faqihi, Fahad; Abuhamdah, Mohamed; Noor, Alfateh; Naseem, Nasir; Balhamar, Abdullah; Al Saud, Ahad Alhassan Al Saud Bin Abdulaziz; Brindley, Peter G; Memish, Ziad A; Karakitsos, Dimitrios; Blaivas, Michael",J. ultrasound med,,268

442907,Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in placentas with pathology and vertical transmission,2020,"BACKGROUNDPatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop pneumonia generally associated with lymphopenia and a severe inflammatory response due to uncontrolled cytokine release. These mediators are transcriptionally regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules.METHODSWe treated a group of patients (n = 20) with baricitinib according to an off-label use of the drug. The study was designed as an observational, longitudinal trial and approved by the local ethics committee. The patients were treated with 4 mg baricitinib twice daily for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for the remaining 7 days. Changes in the immune phenotype and expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in blood cells were evaluated and correlated with serum-derived cytokine levels and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2). In a single treated patient, we also evaluated the alteration of myeloid cell functional activity.RESULTSWe provide evidence that patients treated with baricitinib had a marked reduction in serum levels of IL-6, IL-1ß, and TNF-&#945;, a rapid recovery of circulating T and B cell frequencies, and increased antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, all of which were clinically associated with a reduction in the need for oxygen therapy and a progressive increase in the P/F (PaO2, oxygen partial pressure/FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio.CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that baricitinib prevented the progression to a severe, extreme form of the viral disease by modulating the patients' immune landscape and that these changes were associated with a safer, more favorable clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04438629.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Fondazione Cariverona (ENACT Project) and the Fondazione TIM.","Bronte, Vincenzo; Ugel, Stefano; Tinazzi, Elisa; Vella, Antonio; De Sanctis, Francesco; Canè, Stefania; Batani, Veronica; Trovato, Rosalinda; Fiore, Alessandra; Petrova, Varvara; Hofer, Francesca; Barouni, Roza Maria; Musiu, Chiara; Caligola, Simone; Pinton, Laura; Torroni, Lorena; Polati, Enrico; Donadello, Katia; Friso, Simonetta; Pizzolo, Francesca; Iezzi, Manuela; Facciotti, Federica; Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe; Righetti, Daniela; Bazzoni, Paolo; Rampudda, Mariaelisa; Comel, Andrea; Mosaner, Walter; Lunardi, Claudio; Olivieri, Oliviero",J. clin. invest,,268

We propose a new fully automated deep learning framework for rapid quantification and differentiation between lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia from both contrast and non-contrast CT images using convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks. Utilizing the expert annotations, model training was performed 5 times with separate hold-out sets using 5-fold cross-validation to segment ground-glass opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and pleural effusion). The performance of the method was evaluated on CT data sets from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and automatic segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score coefficient of 0.876 $\pm$ 0.005;excellent correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. In the external validation set of 67 patients, there was dice score coefficient of 0.767 $\pm$ 0.009 as well as excellent correlations of 0.989 and 0.996 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. Computations for a CT scan comprising 120 slices were performed under 2 seconds on a personal computer equipped with NVIDIA Titan RTX graphics processing unit. Therefore, our deep learning-based method allows rapid fully-automated quantitative measurement of pneumonia burden from CT and may generate results with an accuracy similar to the expert readers.","Grodecki, K.; Killekar, A.; Lin, A.; Cadet, S.; McElhinney, P.; Razipour, A.; Chan, C.; Pressman, B.

Repetition of a mantram as a mindfulness practice is helpful for stress management and resilience building. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the key features of mantram and the Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) developed in the US Veterans Healthcare System, the evidence base for the MRP, and its applications. Methods: MRP practices are portable and do not require an extended or regularized period of sitting, in contrast to most methods of meditation. Core functions of MRP practices include focus shifting, frame activation, and fostering of mindfulness. We review scientific research, including multiple randomized trials, that has investigated the MRP. Results: Research on the MRP has documented reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms, insomnia, hyperarousal, and depression, as well as enhancement of quality of life, self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Mantram repetition may possess comparative advantages for managing symptoms of various mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and chronic diseases. Conclusions: MRP practices can be integrated into daily routines to manage stress and improve coping, safety, efficacy, calmness, and resilience. The inclusion of mantram repetition alongside conventional mindfulness-based practices for stress management will improve their cultural and religious inclusiveness, enabling societies and organizations to build greater collective resilience. Mantram repetition can be readily used in the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on healthcare workers, patients, and the public.","Oman, Doug; Bormann, Jill E; Kane, Jim J",Mindfulness (N Y),,268

Many prevalent measures have been taken to prevent its spread and protect the public. However, the use of face coverings as an effective preventive measure remains contentious. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of face coverings as a protective measure. We examined the effectiveness of face coverings between 1 April and 31 December 2020. This was accomplished by analyzing trends of daily new COVID-19 cases, cumulative confirmed cases, and cases per 100,000 people in different U.S. states, including the District of Columbia. The results indicated a sharp change in trends after face covering mandates. For the 32 states with face covering mandates, 63% and 66% exhibited a downward trend in confirmed cases within 21 and 28 days of implementation, respectively. We estimated that face covering mandates in the 32 states prevented approximately 78,571 and 109,703 cases within 21- and 28-day periods post face covering mandate, respectively. A statistically significant (p = 0.001) negative correlation (-0.54) was observed between the rate of cases and days since the adoption of a face covering mandate. We concluded that the use of face coverings can provide necessary protection if they are properly used.","Ayodeji, Olukayode James; Ramkumar, Seshadri",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,268

This study sought to assess COVID-19-related fear, depression, anxiety and stress among hospital staff, potential factors that may help reduce its psychological effects and their personal coping strategies. The study will help to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Ghanaian health workers and indirectly serve as a needs assessment survey for input to support affected staff and the broader health system. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health workers in three hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from 11 July 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic data and scores from the validated DASS-21 and Fear of COVID-19 scales and two other scales developed de novo were entered from 272 self-administered questionnaires and analyzed for means, frequencies and proportions. Fisher's exact test analysis was done to ascertain associations between selected independent variables and depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the mean and median scores of the outcome variables across the three study hospitals. Results and conclusion: Over 40% of respondents had fear while 21.1%, 27.8% and 8.2% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Positive attitudes from colleagues and the government's tax-free salary relief were some factors said to reduce the psychological effects while over half of participants indicated praying more often as a coping strategy. There is a need for the health system to recognize the presence of these adverse psychological effects in health workers and take pragmatic steps to address them.","Ofori, Anthony Amanfo; Osarfo, Joseph; Agbeno, Evans Kofi; Manu, Dominic Owusu; Amoah, Elsie",SAGE Open Med,,268

467277,Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia in a Patient With Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan in December 2019 and has spread globally. Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.","Lagoumintzis, George; Chasapis, Christos T; Alexandris, Nikolaos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tzartos, Socrates; Eliopoulos, Elias; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,,268

METHODS: This retrospective claims analysis included 6680 Medicare beneficiaries over age 66 with ovarian cancer who survived at least one year after diagnosis, had at least 4 outpatient evaluation and management visits and died between 2000 and 2016. We calculated the Bice-Boxerman Continuity of Care Index (COC) for each woman, and split COC into tertiles (high, medium, low). We compared late or no hospice use, >1 emergency department (ED) visit, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, >1 hospitalization, terminal hospitalization, chemotherapy, and invasive and/or life extending procedures among women with high or medium vs. low COC using multivariable adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: In this sample, 49.8% of women received aggressive care in the last month of life. Compared to women with low COC, women with high COC had 66% higher odds of chemotherapy (adjusted OR 1.66 CI 1.23-2.24) in the last two weeks of life. Women with high COC also had 16% greater odds of not enrolling in hospice compared to women with low COC (adjusted OR 1.16 CI 1.01-1.33). COC was not associated with late enrollment in hospice, hospital utilization, or aggressive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: COC at the end of life is complicated and may pose unique challenges in providing quality end of life care. Future work exploring the specific facets of continuity associated with quality end of life care is needed.","Mullins, Megan A; Ruterbusch, Julie J; Clarke, Philippa; Uppal, Shitanshu; Cote, Michele L; Wallner, Lauren P",Gynecol. oncol,,268

Antioxidant activity tests have proven that MeOH extract showed higher activity than others (DPPH: 4.15 mg/mL, ABTS: 2.05 mg/mL, CUPRAC: 1.80 mg/mL, FRAP: 0.83 mg/mL, phosphomolybdenum: 1.69 mg/mL). Ferrous ion chelating activity of the water extract was 1.03 mg/mL. In &#945;-amylase and tyrosinase inhibitory assays, EtOAc (IC50: 2.54 mg/mL) and MeOH (IC50: 1.51 mg/mL) extracts showed higher activity than the others did. In phosphomolybdenum, CUPRAC, FRAP, and tyrosinase inhibitory assays, the activity was strongly correlated with flavonoids, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, and hyperoside. On the other hand, phenolic compounds have been found to contribute more to radical scavenging activity. Pearson correlation analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids were not responsible for the &#945;-amylase inhibitory activity of EtOAc extract.","Sarikurkcu, Cengiz; Sarikurkcu, Rifat Tayyib; Tepe, Bektas",,,268

474917,Public Health Agency of Sweden's Brief Report: Pregnant and postpartum women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in intensive care in Sweden,2020,"Effective agents to treat coronavirus infection are urgently required, not only to treat COVID-19, but to prepare for future outbreaks. Repurposed anti-virals such as remdesivir and human anti-inflammatories such as barcitinib have received emergency approval but their overall benefits remain unclear. Vaccines are the most promising prospect for COVID-19, but will need to be redeveloped for any future coronavirus outbreak. Protecting against future outbreaks requires the identification of targets that are conserved between coronavirus strains and amenable to drug discovery. Two such targets are the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) which are essential for the coronavirus replication cycle. We describe the discovery of two non-antiviral therapeutic agents, the caspase-1 inhibitor SDZ 224015 and Tarloxotinib that target Mpro and PLpro, respectively. These were identified through extensive experimental screens of the drug repurposing ReFRAME library of 12,000 therapeutic agents. The caspase-1 inhibitor SDZ 224015, was found to be a potent irreversible inhibitor of Mpro (IC50 30 nM) while Tarloxotinib, a clinical stage epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is a sub micromolar inhibitor of PLpro (IC50 300 nM, Ki 200 nM) and is the first reported PLpro inhibitor with drug-like properties. SDZ 224015 and Tarloxotinib have both undergone safety evaluation in humans and hence are candidates for COVID-19 clinical evaluation.","Redhead, Martin A; Owen, C David; Brewitz, Lennart; Collette, Amelia H; Lukacik, Petra; Strain-Damerell, Claire; Robinson, Sean W; Collins, Patrick M; Schäfer, Philipp; Swindells, Mark; Radoux, Chris J; Hopkins, Iva Navratilova; Fearon, Daren; Douangamath, Alice; von Delft, Frank; Malla, Tika R; Vangeel, Laura; Vercruysse, Thomas; Thibaut, Jan; Leyssen, Pieter; Nguyen, Tu-Trinh; Hull, Mitchell; Tumber, Anthony; Hallett, David J; Schofield, Christopher J; Stuart, David I; Hopkins, Andrew L; Walsh, Martin A",Sci Rep,,268

Here, we determined circulating miRNA and cytokine and chemokine (CC) profiles in 171 blood plasma samples from 58 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Thirty-two miRNAs were differentially expressed in severe cases when compared to moderate and mild cases. These miRNAs and their predicted targets reflected key COVID-19 features including cell death and hypoxia. Compared to mild cases, moderate and severe cases were characterised by a global decrease in circulating miRNA levels. Partial least squares regression using miRNA and CC measurements allowed for discrimination of severe cases with greater accuracy (87%) than using miRNA or CC levels alone. Correlation analysis revealed severity group-specific associations between CC and miRNA levels. Importantly, the miRNAs that correlated with IL6 and CXCL10, two cardinal COVID-19-associated cytokines, were distinct between severity groups, providing a novel qualitative way to stratify patients with similar levels of proinflammatory cytokines but different disease severity. Integration of miRNA and CC levels with clinical parameters revealed severity-specific signatures associated with clinical hallmarks of COVID-19. Our study highlights the existence of severity-specific circulating CC/miRNA networks, providing insight into COVID-19 pathogenesis and a novel approach for monitoring COVID-19 progression.","WIlson, Julie C.; Kealy, David; James, Sally R.; Newling, Katherine; Jagger, Christopher; Filbey, Kara; Mann, Elizabeth; Konkel, Joanne; Menon, Madhvi; Knight, Sean B.; Simspon, Angela; group, - CIRCO collaborative; Grainger, John R.; Hussell, Tracy; Kaye, Paul M; Signoret, Nathalie; Lagos, Dimitris",,,268

However, it may manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms that may overlap with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). COVID-19 appears to have higher mortality in those with comorbidities. We aimed to assess the outcomes of coinfection in these patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients with CDI and COVID-19 from January 1st, 2020 to November 17th, 2020. Both infections were diagnosed via PCR. Clinical features, treatment for COVID-19 and CDI and outcomes including intensive care unit admission, colectomy, 30 day-mortality and long-term complications were analyzed. Results: Overall, 21 patients (20 hospitalized) with median age 70.9 years (range 51.8-90.7 years) had CDI and COVID-19 within 4 weeks of each other. Of these, 4 patients (19%) with CDI were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of admission, 12 (57%) had CDI diagnosed after COVID-19, and 5 (23.9%) developed COVID-19 within 4 weeks after CDI. Fourteen patients (66.7%) were treated with medications directed against COVID-19 including remdesivir and dexamethasone (n=7), remdesivir with convalescent plasma (n=1), remdesivir (n=5) and dexamethasone (n=1). The most common treatment for CDI was oral vancomycin in 20 patients (95.2%), and 1 patient received intravenous metronidazole. No patient required colectomy for CDI but 2 (9.5%) required ICU admission. Four patients (19%) died likely due to COVID-19 with median age 80 years (range 61-90 years). Conclusion: The relationship between COVID-19 and CDI is poorly understood, and studies are required to further investigate this association. Whether coinfection results in a worsening of outcomes, including mortality and clinical course, are questions that should be answered in future research studies. Diagnosing both infections for appropriate management is vital in light of overlapping symptoms.","Sehgal, K.; Fadel, H. J.; Tande, A. J.; Pardi, D. S.; Khanna, S.",Infection and Drug Resistance,,268

Following closely the growth dynamics of the disease is one of the pillars toward achieving that goal. Objective: We aimed at developing a simple framework to facilitate the analysis of the growth rate (cases/day) and growth acceleration (cases/day 2) of COVID-19 cases in real-time. Methods: The framework was built using the Moving Regression (MR) technique and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The dynamics of the pandemic was initially modeled via combinations of four different growth stages: lagging (beginning of the outbreak), exponential (rapid growth), deceleration (growth decay), and stationary (near zero growth). A fifth growth behavior, namely linear growth (constant growth above zero), was further introduced to add more flexibility to the framework. An R Shiny application was developed, which can be accessed at https://theguarani.com.br/ or downloaded from https://github.com/adamtaiti/SARS-CoV-2. The framework was applied to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which comprised 3,722,128 cases reported worldwide as of May 8th 2020. Results: We found that the impact of public health measures on the prevalence of COVID-19 could be perceived in seemingly real-time by monitoring growth acceleration curves. Restriction to human mobility produced detectable decline in growth acceleration within 1 week, deceleration within ~2 weeks and near-stationary growth within ~6 weeks. Countries exhibiting different permutations of the five growth stages indicated that the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence is more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Conclusions: These results corroborate that mass social isolation is a highly effective measure against the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, as previously suggested. Apart from the analysis of prevalence partitioned by country, the proposed framework is easily applicable to city, state, region and arbitrary territory data, serving as an asset to monitor the local behavior of COVID-19 cases.","Utsunomiya, Yuri Tani; Utsunomiya, Adam Taiti Harth; Torrecilha, Rafaela Beatriz Pintor; Paulan, Silvana de Cássia; Milanesi, Marco; Garcia, José Fernando",Front.

Detailed scientific knowledge of the members of the Coronaviridae family, including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is currently lacking. Structural studies of the MERS-CoV proteins in the current literature are extremely limited. We present here detailed characterization of the structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. Additionally, we studied the impacts of chosen force field parameters and parallel tempering simulation techniques on the predicted structural properties of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. For this purpose, we conducted extensive Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and Temperature-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using the CHARMM36m and AMBER99SB parameters for the macro domain. This study shows that the predicted secondary structure properties including their propensities depend on the chosen simulation technique and force field parameter. We perform structural clustering based on the radius of gyration and end-to-end distance of MERS-CoV macro domain in aqueous solution. We also report and analyze the residue-level intrinsic disorder features, flexibility and secondary structure. Furthermore, we study the propensities of this macro domain for protein-protein interactions and for the RNA and DNA binding. Overall, results are in agreement with available nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings and present more detailed insights into the structural properties of MERS CoV macro domain in aqueous solution.

506966,Glucocorticoid-Glucocorticoid Receptor Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2021,"A new coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China; the virus escalated rapidly and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. Emerging data suggests that older patients with COVID-19 associated with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and lung diseases are particularly more susceptible, compared to general populations, and have higher mortality. It is not yet clear whether this increased association of high blood pressure with COVID-19 and the increased risk of mortality are directly related to high blood pressure or other associated comorbidities, or to antihypertensive treatment. Although the underlying pathogenic mechanism linking hypertension and severity of COVID-19 infection remains to be elucidated, it has been hypothesized that excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) could contribute to the progression of COVID-19 related lung injury. Concern about whether angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have deleterious effects on morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 is based on speculation that these drugs would increase the regulation of angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which would increase viral load and lung damage. Recent studies are consistent with the recommendations of scientific societies that propose avoiding the suspension or change of antihypertensive medication, as there is no evidence that shows that these can be taken as risk factors for severity or mortality from COVID-19.","Molina, Dora Inés; Muñoz, Tania Marcela; Guevara, Katterine",Rev.

The high mutation frequency in the genomic material of these viruses supports their ability to adapt to new environments, resulting in an efficient alteration in tissue tropism and host range. Therefore, the coronavirus’ health threats could be relevant for the long-term. The epidemiological data indicate that age, sex, and cardio-metabolic disease have a significant impact on the spread and severity of COVID-19. In this review, we highlight recent updates on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 among men and women, including children. We also discuss the role of the cellular receptors and coreceptors used by the virus to enter host cells on differential infection among men, women, and cardio-metabolic patients.","Rothan, Hussin A.; Acharya, Arpan; Reid, St Patrick; Kumar, Mukesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.",Pathogens,,268

The objective of this study was to phenotype recovery trajectories of non-hospitalized COVID-19 individuals. METHODSWe performed an international, multi-center, exploratory online survey study on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and recovery status of non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected adults (Austria: n=1157), and Italy: n= 893). RESULTSWorking age subjects (Austria median: 43 yrs (IQR: 31 - 53), Italy: 45 yrs (IQR: 35 - 55)) and females (65.1% and 68.3%) predominated the study cohorts. Course of acute COVID-19 was characterized by a high symptom burden (median 13 (IQR: 9 - 18) and 13 (7 - 18) out of 44 features queried), a 47.6 - 49.3% rate of symptom persistence beyond 28 days and 20.9 - 31.9% relapse rate. By cluster analysis, two acute symptom phenotypes could be discerned: the non-specific infection phenotype and the multi-organ phenotype (MOP), the latter encompassing multiple neurological, cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal and dermatological features. Clustering of long COVID subjects yielded three distinct subgroups, with a subset of 48.7 - 55 % long COVID individuals particularly affected by post-acute MOP symptoms. The number and presence of specific acute MOP symptoms and pre-existing multi-morbidity was linked to elevated risk of long COVID. CONCLUSIONThe consistent findings of two independent cohorts further delineate patterns of acute and post-acute COVID-19 and emphasize the importance of symptom phenotyping of home-isolated COVID-19 patients to predict protracted convalescence and to allocate medical resources.

VBI-2905a protected hamsters against infection with a Beta variant virus and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta RBD. In a heterologous vaccination regimen, a single injection of VBI-2905a in animals previously immunized with VBI-2902, a vaccine candidate expressing S from ancestral SARS-CoV-2, hamsters were equally protected against Beta variant infection. As an alternate strategy to broaden immunity, we produced a trivalent vaccine expressing the prefusion spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 together with unmodifed S from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Relative to immunity induced against the ancestral strain, the trivalent vaccine VBI-2901a induced higher and more consistent antibody binding and neutralizing responses against a panel of variants including Beta, Delta, Kappa, and Lambda, with evidence for broadening of immunity rather than just boosting cross-reactive antibodies.","Bozic, Jasminka; Ahmed, Tanvir; Ontsouka, Barthelemy; Fluckiger, Anne-Catherine; Diress, Abebaw; Berthoud, Tamara; Yuan, Xiaoyang; Yang, Lanjian; Diaz-Mitoma, Francisco; Anderson, David E; Soare, Catalina",,,268

The end of the pandemic is not in sight and many people are anxious of becoming infected in different settings. The Gastein Healing Gallery (GHG) is a unique outpatient facility combining heat, high humidity and mild radon radiation. Every year approximately 12,000 patients with inflammatory rheumatic, degenerative diseases and chronic pain are treated. We have therefore reviewed and analyzed the literature with respect to a possible increased risk of infection for patients during treatment in the GHG. On the one hand the climatic and physical conditions in the GHG can be viewed as hostile to viruses and on the other hand the mild radon hyperthermia and the geographic location of the GHG lead to positive effects on the patient's health via complex physiological processes. We therefore consider the likelihood of infection with viruses in the GHG in no way increased, in contrast, it is probably considerably lower compared to other settings.","Offenbächer, M; Hölzl, B; Gaisberger, M; Untner, H; Würzner, R",Rheuma Plus,,268

However, whether lung ultrasound (LUS) score predicts all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the predictive value of lung ultrasound score for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 who underwent lung ultrasound were prospectively enrolled from three hospitals in Wuhan, China between February 2020 and March 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from digital patient records. Lung ultrasound scores were analyzed offline by two observers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 402 patients, 318 (79.1%) had abnormal lung ultrasound. Compared with survivors (n = 360), non-survivors (n = 42) presented with more B2 lines, pleural line abnormalities, pulmonary consolidation, and pleural effusion (all p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, non-survivors had higher global and anterolateral lung ultrasound score than survivors. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, areas under the curve were 0.936 and 0.913 for global and anterolateral lung ultrasound score, respectively. A cutoff value of 15 for global lung ultrasound score had a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 85.3%, and 9 for anterolateral score had a sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 83.3% for prediction of death. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that both global and anterolateral scores were strong predictors of death (both p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that global lung ultrasound score was an independent predictor (hazard ratio, 1.08;95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.16;p = 0.03) of death together with age, male sex, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase-myocardial band. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound score as a semiquantitative tool can be easily measured by bedside lung ultrasound. It is a powerful predictor of in-hospital mortality and may play a crucial role in risk stratification of patients with COVID-19.","Sun, Z. X.; Zhang, Z. M.; Liu, J.; Song, Y.; Qiao, S.; Duan, Y.

The data on unemployment rate, un employment insurance claims, contingent of families in extreme poverty, and food insecurity was collected in government information systems, research published by public agencies, scientific articles, and in news portals. In an upward trajectory since 2015, the increase in unemployment and the number of families in extreme poverty was exacerbated after the pandemic began, drastically reducing the purchase power and access to healthy and adequate food, affecting mainly women and the populations of the Northern and Northeastern regions. Between January and September 2020, there was a 3% increase in unemployment in Brazil and, in October 2020, there were almost 485 thousand more families in extreme poverty compared to January of the same year. There are inadequate and insufficient responses from the Brazilian government to the articulated set of problems. The Covid-19 pandemic is a new element that potentiates the recent increase in hunger in Brazil, which occurs in parallel with the dismantling of the Food and Nutrition Security programs and the expansion of fiscal austerity measures, started with the political-economic crisis in 2015.

519763,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and forensic pathology,2021,"BACKGROUND: Current diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this test is associated with increased risks of viral dissemination and environmental contamination and shows relatively low sensitivity, attributable to technical deficiencies in the sampling method. Given that COVID-19 is transmitted via exhaled aerosols and droplets, and that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is an established modality for sampling exhaled aerosols, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in EBC offers a promising diagnostic approach. However, current knowledge on the detection and load of the virus in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients remains limited and inconsistent. The objective of the study was to quantify the viral load in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients and to validate the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection from EBC as a diagnostic test for the infection. METHOD: EBC samples were collected from 48 COVID-19 patients using a collection device, and viral loads were quantified by RT-PCR targeting the E gene. Changes in detection rates and viral loads relative to patient characteristics and days since disease onset were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with higher viral load (p<0.05). Need for oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation, less than 3 days since onset, and presence of cough or fever were significantly associated with higher detection rates (p<0.05). Among spontaneously breathing patients, viral load in EBC attenuated exponentially over time. The detection rate was 86% at 2 days since onset and deteriorated thereafter. In mechanically ventilated patients, detection rate and viral load were high regardless of days since onset. CONCLUSION: These results support the feasibility of using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 from EBC for COVID-19 patients within 2 days of symptom onset.","Sawano, Makoto; Takeshita, Kyousuke; Ohno, Hideaki; Oka, HIdeaki",Journal of breath research (Online),,268

The pandemic has opened challenges and concerns for patient safety, starting with the early recognition that individuals, including medical staff, may spread the virus during the asymptomatic phase. Many healthcare facilities faced resource-limited settings, including challenges in the availability of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted medical education, both at the undergraduate and at the graduate levels, and according to many predictions, its effects may forever transform the ways medical education is delivered.

There is a growing focus on home-based formats of CR and a lack of evidence on preferences for psychological care in CR. This pilot study aimed to investigate preferences for delivery attributes of a psychological therapy intervention in CR patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted and recruited participants from a feasibility trial. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical interventions, described using five attributes; intervention type (home or centre-based), information provided, therapy manual format, cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and waiting time. A separate opt-out was included. A conditional logit using maximum likelihood estimation was used to analyse preferences. The NHS cost was used to estimate willingness to pay for aspects of the intervention delivery. RESULTS: 35 responses were received (39% response rate). Results indicated that participants would prefer to receive any form of therapy compared with no therapy. Statistically significant results were limited, but included participants being keen to avoid not receiving information prior to therapy (β=−0.270; p=0.03) and preferring a lower cost to the NHS (β=−0.001; p=0.00). No significant results were identified for the type of psychological intervention, format of therapy/exercises and programme start time. Coefficients indicated preferences were stronger for home-based therapy compared with centre-based, but this was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a DCE in this group, it identifies potential attributes and levels, and estimates the sample sizes needed for a full study. Preliminary evidence indicated that sampled participants tended to prefer home-based psychological therapy in CR and wanted to receive information before initiating therapy.

The viral spike glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host protein receptor and mediates fusion of the viral and host membranes, making S essential to viral entry into host cells and host species tropism. As SARS-CoV enters host cells, the viral S is believed to undergo a number of conformational transitions as it is cleaved by host proteases and binds to host receptors. We recently developed stabilizing mutations for coronavirus spikes that prevent the transition from the pre-fusion to post-fusion states. Here, we present cryo-EM analyses of a stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV S, as well as the trypsin-cleaved, stabilized S, and its interactions with ACE2. Neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within stabilized SARS-CoV S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2′.","Kirchdoerfer, Robert N.; Wang, Nianshuang; Pallesen, Jesper; Wrapp, Daniel; Turner, Hannah L.; Cottrell, Christopher A.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Graham, Barney S.; McLellan, Jason S.; Ward, Andrew B.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30356097/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34171-7,268

595329,Coronavirus as a possible cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome,2003-04-19,"OBJECTIVE: To learn about the attitudes and behaviours of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in relation to the difficulties experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicentre phone call survey. SETTING: Four university hospitals in Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients with IPF receiving antifibrotics for at least 3 months and with doctor appointment and/or scheduled routine blood analysis between March and May 2020 (the first 3 months after the official announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey). INTERVENTIONS: Phone calls (a 5 min interview) were performed in June 2020. A questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale were applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients’ preferences for disease monitoring, patients’ attitudes and behaviours towards IPF, drug continuation, COVID-19 diagnosis and anxiety/depression status. RESULTS: The study included 115 patients with IPF (82 male; mean age, 68.43±7.44 years). Of the patients, 73.9% had doctor appointment and 52.2% had scheduled routine blood testing; 54.5% of patients with doctor appointment self-cancelled their appointments and 53.3% of patients with scheduled routine blood testing did not undergo testing. Of the patients, 32.2% were on nintedanib and 67.8% were on pirfenidone; self-initiated drug discontinuation rate was 22.6%. The percentage of patients communicating with their physicians was 35.7%. The route of communication was by phone (34.8%). The frequency of depression and anxiety was 27.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The rates of drug discontinuation (35.1% vs 16.7%, p<0.05) and depression (37.8% vs 21.8%, p=0.07) were higher in nintedanib users than in pirfenidone users. Only two (1.7%) patients had COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion (>50%) of patients self-cancelled their appointments and nearly a quarter of patients discontinued their medications. Providing a documentation of the problems experienced by patients with IPF about management of the necessary requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study may be a model for patients with chronic diseases.","Coskun, Funda; Hanta, Ismail; Cilli, Aykut; Ozkaya, Guven; Ursavas, Ahmet; Sevinc, Can",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385255/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050578,268

595642,Extended ORF8 Gene Region Is Valuable in the Epidemiological Investigation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–Similar Coronavirus,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with poor coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, little is known on the impact of undiagnosed diabetes in the COVID-19 population. We investigated whether diabetes, particularly undiagnosed diabetes, was associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study identified adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Diabetes was determined using patients’ past history (diagnosed) or was newly defined if the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at admission was ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (undiagnosed). The in-hospital mortality rate and survival probability were compared between the non-diabetes and diabetes (overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes) groups. Risk factors of mortality were explored using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 373 patients, 233 were included in the final analysis, among whom 80 (34.3%) had diabetes: 44 (55.0%) reported a diabetes history, and 36 (45.0%) were newly defined as having undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c testing at admission. Compared with the non-diabetes group, the overall diabetes group had a significantly increased mortality rate (22.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes groups displayed lower survival probability in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (all p < 0.01). Using multivariate Cox regression, diabetes, age, quick sequential organ failure assessment score, and D-dimer ≥1.0 μg/mL were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes among patients with COVID-19 is high in China. Diabetes, even newly defined by HbA1c testing at admission, is associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c measurement should be considered in adult Chinese inpatients with COVID-19.

CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a thirty-eight-year-old woman taking combined oral contraception (desogestrel/ethinyl oestradiol tablets) with a history of varicose veins. She recovered from a COVID-19 infection in November 2020. She presented to the emergency room with right lower-limb pain below the knee and progressive swelling for five days in February 2021. Physical examination of the lower limb showed mild swelling and tenderness of the right leg compared to the left leg. D-Dimer was elevated (1.06 mcg/mL FEU). COVID-19 screening was negative. A Doppler scan to exclude DVT was performed considering the clinical picture and high D-dimer level. There was no evidence of DVT in the right limb. She was reassured and discharged with instructions on when to visit the emergency room. The D-dimer had decreased to 0.53 mcg/mL FEU in March 2021. She booked an appointment with family medicine clinics because she was concerned about the continuation of combined oral contraception (desogestrel/ethinyl oestradiol tablets) with high D-dimer and risk of thrombosis. The follow-up D-dimer level in May 2021 was normal (0.4 mcg/mL FEU). The patient preferred to continue taking oral contraception.

The inclusive detail of each group along with the clarification to formulate the manipulative form of the SITR nonlinear model of novel COVID-19 dynamics is presented. The solution of the SITR model is presented using the artificial neural networks (ANNs) models trained with particle swarm optimization (PSO), i.e., global search scheme and prompt fine-tuning by IPA, i.e., ANN-PSOIPA. In the ANN-PSOIPA, the merit function is expressed for the impression of mean squared error applying the continuous ANNs form for the dynamics of SITR system and training of these networks are competently accompanied with the integrated competence of PSOIPA. The exactness, stability, reliability and prospective of the considered ANN-PSOIPA for four different forms is established via the comparative valuation from of Runge-Kutta numerical solutions for the single and multiple executions.

They have contributed to significant reductions in influenza morbidity and mortality. However, there have been limitations in their effectiveness, in part due to the continuous antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, but also due to the predominant use of embryonated chicken eggs for their production. The latter furthermore limits their worldwide production timelines and scale. Therefore today, alternative approaches for their design and production are increasingly pursued, with already licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines produced in cell cultures, including based on a baculovirus expression system. Next-generation influenza vaccines aim at inducing broader and longer-lasting immune responses to overcome seasonal influenza virus antigenic drift and to timely address the emergence of a new pandemic influenza virus. Tailored approaches target mechanisms to improve vaccine-induced immune responses in individuals with a weakened immune system, in particular older adults.","Becker, Tanja; Elbahesh, Husni; Reperant, Leslie A; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590139/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab269,268

Methods: This was a retrospective case series involving 218 patients admitted to three tertiary hospitals in the Loudi, Shaoyang, and Xiangtan areas of China from January 21 to June 27, 2020, who were confirmed by RT-PCR to have SARS-CoV-2. The patients' clinical characteristics, laboratory results, treatments, and prognoses based on clinical classification were recorded. Poor outcome was defined as admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: The patients were classified into four clinical groups based on disease severity, namely mild (10/218, 5%), moderate (146/218, 67%), severe (24/218, 11%), or critical (14/218, 6%); 24 (11%) asymptomatic cases were also included in the study. The most common symptoms were self-reported cough (162/218, 74%), fever (145/218, 67%), sputum production (99/218, 45%), and fatigue (77/218, 35%). Among the 218 patients, 192 (88%) received lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-alpha inhalation, and 196 (90%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine. Among the severe and critical patients, 25 (11%) were admitted to an ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and one patient died. The presence of diabetes [relative risk (RR), 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3–6.8; p = 0.007) or other comorbidities (RR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.9–17.8; p = 0.002) was independently associated with poor outcome. To date, 20 (9%) patients have retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovering and being discharged. Conclusion: The majority of patients in this case series were clinically classified as having moderate COVID-19. Older patients tended to present with greater levels of clinical severity.

Since global challenges are problems of unprecedented complexity, it is argued that a secular paradigm shift is required away from the overemphasis on allegedly neutral standpoints, on a mechanistic picture of the world and on deductive logics towards accounts of emergence, of systemicity, informationality and conviviality, building upon each other and providing together a transdisciplinary edifice of the sciences, in the end, for, and by the inclusion of, citizens. Viewed from such a combined perspective, the current social evolution is punctuated by a Great Bifurcation similar to bifurcations other emergent systems have been facing. On the one hand, humankind is on the brink of extinction. It is the world occurrence of the enclosure of commons that is detrimental to sharing the systemic synergy effects and thus to the cohesion of social systems. On the other hand, humanity is on the threshold of a planetary society. Another leap in integration would be the appropriate response to the complexity confronted with. Humans and their social systems are informational agents and, as such, they are able to generate requisite information and use it to catch up with the complex challenges. They can establish convivial rules of living together in that they disclose the commons world-wide. By doing so, they would accomplish another evolutionary step in anthroposociogenesis.

We reviewed and analysed the legal and policy framework to identify policy gaps, options and priority areas to address the SLT burden in India and lessons thereof. In India, 21.4% adults, including 29.6% of men, 12.8% of women, use SLT while more than 0.35 million Indians die every year due to SLT use. SLT use remains a huge public health concern for other countries in the region as well. Priority areas for SLT control should include: constant monitoring, increasing taxes and price of SLT products, strengthening and strict enforcement of existing laws, integration of SLT cessation with all health and development programmes, banning of advertisement and promotion of SLT, increasing age of access to tobacco up to 21 years, introducing licensing for the sale of SLT, standardising of SLT packaging and preventing SLT industry interference in the implementation of SLT control policies besides a committed multistakeholder approach for effective policy formulation and enforcement.

The most amount of the death toll is accounted by old people affected by age-related diseases that develop a hyper-inflammatory syndrome. In this regard, we hypothesized that COVID-19 severity may be linked to inflammaging. Here, we examined 30 serum samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial NCT04315480 assessing the clinical response to a single-dose intravenous infusion of the anti-IL-6 receptor drug Tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 patients with multifocal interstitial pneumonia. In these serum samples, as well as in 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, we assessed a set of microRNAs that regulate inflammaging, i.e. miR-146a-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-126-3p, which were quantified by RT-PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. We showed that COVID-19 patients who did not respond to TCZ have lower serum levels of miR-146a-5p after the treatment (p=0.007). Among non-responders, those with the lowest serum levels of miR-146a-5p experienced the most adverse outcome (p=0.008). Our data show that a blood-based biomarker, such as miR-146a-5p, can provide clues about the molecular link between inflammaging and COVID-19 clinical course, thus allowing to better understand the use of biologic drug armory against this worldwide health threat.","Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Giuliani, Angelica; Matacchione, Giulia; Latini, Silvia; Laprovitera, Noemi; Pomponio, Giovanni; Ferrarini, Alessia; Baroni, Silvia Svegliati; Pavani, Marianna; Moretti, Marco; Gabrielli, Armando; Procopio, Antonio Domenico; Ferracin, Manuela; BonafÃ¨, Massimiliano; Olivieri, Fabiola",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151365; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.11.20151365v1?rss=1,268

Whilst efforts have been made in recent years to transform our profession, numerous challenges remain. An improved understanding of the topic of decoloniality is a useful and necessary way of beginning to address these challenges. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this opinion piece is to encourage further dialogue amongst South African physiotherapists working in all sectors – a dialogue that must focus on genuinely transforming our profession to be better suited to serving the majority of South Africans. METHOD: Global and local literature related to decoloniality is summarised for readers, followed by a closer scrutiny of how this topic relates to some of the challenges faced by the profession of physiotherapy in South Africa. RESULTS: The evidence presented demonstrates that whilst some efforts have been made to transform South African physiotherapy, significant work and dialogue is required to bring about a true transformation of the profession. CONCLUSION: An honest and transparent conversation about decoloniality and transformation can assist in realising the potential of our profession, thereby improving the health and well-being of all South Africans.

This paper highlights how ‘TreC_Televisita’ was integrated into the Trentino healthcare system and its potential to become a structural and durable solution for the future local healthcare service provisioning. SUBJECT AND METHODS: This paper presents the multifactorial context that TreC_Televisita has faced for its implementation and the strategies adopted for its structural integration into the healthcare system. The analysis focuses on the main issues faced for the integration of the tele visits (e.g. privacy, payments) and how the context of TrentinoSalute4.0 permitted responding quickly to its implementation during the pandemic. It also describes how TreC_Televisita fits into the healthcare continuum from the organisational and technological standpoint, the end-user perspective and the barriers that could hamper the solution scalability. RESULTS: TreC_Televisita has demonstrated to be a technological solution that can be contextualised for different clinical domains beyond SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has shown its potential to scale up the solution beyond the COVID-19 emergency to the whole healthcare provisioning system in the long term. CONCLUSION: Being a positive experience in the first months of its implementation, the long-term goal is to transform TreC_Televisita into a structural pillar of the Trentino healthcare system, setting the bases for a sustainable, win–win situation for all the stakeholders involved in healthcare service provisioning.","Testa, Sara; Mayora-Ibarra, Oscar; Piras, Enrico Maria; Balagna, Olivia; Micocci, Stefano; Zanutto, Alberto; Forti, Stefano; Conforti, Diego; Nicolini, Andrea; Malfatti, Giulia; Moz, Monica; Gios, Lorenzo; Benetollo, Pier Paolo; Turra, Ettore; Orrasch, Massimo; Zambotti, Francesca; Del Greco, Maurizio; Maines, Massimiliano; Filippi, Lorena; Ghezzi, Monica; Romanelli, Federica; Racano, Elisabetta; Marin, Mauro; Betta, Marta; Bertagnolli, Elisabetta",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150467/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01609-8,268
618295,Antibody Response of Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Targets the Viral Nucleocapsid,2004-07-15,"COVID-19 related restrictions lowered particulate matter and trace gas concentrations across cities around the world, providing a natural opportunity to study effects of anthropogenic activities on emissions of air pollutants. In this paper, the impact of sudden suspension of human activities on air pollution was analyzed by studying the change in satellite retrieved NO(2) concentrations and top-down NOx emission over the urban and rural areas around Delhi. NO(2) was chosen for being the most indicative of emission intensity due to its short lifetime of the order of a few hours in the planetary boundary layer. We present a robust temporal comparison of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved NO(2) column density during the lockdown with the counterfactual baseline concentrations, extrapolated from the long-term trend and seasonal cycle components of NO(2) using observations during 2015 to 2019. NO(2) concentration in the urban area of Delhi experienced an anomalous relative change ranging from 60.0% decline during the Phase 1 of lockdown (March 25–April 13, 2020) to 3.4% during the post-lockdown Phase 5. In contrast, we find no substantial reduction in NO(2) concentrations over the rural areas. To segregate the impact of the lockdown from the meteorology, weekly top-down NOx emissions were estimated from high-resolution TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) retrieved NO(2) by accounting for horizontal advection derived from the steady state continuity equation. NOx emissions from urban Delhi and power plants exhibited a mean decline of 72.2% and 53.4% respectively in Phase 1 compared to the pre-lockdown business-as-usual phase. Emission estimates over urban areas and power-plants showed a good correlation with activity reports, suggesting the applicability of this approach for studying emission changes. A higher anomaly in emission estimates suggests that comparison of only concentration change, without accounting for the dynamical and photochemical conditions, may mislead evaluation of lockdown impact. Our results shall also have a broader impact for optimizing bottom-up emission inventories.","Misra, Prakhar; Takigawa, Masayuki; Khatri, Pradeep; Dhaka, Surendra K.; Dimri, A.

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have only recently been shown to cause both lower and upper respiratory tract infections. To date, five coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV HKU-1) that infect humans have been identified, four of which (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU-1) circulate continuously in the human population. Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was first isolated from the aspirate from a 7-month-old baby in early 2004. Infection with HCoV-NL63 has since been shown to be a common worldwide occurrence and has been associated with many clinical symptoms and diagnoses, including severe lower respiratory tract infection, croup and bronchiolitis. HCoV-NL63 causes disease in children, the elderly and the immunocompromised, and has been detected in 1.0–9.3% of respiratory tract infections in children. In this article, the current knowledge of human coronavirus HCoV-NL63, with special reference to the clinical features, prevalence and seasonal incidence, and coinfection with other respiratory viruses, will be discussed.","Fielding, Burtram C",Future Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366416/; https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.10.166,268

Our study aimed to determine the factors influencing the outcomes of older ventilated medical patients in a large tertiary medical center. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study including all newly ventilated medical patients aged 65 years and older over a period of 18 months. Data were acquired from computerized medical records and from an interview of the medical personnel initiating mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 554 patients underwent mechanical ventilation for the first time during the study period. The average age was 79 years, and 80% resided at home. Following mechanical ventilation, 8% died in the emergency room, and the majority of patients (351; 63%) were hospitalized in internal medicine wards. In-hospital mortality was 64.1%, with 48% dying during the first week of hospitalization. Overall 6-months survival was 26%. We found that a combination of age 85 years and older, functional status prior to ventilation, and associated morbidity (diabetes with target organ injury and/or oncological solid organ disease) were the strongest negative predictors of survival after discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Mechanical ventilation at older age is associated with poor survival and it is possible to identify factors predicting survival. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of this study may help in the decision-making process regarding mechanical ventilation for older people.","Smolin, Bella; Raz-Pasteur, Ayelet; Mashiach, Tatiana; Zaidani, Hisam; Levi, Leon; Strizevsky, Alexander; King, Daniel A.; Dwolatzky, Tzvi",Eur Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542845/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-021-00557-6,268

The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sher, Leo",QJM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32539153/; https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa202,268

Although real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is known as the most widely laboratory method to detect the COVID-19 from respiratory specimens. It suffers from several main drawbacks such as time-consuming, high false-negative results, and limited availability. Therefore, the automatically detect of COVID-19 will be required. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use an automated deep convolution neural network based pre-trained transfer models for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, we have applied Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16, VGG-19, MobileNet, and InceptionResNetV2 pre-trained models for detection COVID-19 infection from 348 chest X-ray images. RESULTS: Our proposed models have been trained and tested on a dataset which previously prepared. The all proposed models provide accuracy greater than 90.0%. The pre-trained MobileNet model provides the highest classification performance of automated COVID-19 classification with 99.1% accuracy in comparison with other three proposed models. The plotted area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and InceptionResNetV2 models are 0.92, 0.91, 0.99, and 0.97, respectively. CONCLUSION: The all proposed models were able to perform binary classification with the accuracy more than 90.0% for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our data indicated that the MobileNet can be considered as a promising model to detect COVID-19 cases. In the future, by increasing the number of samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to the training dataset, the accuracy and robustness of our proposed models increase further.","R., Mohammadi; M., Salehi; H., Ghaffari; A.

As a result of IFN signaling, a wide array of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products is upregulated to target different stages of the viral life cycle. We review recent findings implicating a subset of ISGs in translational regulation of viral and host mRNAs. Translation inhibition is mediated either by binding to viral RNA or by disrupting physiological interactions or levels of the translation complex components. In addition, many of these ISGs localize to translationally silent cytoplasmic granules, such as stress granules and processing bodies, and intersect with the microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing pathway to regulate translation of cellular mRNAs.","Li, Melody M.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this investigation is to: 1) examine the postoperative outcomes of patients that underwent elective procedures in an ambulatory surgery center during the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) share the preoperative screening and patient selection protocol implemented in our center. METHODS: Elective procedures performed in an ambulatory surgery center between March 1, 2020 and April 16, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcomes were occurrence of COVID-19 related postoperative complications. These complications include pneumonia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and clotting disorders. Predictive variables analyzed in this study were: age, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, and specialty conducting the procedure, operating time, and the type of plastic and reconstructive surgery procedure being performed. RESULTS: A total of 300 consecutive electives cases were included in the study. The most common procedures were pain management (43.0%), gastrointestinal (26.0%), aesthetic (14.0%), orthopedic (10.3%), reconstructive (4.0%), otorhinolaryngology (2.0%), and gynecology (0.67%). The median age of the cohort was 54.6 years (range, 1-90 years) and the median procedure time was 47 minutes (range, 11-304 minutes).

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) often causes severe hypercalcemia. Volume resuscitation, parenteral salmon calcitonin, and administration of intravenous bisphosphonates are common measures used to stabilize patients. However, the use of these measures is inadequate in several patients and may even be contraindicated in individuals with renal insufficiency or severe systemic illness. This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe hypercalcemia due to PHPT, when immediate surgery was not feasible. We present four patients with severe hypercalcemia due to PHPT. Immediate surgery was not feasible because the patients had severe systemic illness, such as seizures and altered sensorium (case 1); acute severe pancreatitis (cases 2 and 3); or coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia (case 4). Intravenous normal saline and parenteral salmon calcitonin were inadequate for controlling hypercalcemia. Intravenous bisphosphonates were avoided because of severe systemic illness in all cases and impaired renal function in three cases. Denosumab was administered to control hypercalcemia and allow the stabilization of patients for definitive surgical management. Following denosumab administration, serum calcium levels normalized, and general condition improved in all patients. Three patients underwent parathyroidectomy after two weeks and another patient after eight weeks. The use of denosumab for the management of severe hypercalcemia due to PHPT is efficacious and safe in patients when immediate surgical management is not feasible due to severe systemic illness.","Kuchay, Mohammad Shafi; Mathew, Anu; Kaur, Parjeet; Mishra, Sunil Kumar",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

Normally, older individuals and those with underlying health issues are more at risk. However, about 40% of COVID-19 positive individuals are asymptomatic. This review aims to identify suggested mechanisms of diverse manifestations of COVID-19. Studies suggest that T cell-mediated immunity and specific and/or nonspecific immunity from other vaccines could protect against SARS-CoV-2. The potential role of cross-reacting antibodies to coronaviruses that cause the common cold, mumps virus, polio virus, and pneumococcal bacteria are also suggested to help protect against COVID-19. Decreased production of Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) could also be linked to COVID-19 manifestations. Several studies suggest that ACE2 cell membrane receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the relationship between an abundance of ACE2 receptors and the infectivity of the virus is unknown. Unlocking these manifestation mysteries could be crucial as this could help researchers better understand the virulence, pathology, and immune responses associated with SARS-CoV-2, leading to the development of effective therapies and treatment plans.","Zaman, Md S.; Sizemore, Robert C.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574709/,268

As FcRs can trigger positive and negative signals, as these signals control several biological activities in individual cells, as FcRs are expressed by many cells of hematopoietic origin, mostly of the myeloid lineage, as these cells express various combinations of FcRs, and as FcR-expressing cells have different functional repertoires, antibodies can exert a wide spectrum of biological activities. Like B and T Cell Receptors (BCRs and TCRs), FcRs are bona fide immunoreceptors. Unlike BCRs and TCRs, however, FcRs are immunoreceptors with an adaptive specificity for antigen, with an adaptive affinity for antibodies, with an adaptive structure and with an adaptive signaling. They induce adaptive biological responses that depend on their tissue distribution and on FcR-expressing cells that are selected locally by antibodies. They critically determine health and disease. They are thus exquisitely adaptive therapeutic tools.","Daëron, Marc",Fc Receptors,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07911-0_7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25116099/,268

Three incrementing levels of hospital equipment usage are considered: (1) in terms of available intensive care unit (ICU) beds; (2) available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms; and (3) available ICU beds and existing surgery operating rooms and respirators located in other hospital areas. The average available (adult) ICU beds in a hospital has been computed deducting from the number of existing beds the equivalent number of beds that has been demanded during 2019 on a monthly average. Based on a reference mean duration of hospitalization for the disease, it is computed the daily admission capacity of infected patients per state and of the entire country health system for each of the three referred levels of hospital equipment usage. Furthermore, an exponential regression model is fitted using the daily available data for the number of patients who have been documented as infected in Brazil. It can then be predicted the three dates at which the health system might begin to demonstrate stress for the maximum demand of the three incrementing groups of hospital equipments.

We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those characteristics associated with worse CPET performance. Methods We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed. Results Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)%. Thirty-eight(34.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits. Eight(21.1%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with %pVO2 (p>0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age ({beta}=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss ({beta}=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status ({beta}=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay ({beta}=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength ({beta}=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with %pVO2. Conclusions Half of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.","Clavario, P.; De Marzo, V.; Lotti, R.; Barbara, C.; Porcile, A.; Russo, C.; Beccaria, F.; Bonavia, M.; Bottaro, L.

637421,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),2009-05-15,"At the moment of writing this communication, the health crisis derived from the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 120 million cases, with 40 million corresponding to Europe. In total, the number of deaths is almost 3 million, but continuously rising. Although COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 infects also endothelial cells in the pulmonary capillaries. This affects the integrity of the endothelium and increases vascular permeability. In addition, there are serious indirect consequences, like disruption of endothelial cells’ junctions leading to micro-bleeds and uncontrolled blood clotting. The impact of COVID-19 in people with rare chronic cardiovascular diseases is unknown so far, and interesting to assess, because the virus may cause additional complications in these patients. The aim of the present work was to study the COVID-19 infection among the patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). A retrospective study was carried out in a 138 HHT patients’ sample attending an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) reference consult. The evaluation of the COVID-19 infection in them reveals milder symptoms; among the 25 HHT patients who were infected, only 3 cases were hospitalized, and none of them required ICU or ventilation assistance. The results are discussed in the light of macrophage immune response.","Marcos, Sol; Albiñana, Virginia; Recio-Poveda, Lucia; Tarazona, Belisa; Verde-González, María Patrocinio; Ojeda-Fernández, Luisa; Botella, Luisa-María",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10091884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925423/,268

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 797 documented and undocumented migrants thought to be vulnerable to influenza during the early stages of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Data were collected on socio-demographic factors, migration status, health information sources, barriers to accessing public healthcare services and influenza-related knowledge using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Among the different types of influenza, participants' awareness of avian influenza was greatest (81%), followed by H1N1 (78%), human influenza (61%) and pandemic influenza (35%). Logistic regression analyses identified 11 factors that significantly predicted a high level of knowledge about influenza. Six or more years of education completed [odds ratio (OR) 6.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.58–13.24)] and recent participation in an influenza prevention activity [OR 5.27 (95% CI 2.78–9.98)] were the strongest predictors. Recommendations to aid public health efforts toward pandemic mitigation and prevention include increasing accessibility of education options for migrants and increasing frequency and accessibility of influenza prevention activities, such as community outreach and meetings.

640608,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Reinfection Cases Corroborated by Sequencing.,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is recommended in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEIs); however, little is known about immunogenicity and safety in these patients. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the impact of genetic diagnosis, age, and treatment on antibody response to COVID-19 vaccine and related adverse events in a cohort of patients with IEIs. METHODS: Plasma was collected from 22 health care worker controls, 81 patients with IEIs, and 2 patients with thymoma; the plasma was collected before immunization, 1 to 6 days before the second dose of mRNA vaccine, and at a median of 30 days after completion of the immunization schedule with either mRNA vaccine or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. Anti-spike (anti-S) and anti-nucleocapsid antibody titers were measured by using a luciferase immunoprecipitation systems method. Information on T- and B-cell counts and use of immunosuppressive drugs was extracted from medical records, and information on vaccine-associated adverse events was collected after each dose. RESULTS: Anti-S antibodies were detected in 27 of 46 patients (58.7%) after 1 dose of mRNA vaccine and in 63 of 74 fully immunized patients (85.1%). A lower rate of seroconversion (7 of 11 [63.6%]) was observed in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy. Previous use of rituximab and baseline counts of less than 1000 CD3(+) T cells/mL and less than 100 CD19(+) B cells/mL were associated with lower anti-S IgG levels. No significant adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating patients with IEIs is safe, but immunogenicity is affected by certain therapies and gene defects. These data may guide the counseling of patients with IEIs regarding prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for subsequent boosts.","Delmonte, Ottavia M.; Bergerson, Jenna R.E.; Burbelo, Peter D.; Durkee-Shock, Jessica R.; Dobbs, Kerry; Bosticardo, Marita; Keller, Michael D.; McDermott, David H.; Rao, V.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological symptoms of ordinary Chinese citizens during the Level I Emergency Response throughout China. From January 31 to February 2 2020, an online questionnaire, Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) was designed, and differences in GSI T-scores among subgroups were examined by ANOVA. Based on a cut-off point of the GSI T-scores of 63, the overall sample was divided into high and low-risk groups. of the 1,060 participants investigated in China, more than 70% of them have moderate and higher level of psychological symptoms specifically elevated scores for obsessive compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. There were no significant differences between males and females. Those who were of over 50 years old, had an undergraduate education and below, were divorced or widowed, and agricultural workers had significantly more symptoms. However, significantly more minors and medical staff were in the high-risk group. These results show that COVID-19 has a significant adverse socio-psychological influence on ordinary citizens. Therefore, governments should equip psychological health departments and pay attention to the people who are in high-risk groups, providing psychological interventions and assistance.","Tian, Fangyuan; Li, Hongxia; Tian, Shuicheng; Yang, Jie; Shao, Jiang; Tian, Chenning",Psychiatry Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302816/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120306879; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112992; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120306879,268

Three dogs and one cat are described that developed neurological signs within 21 to 42 hours of attenuation of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. None of these cases had biochemical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy postoperatively. Two dogs died during management of status epilepticus following aspiration of food. One dog died six months postoperatively. The cat had persistent neurological dysfunction at discharge, but was alive and had recovered most of its neurological function at the time of writing, 37 months after surgery. This report demonstrates the potential for animals with intrahepatic portosystemic shunts to develop postoperative neurological signs and highlights the difficulty of managing such cases. Two dogs had both intrahepatic and extrahepatic portosystemic shunts.

645683,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,2004-05-15,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","Raoult, Didier; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Kroemer, Guido",Cell stress,https://doi.org/10.15698/cst2020.04.216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292881/,268

Here we report the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States and determination of its origin, evolution, and genotypes based on temporal and geographical evidence. Histological lesions in small intestine sections of affected pigs and the complete genomic sequences of three emergent strains of PEDV isolated from outbreaks in Minnesota and Iowa were characterized. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the three U.S. strains revealed a close relationship with Chinese PEDV strains and their likely Chinese origin. The U.S. PEDV strains underwent evolutionary divergence, which can be classified into two sublineages. The three emergent U.S. strains are most closely related to a strain isolated in 2012 from Anhui Province in China, which might be the result of multiple recombination events between different genetic lineages or sublineages of PEDV. Molecular clock analysis of the divergent time based on the complete genomic sequences is consistent with the actual time difference, approximately 2 to 3 years, of the PED outbreaks between China (December 2010) and the United States (May 2013). The finding that the emergent U.S. PEDV strains share unique genetic features at the 5′-untranslated region with a bat coronavirus provided further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission. The data from this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in the United States and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures against PEDV.","Huang, Yao-Wei; Dickerman, Allan W.; Piñeyro, Pablo; Li, Long; Fang, Li; Kiehne, Ross; Opriessnig, Tanja; Meng, Xiang-Jin",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24129257/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00737-13,268

The analysis draws upon data from fieldwork and documentary materials with a focus on the UK and EU (2002–05) and explores four arenas: governance and regulatory policy; commercialisation and the market; ‘evidentiality’ manifest in evidence-based policy; and publics’ and technology users’ values and ethics. The analysis suggests that there is a trend toward ‘purification’ across these arenas, both material and socio-political. A common process of partitioning is found in stakeholders’ attempts to define a clear terrain, which the field of tissue-engineered technology might occupy. We conclude that pollution ideas and partitioning processes are useful in understanding regulatory ordering and innovation in the emerging technological zone of human tissue engineering.","Faulkner, Alex; Kent, Julie; Geesink, Ingrid; FitzPatrick, David",Soc Sci Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606003091; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953606003091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905231/,268
649440,Predicting Super Spreading Events during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Epidemics in Hong Kong and Singapore,2004-10-15,"We are concerned with the challenge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) detection in chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, and the classification and segmentation of related infection manifestations. Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics. We evaluate the proposed models on widely adopted datasets, and we demonstrate an increase of approximately 4% and 7% for dice coefficient and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), respectively, while achieving 60% reduction in computational time, compared to the recent literature.","El-bana, S.; Al-Kabbany, A.; Sharkas, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20139238; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20139238v1?rss=1,268

But how effective were these measures across countries? Compared to multiple recent studies that document an association between such restrictions and the control of the contagion, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate the causal effect of these restrictions on mobility, and the growth rate of confirmed cases and deaths during the first wave of the pandemic. Using the level of stringency in the rest of the world to predict the level of stringency of the restriction measures in a country, we show while stricter contemporaneous measures affected mobility, stringency in seven to fourteen days mattered most for containing the contagion. Heterogeneity analysis, by various institutional inequalities, reveals that even though the restrictions reduced mobility more in relatively less-developed countries, the causal effect of a reduction in mobility was higher in more developed countries. We propose several explanations. Our results highlight the need to complement mobility and activity restrictions with other health and information measures, especially in less-developed countries, to combat the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.","Fakir, Adnan M.

It is important to highlight that one of the main characteristics of this pandemic is the oversaturation of the health system capacity, mostly due to a high demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), Hospital/ICU beds, as well as ventilators. In places with limited resources and where the health care systems are already saturated, such consideration is even more worrisome. Therefore, most worldwide authorities are recommending to avoid, as much as possible, patient’s elective visits to hospitals, as well as a judicious use of the operating room in order to mitigate the strain put on the health system. While efforts should be directed to the care of COVID-19 patients, other conditions (especially urgencies and oncological cases) must continue to be assisted. Thus, through a panel of experts, we have prepared a practical guide for urologists based on the recommendations from the main Urologic Associations, as well as data from the literature to support the suggested management. We will try to follow the standard guideline recommendations from the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU), with the aim of pursuing the best outcomes possible.

Amantadine and/or memantine have shown anti-inflammatory effects in chronic hepatitis C, in neuroinflammation induced by sepsis and by lipopolysaccharides, experimental models of multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and respiratory diseases. Since the inflammatory response is one of the main pathogenetic mechanisms in the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-inflammatory effects of amantadine and memantine could be hypothetically useful in the treatment of this condition.

653316,Multiscale interactome analysis coupled with off-target drug predictions reveals drug repurposing candidates for human coronavirus disease,2021-04-13,"qRT-PCR still remains the most widely used method for quantifying gene expression levels, although newer technologies such as next generation sequencing are becoming increasingly popular. A critical, yet often underappreciated, problem when analysing qRT-PCR data is the selection of suitable reference genes. This problem is compounded in situations where up to 25% of all genes may change (e.g., due to leukocyte invasion), as is typically the case in ARDS. Here, we examined 11 widely used reference genes for their suitability in commonly used models of acute lung injury (ALI): ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), in vivo and ex vivo, lipopolysaccharide plus mechanical ventilation (MV), and hydrochloric acid plus MV. The stability of reference gene expression was determined using the NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm algorithms. We then proceeded with the geNorm results because this is the only algorithm that provides the number of reference genes required to achieve normalisation. We chose interleukin-6 (Il-6) and C-X-C motif ligand 1 (Cxcl-1) as the genes of interest to analyse and demonstrate the impact of inappropriate normalisation. Reference gene stability differed between the ALI models and even within the subgroup of VILI models, no common reference gene index (RGI) could be determined. NormFinder, BestKeeper, and geNorm produced slightly different, but comparable results. Inappropriate normalisation of Il-6 and Cxcl1 gene expression resulted in significant misinterpretation in all four ALI settings. In conclusion, choosing an inappropriate normalisation strategy can introduce different kinds of bias such as gain or loss as well as under- or overestimation of effects, affecting the interpretation of gene expression data.","Fragoulis, Athanassios; Biller, Kristina; Fragoulis, Stephanie; Lex, Dennis; Uhlig, Stefan; Reiss, Lucy Kathleen",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360619/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22157853,268

The present study examined the relationships between hope, death anxiety and simplified coping style scores of nursing students during the outbreak of COVID-19. Between February and April 2020, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed using a Sojump online survey, and 870 nursing students completed the herth hope (HH), death anxiety scale (DAS) and simplified coping style questionnaire. The data were analyzed using t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple linear regression in SPSS 23.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The average HH, DAS and active and passive coping scores of the 870 nursing students were 3.07 ± 0.32, 3.01 ± 0.37, 2.84 ± 0.48, and 2.25 ± 0.50, respectively. Participants with contact experience with individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to adopt passive coping styles than students without contact experience (t = 5.019, P = .025). Being older and having higher inner positive readiness and expectancy, a lower inner sense of temporality and future, and lower time awareness were predictors of passive coping styles (P < .05). Living in cities (vs towns) and having a higher inner positive readiness and expectancy, a higher inner sense of temporality and future and lower cognition of death were predictors of active coping styles (P < .05). The findings of this study suggest that hope and death anxiety are important aspects of the coping styles of nursing students. Nursing educators should emphasize the role of hope, further deepen the death education mode, and perform scientific and reasonable death education programmes to reduce the death anxiety level of nursing students to promote their coping styles in crisis.","Cheng, Linan; Guo, Xiaoyan; Liu, Haijing; Chen, Qian; Cui, Renshan",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000027016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449474/,268

It is imperative to identify these patients early. We show that a deep learning-based survival model can predict the risk of COVID-19 patients developing critical illness based on clinical characteristics at admission. We develop this model using a cohort of 1590 patients from 575 medical centers, with internal validation performance of concordance index 0.894 We further validate the model on three separate cohorts from Wuhan, Hubei and Guangdong provinces consisting of 1393 patients with concordance indexes of 0.890, 0.852 and 0.967 respectively. This model is used to create an online calculation tool designed for patient triage at admission to identify patients at risk of severe illness, ensuring that patients at greatest risk of severe illness receive appropriate care as early as possible and allow for effective allocation of health resources.","Liang, Wenhua; Yao, Jianhua; Chen, Ailan; Lv, Qingquan; Zanin, Mark; Liu, Jun; Wong, SookSan; Li, Yimin; Lu, Jiatao; Liang, Hengrui; Chen, Guoqiang; Guo, Haiyan; Guo, Jun; Zhou, Rong; Ou, Limin; Zhou, Niyun; Chen, Hanbo; Yang, Fan; Han, Xiao; Huan, Wenjing; Tang, Weimin; Guan, Weijie; Chen, Zisheng; Zhao, Yi; Sang, Ling; Xu, Yuanda; Wang, Wei; Li, Shiyue; Lu, Ligong; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; Huang, Junzhou; He, Jianxing",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17280-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669540/,268

The current COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed millions of people. Unfortunately, effective treatments for CoVs infection are still lacking, suggesting the importance of coronavirus vaccines. Our previous work showed that CoV nonstuctural protein 14 (nsp14) functions as (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), which is involved in RNA cap formation. Moreover, we found that N7-MTase is well conserved among different CoVs and is a universal target for developing antivirals against CoVs. Here, we show that N7-MTase of CoVs can be an ideal target for designing live attenuated vaccines. Using murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), a representative and well-studied model of coronaviruses, we constructed N7-MTase-deficient recombinant MHV D330A and Y414A. These two mutants are highly attenuated in mice and exhibit similar replication efficiency to the wild-type (WT) virus in the cell culture. Furthermore, a single dose immunization of D330A or Y414A can induce long-term humoral immune responses and robust CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses, which can provide full protection against the challenge of a lethal-dose of MHV-A59. Collectively, this study provides an ideal strategy to design live attenuated vaccines for coronavirus by abolishing viral RNA N7-MTase activity. This approach may apply to other RNA viruses that encode their own conservative viral N7-methyltransferase.","Zhang, Zhen; Liu, Qianyun; Sun, Ying; Li, Jiali; Liu, Jiejie; Pan, Ruangang; Cao, Liu; Chen, Xianying; Li, Yingjian; Zhang, Yuzhen; Xu, Ke; Guo, Deyin; Zhou, Li; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365904/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1964385,268

Avian influenza outbreaks in downwind areas of Asian dust storms (ADS) suggest that viruses might be transported by dust storms. OBJECTIVES: We developed a technique to measure ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses. We then used this technique to measure concentrations of these viruses on ADS days and background days, and to assess the relationships between ambient influenza and avian influenza viruses, and air pollutants. METHODS: A high-volume air sampler was used in parallel with a filter cassette to evaluate spiked samples and unspiked samples. Then, air samples were monitored during ADS seasons using a filter cassette coupled with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Air samples were monitored during ADS season (1 January to 31 May 2006). RESULTS: We successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using the filtration/real-time qPCR method during ADS days and background days. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the concentration of influenza virus in ambient air. In both the spiked and unspiked samples, the concentration of influenza virus sampled using the filter cassette was higher than that using the high-volume sampler. The concentration of ambient influenza A virus was significantly higher during the ADS days than during the background days.

Four groups of 63 (1–5-week-old) suckling, TGEV-seronegative pigs were used to assess the efficacy of the recombinant protein vaccine (group 3) in comparison with sham (group 1), commercial vaccine (group 2), and virulent TGEV Miller-strain-inoculated pigs (group 4). The TGEV-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses were measured after in vivo and in vitro stimulation with TGEV-antigens. The major T-cell subset distribution was analyzed in vivo and in vitro after stimulation of mononuclear cells with TGEV (from mesenteric lymph nodes of group 3 inoculated with TGEV-recombinant proteins). Induction of active immunity was assessed by challenge of pigs with virulent TGEV at 27 days of age. Baculovirus-expressed TGEV proteins coadministered with LT-R192G in IFA induced mesenteric lymph node immune responses associated with IgA-antibodies to TGEV and partial protection against TGEV-challenge. The high titers of serum IgG- and virus-neutralizing-antibodies to TGEV in group 3 pigs most likely reflected the dose of TGEV S-protein administered. At the day of TGEV-challenge, the in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of group 3 pigs with inactivated TGEV resulted in an increase in double positive (CD4+CD8+), natural killer (CD2+CD4−CD8+dim) and cytotoxic (CD2+CD4−CD8+bright) T-cell phenotypes, accompanied by increased expression of interleukin-2 receptor and a decrease of the null (CD2−CD4−CD8−/SW6+) cell phenotype.","Sestak, K.; Meister, R.K.; Hayes, J.R.; Kim, L.; Lewis, P.A.; Myers, G.; Saif, L.J.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507362/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242799000744; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242799000744,268

The theoretical underpinning of this relationship is multifaceted, but a new and growing field of empirical literature strongly suggests communities that voted for the losing presidential candidate may experience decreased physical and mental health under the leadership of the winning candidate. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the relationship between mortality rates and community support for the losing presidential candidate (partisan loss). METHODS: Mortality data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and election results at the county level were used across a suite of county-year fixed-effects models to estimate the effect of election outcomes on mortality rates for the years 1999–2017. RESULTS: Mortality rates were positively associated with partisan loss. Results suggest mortality rates increase by as much as 3% in extremely partisan counties following presidential election losses.

Due to the rampant rise in the number of cases in China and globally, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The disease is transmitted via respiratory droplets of infected patients during coughing or sneezing and affects primarily the lung parenchyma. The spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in COVID-19 patients ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease resulting in mortality. Although respiratory involvement is most common in COVID-19 patients, the virus can affect other organ systems as well. The systemic inflammation induced by the disease along with multisystem expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor which allows viral entry into cells, explains the manifestation of extra-pulmonary symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, renal, musculoskeletal, and endocrine system. Here, we have reviewed the extensive literature available on COVID-19 about various clinical presentations based on the organ system involved as well as clinical presentation in specific population including children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients. We have also briefly discussed about the Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome occurring in children and adults with COVID-19. Understanding the various clinical presentations can help clinicians diagnose COVID-19 in an early stage and ensure appropriate measures to be undertaken in order to prevent further spread of the disease.","Mehta, Om Prakash; Bhandari, Parshal; Raut, Akshay; Kacimi, Salah Eddine Oussama; Huy, Nguyen Tien",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520910/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.582932,268

Many patients present with a remarkable disconnect in rest between profound hypoxemia yet without proportional signs of respiratory distress (i.e. happy hypoxemia) and rapid deterioration can occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with the experience of physicians usually treating critically ill patients in respiratory failure and ensuring timely referral to the intensive care unit can, therefore, be challenging. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological determinants of respiratory drive and hypoxemia may promote a more complete comprehension of a patient’s clinical presentation and management. Preserved oxygen saturation despite low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood samples occur, due to leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve induced by hypoxemia-driven hyperventilation as well as possible direct viral interactions with hemoglobin. Ventilation-perfusion mismatch, ranging from shunts to alveolar dead space ventilation, is the central hallmark and offers various therapeutic targets.","Dhont, Sebastiaan; Derom, Eric; Van Braeckel, Eva; Depuydt, Pieter; Lambrecht, Bart N.",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723327/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-020-01462-5,268

Their 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which catalyzes the proteolytic processing of the polyproteins for viral replication, is a potential target for anti-coronaviral infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we profiled the substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from human CoV NL63 (group 1), human CoV OC43 (group 2a), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (group 2b) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (group 3), by measuring their activity against a substrate library of 19×8 of variants with single substitutions at P5 to P3' positions. The results were correlated with structural properties like side chain volume, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensities of substituting residues. All 3CL(pro) prefer Gln at P1 position, Leu at P2 position, basic residues at P3 position, small hydrophobic residues at P4 position, and small residues at P1' and P2' positions. Despite 3CL(pro) from different groups of CoVs share many similarities in substrate specificities, differences in substrate specificities were observed at P4 positions, with IBV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Pro and SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) prefers P4-Val. By combining the most favorable residues at P3 to P5 positions, we identified super-active substrate sequences ‘VARLQ↓SGF’ that can be cleaved efficiently by all 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 1.7 to 3.2, and ‘VPRLQ↓SGF’ that can be cleaved specifically by IBV 3CL(pro) with relative activity of 4.3. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The comprehensive substrate specificities of 3CL(pro) from each of the group 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 CoVs have been profiled in this study, which may provide insights into a rational design of broad-spectrum peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting the proteases.","Chuck, Chi-Pang; Chow, Hak-Fun; Wan, David Chi-Cheong; Wong, Kam-Bo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22073294/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0027228,268

Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibit potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. Both compounds actively inhibit virus replication within infected cells as reduced virus progeny production was observed when the compound was added at post-inoculation conditions. Without replenishment of the compound, antiviral activity was observed up to roughly 5 rounds of replication, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of these compounds. Collectively, our data indicate that resveratrol and pterostilbene are promising antiviral compounds to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of retrospective and concurrent data on MVPA/MSA pre- and post-Covid-19 (until 14th June 2020) among 2,657 UK adults. The associations between socio-demographic and health characteristics, MVPA/MSA pre-Covid-19, living and exercise conditions and meeting WHO recommended levels for MVPA/MSA/both (vs meeting neither), and changes in MVPA/MSA from pre- to post-Covid-19 following stratification for pre-Covid-19 MVPA/MSA levels were evaluated. Results: A third of adults maintained (30.4%), decreased (36.2%) or increased (33.4%) their MVPA levels post-Covid-19. For MSA, the percentages were 61.6%, 18.2%, and 20.2%, respectively.

669744,Haematological parameters in severe acute respiratory syndrome,2005-02-01,"PURPOSE: Rubbing the hands with alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) is globally recommended as the preferred approach to prevent healthcare-associated infections in most routine encounters with patients, except in cases handwashing with soap and water is advised. Inappropriate utilization of ABHR could have detrimental effects, most importantly during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which include exposure of healthcare professionals to healthcare-associated infections and the development of resistant microorganisms. In a hospital setting, the utilization of ABHR among frontline healthcare workers including pharmacy professionals is low. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the current practice of hand rubbing among pharmacy professionals in public hospitals of Addis Ababa during the pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire conducted among pharmacy professionals in public hospitals found in Addis Ababa from 10th May to 9th June, 2020 to recognize ABHR utilization rate. Data were collected on a sample of 384 pharmacy professional by a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis was done using software for the statistical package for social science version 25.0. To identify the significant predictors of ABHR utilization practice bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were carried out. Crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated to determine the predictors. RESULTS: Out of 384 participants, three hundred and four participants were included in the final analyses after the exclusion of incomplete responses. Female participants represented 41.4% of the study participants. More than half (58.9%) of the pharmacy professionals had sufficient knowledge on ABHR utilization for COVID-19 prevention. Similarly, 56.6% of pharmacy professionals had positive attitude towards ABHR for COVID-19 prevention. But only 35.9% of the study participants had good ABHR utilization practice. CONCLUSION: Despite the modest level of knowledge and attitude towards ABHR, pharmacy professionals’ utilization practice of ABHR for COVID-19 prevention was found to be suboptimal. Provision of ABHR solutions through hospitals and increasing the awareness of pharmacy professionals on ABHR needs to be encouraged.","Baye, Assefa Mulu; Ababu, Andualem; Bayisa, Regasa; Abdella, Mahdi; Diriba, Edessa; Wale, Minychel; Selam, Muluken Nigatu",Drug Healthc Patient Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623439/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dhps.s295599,268

In addition to playing an important role in suppressing transmission, NPIs influence pathogen evolution by mediating mutation supply and altering the strength of selection for novel variants. However, it is unclear how NPIs might affect the emergence of novel variants of concern that are able to escape pre-existing immunity (partially or fully), are more transmissible, or cause greater mortality. Here, we analyse a stochastic two-strain epidemiological model to determine how the strength of NPIs affects the emergence of variants with similar or contrasting life-history characteristics to the wildtype. We show that, while stronger and timelier NPIs generally reduce the likelihood of variant emergence, it is possible for more transmissible variants with high cross immunity to have a greater probability of emerging at intermediate levels of NPIs. However, since one cannot predict the characteristics of a variant, the best strategy to prevent emergence is likely to be implementation of strong, timely NPIs.","Ashby, B.; Thompson, R.

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 15E2) against the IBV M protein was prepared and a series of 14 partially-overlapping fragments of the IBV M gene were expressed with a GST tag. These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using MAb 15E2 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, (199)FATFVYAK(206), which was located at the C-terminus of the M protein, was identified by MAb 15E2. ELISA and western blotting also showed that this epitope could be recognized by IBV-positive serum from chicken. Given that 15E2 showed reactivity with the (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif, expressed as a GST fusion protein, in both western blotting and in an ELISA, we proposed that this motif represented a linear B-cell epitope of the M protein. The (199)FATFVYAK(206) motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 15E2 with several truncated peptides that were derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 15E2-defined epitope sequence with the sequences of other corona-viruses indicated that the epitope is well conserved among chicken and turkey coronaviruses.

675798,Inhalation of Nitric Oxide in the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: A Rescue Trial in Beijing,2004-11-15,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic implied a period of lockdown for the general population, increasing the risk to develop some physical or mental disorders. In fibromyalgia patients, these disorders are part of the large clinical picture of the syndrome. Fibromyalgia management is especially based on a regular practice of physical activity. Lockdown imposed a break in rhythms, requiring a restructuring of scheduling. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the experiences of fibromyalgia patients during COVID-19 lockdown using a qualitative analysis. Method: 19 patients (52 ± 9 years old) who completed a 3-month therapeutic education and/or supervised physical activity program were invited to participate (Fimouv study, Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04107948). A sociologist collected data by means of semi-structured interviews and analyzed them using thematic content analysis. Results: Lockdown exacerbated the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, but adjusting the rhythms of life to fluctuations of these symptoms allowed a better quality of life. Patients felt the lack of physical activity and 68% found alternatives to remain physically active. The reduction of social constraints allowed them to better contend with their pathology. Fibromyalgia stopped being a main priority. Conclusion: Lockdown was positively experienced by fibromyalgia patients. They linked the absence of physical activity with increased pain and fatigue. Nevertheless, reducing social constraints could be a key for fibromyalgia management, where symptoms seemed to take less space in everyday life.

However, the economic value of a shortened LOS is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate incremental costs per day of hospitalization for a patient with influenza or viral pneumonia, as a proxy for COVID-19; ICU costs associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) were also determined. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of claims-based data was conducted using the IBM MarketScan(®) Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Care and the Medicare Fee-for-Service claims databases for hospitalizations due to influenza/viral pneumonia between January 2018 and June 2019. Cases were stratified as uncomplicated hospitalizations or with ICU. Ordinary least squares regression, excluding LOS or costs exceeding the 99th percentile (base case), was used to estimate incremental costs per day; a sensitivity analysis included all qualified hospitalizations. Additional sensitivity analyses used weighting methodology. RESULTS: Among 6055 and 118,419 hospitalizations in the commercially insured and Medicare databases, respectively, 5958 and 116,552 hospitalizations, respectively, represented the base case. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional inpatient day were $2158 and $3900 in the commercial population for uncomplicated hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU, respectively, and $475 and $668, respectively in the Medicare population. Estimated incremental base case costs per additional ICU day were $5254 and $608 for Commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. Higher absolute costs were estimated in the sensitivity analysis on all qualified hospitalizations; the weighted sensitivity analyses generally showed that estimates were stable. Use of iMV increased costs by $35,482 and $13,101 in the commercial and Medicare populations, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incremental daily cost of a hospitalization is substantial for US patients with commercial insurance and for Medicare patients. These findings may help quantify the economic value of COVID-19 treatments that reduce LOS.","Wu, Ning; Kuznik, Andreas; Wang, Degang; Moretz, Chad; Xi, Ann; Kumar, Shambhavi; Hamilton, Laurie",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s280461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293840/,268

We hypothesized that using a 200 m fast walking test (200 mFWT) and telerehabilitation would create an effective alternative cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention that could improve cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants (n = 19, mean age 60.4 ± 9.6) of the 8-week intervention performed regular physical exercise at the target heart rate zone determined by calculations based on the 200 mFWT results. In our study, the participants were supervised using telerehabilitation. A total of 84% of participants completed the 8-week intervention. No adverse events were reported during telerehabilitation. The study participants noted a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in cardiorespiratory fitness expressed by an 8% reduction in the walking test time (Δ 8.8 ± 5.9 s). Home-based telerehabilitation based on 200 mFWT effectively increased the cardiorespiratory fitness in people with CHD with a low to moderate cardiovascular risk.

The current crisis has led to an urgent requirement to develop therapeutics. Even though a number of vaccines are available, alternative strategies targeting essential viral components are required as a back-up against the emergence of lethal viral variants. One such target is the main protease (Mpro) that plays an indispensible role in viral replication. The availability of over 270 Mpro X-ray structures in complex with inhibitors provides unique insights into ligand-protein interactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive comparison of all non-redundant ligand-binding sites available for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mpro. Extensive adaptive sampling has been used to explore conformational dynamics employing convolutional variational auto encoder-based deep learning, and investigates structural conservation of the ligand binding sites using Markov state models across β-coronavirus homologs. Our results indicate that not all ligand-binding sites are dynamically conserved despite high sequence and structural conservation across β-coronavirus homologs.

Its consequences on the well-being of individuals needs to be better understood. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of lockdown on the well-being of a general population and the factors associated with this potential impairment of well-being in a population that has been only lightly affected by COVID-19 such as in Reunion island, an overseas French department. METHODS: An online survey was proposed to the population of Reunion Island between the 35(th) and 54(th) days of lockdown relative to pre- and per-lockdown periods. Well-being was measured by the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index, with some questions about sleep habits (Pittsburgh questionnaire), weekly physical activity (IPAQ), health, and lifestyle. RESULTS: Four hundred volunteers answered the survey. They reported a 15.7% decrease in well-being (p<0.001), accompanied by increased anxiety (p<0.001), decreased weekly physical activity (p<0.001), delayed and poorer quality sleep (p<0.001).

We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. Methods We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. Results Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. Conclusions Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.","Vilches, Thomas N.; Zhang, Kevin; Van Exan, Robert; Langley, Joanne M.; Moghadas, Seyed M.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21003625?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33812742/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21003625; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.058,268

Multiple AdV serotypes with low cross-reactivity circulate in the human population, making the development of an effective vaccine very challenging. In the current study, we designed a cross-reactive AdV vaccine based on the T-cell epitopes conserved among various AdV serotypes, which were inserted into the genome of a licensed cold-adapted live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) backbone. We rescued two recombinant LAIV-AdV vaccines by inserting the selected AdV T-cell epitopes into the open reading frame of full-length NA and truncated the NS1 proteins of the H7N9 LAIV virus. We then tested the bivalent vaccines for their efficacy against influenza and human AdV5 in a mouse model. The vaccine viruses were attenuated in C57BL/6J mice and induced a strong influenza-specific antibody and cell-mediated immunity, fully protecting the mice against virulent influenza virus infection. The CD8 T-cell responses induced by both LAIV-AdV candidates were functional and efficiently killed the target cells loaded either with influenza NP(366) or AdV DBP(418) peptides. In addition, high levels of recall memory T cells targeted to an immunodominant H2(b)-restricted CD8 T-cell epitope were detected in the immunized mice after the AdV5 challenge, and the magnitude of these responses correlated with the level of protection against pulmonary pathology caused by the AdV5 infection.

Herein, we summarize this controversy and provide guidance on disclosure. RECENT FINDINGS: Neurodegeneration risk disclosure in iRBD is controversial because of a long latency to disease onset and a lack of preventative strategies. Balancing the relevant ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and autonomy is challenging. Although there are few data on disclosure in iRBD, evidence from discussing risk in other diseases with dementia provides some guidance. SUMMARY: We provide an approach to risk disclosure for patients with iRBD. Patients should be asked if they want to know about future risks. If so, disclosure should be patient centered, focusing on what might happen. Discussion should occur early to give patients time to prepare for the future and consider participating in research.","Malkani, Roneil G.; Wenger, Neil S.",Curr Sleep Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336551/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40675-021-00206-1,268
