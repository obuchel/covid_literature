133,133,133,Role of receptor polymorphism and glycosylation in syncytium induction and host range variation of ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses,11.602574,4.8128,2008-01-10,"BACKGROUND: We previously identified unusual variants of Moloney and Friend ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses that have altered host range and are cytopathic in cells of the wild mouse species Mus dunni. Cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction: S82F in the Moloney variant Spl574, and S84A in the Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV. Because M. dunni cells carry a variant CAT-1 cell surface virus receptor (dCAT-1), we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range. RESULTS: We expressed dCAT-1 or mCAT-1 of NIH 3T3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic MLVs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus-induced syncytium formation. The dCAT-1 transfectants, but not the mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity, and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. The dCAT-1 transfectants, however, did not also reproduce the relative resistance of M. dunni cells to Moloney MLV, and the mCAT-1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. Western analysis, use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell-specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry. CONCLUSION: Virus entry and virus-induced syncytium formation using the CAT-1 receptor are mediated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in receptor and virus Env. Virus entry is modulated by glycosylation of cellular proteins, and this effect is cell and virus-specific.","Yan, Yuhe; Jung, Yong T; Wu, Tiyun; Kozak, Christine A",Retrovirology,85,1

Pregnancy-specific VSA (VSA(PAM)), which include the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA, are targets of IgG-mediated protective immunity to PAM. Here, we report an investigation of the specificity of naturally acquired immunity to PAM, using eight human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies that react exclusively with intact CSA-adhering IEs expressing VSA(PAM). Four reacted in Western blotting with high-molecular-weight (> 200 kDa) proteins, while seven reacted with either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-ε domains of VAR2CSA expressed either as Baculovirus constructs or on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells. We used a panel of recombinant antigens representing DBL3-X domains from P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate B-cell epitope diversity among parasite isolates, and identified the binding site of one monoclonal antibody using a chimeric DBL3-X construct. Our findings show that there is a high-frequency memory response to VSA(PAM), indicating that VAR2CSA is a primary target of naturally acquired PAM-specific protective immunity, and demonstrate the value of human monoclonal antibodies and conformationally intact recombinant antigens in VSA characterization.","Barfod, Lea; Bernasconi, Nadia L; Dahlbäck, Madeleine; Jarrossay, David; Andersen, Pernille Haste; Salanti, Ali; Ofori, Michael F; Turner, Louise; Resende, Mafalda; Nielsen, Morten A; Theander, Thor G; Sallusto, Federica; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Hviid, Lars",Mol Microbiol,85,11
428,428,428,Adaptive Contact Networks Change Effective Disease Infectiousness and Dynamics,11.9443655,4.8041635,2010-08-19,"Human societies are organized in complex webs that are constantly reshaped by a social dynamic which is influenced by the information individuals have about others. Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual's health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here – SI, SIS and SIR – the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).","Van Segbroeck, Sven; Santos, Francisco C.; Pacheco, Jorge M.",PLoS Comput Biol,85,17
813,813,813,Quantifying Type-Specific Reproduction Numbers for Nosocomial Pathogens: Evidence for Heightened Transmission of an Asian Sequence Type 239 MRSA Clone,11.960772,4.9204793,2012-04-12,"An important determinant of a pathogen's success is the rate at which it is transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts. Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","Cooper, Ben S.; Kypraios, Theodore; Batra, Rahul; Wyncoll, Duncan; Tosas, Olga; Edgeworth, Jonathan D.",PLoS Comput Biol,85,1
1087,1087,1087,Exploratory Analysis of Methods for Automated Classification of Laboratory Test Orders into Syndromic Groups in Veterinary Medicine,11.8678875,4.838187,2013-03-07,"BACKGROUND: Recent focus on earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human and animal populations has led to the development of surveillance systems based on automated monitoring of health data. Real- or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes–syndromic surveillance–using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. METHODS: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. RESULTS: High performance (F(1)-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F(1-macro)), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Naïve Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F(1-micro) = 0.994 and F(1-macro) = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. CONCLUSION: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.","Dórea, Fernanda C.; Muckle, C.

1135,1135,1135,Inference of R (0) and Transmission Heterogeneity from the Size Distribution of Stuttering Chains,11.96954,4.6603723,2013-05-02,"For many infectious disease processes such as emerging zoonoses and vaccine-preventable diseases, [Image: see text] and infections occur as self-limited stuttering transmission chains. A mechanistic understanding of transmission is essential for characterizing the risk of emerging diseases and monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics. Thus methods for inferring [Image: see text] and the degree of heterogeneity in transmission from stuttering chain data have important applications in disease surveillance and management. Previous researchers have used chain size distributions to infer [Image: see text], but estimation of the degree of individual-level variation in infectiousness (as quantified by the dispersion parameter, [Image: see text]) has typically required contact tracing data. Utilizing branching process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to chain size data to infer both [Image: see text] and the dispersion parameter that characterizes heterogeneity. While the maximum likelihood value for [Image: see text] is a simple function of the average chain size, the associated confidence intervals are dependent on the inferred degree of transmission heterogeneity. As demonstrated for monkeypox data from the Democratic Republic of Congo, this impacts when a statistically significant change in [Image: see text] is detectable. In addition, by allowing for superspreading events, inference of [Image: see text] shifts the threshold above which a transmission chain should be considered anomalously large for a given value of [Image: see text] (thus reducing the probability of false alarms about pathogen adaptation). Our analysis of monkeypox also clarifies the various ways that imperfect observation can impact inference of transmission parameters, and highlights the need to quantitatively evaluate whether observation is likely to significantly bias results.","Blumberg, Seth; Lloyd-Smith, James O.",PLoS Comput Biol,85,1
1216,1216,1216,The role of pattern recognition receptors in intestinal inflammation,11.945634,4.865834,2013-03-20,"Recognition of microorganisms by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) is the primary component of innate immunity that is responsible for the maintenance of host–microbial interactions in intestinal mucosa. Dysregulation in host–commensal interactions has been implicated as the central pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which predisposes to developing colorectal cancer. Recent animal studies have begun to outline some unique physiology and pathology involving each PRR signaling in the intestine. The major roles played by PRRs in the gut appear to be the regulation of the number and the composition of commensal bacteria, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal permeability in response to epithelial injury. In addition, PRR signaling in lamina propria immune cells may be involved in induction of inflammation in response to invasion of pathogens. Because some PRR-deficient mice have shown variable susceptibility to colitis, the outcome of intestinal inflammation may be modified depending on PRR signaling in epithelial cells, immune cells, and the composition of commensal flora. Through recent findings in animal models of IBD, this review will discuss how abnormal PRR signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis in the intestine.

These are referred to as “unknowns,"" and reflect the vast unexplored microbial sequence space of our biosphere, also known as “biological dark matter."" However, unknowns also exist because metagenomic datasets are not optimally mined. There is a pressure on researchers to publish and move on, and the unknown sequences are often left for what they are, and conclusions drawn based on reads with annotated homologs. This can cause abundant and widespread genomes to be overlooked, such as the recently discovered human gut bacteriophage crAssphage. The unknowns may be enriched for bacteriophage sequences, the most abundant and genetically diverse component of the biosphere and of sequence space. However, it remains an open question, what is the actual size of biological sequence space? The de novo assembly of shotgun metagenomes is the most powerful tool to address this question.","Dutilh, Bas E",Bacteriophage,85,1
2570,2570,2570,Inference of Transmission Network Structure from HIV Phylogenetic Trees,11.760042,5.022882,2017-01-13,"Phylogenetic inference is an attractive means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.","Giardina, Federica; Romero-Severson, Ethan Obie; Albert, Jan; Britton, Tom; Leitner, Thomas",PLoS Comput Biol,85,1

Since macrophages play an essential role in controlling Salmonella infection, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on immune function of chicken HD11 macrophages. METHODS: Chicken HD11 macrophages were treated with GA (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 μg/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500 ng/ml) for 3, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h. Evaluated responses included phagocytosis, bacteria-killing, gene expression of cell surface molecules (cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), CD80, CD83, and CD197) and antimicrobial effectors (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX-1), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α factor (LITAF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10), and production of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). RESULTS: GA increased the internalization of both fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran and ST by HD11 cells and markedly decreased the intracellular survival of ST. We found that the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell surface molecules (CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD197) and cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10) of HD11 cells was up-regulated following GA exposure. The expression of iNOS and NOX-1 was induced by GA and thereby the productions of NO and H(2)O(2) in HD11 cells were enhanced. Notably, it was verified that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways were responsible for GA-induced synthesis of NO and IFN-γ gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggested that GA exhibits a potent immune regulatory effect to activate chicken macrophages and enhances Salmonella-killing capacity.

3859,3859,3859,iProt-Sub: a comprehensive package for accurately mapping and predicting protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites,11.929927,6.875791,2018-04-19,"Regulation of proteolysis plays a critical role in a myriad of important cellular processes. The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.","Song, Jiangning; Wang, Yanan; Li, Fuyi; Akutsu, Tatsuya; Rawlings, Neil D; Webb, Geoffrey I; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Brief Bioinform,85,1

In this study, the full-length sequences of two KAA isoforms, KAA-1 and KAA-2, were elucidated by a combination of peptide mapping and complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning. They consisted of four internal tandem-repeated domains, which are conserved in high-mannose specific lectins from lower organisms, including a cyanobacterium Oscillatoria agardhii and a red alga Eucheuma serra. Using an Escherichia coli expression system, an active recombinant form of KAA-1 (His-tagged rKAA-1) was successfully generated in the yield of 115 mg per liter of culture. In a detailed oligosaccharide binding analysis by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method with 27 pyridylaminated oligosaccharides, His-tagged rKAA-1 and rKAA-1 specifically bound to high-mannose N-glycans with an exposed α1-3 mannose in the D2 arm as the native lectin did. Predicted from oligosaccharide binding specificity, a surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the recombinants exhibit strong interaction with gp120, a heavily glycosylated envelope glycoprotein of HIV with high association constants (1.48 − 1.61 × 10(9) M(−1)). Native KAAs and the recombinants inhibited the HIV-1 entry at IC(50)s of low nanomolar levels (7.3–12.9 nM). Thus, the recombinant proteins would be useful as antiviral reagents targeting the viral surface glycoproteins with high-mannose N-glycans, and the cultivated alga K. alvarezii could also be a good source of not only carrageenans but also this functional lectin(s).","Hirayama, Makoto; Shibata, Hiromi; Imamura, Koji; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Hori, Kanji",Mar Biotechnol (NY),85,28

DESIGN: Single-center study with 19 patients, followed by a multicenter randomized comparison of surfactant with a standardized treatment algorithm. Primary endpoint PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 48 h, secondary endpoints: PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 2, 4, 12, and 24 h, survival, survival without rescue, days on ventilator, subgroups analyzed by analysis of variance to identify patients who might benefit from surfactant SETTING: Multicenter study in 19 reference centers for ARDS. PATIENTS: Children after the 44th postconceptional week and under 14 years old, admitted for at least 4 h, ventilated for 12–120 h, and without heart failure or chronic lung disease. In the multicenter study 35 patients were recruited; 20 were randomized to the surfactant group and 15 to the nonsurfactant group. Decreasing recruitment of patients led to a preliminary end of this study. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 100 mg/kg bovine surfactant intratracheally under continuous ventilation and PEEP, as soon as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio dropped to less than 100 for 2 h (in the pilot study increments of 50 mg/kg as long as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) did not increase by 20%). A second equivalent dose within 48 h was permitted. RESULTS: In the pilot study the PaO(2)/FIO(2) increased by a mean of 100 at 48 h (n=19). A higher PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was observed in the surfactant group 2 h after the first dose (58 from baseline vs. 9), at 48 h there was a trend towards a higher ratio (38 from baseline vs. 22).

While there are subtle cell type differences in Golgi enzyme subcompartmentation, in general, glycosylation enzymes are localized within the Golgi cisternae in the same sequence in which they act to modify oligosaccharide substrates. The possibility that this enzyme subcompartmentation may control the types of oligosaccharides expressed by a cell has led to an interest in the signals and mechanisms directing enzyme localization in the Golgi cisternae. All glycosidases and glycosyltransferases characterized thus far have very little sequence homology that might suggest a common Golgi retention signal, but they do share a similar domain structure. They are all type II transmembrane proteins consisting of an amino terminal cytoplasmic tail, a signal anchor transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large luminal catalytic domain. Their lack of sequence homology suggests that these proteins' Golgi retention signals are not linear amino acid sequences, but most likely involve general characteristics or conformations of larger protein domains. The peptide sequences required for Golgi retention of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAcTI), (β1,4-galactosyltrans- ferase (GalT) and α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) have been extensively studied. To do this, researchers created mutant and chimeric proteins, expressed these in tissue culture cells, and localized these proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy or immunoelectron microscopy. The cell surface expression of deletion mutants suggested that the deleted sequences were necessary for Golgi retention. Then, if these sequences were fused to a non-Golgi reporter protein and this chimeric or hybrid protein was retained in the Golgi, then these sequences were also sufficient for Golgi retention. Due to differences in reporter proteins used to construct these chimeric proteins, different cell types used for protein expression, different levels of protein expression, and different methods of cell surface protein detection, these experiments have led to somewhat confusing results. However, in general, it appears that the GalT relies primarily on its transmembrane domain for Golgi retention, while the GlcNAcTI and ST have requirements for their transmembrane regions, sequences flanking these regions, and luminal stem sequences. Based on these results, two potential Golgi retention mechanisms have been proposed and are now being tested. The observation that glycosyltransferase transmembrane domains are frequently sufficient for Golgi retention has led to the first of these models, the bilayer thickness model. This model proposes that the shorter transmembrane domains of Golgi proteins prevent them from entering cholesterol-rich transport vesicles destined for the plasma membrane,.and that this leads to Golgi retention. The second of these models is supported by the role of multiple protein domains in the Golgi retention of some proteins. This model, the oligomerization/kin recognition model of Golgi retention, proposes that the formation of insoluble protein homo-oligomers or very large hetero-oligomers prevents protein movement into transport vesicles destined for later compartments. Initial work suggests that the bilayer thickness mechanism may play a role in the retention of some Golgi retained proteins; however, it is not the sole retention mechanism. Other evidence suggests that an oligomerization/kin recognition mechanism may be more common, but definitive proof for its general use in Golgi protein retention is lacking. More research is required to further elucidate the sequences and particularly the mechanisms of Golgi retention. In the future, we hope to be able to explain the cell type differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation, the different sequence requirements for the Golgi retention of the same enzyme in various cell types, and whether differences in glycosylation enzyme Golgi subcompartmentation change the types of oligosaccharides made by a cell.","Colley, Karen J.",Glycobiology,85,33

Encephalitis is the most frequent manifestation, but cases of meningitis, myelitis, and polyradiculitis, as well as many other symptoms (e.g., coma, ataxia, psychosis, and stroke), have been reported. The onset of these manifestations is usually acute, with lowered consciousness, convulsions, pareses, and other neurological signs. Severe, even fatal, cases are known. The pathophysiology of CNS manifestations is unknown. To our knowledge, M. pneumoniae has never been isolated from brain tissue, but instead it has been recovered from CSF specimens in at least seven cases. Besides direct invasion of M. pneumoniae into the brain, neurotoxic or autoimmune reaction within the brain tissue is suspected. At neuropathological examination, edema, demyelination, and microthrombi have been described.

Vehicles used for nasal siRNA delivery include established as well as novel reagents, many of which have been recently optimized. In general, they all promote significant uptake of siRNA into the lower respiratory tract, including the lung. When properly designed and optimized, these siRNAs offer significant protection against respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nasally administered siRNA remains within the lung and does not access systemic blood flow, as judged by its absence in other major organs such as liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Adverse immune reaction is generally not encountered, especially when immunogenic and/or off-target siRNA sequences and toxic vehicles are avoided. In fact, siRNA against RSV has entered Phase II clinical trials in human with promising results. Here, we provide a standardized procedure for using the nose as a specific route for siRNA delivery into the lung of laboratory animals. It should be clear that this simple and efficient system has enormous potential for therapeutics.","Barik, Sailen",Antiviral RNAi,85,31

In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc(3)Man(8,9)(GIcNAc)(2) and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein. The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man(9)(GIcNAc)(2). However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures. When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles. In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes. These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM. The results confirm the essential role of glucose trimming in the Sindbis virus-BHK cell system and suggest that the initial stages of mannose removal maybe important too.","McDowell, William; Romero, Pedro A.; Datema, Roelf; Schwarz, Ralph T.",Virology,85,1

White attributed to a constraint in spiders, namely their proximal chiasma localization acting to upset meiotic segregation in males with fusions. Of the 75 taxa of Habronattus and outgroups studied, 47 have X(1)X(2)0 sex chromosomes in males, 10 have X(1)X(2)Y, 15 have X(1)X(2)X(3)Y, 2 have X0, and one has both X(1)X(2)0 and X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Chromosome numbers and behavior suggest neo‐Ys formed by an autosome‐X fusion to make X(1)X(2)Y, with a second fusion to an autosome to make X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Phylogeny shows at least 8–15 gains (or possibly some losses) of neo‐Y (i.e., X‐autosome fusions), a remarkable number for such a small clade. In contrast to the many X‐autosome fusions, at most one autosome–autosome fusion is indicated. Origins of neo‐Y are correlated significantly with distal localization of chiasmata, supporting White's hypothesis that evolution of neo‐Y systems is facilitated by looser pairing (distal chiasmata) at meiosis. However, an alternative (or contributing) explanation for the correlation is that X‐autosome fusions were selected to permit isolation of male‐favored alleles to the neo‐Y chromosome, aided by distal chiasmata limiting recombination. This intralocus sexual conflict hypothesis could explain both the many X‐autosome fusions, and the stunning complexity of male Habronattus courtship displays.","Maddison, Wayne P.; Leduc‐Robert, Geneviève",Evolution,85,1

The whole procedure is very simple and rapid wherein the amplification can be completed in less than 1 h under isothermal conditions employing a set of six specially designed primers spanning eight distinct sequences of a target gene, by incubating all the reagents in a single tube. Gene amplification products can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis as well as by real‐time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter. Gene copy number can also be quantified with the help of a standard curve generated from different concentrations of gene copy number plotted against time of positivity with the help of a real‐time turbidimeter. Alternatively, gene amplification can be visualised by the naked eye either as turbidity or in the form of a colour change when SYBR Green I, a fluorescent dsDNA intercalating dye, is employed. LAMP does not require a thermal cycler and can be performed simply with a heating block and/or water bath. Considering the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation and easy detection, LAMP has potential applications for clinical diagnosis as well as surveillance of infectious diseases in developing countries without requiring sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel.

The development of a ZnO nanorod integrated microdevice as a multiplex immunofluorescence platform for highly sensitive and selective detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) is described. The 3D morphology and unique optical property of the ZnO nanorods boost the detection limit of the H5N2 AIV to as low as 3.6 × 10(3) EID(50) mL(−1) (EID(50): 50% embryo infectious dose), which is ≈22 times more sensitive than conventional enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. The entire virus capture and detection process could be completed within 1.5 h with excellent selectivity. Moreover, this microfluidic biosensor is capable of detecting multiple viruses simultaneously by spatial encoding of capture antibodies. One prominent feature of the device is that the captured H5N2 AIV can be released by simply dissolving ZnO nanorods under slightly acidic environment for subsequent off‐chip analyses. As a whole, this platform provides a powerful tool for rapid detection of multiple pathogens, which may extent to the other fields for low‐cost and convenient biomarker detection.","Yu, Xu; Xia, Yiqiu; Tang, Yi; Zhang, Wen‐Long; Yeh, Yin‐Ting; Lu, Huaguang; Zheng, Si‐Yang",Small,85,22

Infection with the naturally attenuated OURT88/3 strain induces protection against challenge with virulent isolates from the same or closely related genotypes. However, adverse clinical signs following immunisation have been observed. Here, we attempted to increase the OURT88/3 safety profile by deleting I329L, a gene previously shown to inhibit the host innate immune response. The resulting virus, OURT88/3ΔI329L, was tested in vitro to evaluate the replication and expression of type I interferon (IFN) and in vivo by immunisation and lethal challenge experiments in pigs. No differences were observed regarding replication; however, increased amounts of both IFN-β and IFN-α were observed in macrophages infected with the deletion mutant virus. Unexpectedly, the deletion of I329L markedly reduced protection against challenge with the virulent OURT88/1 isolate. This was associated with a decrease in both antibody levels against VP72 and the number of IFN-γ-producing cells in the blood of non-protected animals. Furthermore, a significant increase in IL-10 levels in serum was observed in pigs immunised with OURT88/3ΔI329L following challenge.

Despite new diagnostic developments, most pneumonia cases continue to be difficult to diagnose clinically, partly due to acquired antibiotic resistance and the lack of a ‘gold standard’ method of diagnosis. In other words, the lack of a rapid, accurate diagnostic test, as well as the uncertainty of the initial etiologic diagnosis and the risk stratification, results in empirical antibiotic treatments. There are significant changes in the aetiology of patients with ventilator associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), which are characterised by a higher incidence of multi drug resistant organisms. Evidence suggests that when patients with VA-LRTI develop organ failure, the associated mortality can be exceptionally high with frequent complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and septic shock. Appropriate antibiotic treatments must consider that the present cardiovascular failure seen in patients has a different association with the patient’s mortality. Unlike patients with less severe clinical presentations, who have a higher chance of survival when the appropriate antibiotics are administered promptly, for patients with a severe subtype of the disease, the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment will impact the patient’s outcome to a lesser extent. The present review highlights certain factors detectable at the time of admission that could indicate patients who are at a high risk of bacteraemia and who, therefore, merit more intense therapy and stratified care.","Martin-Loeches, Ignacio",Antibiotics (Basel),85,1

Our aim was to examine whether more favorable preoperative expectations of psychosocial outcomes predict weight loss in the first year after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and whether postoperative satisfaction with these outcomes predicts weight maintenance in the second year after the operation. METHODS: Six months before and 1 year after surgery, the “Obesity Psychosocial State Questionnaire” was filled out by 91 patients (77 female, 14 male, mean age 45 ± 9 years, mean preoperative body mass index 47 ± 6 kg/m(2)). We evaluated the preoperative outcome expectations and the postoperative satisfaction for the seven domains of psychosocial and physical functioning of this questionnaire, as well as the correlations between these scores and both weight loss and weight maintenance. RESULTS: Patients showed high satisfaction with psychosocial outcomes after LAGB in all seven domains (p < 0.001), even though the improvement was less than expected in five of the domains (p ≤ 0.01). While weight loss 1 year after the operation was related to satisfaction with psychosocial outcomes (p ≤ 0.05), preoperative expectations were not related to weight loss in the first year after surgery, and satisfaction with the outcomes was not related to weight maintenance in the second year after surgery. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that surgically induced effects of weight loss and weight maintenance are achieved independently of the patient’s preoperative expectations of and postoperative satisfaction with the psychosocial outcomes.","Zijlstra, Hanna; Larsen, Junilla K.; de Ridder, Denise T.

By setting up Health Telescope, we aim to (1) understand more about the long-term use of eHealth apps in an externally valid setting, (2) understand the relationships between short-term and long-term outcomes of the usage of eHealth apps, and (3) test different ways in which eHealth app allocation can be personalized. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to (1) demonstrate and motivate the validity of the many choices that we made in setting up an intensive longitudinal study, (2) provide a resource for researchers interested in using data generated by our study, and (3) act as a guideline for researchers interested in setting up their own longitudinal data collection using wearable devices. For the third objective, we explicitly discuss the General Data Protection Regulation and ethical requirements that need to be addressed. METHODS: In this 4-month study, a group of approximately 450 participants will have their daily step count measured and will be asked daily about their mood using experience sampling. Once per month, participants will receive an intervention containing a recommendation to download an app that focuses on increasing physical activity. The mechanism for assigning recommendations to participants will be personalized over time, using contextual data obtained from previous interventions.

This study combined biofilm assays and molecular techniques to demonstrate that N. europaea makes very little biofilm on its own, and relies on the activity of associated heterotrophic bacteria to establish a biofilm. However, N. europaea has a vital role in the proliferation of mixed-species communities under carbon-limited conditions, such as in drinking water distribution systems, through the provision of organic carbon via ammonia oxidation. Results show that the addition of nitrification inhibitors to mixed-species nitrifying cultures under carbon-limited conditions disrupted biofilm formation and caused the dispersal of pre-formed biofilms. This dispersal effect was not observed when an organic carbon source, glucose, was included in the medium. Interestingly, inhibition of nitrification activity of these mixed-species biofilms in the presence of added glucose resulted in increased total biofilm formation compared to controls without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, or with only glucose added. This suggests that active AOB partially suppress or limit the overall growth of the heterotrophic bacteria. The experimental model developed here provides evidence that ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) are involved in both the formation and maintenance of multi-species biofilm communities. The results demonstrate that the activity of the AOB not only support the growth and biofilm formation of heterotrophic bacteria by providing organic carbon, but also restrict and limit total biomass in mixed community systems.","Keshvardoust, Pejhman; Huron, Vanessa A.

AIM: To describe the experience and perceived needs of stroke survivors, their caregivers and CHWs in a context with limited access to and support from formal rehabilitation services. SETTING: The Breede Valley subdistrict, Western Cape, South Africa, a rural, less resourced setting. METHODS: A descriptive exploratory qualitative study. Four focus group interviews were held with purposively selected stroke survivors and caregivers and four with CHWs. A thematic approach and the framework method were used to analyse the transcripts. FINDINGS: A total of 41 CHWs, 21 caregivers and 26 stroke survivors participated. Four main themes and 11 sub-themes were identified. Because of the lack of knowledge, training and rehabilitation services, the main theme for all groups was having to ‘figure things out’ independently, with incontinence management being particularly challenging. Secondly was the need for emotional support for stroke survivors and caregivers. Thirdly, contextual factors such as architectural barriers and lack of assistive products negatively impacted care and function. Lastly, the organisation of health and rehabilitation services negatively impacted home-based services and professional support.

Agreement between the quantitative and semi quantitative methods was assessed via the kappa statistic test. Pathogen yield between the two methods was compared using Pearson’s chi-square test. RESULTS: The quantitative and semi-quantitative methods yielded pathogens in 81 (45.5%) and 85 (47.8%) cases respectively. There was complete concordance of both techniques in 155 (87.1%) ETSA samples. No growth was observed in 45 (25.3%) ETSA specimens with quantitative culture and 37 (20.8%) cases by semi-quantitative culture. The diagnostic accuracy of both techniques were comparable; 64.6% for quantitative and 64.0% for semi-quantitative culture. The kappa agreement was found to be 0.84 (95% CI, 0.77–0.91) representing almost perfect agreement between the two methods. Although semi-quantitative cultures yielded more pathogens (47.8%) as compared to quantitative ETSA cultures (45.5%), the difference was only 2.3%. However, this difference achieved statistical (chi-square p-value < 0.001) favoring semi-quantitative culture methods over quantitative culture techniques for processing ETSA. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is a strong agreement between the performances of both methods of processing ETSA cultures in terms of accuracy of LRTI diagnosis. Semi-quantitative cultures of ETSA yielded more pathogens as compared to quantitative cultures. Although both techniques were comparable, we recommend processing of ETSA using semi-quantitative technique due to its ease and reduced processing time.","Rattani, Salima; Farooqi, Joveria; Jabeen, Ghazala; Chandio, Saeeda; Kash, Qaiser; Khan, Aijaz; Jabeen, Kauser",BMC Pulm Med,85,1

Cancer immunotherapy, by relying on this basic recognition method, boosts the antitumor efficacy of T cells by unleashing the inhibition of immune checkpoints and expands adaptive immunity by facilitating the adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells. T cells genetically equipped with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or TCRs have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating some hematological malignancies, although the efficacy of engineered T cells in treating solid tumors is far from satisfactory. In this review, we summarize the development of genetically engineered T cells, outline the most recent studies investigating genetically engineered T cells for cancer immunotherapy, and discuss strategies for improving the performance of these T cells in fighting cancers.","Li, Dan; Li, Xue; Zhou, Wei-Lin; Huang, Yong; Liang, Xiao; Jiang, Lin; Yang, Xiao; Sun, Jie; Li, Zonghai; Han, Wei-Dong; Wang, Wei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,85,13

Intrinsic host factors, such as age, can influence disease severity. Glycosylation plays a critical role in influenza pathogenesis; however, the molecular drivers of influenza outcomes remain unknown. In this work, we characterized the host glycomic response to the H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) as a function of age-dependent severity in a ferret model. Using our dual-color lectin microarray technology, we examined baseline glycosylation and glycomic response to infection in newly weaned and aged animals, models for young children and the elderly, respectively. Compared to adult uninfected ferrets, we observed higher levels of α-2,6-sialosides, the receptor for H1N1pdm09, in newly weaned and aged animals. We also observed age-dependent loss of O-linked α-2,3-sialosides. The loss of these highly charged groups may impact viral clearance by mucins, which corresponds to the lower clearance rates observed in aged animals. Upon infection, we observed dramatic changes in the glycomes of aged animals, a population severely impacted by the virus. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in the newly weaned animals, which show mild to moderate responses to the H1N1pdm09. High mannose, a glycan recently identified as a marker of severity in adult animals, increased with severity in the aged population. However, the response was delayed, in line with the delayed development of pneumonia observed. Overall, our results may help explain the differential susceptibility to influenza A infection and severity observed as a function of age.","Chen, Shuhui; Kasper, Brian; Zhang, Bin; Lashua, Lauren P.; Ross, Ted M.; Ghedin, Elodie; Mahal, Lara K.",J Proteome Res,85,1

METHODS: The National Center for Tumour Diseases (NCT) MOBILE trial was a monocentric open-label randomised controlled clinical trial of patients with solid tumours undergoing systemic cancer therapy with need of a follow-up visit with their consulting physician at outpatient clinics. 66 patients were 1:1 randomised to receive either a standard in-person follow-up visit at outpatient clinics or a video call via a mobile phone application. The primary outcome was feasibility defined as the proportion of patients successfully completing the first follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included success rate of further video calls, time spent by patient and physician, patient satisfaction and quality of physician–patient relationship. FINDINGS: Success rate of the first follow-up visit in the intention-to-treat cohort was 87.9% (29 of 33) for in-person visits and 78.8% (26 of 33) for video calls (relative risk: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.13, p=0.51). The most common reasons for failure were software incompatibility in the video call and no-show in the in-person visit arm. The success rate for further video visits was 91.7% (11 of 12). Standardised patient questionnaires showed significantly decreased total time spent and less direct costs for patients (Δmean −170.8 min, 95% CI −246 min to −95.5 min), p<0.0001; Δmean −€14.37, 95% CI −€23.9 to −€4.8, p<0.005) and comparable time spent for physicians in the video call arm (Δmean 0.5 min, 95% CI −5.4 min to 6.4 min, p=0.86). Physician–patient relationship quality mean scores assessed by a validated standardised questionnaire were higher in the video call arm (1.13-fold, p=0.02).

BACKGROUND: Few studies have connected the quality of work life with contributing and coexisting factors such as depression, anxiety and stress, but none to date in a Chinese health care setting. METHOD: A cross‐sectional survey of 950 registered Chinese nurses was employed. RESULTS: 299 of 861 participants (34.7%) were categorized into four of five professional quality of life risk profiles, consistent with the reflective risk assessment model. Significant differences were seen with large‐sized effects in the mean scores of stress, anxiety and depression among the participants, with participants of the very distressed profile having significantly higher mean scores in stress, anxiety and depression, followed by the at‐risk profile group. CONCLUSION: The reflective risk assessment model and professional quality of life five risk profiles are supported by this study. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The reflective risk assessment model can be used to detect risk factors for mental health in nurses and for the design of interventions that promote nurses’ mental health.","Li, Wendy Wen; West, Caryn; Xie, Guojun",J Nurs Manag,85,1

IgA-bacteria interactions are altered during inflammatory diseases, but how these interactions are shaped by bacterial, host, and environmental factors remains unclear. In this study, we utilized IgA-SEQ to profile IgA-bound fecal bacteria in 48 recurrent Clostridioides difficile patients before and after successful fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to gain further insight. Prior to FMT, Escherichia coli was the most highly IgA-targeted taxon; following restoration of the microbiota by FMT, highly IgA-targeted taxa included multiple Firmicutes species. Post-FMT IgA-targeting was unaffected by the route of FMT delivery (colonoscopy versus capsule), suggesting that both methods lead to the establishment of healthy immune–bacterial interactions in the gut. Interestingly, IgA-targeting in FMT recipients closely resembled the IgA-targeting patterns of the donors, and fecal donor identity was significantly associated with IgA-targeting of the recipient microbiota. These data support the concept that intrinsic bacterial properties drive IgA recognition across genetically distinct human hosts. Together, this study suggests that IgA-bacterial interactions are reestablished in human FMT recipients to resemble that of the healthy fecal donor.","Huus, Kelsey E; Frankowski, Marcin; Pučić-Baković, Maja; Vučković, Frano; Lauc, Gordan; Mullish, Benjamin H; Marchesi, Julian R; Monaghan, Tanya M; Kao, Dina; Finlay, B.

The INJECT study prospectively evaluated ocriplasmin in the setting of clinical practice. METHODS: INJECT was a Phase 4, multicenter, prospective observational study. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Assessments included nonsurgical VMT resolution, nonsurgical MH closure, best-corrected visual acuity, occurrence of vitrectomy, and adverse events. RESULTS: The efficacy population (N = 395) received an ocriplasmin injection and had optical coherence tomography–confirmed VMT at baseline. At Day 28, the rate of nonsurgical VMT resolution was 40.7% in the overall group, and the rate of nonsurgical MH closure was 36.0% in the VMT with MH group. At Month 12, the rate of ≥2-line best-corrected visual acuity gain (irrespective of vitrectomy) was 36.8% in the overall group and 59.6% in the VMT with MH group. The percentage of patients who underwent vitrectomy in the study eye was 29.1% in the overall group and 55.6% in the VMT with MH group. Photopsia (9.8%) and vitreous floaters (6.8%) were the most frequent adverse events. CONCLUSION: The INJECT study showed that ocriplasmin is effective in a clinical setting in patients with VMT, with or without MH. No new safety signals were identified from this large and surgeon-selected patient group, although the significant limitations of the study design without an image reading center and scheduled study visit timings should be noted.","Steel, David H.

In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General announced his commitment to eliminate cervical cancer, with HPV vaccination as a priority. However, the costs of setting up a multi-dose HPV vaccination programme remain a barrier to its introduction. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a randomised-controlled trial of reduced dose schedules of HPV vaccine in Tanzania to establish whether a single dose produces immune responses that will be effective in preventing cervical cancer. 930 girls aged 9–14 years in Mwanza, Tanzania, were randomised to one of 6 arms, comprising 3 different dose schedules of the 2-valent (Cervarix) and 9-valent (Gardasil-9) HPV vaccines: 3 doses; 2 doses given 6 months apart; or a single dose. All participants will be followed for 36 months; those in the 1 and 2 dose arms will be followed for 60 months. Trial outcomes focus on vaccine immune responses including HPV 16/18-specific antibody levels, antibody avidity, and memory B cell responses. Results will be immunobridged to historical cohorts of girls and young women in whom efficacy has been demonstrated. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised trial of the single dose HPV vaccine schedule in the target age group. The trial will allow us to examine the quality and durability of immune responses of reduced dose schedules in a population with high burden of malaria and other infections that may affect vaccine immune responses.

We combine theory and experiment to investigate this question in the zebrafish segmentation clock. We remove a Notch inhibitor, allowing resynchronization, and analyze embryonic segment recovery. We observe unexpected intermingling of normal and defective segments, and capture this with a new model combining coupled oscillators and tissue mechanics. Intermingled segments are explained in the theory by advection of persistent phase vortices of oscillators. Experimentally observed changes in recovery patterns are predicted in the theory by temporal changes in tissue length and cell advection pattern. Thus, segmental pattern recovery occurs at two length and time scales: rapid local synchronization between neighboring cells, and the slower transport of the resulting patterns across the tissue through morphogenesis.","Uriu, Koichiro; Liao, Bo-Kai; Oates, Andrew C; Morelli, Luis G",,85,22

Although epigenetic disorders are considered a sign of cell carcinogenesis and malignant events that affect tumor progression and drug resistance, in view of the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications, clinicians believe that associated mechanisms can be a key target for cancer prevention and treatment. In contrast, epidemiological and preclinical studies indicated that the epigenome is constantly reprogrammed by intake of natural organic compounds and the environment, suggesting the possibility of utilizing natural compounds to influence epigenetics in cancer therapy. Flavonoids, although not synthesized in the human body, can be consumed daily and are common in medicinal plants, vegetables, fruits, and tea.

While many chemical substances such as beta-lactam antibiotics can reach therapeutic levels in most parts throughout the human body after administration, substances of higher molecular weight such as therapeutic proteins may not be able to reach the site of action (e.g., an infection) and are therefore ineffective. In the case of therapeutic phages, i.e., viruses that infect microbes, to treat bacterial infections, this problem is exacerbated; not only are phages unable to penetrate tissues, but phage particles can be cleared by the immune system, and phage proteins are rapidly degraded by enzymes or inactivated by the low pH in the stomach. Yet, the use of therapeutic phages is a highly promising strategy, in particular for infections caused by bacteria that exhibit multidrug resistance. Clinicians increasingly encounter situations where no treatment options remain available for such infections where antibiotic compounds are ineffective. While the number of drug-resistant pathogens continues to rise due to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, no new compounds are becoming available, as many pharmaceutical companies discontinue their search for chemical antimicrobials. In recent years, phage therapy has undergone massive innovation for the treatment of infections caused by pathogens resistant to conventional antibiotics. While most therapeutic applications of phages are well described in the literature, other aspects of phage therapy are less well-documented. In this review, we focus on the issues that are critical for phage therapy to become a reliable standard therapy and describe methods for efficient and targeted delivery of phages, including their encapsulation.","Loh, Belinda; Gondil, Vijay Singh; Manohar, Prasanth; Khan, Fazal Mehmood; Yang, Hang; Leptihn, Sebastian",Appl Environ Microbiol,85,1

RESULTS: Ocular toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent infectious etiologies of posterior uveitis. It typically presents with retinochoroiditis. Setting an accurate diagnosis depends to a considerable degree on detecting characteristic clinical characteristics. In addition to the evaluation of clinical features, the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis relies at a large degree on serologic testing. The detection of the parasite DNA in the aqueous or vitreous humor can provide evidence for a definitive diagnosis. The current mainstay for the treatment, if necessary, is the use of oral antibiotic with systemic corticosteroids. Recent evidence suggests other therapeutic approaches, such as intravitreal antibiotics can be used. CONCLUSION: Recent developments in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach have contributed to preventing or limiting vision loss of patients suffering from ocular toxoplasmosis. Further studies are required to provide a better understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment with a significant impact on the management of this challenging clinical entity.","Kalogeropoulos, Dimitrios; Sakkas, Hercules; Mohammed, Bashar; Vartholomatos, Georgios; Malamos, Konstantinos; Sreekantam, Sreekanth; Kanavaros, Panagiotis; Kalogeropoulos, Chris",Int Ophthalmol,85,11

Past reports have indicated that commensal bacteria may either promote or repress rotavirus replication in the small intestine of mice. We now report that rotavirus replicated more efficiently in the intestines of germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice compared to animals with an unmodified microbiota. Antibiotic treatment also facilitated rotavirus replication in type I and type III interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, revealing IFN-independent proviral effects. Expression of interleukin-22 (IL-22) was strongly diminished in the intestine of antibiotic-treated mice. Treatment with exogenous IL-22 blocked rotavirus replication in microbiota-depleted wild-type and Stat1(-/-) mice, demonstrating that the antiviral effect of IL-22 in animals with altered microbiome is not dependent on IFN signaling. In antibiotic-treated animals, IL-22-induced a specific set of genes including Fut2, encoding fucosyl-transferase 2 that participates in the biosynthesis of fucosylated glycans which can mediate rotavirus binding. Interestingly, IL-22 also blocked rotavirus replication in antibiotic-treated Fut2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, IL-22 inhibited rotavirus replication in antibiotic-treated mice lacking key molecules of the necroptosis or pyroptosis pathways of programmed cell death. Taken together, our results demonstrate that IL-22 determines rotavirus susceptibility of antibiotic-treated mice, yet the IL-22-induced effector molecules conferring rotavirus resistance remain elusive.","Schnepf, Daniel; Hernandez, Pedro; Mahlakõiv, Tanel; Crotta, Stefania; Sullender, Meagan E.; Peterson, Stefan T.; Ohnemus, Annette; Michiels, Camille; Gentle, Ian; Dumoutier, Laure; Reis, Celso A.; Diefenbach, Andreas; Wack, Andreas; Baldridge, Megan T.; Staeheli, Peter",PLoS One,85,1

Although classically associated with bacterial and viral agents, fungal species have also been suspected to affect the course of the disease. Candida tropicalis is an opportunistic fungus that affects immunocompromised individuals and is also able to spread to vital organs. As C. tropicalis has been increasingly isolated from systemic infections, we aimed to evaluate the effect of this fungus on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model to study MS. For this, EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice 3 days after infection with 10(6) viable C. tropicalis yeasts. The infection decreased EAE prevalence and severity, confirmed by the less inflammatory infiltrate and less demyelization in the lumbar spinal cord. Despite this, C. tropicalis infection associated with EAE results in the death of some animals and increased urea and creatinine serum levels. The kidneys of EAE-infected mice showed higher fungal load associated with increased leukocyte infiltration (CD45(+) cells) and higher expression of T-box transcription factor (Tbx21) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3). Altogether, our results demonstrate that although C. tropicalis infection reduces the prevalence and severity of EAE, partially due to the sequestration of leukocytes by the inflamed renal tissue, this effect is associated with a poor disease outcome.","Munhoz-Alves, Natália; Mimura, Luiza Ayumi Nishiyama; Viero, Rosa Marlene; Bagagli, Eduardo; Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Sartori, Alexandrina; Fraga-Silva, Thais Fernanda de Campos",J Fungi (Basel),85,1

A warning system capable of anticipating social disruptions resulting from disease outbreaks is urgently needed to help decision makers prepare appropriately. We designed a system that operates in near real-time to identify and predict social response. Over 150,000 Internet-based news articles related to outbreaks of 16 diseases in 72 countries and territories were provided by HealthMap. These articles were automatically tagged with indicators of the disease activity and population reaction. An anomaly detection algorithm was implemented on the population reaction indicators to identify periods of unusually severe social response. Then a model was developed to predict the probability of these periods of unusually severe social response occurring in the coming week, 2 and 3 weeks. This model exhibited remarkably strong performance for diseases with substantial media coverage. For country-disease pairs with a median of 20 or more articles per year, the onset of social response in the next week was correctly predicted over 60% of the time, and 87% of weeks were correctly predicted. Performance was weaker for diseases with little media coverage, and, for these diseases, the main utility of our system is in identifying social response when it occurs, rather than predicting when it will happen in the future. Overall, the developed near real-time prediction approach is a promising step toward developing predictive models to inform responders of the likely social consequences of disease spread.

He called for a new field of Bioethics—“a science of survival.” Bioethics did develop, but with a narrower focus on medical ethics. Recently there have been attempts to broaden that focus to bring biomedical ethics together with environmental ethics. Though the two have many differences—in habits of thought, scope of concern, and value commitments—in this paper we argue that they often share common cause and we identify common ground through an examination of two case studies, one addressing drug development, the other food production.","Gruen, Lori; Ruddick, William",J Bioeth Inq,85,1

This review will cover components of various gene constructs used in developing plant-based vaccines against a myriad of viral and bacterial diseases. Specifically, it will focus on sequences that are involved in targeting the antigen to mucosal tissues of the intestinal tract, thus enhancing the immunogenicity of the plant-based vaccine as well as those components that result in higher accumulation of the protein within the plant.","Korban, Schuyler S.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Plant,85,20

Our study of genetic homozygosity degree includes an analysis of the presence, distribution and individual combination of 20 to 30 selected genetically controlled morphophysiological traits in the sample of BEN patients and in the control-healthy group. Assuming that BEN is genetically controlled disease, we made a hypothesis that an increased homozygosity level, as well as the changed variability among the patients, could be populationgenetic parameter for the prediction of the illness. Taking into consideration our experience, as well as the experience of numerous scientists who studied the nature of the inheritance of mono-and oligo-genically controlled qualitative traits, we applied a methodology to estimate the proportion of such homozygously recessive characters (HRC-test). This population-genetic study did not only show statistically significant difference of the mean values of genetic homozygosity (BEN: 8.7 ± 0.3; control: 7.6 ± 0.3), but of the differences in the type of distribution too, as well as the differences in the presence of certain individual combinations of such traits.","Marinkovic, D.; Cvjeticanin, S.",Russ J Genet,85,1

The effects of the sampling time, the sampling interval, and the sensor response time and measurement error on the location identification of the contaminant source are analyzed. The results indicate that the identification performance of the MDD method is better than that of the MCC method; however, the MDD requires a fast response and high-accuracy sensor. MCC method not only has smaller effects of response time and measurement error compared with the MDD method but it also does not require high-performance (accuracy) sensor and it is not suitable for fast identification in a short time.

The cells grew and secreted mAb stably. Antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048×10(6) and 4.096×10(6), respectively. By applying the anti-HBs G6 mAb and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-HBs antibody, we developed a sandwich ELISA (defined G6m ELISA) for detecting both wild-type and immune escape mutant HBsAgs (IEM HBsAg). The assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression HBsAg, including two wild-type species and 15 IEM HBsAg species, which varied in the “a” determinant, in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The patients previously had a lower ELISA detection signal [(absorbance of patients/absorbance of normal people (P/N): 1.0–4.5)]. The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild-type HBsAg was no less than 0.125 μg/L; 12 of 15 IEM HBsAg species (P/N⩾2.5) were positive for G6 mAb. Of the positive IEM HBsAg species, two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm (A (450)), one had an intermediate A450 value and nine had a high A (450) value, which was 7.55%(mean), 59.4%and 92.1%–109.4% of the wild-type A (450) value, respectively.

The changes of body weight, Lee’s index, body fat, and the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT in obese rats were observed before and after acupuncture.Results: The body weight, Lee’s index, body fat in obese rats were all markedly higher than those in normal rats, but the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT in obese rats was all lower than that in normal rats. There were negative correlation between the obesity index and the expression of UCP(1) gene in BAT. After acupuncture the marked effect of weight loss was achieved while the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT obviously increased in obese rats.Conclusion: The abnormal reduction for expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT might be an important cause for the obesity.

Given that frailty may impact recovery from influenza, we examined frailty as a predictor of recovery in older adults hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. METHODS: Data came from the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network during the 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14 influenza seasons; all patients were aged 65+. Frailty was measured using a previously validated Frailty Index (FI) of health and functional deficits; baseline frailty was categorized using published cutoffs (0-.1 non-frail, >.1-.21 pre-frail, >.21-.45 frail, >.45 most frail). Recovery was operationalized as being alive 30 days post-discharge with less than two additional health/functional deficits (<=0.06 FI increase). Logistic regression was used to examine the change in odds of recovery for every 0.1 increase in baseline FI, controlling for age, sex, season, lab-confirmed influenza status, and seasonal influenza vaccination status. RESULTS: Of 5125 hospitalized older adults, 15% were non-frail, 39% pre-frail, 40% frail, and 6% most frail. 11% died, and poor recovery was experienced by 520/4544=11% of survivors. Poor recovery was inversely associated with baseline frailty (11% non-frail, 17% pre-frail, 28% frail, 38% most frail; P < .001). Frailty was associated with lower odds of recovery in all three seasons [2011/12 (OR=0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.85), 2012/13 (OR=0.72; 0.66–0.78), 2013/14 (OR=0.76; 0.70–0.82)] though results varied by season, influenza status, and vaccination status. In 2011/12, frailty was associated with poor recovery in unvaccinated (OR=0.46. 95% CI=0.32–0.67) but not vaccinated older patients (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.68–1.02). CONCLUSION: Increasing frailty was consistently associated with lower odds of recovery in older adults admitted with influenza and other acute respiratory illnesses; depending on seasonal factors, vaccination may offer some buffering of this impact. Understanding frailty and functional status is important, both because frailty is predictive of poor recovery and because persistence of new health/functional deficits is an adverse outcome with important implications for patients, families and health systems.

Since the early days of marine natural products research in the 1960s, sponges have notoriously yielded the largest number of new metabolites reported per year compared to any other plant or animal phylum known from the marine environment. This not only reflects the remarkable productivity of sponges with regard to biosynthesis and accumulation of structurally diverse compounds but also highlights the continued interest of marine natural product researchers in this fascinating group of marine invertebrates. Among the numerous classes of natural products reported from marine sponges over the years, alkaloids, peptides, and terpenoids have attracted particularly wide attention due to their unprecedented structural features as well as their pronounced pharmacological activities which make several of these metabolites interesting candidates for drug discovery. This chapter consequently highlights several important groups of sponge-derived alkaloids, peptides, and terpenoids and describes their biological and/or pharmacological properties.","Ebada, Sherif S.; Proksch, Peter",Handbook of Marine Natural Products,85,1

Thus, exclusion of infectious etiologies is the first step in the diagnoses of pulmonary complications. Late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications typically occur 3 months post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the major contributor to late-onset pulmonary complications, and its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and current therapeutic approaches are discussed. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is another important complication which usually occurs early, although its onset may be delayed.

Policy implications of the model are discussed in light of the experience of developed countries in regulating livestock pollution and other externalities. We argue that environmental problems from agricultural industrialization in developing countries may pose major challenges. In the case of livestock production, these are compounded by production intensity, high population densities in periurban and urban areas, and the generally lower public health standards. As the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza epidemics in Asia suggest, the new era of globalization and the onset of a free world trade regime points to the urgent need for developing countries to install inspection and enforcement mechanisms that ensure product safety and quality, as well as minimize the adverse effects on the environment.","Chakravorty, Ujjayant; Fisher, Donna K.; Umetsu, Chieko",,85,1

There are many financial, ethical, and emotional issues for veterinarians to consider when deciding whether to accept wildlife cases to their practice. Wildlife is not owned and, therefore, does not come with paying caretakers. In many cases, the hospital will be expected to absorb the cost of treatment, although avenues for monetary compensation, including grants and public donations, do exist. Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian's compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian's domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. The potential costs of accepting wildlife cases usually include expenses associated with captivity, treatment, release, and failure to reestablish the animal in the wild, as well as the welfare risks to conspeciﬁcs and other species through the possible introduction of infection or competition for resources and the upset in natural selection (for example, treating animals that have increased susceptibility to disease may inadvertently select for less ﬁt animals). The potential benefits associated with working with these animals include the emotional pleasure humans derive from helping a “lesser” species, the potential to educate the public, and the opportunities this type of medicine provides for monitoring threats to wildlife and human populations.","Bewig, Maya; Mitchell, Mark A.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,85,1

Diet has a marked influence on gastrointestinal tract function and the manipulation of dietary composition provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic tool. During acute gastroenteritis, a short period of fasting is recommended. ‘Feeding through’ diarrhoea (without a period of fasting) is recommended in human infants but has limited applicability in dogs and cats, primarily because different types of diarrhoea are commonly treated by veterinary surgeons compared to physicians. Following the fast, a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources is advisable. This minimises the likelihood of acquired food allergies to staple proteins. Allergy avoidance may require special techniques such as rotation diets or protein hydrolysates. Dietary fat is usually kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction as malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids promote secretory diarrhoea in the large bowel. Recommendations to feed high fat rather than high carbohydrate diets to cats with diarrhoea need to be objectively examined. The type of fat fed may also prove to be an important consideration. Incorporation of omega‐3 fatty acids into the diet has been shown to have anti‐inflammatory effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fibre diets. This recommendation needs re‐examination because the binding and gelling properties of fibre are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhoea. High fibre diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. Soluble (fermentable) fibres (eg, psyllium, oat bran and fibrim) rather than insoluble (non‐fermentable) fibres (eg, wheat bran) give better results in treating colitis. The benefits from soluble fibre probably relates to the binding of irritant bile acids and the generation of volatile fatty acids, such as butyrate, that nourish the colonic epithelium and encourage growth of normal bacterial flora.","Guilford, W.

A candidate autoantigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), has especially attracted attention. The presence of anti‐MBP antibodies is a predictor of definite MS, but their role in the pathogenesis remains obscure. T cells have long been known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MS. Recently, an important role for B cells as autoantigen‐presenting cells has been demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The uptake of MBP by B cells and the presentation of MBP‐derive peptides to T helper (Th) cells by B cells may be promoted by the formation of complement (C) activating immune complexes (ICs) between MBP and natural autoantibodies in healthy individuals and disease‐associated anti‐MBP antibodies in MS patients, respectively. We have investigated the formation of MBP‐containing IC, the binding of MBP to B cells, the MBP‐elicited induction of Th‐cell and B‐cell proliferation and the cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors grown in the presence of intact or C‐inactivated serum from healthy donors or patients with MS. While MBP did not induce measurable proliferation of B cells nor CD4(+) T cells, we observed the production of TNF‐α, IFN‐γ and IL‐10 by PBMC in response to incubation with MBP in the presence of sera from healthy controls as well as sera from MS patients. By contrast, no production of IL‐2, IL‐4 and IL‐5 was detected. We are currently investigating the capability of MS sera to promote the formation of MBP‐containing IC and thereby enhance the cytokine responses, by virtue of elevated anti‐MBP contents.","Hedegaard, C.

They may lead to complications including viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections and graft dysfunction. There has been a recent widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza among domestic poultry and wild birds along with a number of human cases with severe disease and high mortality. Genetic changes in the H5N1 virus may lead to efficient human‐to‐human transmission, heralding the onset of the next influenza pandemic. Discussed are the implications that such a pandemic may have on transplant patients. Logical inferences can be made from data on influenza in transplant patients and from experience with other respiratory virus outbreaks. In the event of a pandemic, it is likely that transplant patients will have more severe disease and higher mortality as compared to the general population. Vaccination and antiviral strategies may be less effective in this population. Implications for transplant programs in general are also discussed.","Kumar, D.; Humar, A.",Am J Transplant,85,1

The systematic study of these two features of social systems has started only very recently, mainly thanks to the development of multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic models unfolding at comparable timescale with respect to the evolution of the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic threshold as a function of the multiplexity and the features of each layer. We found that higher values of multiplexity significantly reduce the epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of nodes present on multiple layers are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics is driven by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the multiplexity. However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics is sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their effects on contagion phenomena.","Liu, Quan-Hui; Xiong, Xinyue; Zhang, Qian; Perra, Nicola",,85,1

It is a key component in AI applications which rely on building a model of the environment using observations and performing lookups on the model for newer observations. In this work, we develop FASTHash, a “truly” high throughput parallel hash table implementation using FPGA on-chip SRAM. Contrary to state-of-the-art hash table implementations on CPU, GPU, and FPGA, the parallelism in our design is data independent, allowing us to support p parallel queries ([Formula: see text]) per clock cycle via p processing engines (PEs) in the worst case. Our novel data organization and query flow techniques allow full utilization of abundant low latency on-chip SRAM and enable conflict free concurrent insertions. Our hash table ensures relaxed eventual consistency - inserts from a PE are visible to all PEs with some latency. We provide theoretical worst case bound on the number of erroneous queries (true negative search, duplicate inserts) due to relaxed eventual consistency. We customize our design to implement both static and dynamic hash tables on state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Our implementations are scalable to 16 PEs and support throughput as high as 5360 million operations per second with PEs running at 335 MHz for static hashing and 4480 million operations per second with PEs running at 280 MHz for dynamic hashing. They outperform state-of-the-art implementations by 5.7x and 8.7x respectively.","Yang, Yang; Kuppannagari, Sanmukh R.; Srivastava, Ajitesh; Kannan, Rajgopal; Prasanna, Viktor K.",High Performance Computing,85,1

Therefore, problems are often too large and complex to be run on quantum devices. By distributing quantum algorithms over different devices, larger problem instances can be run. This distributing however, often requires operations between two qubits of different devices. Using shared entangled states and classical communication, these operations between different devices can still be performed. In the ideal case of perfect fidelity, distributed quantum computing is a solution to achieving scalable quantum computers with a larger number of qubits. In this work we consider the effects on the output fidelity of a quantum algorithm when using noisy shared entangled states. We consider the quantum phase estimation algorithm and present two distribution schemes for the algorithm. We give the resource requirements for both and show that using less noisy shared entangled states results in a higher overall fidelity.","Neumann, Niels M.

The authors hypothesized that practitioners would transition services to telehealth but that this would differ by provider type. METHOD: English-speaking adult mental health practitioners (N = 910) were recruited via professional listservs, personal emails, and social media. Data were collected 03/30/2020–04/10/2020 via an online Qualtrics survey asking about demographics and practice adjustments in response to COVID-19. Most practitioners were psychologists/doctoral-level therapists (41%), social workers/masters-level therapists (17%), and neuropsychologists (16%). The majority was employed in an academic medical center (19%) or private practice (22%). Differences among provider types were examined using chi-square tests with Bonferroni corrections and one-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Tukey tests. Preliminary Results (see Table 1): Most mental health practitioners adjusted their practices, primarily by transitioning to telehealth. The majority reported having easy access to information technology (IT) services. Although telehealth implementation was neutral to somewhat difficult, participants were neutral to somewhat likely to provide telehealth in the future. Compared to other practitioners, neuropsychologists saw fewer patients; were more likely to cancel, reschedule, or restrict appointments; were less likely to implement telehealth; and reported greater difficulty doing so. Findings related to other group differences (e.g., between settings) will also be presented. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, mental health practitioners rapidly shifted to telehealth, but neuropsychologists were less likely to do so and reported greater difficulty doing so. This may be related to the difficulty of administering neuropsychological tests remotely and has implications for neuropsychologists’ ability to meet patients’ needs during COVID-19.

In Italy, the mean waiting time is increasing causing potentially ED overflow and a detrimental effect on quality of care. METHODS: We collected total daily ED visits between 2014 and 2019 in the five major hospitals of Milan. To predict daily volumes, we used a regression model with ARIMA errors. Predictors included were weekly and yearly periodicity, meteorological and environmental variables, information on influenza epidemics and festivities. Parameters have been calibrated on training datasets (2014-2018) and successively validated on 2019, accuracy of prediction have been evaluated with the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Finally, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak calculating the proportion of ED accesses by triage levels, before and after the outbreak. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2019 there have been 2 million of ED visits in the hospitals of Milan. We found different patterns of ED visits across age and days: children (0-14 years) tended to visit ED more likely on weekends while adults and senior people on Mondays. Results confirmed the role of meteorological and environmental variables, and the presence of yearly and weekly pattern. We found high correlation between observed and predicted value with a MAPE globally smaller than 8.1%. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of white triage ED accesses was reduced up to 71%. CONCLUSIONS: Results permitted to develop a 2-day ED warning system combining forecast data provided by ARPA Lombardia. This is crucial in a system where inappropriate emergency admissions are still high where the analysis conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic period suggested a dramatic reduction in the number of daily ED access of lower triages. KEY MESSAGES: The ability to forecast future demands would be a valuable support in a system of limited resources, which must therefore be used in the best way. Environmental and meteorological variable have a moderate effect on emergency admissions.","Murtas, R; Decarli, A; Russo, A G",Eur J Public Health,85,22

It examines the recent transformation of collective bargaining regimes at national and transnational level and the consequences for normativities that characterize the relationship between labour law and the system of international labour standards. Domestic bargaining regimes are influenced by decentralization whereas in a transnational setting, with the phenomena of contractual arrangements between multinational enterprises and trade unions or other employee representatives, transnational collectivization of labour law is occurring. The process of transnationalization of labour law affects the traditional labour law paradigm with profound consequences for our understanding of the purpose and role of labour law. The transformation of labour law highlights regulatory developments that require reinforcement of the role of fundamental labour rights. Building a perspective on major global challenges to the ILO at the beginning of its second centenary requires an assessment of the labour question in terms of flexibility and vulnerabilities. This raises the question of inclusivity, calling for the ILO decent work agenda, employment creation, social protection, rights at work and social dialogue, all to be more firmly integrated in global regulatory approaches to work.","Liukkunen, Ulla",International Labour Organization and Global Social Governance,85,1

Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of lncRNAs is distinct from that of mRNAs and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of lncRNA biogenesis, localization and functions in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and other modes of gene regulation, and their potential therapeutic applications.","Statello, Luisa; Guo, Chun-Jie; Chen, Ling-Ling; Huarte, Maite",Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,85,12

PML is a serious complication of MS treatment which is most commonly related to natalizumab. CASE PRESENTATION: We report clinical course of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a 40-year-old man who was on treatment for highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with natalizumab (Nz). He was treated with steroids, cidofovir, and mirtazapine and went on to develop long-term disability. The case describes the evolution of PML from diagnosis up till 5 months with changes on sequential brain scans and clinical symptoms in our patient. CONCLUSION: Patients who are on natalizumab should be aware and consented for the risk of PML. They should be periodically re-assessed for their relative PML risk. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests switching patients from natalizumab who have a higher risk of PML to other safer treatment options.","Mansoor, Salman; Mullane, Gerard; Adenan, Mohammad Hijaz; Kelly, Siobhan; Water, Aine; McPartland, Grainne; Murphy, Kevin",Egypt J Neurol Psychiatr Neurosurg,85,1

Both novels focus on characters whose development as human beings is prevented by the contrasting illusions of ephemerality and digital hypermnesia. I show that the way characters use social media entails a sense of virtual disembodiment that shapes their perception of their physical bodies and surrounding spaces. I also argue that their online activity as represented in the novels invites reflections on the archival values of images and on social networks as fragmentary repositories of the self.

The convenience sampling method was used to randomly select 80 cardiology patients from the electronic medical record system of the hospital, and the patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group was the control group. The routine nursing method was adopted, and a dedicated nurse paid attention to the sleep status; the other group was the control group. The research group adopts targeted nursing methods. This paper selects three kinds of sensor data as features. When collecting each scene record, it is first divided into sleeping and awake states, and then the classified time is composed of time segments, and these time segments are finally accumulated into sleep duration. Using sleep time, waking time, and sleep duration as input, the participants were divided into good sleepers and poor sleepers. Through a self-made questionnaire survey, the factors that have an adverse effect on the patient's sleep are divided into 7 aspects. Using the method of internal continuity measurement, Cronbach's coefficient a is 0.811, suggesting that the internal consistency is better, and the calculation reliability and validity are 86.1% and 83.4%, respectively, suggesting that the table can be used for sleep in hospitalized patients.

We studied their association and interactions with lifestyles in 40,768 adults aged over 40 years from a large-scale, hospital-based cohort study collected during 2010–2013. White blood cell counts (WBC) and serum C-reactive protein concentrations (CRP) were used as indexes of immune status. The participants were categorized into four groups by the cutoff points of 6.2 × 10(9)/L WBC(L-WBC) and <0.5 mg/dL CRP(L-CRP): L-WBC+L-CRP(n = 25,604), H-WBC+L-CRP(n = 13,880), L-WBC+H-CRP(n = 464), and H-WBC+H-CRP(n = 820). The participants in the H-WBC+L-CRP were younger and had higher numbers of males than the L-WBC+L-CRP. MetS risk was higher by 1.75- and 1.86-fold in the H-WBC+L-CRP and H-WBC+H-CRP, respectively, than the L-WBC+L-CRP. MetS components, including plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations, and SBP were elevated in H-WBC+L-CRP and H-WBC+H-CRP compared with L-WBC+L-CR+P. The risk of hyperglycemia and high HbA1c was the highest in the H-WBC+H-CRP among all groups. Areas of WBC counts and serum CRP concentrations were 0.637 and 0.672, respectively, in the receiver operating characteristic curve. Daily intake of energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat was not significantly different in the groups based on WBC counts and CRP. However, a plant-based diet (PBD), physical activity, and non-smoking were related to lowering WBC counts and CRP, but a Western-style diet was linked to elevating CRP. A high PBD intake and smoking status interacted with immunity to influence MetS risk: a low PBD and current smoking were associated with a higher MetS risk in the H-WBC+H-CRP. In conclusion, overactivated immunity determined by CRP and WBC was associated with MetS risk. Behavior modification with PBD and physical activity might be related to immunity regulation.","Park, Sunmin; Zhang, Ting",Nutrients,85,1

Like arboviruses, chronic neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, are found wherever there are humans. Significant differences in baseline gene and protein expression have been determined between human-induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from non-Parkinson’s disease individuals and from individuals with Parkinson’s disease. It was hypothesized that these inherent differences could impact cerebral organoid responses to viral infection. (2) Methods: In this study, cerebral organoids from a non-Parkinson’s and Parkinson’s patient were infected with Chikungunya virus and observed for two weeks.

Overcoming or suppressing RPIAM can dramatically improve the treatment outcome. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently diagnosed in an advanced stage and often possesses intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy accompanied by the fast development of acquired resistance during the treatment. Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (TKs), specifically epidermal growth factor (EGF) TKs, play an important role in the activation of MAPK/PI3K/Akt/STAT pathways, finally leading to the development of RPIAM. However, the suppression of EGF-TK by different drugs is limited by various defensive mechanisms and mutations. In order to effectively prevent the development of RPIAM in NSCLC, we formulated and tested a multicomponent and multifunctional cancer targeted delivery system containing Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) as vehicles, luteinizing hormone release hormone (LHRH) as a cancer targeting moiety, EFG-TK inhibitor gefitinib and/or paclitaxel as anticancer drug(s), siRNA targeted to EGF receptor (EGFR) mRNA as a suppressor of EGF receptors, and an imaging agent (rhodamine) for the visualization of cancer cells.

This has also been a persistent trend in Thailand. In this study, samples of commercial cosmetic creams on the Thai market were assessed for a functional evaluation of their antioxidant activity, tyrosinase inhibitory effects, and phenolic contents. Samples were extracted using hot water and sonication extraction method to obtain the functional cream extracts. Total phenolic contents in all samples were within the range of 0.46–47.92 mg GAE/30 g cream. Antioxidant activities of the cream extracts were within the range of 3.61–43.98 mg Trolox equivalent/30 g cream, while tyrosinase inhibition activities were within the range of 2.58–97.94% of inhibition. With regard to the relationship between the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the cosmetic creams, Pearson’s correlation coefficient revealed a moderately positive relationship with an r value of 0.6108. Furthermore, the relationship between the antioxidant activity and the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the cosmetic creams was highly positive with an r value of 0.7238. Overall, this study demonstrated that the total phenolic contents in the functional cosmetic creams could play a role in antioxidant activity and anti-tyrosinase activities. The findings indicate how the whitening and antioxidant effects of cosmetic creams could be maintained after the products have been formulated, as this concern can affect the consumer’s decision when purchasing cosmetic products.","Mapoung, Sariya; Semmarath, Warathit; Arjsri, Punnida; Umsumarng, Sonthaya; Srisawad, Kamonwan; Thippraphan, Pilaiporn; Yodkeeree, Supachai; Limtrakul (Dejkriengkraikul), Pornngarm",Plants (Basel),85,1

It has been known that a cell can adhere on an adhesive microisland only over a critical size. But no publication has concerned critical adhesion areas of cells on microislands with nanoarray decoration. Herein, we fabricated a series of micro-nanopatterns with different microisland sizes and arginine—glycine—aspartate (RGD) nanospacings on a nonfouling poly(ethylene glycol) background. Besides reproducing that nanospacing of RGD, a ligand of its receptor integrin (a membrane protein), significantly influences specific cell adhesion on bioactive nanoarrays, we confirmed that the concept of critical adhesion area originally suggested in studies of cells on micropatterns was justified also on the micro-nanopatterns, yet the latter exhibited more characteristic behaviors of cell adhesion. We found increased critical adhesion areas of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on nanoarrayed microislands with increased RGD nanospacings. However, the numbers of nanodots with respect to the critical adhesion areas were not a constant.

In Ireland, an industry-led compulsory eradication programme began in January 2013. The main elements of this programme are the identification and elimination of persistently infected (PI) calves by testing all new-borns, the implementation of biosecurity to prevent re-introduction of disease and continuous surveillance. In 2016, a standardised framework was developed to investigate herds with positive results. This is delivered by trained private veterinary practitioners (PVP). The investigation's aims are 3-fold: firstly, to identify plausible sources of infection; secondly, to ensure that no virus-positive animals remain on farm by resolving the BVD status of all animals in the herd; and thirdly, agreeing up to three biosecurity measures with the herd owner to prevent the re-introduction of the virus. Each investigation follows a common approach comprising four steps based on information from the programme database and collected on-farm: firstly, identifying the time period when each virus-positive calf was exposed in utero (window of susceptibility, taken as 30–120 days of gestation); secondly, determining the location of the dam of each positive calf during this period; thirdly, to investigate potential sources of exposure, either within the herd or external to it; and finally, based on the findings, the PVP and herdowner agree to implement up to three biosecurity measures to minimise the risk of reintroduction. Between 2016 and 2020, 4,105 investigations were completed. The biosecurity recommendations issued more frequently related to the risks of introduction of virus associated with contact with neighbouring cattle at pasture, personnel (including the farmer), the purchase of cattle and vaccination. Although each investigation generates farm-specific outcomes and advice, the aggregated results also provide an insight into the most commonly identified transmission pathways for these herds which inform overall programme communications on biosecurity. The most widely identified plausible sources of infection over these years included retained BVD-positive animals, Trojan births, contact at boundaries and indirect contact through herd owner and other personnel in the absence of appropriate hygiene measures. While generated in the context of BVD herd investigations, the findings also provide an insight into biosecurity practises more generally on Irish farms.","Guelbenzu-Gonzalo, Maria P.; Lozano, Jose-Maria; O'Sullivan, Padraig; Lane, Elizabeth A.; Graham, David A.",Front Vet Sci,85,1

As such, the developing country like Indonesia has largely been suffering from this epidemic. In this context, this paper attempts to analyse some national security issues that are affecting Indonesia, which is currently struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed here are policy measures to combat both present and future challenges. The study uses secondary data collected from different sources concerning COVID-19 pandemic and security issues of Indonesia. The study analyses the data based on descriptive statistics, highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Indonesian law enforcement issues, and security of health, food, supply chain management, industrial and other economic sectors. The study argues that if the vulnerability continues in these security-related issues due to pandemic, the country will face a harsh reality to manage the state-affairs. Therefore, the policy options are mainly concerned with the COVID-19 issue. Indonesia’s government should identify what measures to take by conducting rapid diagnostics and polymerase chain reaction tests in the laboratory, respectively. Moreover, the government and relevant stakeholders need to develop strategies that break the stranglehold of COVID-19 transmission in order to resolve Indonesian national security concern.","Alam, Md.

Direct demonstration of this process nor definition of the entry pathway of Pi into SR are fully established. We show that Pi promoted Ca2+ release at concentrations below 10 mm and decreased it at higher concentrations. This decrease correlated well with that of [Ca2+ ]SR . Pre-treatment of permeabilized myofibers with 2 mm Cl- channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) inhibited both effects of Pi . The biphasic dependence of Ca2+ release on [Pi ] is explained by a direct effect of Pi acting on the SR Ca2+ release channel, combined with the intra-SR precipitation of Ca2+ salts. 9AC effects demonstrates that Pi enters the SR via a Cl- pathway of as yet undefined molecular nature. ABSTRACT Fatiguing exercise causes hydrolysis of phosphocreatine, increasing the intracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi ). Pi diffuses into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it is believed to forms insoluble Ca2+ salts, thus contributing to the impairment of Ca2+ release. Information on the Pi entrance pathway is still lacking. In amphibian muscles endowed with isoform 3 of the RyR channel, Ca2+ spark frequency is correlated with Ca2+ load of the SR and can be used to monitor this variable. We studied the effects of Pi on Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized fibres of the frog. Relative event frequency (f/fref ) rose with increasing [Pi ] reaching 2.54±1.6 at 5 mm and then decreased monotonically, reaching 0.09±0.03 at [Pi ] = 80 mm. Measurement of [Ca2+ ]SR confirmed a decrease correlated with spark frequency at high [Pi ]. A large [Ca2+ ]SR surge was observed upon Pi removal. Anion channels are a putative path for Pi into the SR. We tested the effect of chloride channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) on Pi entrance. 400 μm 9AC applied to the cytoplasm produced a non-significant increase in spark frequency and reduced the Pi effects on this parameter. Fibre treatment with 2 mm 9AC in the presence of high cytoplasmic Mg2+ suppressed Pi effects on [Ca2+ ]SR and spark frequency up to 55 mm Pi . These results suggest that chloride channels (or transporters) provide the main pathway of inorganic phosphate into the SR and confirm that it impairs Ca2+ release by accumulating and precipitating with Ca2+ inside the SR, thus contributing to myogenic fatigue.

However, anosmia is also a common symptom of acute colds of various origins. In contrast to an acute cold, it appears from several questionnaire-based studies that in the context of COVID-19 infection, anosmia is the main rhinological symptom and is usually not associated with other rhinological symptoms such as rhinorrhoea or nasal obstruction. Until now, no study has directly compared smell and taste function between COVID-19 patients and patients with other causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) using valid and reliable psychophysical tests. In this study, we aimed to objectively assess and compare olfactory and gustatory functions in 10 COVID-19 patients (PCR diagnosed, assessed on average 2 weeks after infection), 10 acute cold (AC) patients (assessed before the COVID-19 outbreak) and 10 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Smell performance was assessed using the extended ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test battery (4), while taste function was assessed using ""taste strips"" (5). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were built to probe olfactory and gustatory scores in terms of their discrimination between COVID-19 and AC patients. Our results suggest that mechanisms of COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction are different from those seen in an AC and may reflect, at least to some extent, a specific involvement at the level of central nervous system in some COVID-19 patients. In the future, studies to assess the prevalence of persistent anosmia and neuroanatomical changes on MRI correlated to chemosensory function, will be useful to understand these mechanisms.","Huart, C; Philpott, C; Konstantinidis, I; Altundag, A; Trecca, E M C; Cassano, M; Rombaux, Ph; Hummel, T",Rhinology,85,16

Among these, the modified piggyback (MPB) technique by Belghiti offers specific advantages. The objective of this study was to present our single-center experience with the MPB technique in 500 cases. Recipients' perioperative data were prospectively collected and evaluated. Postoperative and specific complications, stay in the intensive and intermediate care unit, and the mortality rate with cause of death were analyzed. Most recipients were classified as Child C (49.1%). For the patients who underwent LTx for the first time, alcoholic (23.9%) and viral (22.2%) cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (15.1%) were the prevalent indications. The overall median warm ischemia time, anastomosis duration, and operative time were 45, 108, and 320 minutes, respectively. The median intraoperative blood loss was 1500 mL. A venovenous bypass was never needed to maintain hemodynamic stability. Only in a few cases was temporary inferior vena cava clamping necessary. Most prominent surgical complications were hemorrhage, hematoma, and wound dehiscence. Renal failure occurred in 6.2% of patients. The overall median stay in the intensive and intermediate care unit was 14 days. The mortality rates within 30 and 90 days were 6.3% and 13.3%, respectively. No technique-related death occurred. The MPB technique by Belghiti is a feasible and simple LTx technique. The caval flow is preserved during the anhepatic phase, and this minimizes the need for venovenous bypass or portocaval shunt. This technique requires only 1 caval anastomosis, which is easy to perform with a short anhepatic phase. To minimize the risk of outflow obstruction, attention should be paid by doing a wide cavocavostomy cranially to the donor inferior vena cava in a door-lock manner. This technique can be applied in almost all patients undergoing LTx for the first time and liver retransplantation as well.","Mehrabi, Arianeb; Mood, Zhoobin A; Fonouni, Hamidreza; Kashfi, Arash; Hillebrand, Norbert; Müller, Sascha A; Encke, Jens; Büchler, Markus W; Schmidt, Jan",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,85,1

The increasing number of primary studies reporting long-term follow-up measurements supports a meta-analysis of this evidence. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to understand the immediate and long-term impact of mHealth interventions on PA. The secondary objective was to explore potential effect moderators (population type, intervention design, control group type). METHODS We performed this systematic review according to the Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS and PsychINFO in July 2020. Eligible studies included randomized-controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), total PA (TPA), and energy expenditure (EE). Where reported, we extracted data for three time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up ≤6 months, follow-up >6 months). To understand effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. Results were summarized using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RESULTS Of the 2 828 identified citations, 117 studies were included. These studies reported on 21 118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 years (SD 14.14), of whom 59% were female. mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all four outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference 0.46, 0.36 to 0.55; P<.001; MVPA 0.28, 0.21 to 0.35; P<.001; TPA 0.34, 0.20 to 0.47; P<.001; EE 0.44, 0.13 to 0.75; P=.01). Only 33 studies reported short-term and eight studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end of intervention results. Effects were sustained short-term for walking (0.26, 0.09 to 0.42; P=.002), MVPA (0.20, 0.05 to 0.35; P=.008), and TPA (0.53, 0.13 to 0.93; P=.009). Long-term, effects were also sustained for walking (0.25, 0.10 to 0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (0.19, 0.11 to 0.27; P<.001). We found study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. PA was increased both in scalable and non-scalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. The risk of bias was rated high in 94 of 117 studies. In addition, heterogeneity was significant and substantial across outcome measures, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. Effects are maintained long-term, but effect size decreases over time. The results encourage the use of mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations, and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. However, given low evidence quality and high heterogeneity, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of mHealth interventions.

These are protocols to ventilate two patients with a single conventional ventilator. This study demonstrates a means to titrate peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) for test lungs ventilated via a dual-patient single ventilator circuit. METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted using a ventilator connected to two test lungs. Changes in PIP, PEEP, and FiO2 were made to the experimental lung, while no changes were made to the control lung. Measurements were obtained using NICO2 Respiratory Profile Monitor simultaneously measuring each test lung. PIP was titrated using 3D-printed resistors added to the inspiratory circuit. PEEP was titrated using LTV 900 expiratory circuit tubing with an attached manual PEEP valve. FiO2 was titrated by using a 3D-printed T-splitter added to the ventilator tubing. RESULTS PIP, PEEP, and FiO2 were reliably and incrementally titratable in the experimental lung with some notable but manageable pressure and FiO2 changes documented in the control lung during these titrations. Similar results were measured in lungs of identical and different compliances. CONCLUSIONS Individual pressures and fraction of inspired oxygen can be reliably adjusted when utilizing a dual-patient single ventilator circuit with simple, low-cost modifications to the circuit. This innovation could potentially be lifesaving in a resource-limited or crisis setting. Understanding the interactions of these circuits is imperative towards making their use safer.","Sojar, Sakina H; Quinn, Austin M; Bortcosh, William H; Decerbo, Paul C; Chung, Esther; LaVita, Carolyn J; Jay, Gregory D",Respiratory care,85,24

The amino acid (AA) requirements and lysine:metabolizable energy ratio (Lys:ME) of health-challenged pigs for optimum performance are poorly understood. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of increasing standardized ileal digestible (SID) Lys:ME (g SID Lys per Mcal ME) on growth performance during a PRRSV challenge. In Exp. 1, a total of 379 barrows (51.3 ± 0.3 kg body weight [BW]) were allotted to one of six diets (1.87 to 3.41 Lys:ME) for a 35-d growth study. In Exp. 2, a total of 389 barrows (29.2 ± 0.23 kg BW) were allotted to one of six diets (2.39 to 3.91 Lys:ME) for a 49-d growth study. These isocaloric diets represented 80% to 130% of National Research Council (NRC) SID Lys requirement. For each experiment, pigs were randomly allotted across two barns of 24 pens each with seven to nine pigs per pen (four pens per diet per health status). On day 0, one barn was inoculated with live PRRSV, one barn sham inoculated (control), and all pigs were started on experimental diets. Pen growth performance and feed intake were recorded weekly and gain-to-feed ratio (G:F) was calculated. Breakpoint analysis was used to determine the Lys:ME that maximized average daily gain (ADG) and G:F over the 35 or 49-d test periods for Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. In Exp. 1, increasing Lys:ME increased ADG (quadratic P = 0.01) and G:F (linear and quadratic P = 0.04) in control pigs over 35 d. In PRRSV-infected pigs, ADG and G:F increased linearly with increasing Lys:ME (P < 0.01). The Lys:ME for optimum ADG and G:F during PRRSV challenge was 2.83 and 3.17, respectively, compared to 2.24 and 2.83, respectively, in control pigs using a one-slope broken-line model. In Exp. 2, pigs in the control barn became naturally infected after 21 days post inoculation. Before infection, ADG and G:F increased with increasing Lys:ME in control and PRRSV-infected pigs (linear and quadratic P < 0.05), and optimum ADG and G:F were achieved at 3.02 and 2.92 Lys:ME, respectively, in PRRSV-infected pigs compared to 2.82 and 3.22 Lys:ME, respectively, in control pigs. Over the 49-d period, increasing Lys:ME improved ADG (P < 0.01, linear and quadratic) and G:F (linear P < 0.01) in naturally infected pigs. The response was similar in experimental infection for ADG (P < 0.01, linear and quadratic) and G:F (linear P = 0.01). The optimum ratio for ADG (2.86 vs. 3.12 Lys:ME) and G:F (3.18 vs. 3.08 Lys:ME) were similar between natural and experimental infection. In summary, increasing Lys:ME by 10% to 20% above NRC requirements improved performance and feed efficiency during an experimental and natural PRRSV challenge.","Schweer, Wesley P; Mendoza, Omarh F; Shull, Caleb M; Lehman, James; Gaines, Aaron M; Schwartz, Kent J; Gabler, Nicholas K",Translational animal science,85,24

METHODS VASGRA is an open, prospective, observational cohort study. Prospective participants in VASGRA between 2013 and 2019 were included (257 patients; 137 with VGEI). The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for a diagnosis of VGEI was evaluated retrospectively by calculating the sensitivity and specificity vs. the consensually adjudicated VASGRA infection status. RESULTS The VASGRA cohort categorised 137 (53.3%) patients as ""diseased"" and 120 patients as ""not diseased""; using the MAGIC criteria, 183/257 (71.2%) patients were considered to be ""diseased"". Thus, for the MAGIC criteria, a sensitivity of 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-100) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 52-70) were calculated. Considering suspected VGEI according to the MAGIC criteria as ""not diseased"" achieved congruent assessments of the VASGRA team and the MAGIC criteria, with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 93%. The accuracy of the MAGIC criteria for the different graft locations were also compared. If the suspected VGEIs were assigned to the ""not diseased"" group, VGEIs of the thoracic aorta seemed to have a poorer sensitivity (86%; 95% CI 73-95) than the other graft locations. CONCLUSION The current MAGIC criteria offer good sensitivity and specificity in the context of true infections but a reduced specificity for a possible VGEI.","Anagnostopoulos, Alexia; Mayer, Fabienne; Ledergerber, Bruno; Bergadà-Pijuan, Judith; Husmann, Lars; Mestres, Carlos A; Rancic, Zoran; Hasse, Barbara",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,85,31

Axon diameter can be regulated by activity, yet how morphological changes in an axon impact its function remains poorly understood. Axonal swellings have been found on Purkinje cell axons in the cerebellum both in healthy development and in neurodegenerative diseases, and computational models predicts that axonal swellings impair axonal function. Here we report that in young Purkinje cells, axons with swellings propagated action potentials with higher fidelity than those without, and that axonal swellings form when axonal failures are high. Furthermore, we observed that healthy young adult mice with more axonal swellings learn better on cerebellar-related tasks than mice with fewer swellings. Our findings suggest that axonal swellings underlie a form of axonal plasticity that optimizes the fidelity of action potential propagation in axons, resulting in enhanced learning.","Lang-Ouellette, Daneck; Gruver, Kim M; Smith-Dijak, Amy; Blot, François G C; Stewart, Chloe A; de Vanssay de Blavous, Pauline; Li, Connie H; Van Eitrem, Carter; Rosen, Charlotte; Faust, Phyllis L; Schonewille, Martijn; Watt, Alanna J",Nature communications,85,1

This knowledge is not available in the literature. METHODS Using data from the Danish Hernia Database, we included all male patients operated on for an elective, primary inguinal hernia from 1998 to 2012. Within this prospectively collected cohort, the type of inguinal hernia at primary and recurrent procedures was registered. Furthermore, time from primary procedure to reoperation and number of reoperations was registered. Data were compared using multivariate Cox proportionate hazard analysis and by first-order, semipartial correlation. RESULTS Among the 85,314 male patients who had a primary inguinal hernia repaired electively in the study period (56% IIH; 44% direct inguinal hernia [DIH]), we found an overall reoperation rate of 3.8%. More primary IIHs were operated by Lichtenstein's technique than primary DIH (90.7% vs 85.4%, respectively; P < .001). A total of 93% of the reoperations were for inguinal hernias, and 3.9% were for femoral hernias. DIHs resulted more often in reoperation than IIHs (5.2% vs 2.7%, respectively; P < .001). We found an association between the type of hernia at the primary procedure and the recurrent procedure. Thus, direct primary hernias were correlated with recurrent direct hernias, and indirect primary hernias were correlated with recurrent indirect hernias (P < .001). CONCLUSION DIHs resulted in greater risk of reoperation than IIHs. A clear association was found between the same subtype of primary and recurrent type of inguinal hernia and could be an indication of different pathophysiologic etiologies.","Burcharth, Jakob; Andresen, Kristoffer; Pommergaard, Hans-Christian; Bisgaard, Thue; Rosenberg, Jacob",Surgery,85,16

METHODS We used the five-port method with a 3.5 cm umbilical incision for extraction and reconstruction during MPS for CRC. One or two 5 mm ports were exchanged for needle forceps and all surgical procedures were as for previous MPS since July 2012. We investigated the short-term outcomes of 138 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of CRC by NS (July 2012-August 2014) and 130 consecutive patients with CRC treated with MPS during a previous period (January 2010-June 2012). RESULTS Operative time in the NS group was comparable to that of MPS (p=0.467); the NS group had significantly less estimated blood loss (p=0.002) and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (p<0.001). The mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 27 in both groups (p=0.730). No mortality occurred in either group, and similar morbidity rates were observed (p=0.454). CONCLUSIONS NS using Endo Relief needle forceps is a safe and feasible option compared to conventional MPS for CRC.","Tsuruta, Masashi; Hasegawa, Hirotoshi; Okabayashi, Koji; Shigeta, Kohei; Ishida, Takashi; Yahagi, Masashi; Ishii, Yoshiyuki; Kitagawa, Yuko","Journal of the anus, rectum and colon",85,20

The available antiviral agents or host-specific anti-inflammatory therapies are the principal treatment modalities, with drugrepurposing as the most viable approach to timely tackle the CoV pandemic. Though these approaches are successful to some extent in reducing the mortality rate, however, it is too far to see a complete escape from the current CoV-2 pandemic. Plants are the primary source of diet, dietary supplements, botanical drugs, and natural products (NPs). It has been well accepted and proved via several scientific studies that plant-based therapies play a vital role in protecting against such infections. The faulty immune system (compromised innate immunity or aberrant immune activation) decides the severity of the respiratory distress in CoV-2 infected patients. Natural products intervene at various stages of the virus replication cycle, including inhibition of virus entry into the host cells, inhibition of serine/ cysteine proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or helicase. Besides, several natural products or plant-based dietary ingredients have a unique ability to strengthen the immune system or alleviate the hyper-inflammatory condition. Many plant-based formulations, dietary supplements, and NPs are being investigated in clinical trials in CoV-2 patients, and few have already shown positive results. The review has unearthed several NP leads for medicinal chemistry programs as well as some having direct opportunity of repurposing in SARS CoV infections.","Sharma, Venu; Sharma, Ankita; Bharate, Sandip B",Current medicinal chemistry,85,22

DFUC2020 provided participants with a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2,000 images for training and 2,000 images for testing. This paper summarizes the results of DFUC2020 by comparing the deep learning-based algorithms proposed by the winning teams: Faster R-CNN, three variants of Faster R-CNN and an ensemble method; YOLOv3; YOLOv5; EfficientDet; and a new Cascade Attention Network. For each deep learning method, we provide a detailed description of model architecture, parameter settings for training and additional stages including pre-processing, data augmentation and post-processing. We provide a comprehensive evaluation for each method. All the methods required a data augmentation stage to increase the number of images available for training and a post-processing stage to remove false positives. The best performance was obtained from Deformable Convolution, a variant of Faster R-CNN, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.6940 and an F1-Score of 0.7434. Finally, we demonstrate that the ensemble method based on different deep learning methods can enhance the F1-Score but not the mAP.","Yap, Moi Hoon; Hachiuma, Ryo; Alavi, Azadeh; Brüngel, Raphael; Cassidy, Bill; Goyal, Manu; Zhu, Hongtao; Rückert, Johannes; Olshansky, Moshe; Huang, Xiao; Saito, Hideo; Hassanpour, Saeed; Friedrich, Christoph M; Ascher, David B; Song, Anping; Kajita, Hiroki; Gillespie, David; Reeves, Neil D; Pappachan, Joseph M; O'Shea, Claire; Frank, Eibe",Computers in biology and medicine,85,1

Surfaces that retain the native conformation of adsorbed proteins (antimetamorphic surfaces) represent one of the main strategies for creating biocompatible materials, which are in great demand in biotechnology. Though the influence of surfaces on protein conformation has been studied for decades, real-time investigations of protein conformational behavior on a surface obtained at the single-molecule or sub-molecular level are still lacking and remain a challenge. In this work, we apply time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) in aqueous solution to visualize the conformational dynamics of individual model protein molecules (E.coli RNA polymerase, RNAP) adsorbed on modified highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces. We quantitatively characterize the evolution of height and shape of individual RNAP molecules adsorbed on a HOPG surface modified with an oligoglycine-hydrocarbon graphite modifier (GM) during the unfolding process and determine the characteristic unfolding time as ∼7 min. Furthermore, we make a HOPG surface antimetamorphic by modifying it with a denatured RNAP protein layer. Our results provide direct evidence of GM-HOPG-induced RNAP unfolding at the single-molecule level and open new strategies for the development and investigation of antimetamorphic graphitic surfaces.","Dubrovin, Evgeniy V; Klinov, Dmitry V; Schäffer, Tilman E","Colloids and surfaces.

The occurrence of perineal hernia after abdominoperineal resection (APR) is rare, but it has been reported in recent years that the incidence of perineal hernia after rectal cancer surgery has increased. This has been attributed to a shift towards extralevator abdominoperineal resection, together with more frequent and long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy. PRESENTATION OF CASE Here, we report a patient with perineal hernia 5 years after APR surgery for rectal cancer. We decided to perform robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery on this patient using the da Vinci Surgical System. The perineal hernia was repaired by primary closure with the placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh as reinforcement for the pelvic floor. No complications occurred during the operation, and the patient was discharged on the third day after the operation. Clinical follow-up proceeded at the designated time intervals without difficulties. DISCUSSION The recurrence rates of perineal hernia are still very high, and due to poor view, suturing, and mesh placement in the deep pelvis, surgeons face many challenges. Many methods have been described, but there is still no consensus as to the optimal repair technique for perineal hernia. CONCLUSION Perineal hernias can be repaired with robot-assisted laparoscopy. Furthermore, compared with the open and laparoscopic methods, suturing and mesh placement are easier with the robot approach.","Li, Deguan; Zhang, Shangxin; Zhang, Zhen; Li, Yongxiang",International journal of colorectal disease,85,31

Material and methods We performed seven robotic perineal radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection operation using Da Vinci Xi HD Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, USA) on single Gel-port platform. The operation is completed in 4 stages: stage 1 open perineal dissection and gel port placement, stage 2 robotic perineal radical prostatectomy, stage 3 robotic pelvic lymph node dissection, stage 4 vesico-urethral anastomosis. In addition to describing the operation technique step by step, we aimed to present the perioperative and postoperative findings of the seven patients who underwent The Tugcu Bakirkoy Technique. Results All operations were successfully completed without any complications in fully the robotic procedure by a single surgeon. Demographic data of the patients were as follows: Mean age (62.1±8 years), mean body mass index (28.2±0.7 kg/m2), mean prostate specific antigen value (10.7±3 ng/mL), and mean prostate volume (64.2±15.3 cc). Mean operative time (184.1±20.2 mins), blood loss (64.2±15.3 cc), hospitalization time (2.1±0.6 days), and time to withdrawal of the urethral catheter (7.8±0.8 days) were also estimated. According to the pathology results, lymph node metastasis was detected in 3 patients while the surgical margin was positive in one. Conclusion We demonstrated for the first time that a new The Tugcu Bakirkoy robotic perineal radical prostatectomy technique which was previously tested in a cadaveric model, can be safely applied for the first time in vivo, and presented our results. On the basis of this, for problems that can not be overcome by traditional methods, this method is a good alternative as a way out. In this regard, it is necessary to carry out advanced studies so that this method can be applied to daily practice.","Tuğcu, Volkan; Akça, Oktay; Şimşek, Abdulmuttalip; Yiğitbaşı, İsmail; Yenice, Mustafa Gürkan; Şahin, Selçuk; Taşcı, Ali İhsan",Turkish journal of urology,85,1

Thus, providers find it challenging to address patients' dignity, and determine their priorities and preferences for treatments and care, at the patients' final stage of life. AIM This study explores the culture-specific influences and current understanding of end-of-life (EOL) communication in the Chinese context. METHODS A qualitative systematic review of qualitative studies was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PsycINFO, PubMed and ERIC databases were searched for studies between January 1994 and July 2019, using keywords 'end of life', 'terminal care', 'communication' and 'Chinese'. Included studies were appraised with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. RESULTS The search strategy yielded 982 entries and 13 studies were included. Six themes were identified in EOL communication in the Chinese context: (1) Chinese philosophies on the meaning of 'good death'. (2) Negative attitudes towards communication on dying. (3) EOL communication as a taboo topic. (4) Clinician-centred approaches to treatment-decision making. (5) Family expectations being prioritised over patient self-autonomy in prognosis disclosure. (6) Care-providers expressing puzzlement over cultural preferences regarding EOL communication. CONCLUSIONS The review detailed the complexity of EOL communication in the Chinese context, urging for a communication model distinct from Western-based practices. Future research could explore a validated communication framework that addresses the local culture, thus enabling an understanding of patients' priorities and interpreting EOL encounters from a cross-cultural perspective.","Pun, Jack K H; Cheung, Ka Man; Chow, James C H; Chan, Wing Lok",BMJ supportive & palliative care,85,1

METHODS A consecutive series of 25 patients (24 unruptured and one ruptured) with anterior circulation aneurysms treated with a pipeline endovascular device were included in the analysis. RESULTS We found two minor clinical events (resolved within 7 days of the procedure), one major event (symptoms present after 7 days), and no mortality. There were no aneurysm ruptures or parenchymal hemorrhages during follow-up. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 3 and 6 months did not change from the prior mRS score for all cases except 1. There was one asymptomatic periprocedural event. There were three intraprocedural complications which resolved without clinical consequences. Six month follow-up angiograms were obtained for 22 aneurysms, showing complete occlusion in 14 (64%) and significantly decreased residual filling in 8 (36%). The status of branches originating from the aneurysm sacs was evaluated in 14 angiograms: 11 were patent (79%), 2 had moderate reduction (14%) and 1 (7%) was occluded. We found six cases of in-stent stenosis (27%) on 6 month DSA, with only one symptomatic case. CONCLUSIONS The pipeline embolization device provides a feasible and technically safe solution for aneurysms at and beyond the circle of Willis.

METHODS A single-institution retrospective chart review was conducted of men treated with pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and SBRT boost (21Gy/19Gy in 2 fractions) to the prostate for prostate cancer. A cohort treated at the same institution with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost (19Gy in 2 fractions) was compared. Propensity-score (PS) matching and multivariable Cox regression were used for analysis. Outcomes were biochemical-recurrence-freedom (BCRF) and metastasis-freedom (MF). RESULTS 131 men were treated with SBRT boost and 101 with HDR boost with median follow-up of 73.4 and 186.0 months, respectively. 68.8% of men had high-risk and 26.0% had unfavorable-intermediate disease, and 94.3% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Five- and 10-year unadjusted BCRF was 88.8%/85.3% for SBRT and 91.8%/74.6% for HDR boost (Log-Rank P=0.3), and 5- and 10-year unadjusted MF was 91.7%/84.3% for SBRT and 95.8%/82.0% for HDR (Log-Rank P=0.8). After adjusting for covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in BCRF (HR 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.79, P=0.6) or MF (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.44-2.57, P=0.9) between SBRT and HDR boost. Similarly, after PS matching, there was no statistically significant difference between SBRT and HDR (BCRF: HR 0.66, 0.27-1.62, P=0.4; MF: HR 0.84, 0.31-2.26, P=0.7). Grade 3+ genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in the SBRT cohort were 4.6% and 1.5%, and 3.0% and 0.0% in the HDR cohorts (P=0.4, Fisher test).

Phenotypic carbapenemase production was confirmed by the modified Hodge test, and the blaOXA-48 gene was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction. Results Out of 1013 urine samples, 15.2% (154/1013) had bacterial growth. Among the isolates, 91.5% (141/154) were Gram-negative bacteria, and E. coli was the most common bacterial isolate (62.9%; 97/154), followed by K. pneumoniae 15.6% (24/154). Among 121 bacterial isolates (97 E. coli isolates and 24 K. pneumoniae isolates), 70.3% (52/121) were multidrug-resistant E. coli and 29.7% (22/121) were multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. In addition, 9.1% (11/121) were carbapenem resistant (both imipenem and meropenem resistant). Development of multidrug resistance and development of carbapenem resistance were significantly associated (p<0.05). Of the 11 carbapenem-resistant isolates, only seven were carbapenemase producers; of these, 28.6% (2/7) were E. coli, 72.4% (5/7) were K. pneumoniae and 42.8% (3/7) had the blaOXA-48 gene. Of the three bacterial isolates with the blaOXA-48 gene, 33.3% (1/3) were E. coli and 66.7% (2/3) were K. pneumoniae. Conclusion One in ten isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were carbapenem resistant. Among carbapenem-resistant isolates, one-third of E. coli and two-thirds of K. pneumoniae had the blaOXA-48 gene. OXA-48 serves as a potential agent to map the distribution of resistance among clinical isolates.","Gurung, Sushma; Kafle, Sonali; Dhungel, Binod; Adhikari, Nabaraj; Thapa Shrestha, Upendra; Adhikari, Bipin; Banjara, Megha Raj; Rijal, Komal Raj; Ghimire, Prakash",Infection and drug resistance,85,9

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","Sachser, Cedric; Olaru, Gabriel; Pfeiffer, Elisa; Brähler, Elmar; Clemens, Vera; Rassenhofer, Miriam; Witt, Andreas; Fegert, Jörg M",Social science & medicine,85,1

However, it remains uncertain where the initial α-synuclein aggregates originate. We have hypothesized that Parkinson's disease comprises two subtypes. A brain-first (top-down) type, where α-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain with secondary spreading to the peripheral autonomic nervous system; and a body-first (bottom-up) type, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system and then spreads to the brain. We also hypothesized that isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD) is a prodromal phenotype for the body-first type. Using multimodal imaging, we tested the hypothesis by quantifying neuronal dysfunction in structures corresponding to Braak stages I, II and III involvement in three distinct patient groups. We included 37 consecutive de novo patients with Parkinson's disease into this case-control PET study. Patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into 24 RBD-negative (PDRBD-) and 13 RBD-positive cases (PDRBD+) and a comparator group of 22 iRBD patients. We used 11C-donepezil PET/CT to assess cholinergic (parasympathetic) innervation, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to measure cardiac sympathetic innervation, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to measure the integrity of locus coeruleus pigmented neurons, and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA) PET to assess putaminal dopamine storage capacity. Colon volume and transit times were assessed with CT scans and radiopaque markers. Imaging data from the three groups were interrogated with ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests corrected for multiple comparisons. The PDRBD- and PDRBD+ groups showed similar marked reductions in putaminal FDOPA-specific uptake, whereas two-thirds of iRBD patients had normal scans (P < 10-13, ANOVA). When compared to the PDRBD- patients, the PDRBD+ and iRBD patients showed reduced mean MIBG heart:mediastinum ratios (P < 10-5, ANOVA) and colon 11C-donepezil standard uptake values (P = 0.008, ANOVA). The PDRBD+ group trended towards a reduced mean MRI locus coeruleus: pons ratio compared to PDRBD- (P = 0.07, t-test). In comparison to the other groups, the PDRBD+ group also had enlarged colon volumes (P < 0.001, ANOVA) and delayed colonic transit times (P = 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). The combined iRBD and PDRBD+ patient data were compatible with a body-first trajectory, characterized by initial loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-colonic donepezil signal followed by loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake. In contrast, the PDRBD- data were compatible with a brain-first trajectory, characterized by primary loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake followed by a secondary loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-donepezil signal. These findings support the existence of brain-first and body-first subtypes of Parkinson's disease.","Horsager, Jacob; Andersen, Katrine B; Knudsen, Karoline; Skjærbæk, Casper; Fedorova, Tatyana D; Okkels, Niels; Schaeffer, Eva; Bonkat, Sarah K; Geday, Jacob; Otto, Marit; Sommerauer, Michael; Danielsen, Erik H; Bech, Einar; Kraft, Jonas; Munk, Ole L; Hansen, Sandra D; Pavese, Nicola; Göder, Robert; Brooks, David J; Berg, Daniela; Borghammer, Per",Brain : a journal of neurology,85,26

The use of molecular techniques, such as PCR, has substantially improved the sensitivity of enterovirus detection compared to that of virus culture methods. PCR-based methods also can detect a much wider range of EV variants, including those within species A, as well as human parechoviruses (HPeVs) that often grow poorly in vitro and which previously have been underdiagnosed by traditional methods. To exploit these developments, we developed a real-time one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for the rapid and sensitive detection of EV and HPeV in clinical specimens. Two commercially available RT-PCR kits were used (method I, Platinum one-step kit; method II, Express qPCR one-step kit) with primers and probes targeting the EV and HPeV 5'-untranslated regions (5'UTR). Amplification dynamics (threshold cycle [C(T)]values and efficiencies) of absolutely quantified full-length RNA transcripts representative of EV species A to D and HPeV were similar, demonstrating the effectiveness of both assays across the range of currently described human EV and HPeV variants. Probit analysis of multiple endpoint replicates demonstrated comparable sensitivities of the assays for EV and HPeV (method I, approximately 10 copies per reaction for both targets; method II, 20 copies per reaction). C(T) values were highly reproducible on repeat testing of positive controls within assays and between assay runs. Considering the sample turnaround time of less than 3 h, the multiplexed one-step RT-PCR method provides rapid diagnostic testing for EV and HPeV in cases of suspected central nervous system infections in a clinically relevant time frame.","Bennett, Susan; Harvala, Heli; Witteveldt, Jeroen; McWilliam Leitch, E Carol; McLeish, Nigel; Templeton, Kate; Gunson, Rory; Carman, William F; Simmonds, Peter",Journal of clinical microbiology,85,1

Orf virus (ORFV) interferon resistance protein (VIR) is the principal virulence protein that encodes a dsRNA-binding protein to inhibit host antiviral response. p53 is one of the key proteins of the host antiviral innate immunity. It not only enhances type I interferon secretion but also induces apoptosis in infected cells, and plays a crucial role in the immune response against various viral infections. However, it remains to be elucidated what role p53 plays in ORFV replication and whether ORFV's own protein VIR regulates p53 expression to promote self-replication. In this study, we showed that p53 has an antiviral effect on ORFV and can inhibit ORFV replication. In addition, ORFV nonstructural protein VIR interacts with p53 and degrades p53, which inhibits p53-mediated positive regulation of downstream antiviral genes. This study provides new insight into the immune evasion mediated by ORFV and identifies VIR as an antagonistic factor for ORFV to evade the antiviral response.","Yan, Ming-Hao; Wang, Ling-Ling; Hao, Jun-Hong; Zhang, Xue-Gang; Shen, Chao-Chao; Zhang, Da-Jun; Zheng, Hai-Xue; Liu, Xiang-Tao; Zhang, Ke-Shan",Viral immunology,85,1

However, there are cohorts of patients in whom scintigraphy findings are negative or equivocal. We evaluated the role of (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET in a selected group of patients with negative or weakly positive findings on (111)In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy to determine whether (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET is able to detect additional disease and, if so, whether patient management is altered. METHODS Fifty-one patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors were included. Of the 51 patients, 35 who were negative and 16 equivocal for uptake on (111)In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy underwent (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET. Findings were compared using a region-by-region analysis. All findings were verified with CT or MRI. After (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET, all cases were reviewed to determine whether the (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET findings resulted in any alteration in management, in terms of suitability for peptide receptor therapy, somatostatin analogs, and surgery. RESULTS Of the 51 patients, 47 had evidence of disease on cross-sectional imaging or biochemically. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET was positive in 41 of these 47 patients (87.2%). No false-positive lesions were identified. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET detected 168 of the 226 lesions (74.3%) that were identified with cross-sectional imaging. (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET identified significantly more lesions than (111)In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between (68)Ga-DOTATATE uptake and histologic grade of neuroendocrine tumors. (68)Ga-DOTATATE imaging changed management in 36 patients (70.6%), who were subsequently deemed suitable for peptide receptor-targeted therapy. CONCLUSION In patients with negative or equivocal (111)In-DTPA-octreotide findings, (68)Ga-DOTATATE PET identifies additional lesions and may alter management in most cases.","Srirajaskanthan, Rajaventhan; Kayani, Irfan; Quigley, Anne Marie; Soh, Jade; Caplin, Martyn E; Bomanji, Jamshed","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",85,1

METHODS Data from 62 treatment-naive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), with 83 lesions in challenging locations, and who met the Milan criteria and underwent CT-RFA between June 2013 and June 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into one of two groups according to different treatment modalities: study group (TAE combined with RFA assisted by 3DVAPS [n = 32]); and control (RFA only [n = 30]). Oncological outcomes included ablation-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors associated with LTP and OS. RESULTS HCC lesions (mean size, 1.9 ± 1.0 mm in diameter) abutting the gastrointestinal tract (n = 25), heart and diaphragm (n = 21), major vessels (n = 13), and gallbladder (n = 3) were treated. A significant difference was detected in LTP between the two groups (P = 0.034), with no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.193). There were no severe complications related to ablation. Univariate analysis revealed that sex (P = 0.046) and child-turcotte-pugh (CTP) grade (P<0.001) were risk factors for OS, whereas CTP grade and treatment method (P<0.001) were risk factors for LTP. Multivariate analysis revealed that CTP grade B (P = 0.005) was independently associated with poor OS, and RFA alone (P<0.001) was independently associated with poor LTP. CONCLUSION CT-RFA combined with TAE assisted by a 3DVAPS provided ideal clinical efficiency for HCC in challenging locations and was a highly safe treatment modality.","Huang, Zhi-Mei; Zuo, Meng-Xuan; Gu, Yang-Kui; Gu, Hai-Feng; Lai, Chun-Xiao; Zhang, Tian-Qi; Wang, Xiu-Chen; An, Chao; Huang, Jin-Hua",Abdominal radiology,85,16

Cartilage in the adult does not regenerate very efficiently in vivo; and as a result, osteoarthritis leads to irreversible cartilage loss and is accompanied by chronic pain and immobility (1,2). Cartilage tissue engineering offers promising potential to regenerate and restore tissue function. This technology typically involves seeding chondrocytes into natural or synthetic scaffolds and culturing the resulting 3D construct in a balanced medium over a period of time with a goal of engineering a biochemically and biomechanically mature tissue that can be transplanted into a defect site in vivo (3-6). Achieving an optimal condition for chondrocyte growth and matrix deposition is essential for the success of cartilage tissue engineering. In the native joint cavity, cartilage at the articular surface of the bone is bathed in synovial fluid. This clear and viscous fluid provides nutrients to the avascular articular cartilage and contains growth factors, cytokines and enzymes that are important for chondrocyte metabolism (7,8). Furthermore, synovial fluid facilitates low-friction movement between cartilaginous surfaces mainly through secreting two key components, hyaluronan and lubricin (9 10). In contrast, tissue engineered cartilage is most often cultured in artificial media. While these media are likely able to provide more defined conditions for studying chondrocyte metabolism, synovial fluid most accurately reflects the natural environment of which articular chondrocytes reside in. Indeed, synovial fluid has the advantage of being easy to obtain and store, and can often be regularly replenished by the body. Several groups have supplemented the culture medium with synovial fluid in growing human, bovine, rabbit and dog chondrocytes, but mostly used only low levels of synovial fluid (below 20%) (11-25). While chicken, horse and human chondrocytes have been cultured in the medium with higher percentage of synovial fluid, these culture systems were two-dimensional (26-28). Here we present our method of culturing human articular chondrocytes in a 3D system with a high percentage of synovial fluid (up to 100%) over a period of 21 days. In doing so, we overcame a major hurdle presented by the high viscosity of the synovial fluid. This system provides the possibility of studying human chondrocytes in synovial fluid in a 3D setting, which can be further combined with two other important factors (oxygen tension and mechanical loading) (29,30) that constitute the natural environment for cartilage to mimic the natural milieu for cartilage growth. Furthermore, This system may also be used for assaying synovial fluid activity on chondrocytes and provide a platform for developing cartilage regeneration technologies and therapeutic options for arthritis.","Brand, Joshua A; McAlindon, Timothy E; Zeng, Li",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,85,24

Here, we report that Wnt-induced macropinocytosis is regulated through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the β-catenin destruction complex. We find that mutation of Axin1, a tumor suppressor and component of the destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, β-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation.

The RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a major focus of vaccine development. Despite over 60 years of research, there is no licensed vaccine for RSV. AREAS COVERED : The primary focus of this review is the novel RSV-F recombinant nanoparticle vaccine from Novavax utilizing the F protein, a conserved and immunodominant surface glycoprotein. This RSV F recombinant nanoparticle vaccine adsorbed to 0.4 mg of aluminum phosphate was ultimately administered by a single intramuscular injection during the third trimester of pregnancy in an effort to induce passive immunity in newborns. Its mechanism, performance in clinical trials, and place in RSV vaccine history are discussed. EXPERT OPINION The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated in pregnant women and the results suggest potential benefits with respect to other medically relevant end-point events involving RSV-associated respiratory and all-cause disease in infants. However, the RSV-F recombinant nanoparticle vaccine did not meet the pre-specified primary success criteria for efficacy against RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in infants up to 90 days of life. The potential benefits to infants from maternal immunization and excellent safety profile warrant further confirmatory studies.","Blunck, Brittani N; Rezende, Wanderson; Piedra, Pedro A",Expert review of vaccines,85,1

Based on two alternative approaches (that is, the beta diversity partitioning proposed by Baselga and the Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD) partitioning proposed by Legendre), we examined the patterns of beta diversity components of lacustrine benthos, from bacteria to diatoms and chironomids, in the surface sediments along a 100-m water-depth gradient in Lugu Lake. We further quantified the relative importance of spatial, environmental and biotic variables in explaining water-depth patterns in beta diversity. Based on the Baselga's framework, there was a taxonomic dependency for the patterns of beta diversity components with water-depth, showing a significant species turnover pattern for bacteria, while diatoms and chironomids showed significant nestedness. This dependency was also evident in the patterns of community uniqueness with water-depth because based on Legendre's framework, the LCBD decreased with water depth for bacteria whereas increased with depth for diatoms. The total beta diversity and species turnover of bacteria could be explained by the pure effects of spatial, environmental and biotic variables. A total of 26.8% and 23.6% of the nestedness component of diatoms and chironomids was explained by environmental variables, respectively, while species turnover was mostly related to spatial variables. Bacteria total LCBD and species replacement were driven only by environmental variables. For diatoms and chironomids, however, most of the total LCBD and its two components were explained by spatial variables, and biotic variables were most important for the diatom replacement component. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for community organizations along water-depth gradients from the perspective of beta diversity components.","Wu, Kaiyuan; Zhao, Wenqian; Li, Mingjia; Picazo, Félix; Soininen, Janne; Shen, Ji; Zhu, Lifeng; Cheng, Xiaoying; Wang, Jianjun",The Science of the total environment,85,1

Methods In this study, 180 patients, aged between 22 and 65 classified as Class I-II in ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) and operated under elective conditions were included. Patients were assigned into two groups: Patients intubated with GVL Group G (n=90) and patients intubated with ML Group M (n=90). In both groups, intubation time and the number of trials were recorded. HR (Heart Rate), SpO2 (Peripheral Capillary Oxygen Saturation), SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure), DBP (Diastolic Blood Pressure) and MBP (Mean Blood Pressure) scores were recorded at preinduction, post-induction, post-intubation and three minutes after intubation. Post-operative intubation-associated complications were recorded. Results Post intubation HR, DBP and MBP scores were found to be significantly higher in Group M than Group G (p=0,006, p=0.013, p=0.011). Intubation time was found to be significantly higher in Group G than in group M (35.3±10.3, 22.1±7.7 sec). There was no significant difference between the groups' number of trials and intubation-associated complications. Conclusion Despite its long intubation time, we believe that GVL may be the first choice laryngoscopy method in the thyroid or parathyroid cases that intubated with a low dose muscle relaxant for neuromonitoring since it has a slight effect than ML on hemodynamism it does not increase mucosal damage and has improved visibility.","Gunes, Murat; Cinar, Ayse Surhan; Uludag, Mehmet",Sisli Etfal Hastanesi tip bulteni,85,1

The operational benefits, however, have been less explored. Here, we report our initial clinical experience in implementing fast MRI techniques for outpatient brain imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Aggregate acquisition times were extracted from the medical record on consecutive imaging examinations performed during matched pre-implementation (7/1/2019-12/31/2019) and post-implementation periods (7/1/2020-12/31/2020). Expected acquisition time reduction for each MRI protocol was calculated through manual collection of acquisition times for the conventional and accelerated sequences performed during the pre- and post-implementation periods. Aggregate and expected acquisition times were compared for the five most frequently performed brain MRI protocols: brain without contrast (BR-), brain with and without contrast (BR+), multiple sclerosis (MS), memory loss (MML), and epilepsy (EPL). RESULTS The expected time reductions for BR-, BR+, MS, MML, and EPL protocols were 6.6 min, 11.9 min, 14 min, 10.8 min, and 14.1 min, respectively. The overall median aggregate acquisition time was 31 [25, 36] min for the pre-implementation period and 18 [15, 22] min for the post-implementation period, with a difference of 13 min (42%). The median acquisition time was reduced by 4 min (25%) for BR-, 14.0 min (44%) for BR+, 14 min (38%) for MS, 11 min (52%) for MML, and 16 min (35%) for EPL. CONCLUSION The implementation of fast brain MRI sequences significantly reduced the acquisition times for the most commonly performed outpatient brain MRI protocols.","Lang, Min; Cartmell, Samuel; Tabari, Azadeh; Briggs, Daniel; Pianykh, Oleg; Kirsch, John; Cauley, Stephen; Lo, Wei-Ching; Risacher, Seretha; Filho, Augusto Goncalves; Succi, Marc D; Rapalino, Otto; Schaefer, Pamela; Conklin, John; Huang, Susie Y",Academic radiology,85,1

In order to further validate this salivary biomarker, we investigated how periodontal bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and systemic and local host immune responses relate to CRS. Subgingival plaque, saliva, and serum samples collected from 445 individuals were used in the analyses. Plaque levels of 28 microbial species, especially those of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia, and serum and salivary levels of IgA and IgG against these five species were determined. Additionally, LPS activity was measured. High CRS associated strongly with all IgA/IgG antibody and LPS levels in saliva, whereas in serum the associations were not that obvious. In the final logistic regression model, the best predictors of high CRS were saliva IgA burden against the five species (OR 7.04, 95% CI 2.25-22.0), IgG burden (3.79, 1.78-8.08), LPS (2.19, 1.38-3.47), and the sum of 17 subgingival Gram-negative species (6.19, 2.10-18.3).

METHODS Between 2012 and 2017, among 385 patients who underwent 820 TA in our department, 65 (17%) patients (HCC = 11, LM = 54) had exclusive laparoscopic TA representing 112 lesions (HCC = 17, LM = 95). TA was associated with other procedures in 57% of cases (liver resection 81%). All TA were done without liver clamping. Median tumor size was 1.8 cm [ranges from 0.3 to 4.5], 18% of the lesions were larger than 3 cm in size and 11% close to major liver vessels. Tumors locations were 77.5% in right liver, 36% in S7&S8, and 46% in S7&S8&S4a. RESULTS Mortality was nil and morbidity rate 15.4% including Dindo-Clavien > II grade 3%. The median follow-up was 24 months [0.77-75]. Per lesion LR rate after TA was 18% (n = 19 patients) with a mean time of 7.6 months. Among patients with LR, 18 (95%) could have been re-treated successfully (new resection = 11, re-TA = 7). Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor location in S7 alone, S7&S8 and/or S7, S8, or S4a were independent risk factors of LR after TA. CONCLUSIONS Exclusive laparoscopic TA is a safe and an effective tool to treat liver malignancies with or without liver resection. Other than classical risk factors, tumor location in upper segments of the liver, are independent risk factors for LR.","Ledoux, Geoffrey; Amroun, Koceila; Rhaiem, Rami; Cagniet, Audrey; Aghaei, Arman; Bouche, Olivier; Hoeffel, Christine; Sommacale, Daniele; Piardi, Tullio; Kianmanesh, Reza",Surgical endoscopy,85,16

There are several techniques available for dividing the mesoappendix including the using an endostapler, a LigaSure (Covidien, Boulder, CO), a harmonic scalpel (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH), or electrocautery. Although it is the least expensive approach, many feel that electrocautery is an unsafe method of dividing the mesoappendix. Here we present our experience with the use of solely electrocautery to divide the mesoappendix. METHODS Over a period of 12 years, a total of 442 laparoscopic appendectomies were logged into our database. Each appendectomy was performed by coagulating and dividing the mesoappendix with a Maryland dissector or in some cases a hook electrocautery. Three 0-PDS Endoloops (Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH) were then used to ligate the base of the appendix, two proximal and one distal. Patient weight, age, operative time, perforated versus nonperforated, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were queried. RESULTS Of the 442 cases, 71 were perforated (16%). The mean time for nonperforated appendectomies was 26 minutes and 38 minutes for perforated. There was one case of postoperative bleeding managed nonoperatively in a patient with previously undiagnosed factor VIII deficiency. The cost of each endoloop was $22. CONCLUSION Although some have questioned the safety of using electrocautery alone to divide the mesoappendix for fear that it may not be adequate to seal the appendiceal artery, may take excessive time, or may cause collateral tissue injury, this has not been our experience. Therefore, the use of more costly instruments to divide the mesoappendix such as the endostapler, LigaSure, or harmonic scalpel seems unwarranted. This study demonstrates that electrocautery for the mesoappendix and endoloops for the appendix is safe, effective, and cost-efficient.","Ponsky, Todd A; Rothenberg, Steven S",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

This study evaluated the well-being of rats housed in a commercially available multilevel rat caging system, with or without access to the upper level of the caging. The evaluation methodologies included assessment of behavioral observations in the home cage, physiological assessment of metabolism and immune function, and determination of the affective state using a spatial cognitive bias assay. The study determined that rats that were provided access to the full multilevel cage during testing after initial restriction to the lower level of the cage demonstrated behavioral changes consistent with a positive affective state, while those with no changes to their housing situation had no significant differences in their affective states. Rats that were consistently housed with access restricted to the lower level of the cage exhibited a tendency to increased neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios as compared with those provided with access to all levels of the multilevel cage. There were no differences in body weight demonstrated between the experimental groups. Overall use of the cage space, as documented through analysis of behavioral observations in the home cage, demonstrated no significant differences in preferred location in the cage during the light or dark cycles, though rats with access to both levels of the cage were significantly more active during the light cycle.

We here described our 24-month experience SILS cholecystectomy. METHODS Between February 2009 and 2011, patients referred for cholecystectomy to the General and Endocrine Unit of our institution who agreed to undergo SILS were included in a prospective study. All operations were performed by the same surgical team specially trained in this type of surgery. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients. The same operative technique was used in all patients. Data of patients undergoing SILS cholecystectomy were compared with those from an uncontrolled group of patients undergoing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same study period. RESULTS The SILS and standard cholecystectomy groups included 120 patients each. SILS was performed in all patients and none of them required conversion to an open procedure. The median operating time of 45 minutes in the SILS group was not significantly different from that in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. We suture fascial edge with simple stitches under direct vision, thus reducing the risk of incisional hernia in SILS group (P=.046).

Previous animal studies reported that repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli potentiated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, but no clinical study has examined the effects of this intervention on hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation. We thus performed a single-center, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate whether repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung reduce hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing one-lung ventilation were randomized into two groups (n = 68 each). Before one-lung ventilation, in the intermittent hypoxia group, the nondependent lung was not ventilated for 2 min and then ventilated for 2 min while the dependent lung was continuously ventilated. This was repeated five times. In the continuous normoxia group, both lungs were ventilated for 20 min. We measured SpO2, PaO2, FiO2, PaCO2, SaO2, and central venous oxygen saturation during one-lung ventilation. The primary outcome was the number of patients with hypoxemia defined as a SpO2 <95% during one-lung ventilation, which was analyzed with a chi-squared test. RESULTS Hypoxemia was less frequent in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group during OLV [6/68 (8.8%) vs 17/68 (25.0%), risk ratio (95% CI) 0.35 (0.15-0.84), p = 0.012]. The PaO2 (p = 0.008 for 30 min and 0.007 for 60 min) and PaO2/FiO2 (p = 0.008 for both) were higher 30 and 60 min after starting one-lung ventilation, and the alveolar-arterial pressure gradient (p = 0.010) and shunt index (p = 0.008) were lower 30 min after starting one-lung ventilation in the intermittent hypoxia group than in the continuous normoxia group. Postoperative adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS Repeated intermittent hypoxic stimuli to the operative lung seemed to potentiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and thus reduced hypoxemia during the subsequent one-lung ventilation.","Yoon, Susie; Kim, Bo Rim; Min, Se-Hee; Lee, Jaehun; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Seo, Jeong-Hwa",PloS one,85,16

Geometric considerations of rigid rod packing imply that a domain of sufficiently short rods in a background membrane of long rods is more susceptible to twist than the inverse structure, a long-rod domain in a short-rod membrane. The midplane tilt at the interdomain edge forces splay, which, in turn, manifests as spontaneous edge curvature with energetics controlled by the length asymmetry of constituent rods. A thermodynamic model of such tilt-curvature coupling at interdomain edges explains a number of experimental observations, including annularly shaped long-rod domains, and a nonmonotonic dependence of edge twist on domain radius. Our work shows how coupling between orientational and compositional degrees of freedom in two-dimensional fluids gives rise to complex shapes of fluid domains, analogous to shape transitions in 3D fluid vesicles.","Miller, Joia M; Hall, Doug; Robaszewski, Joanna; Sharma, Prerna; Hagan, Michael F; Grason, Gregory M; Dogic, Zvonimir",Science advances,85,5

We used a ligand-based virtual screening analysis to identify selenoglycolicamides with potential antitumor activity. Results & Conclusion: Compounds 3, 6, 7 and 8 were selected for in vitro cytotoxicity tests against various cell lines, according to spectrophotometry results. Compound 3 presented the best cytotoxicity results against a promyelocytic leukemia line (HL-60) and was able to induce cell death at a frequency similar to that observed for doxorubicin. The docking study showed that compound 3 has good interaction energies with the targets caspase-3, 7 and 8, which are components of the apoptotic pathway. These results suggested that selenium has significant pharmacological potential for the selective targeting of tumor cells, inducing molecular and cellular events that culminate in tumor cell death.","Ferreira de Queiroz, Ericka Fernanda; de Sousa Luis, José Alixandre; Sousa Dantas, Diego de; Pereira Arruda, Lúcia Cristina; Bento da Silva, Ellen Cordeiro; de Sousa Silva, João Manoel; da Silva Souza, Helivaldo Diogenes; Costa Barros, Renata Priscila; de Mascena Costa, Luciana Amaral; de Athayde Filho, Petrônio Figueiras; Scotti, Luciana; Scotti, Marcus Tullius; Gomes Filho, Manoel Adrião",Future medicinal chemistry,85,31

There are no routine recommendation to detect etiological causes of FS for neurological perspective, further knowledge about the etiological causes of FS in children will support preventive measures and follow-up strategies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the percentage of respiratory viruses in children with FS. METHODS This prospective multicenter study, entitled ""Viral etiological causes of febrile seizures for respiratory pathogens (EFES Study)"" examined representative populations in eight different cities in Turkey between March 1, 2016 and April 1, 2017. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from all children at presentation. A respiratory multiplex array was performed to detect for influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; human parainfluenza virus 1-2-3 and 4; human coronavirus 229E and OC43; human rhinovirus; human enterovirus; human adenovirus; human bocavirus; human metapneumovirus. RESULTS During the study period, at least one virus was detected in 82.7% (144/174) of children with FS. The most frequently detected virus was adenovirus, followed by influenza A and influenza B. Detection of more than one virus was present in 58.3% of the children with FS, and the most common co-existence was the presence of adenovirus and influenza B. In children younger than 12 months, Coronavirus OC43 was the most common, while influenza A was most frequently observed in children older than 48 months (p < 0.05). Human bocavirus was common in children who experienced complex FS, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A was more common in children who experienced simple FS. Influenza B virus was the most common virus identified in children who were experiencing their first incidence of FS (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that respiratory viruses are important in the etiology of FS in children. The results show that antibiotics must be prescribed carefully in children with FS since the majority of cases are related to viral causes. Widespread use of the existing quadrivalent influenza vaccine might be useful for the prevention of FS related to the flu. Further vaccine candidates for potential respiratory pathogens, including RSV, might be helpful for the prevention of FS.","Carman, Kursat Bora; Calik, Mustafa; Karal, Yasemin; Isikay, Sedat; Kocak, Ozan; Ozcelik, Aysima; Yazar, Ahmet Sami; Nuhoglu, Cagatay; Sag, Cigdem; Kilic, Omer; Dinleyici, Meltem; Lacinel Gurlevik, Sibel; Yimenicioglu, Sevgi; Ekici, Arzu; Perk, Peren; Tosun, Ayse; Isik, Ilhan; Yarar, Coskun; Arslantas, Didem; Dinleyici, Ener Cagri",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,85,31

Teachers have had to face relentless and challenging working conditions, take on new roles and responsibilities, and embrace new ways of working. We searched reports and the available research literature on teacher mental health between September 2020 and October 2020. In our perspective piece, we summarise this literature and draw attention to the struggles of Australian school teachers and how Covid-19 has impacted their mental health. CONCLUSIONS To date, there has been a lack of research focusing on teacher mental health both internationally and in Australia.

Due to the unobservability, the time interval between transmission generations (TG), though important for understanding the disease transmission patterns, of COVID-19 cannot be directly summarized from surveillance data. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the TG and the pre-symptomatic transmission period from the serial interval observations from the individual transmission events. As the results, we estimate the mean of TG at 4.0 days (95%CI: 3.3-4.6), and the mean of pre-symptomatic transmission period at 2.2 days (95%CI: 1.3-4.7). We approximate the mean latent period of 3.3 days, and 32.2% (95%CI: 10.3-73.7) of the secondary infections may be due to pre-symptomatic transmission.

A few studies had described the use of falciform ligament (FL) for MPV reconstruction and received encouraging preliminary effects. AIMS This study was designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of this technique compared with others. METHODS Patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with MPV resection for PDAC from 2009 to 2018 were enrolled. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed, MPV reconstructions using FL were distinguished and compared with other techniques. RESULTS 146 patients underwent MPV reconstruction, and 13 received FL venoplasty. Other reconstruction techniques included primary end-to-end anastomosis (primary, n = 30), lateral venorrhaphy (LV, n = 19), polytetrafluoroethylene conduit interposition (PTFE, n = 24), iliac artery (IA) allografts interposition (n = 47), and portal vein (PV) allografts interposition (n = 13). FL group holds the advantages of shortest operation time (p = 0.023), lowest blood loss (p = 0.109), and shortest postoperative hospital stay (p = 0.125). The grouped patency rates of FL, primary, LV, PTFE, IA, and PV were 100%, 90%, 68%, 54%, 68%, and 85% respectively. Comparison displayed that FL had the highest patency rate (p = 0.008) and lowest antiplatelet/anticoagulation proportion (p = 0.000). Complications and long-term survival were similar among different techniques. The median survival time of patent group (24.0 months, 95% CI: 22.0-26.0) was much longer than that of the thrombosed (17.0 months, 95% CI: 13.7-20.3), though without significant difference (P = 0.148). CONCLUSIONS PD with MPV resection and reconstruction by FL is safe, feasible, and efficacious, it might provide a potential benefit for patients.","Shao, Yi; Feng, Jiaojiao; Jiang, Yuancong; Hu, Zhenhua; Wu, Jian; Zhang, Min; Shen, Yan; Zheng, Shusen",BMC surgery,85,30

In this work, an electrical impedance flow cytometry was fabricated based on microfluidics with constriction microchannel to simultaneously characterize the mechanical and electrical properties of single plant cells. Protoplasts from two model plant species, the herbaceous Arabidopsis thaliana and the woody Populus trichocarpa, could be readily discriminated by their respective mechanical traits, but not by electrical impedance. On the contrary, overexpression of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) on plasma membrane resulted in changes in cell electrical impedance instead of cell deformability. During primary cell wall (PCW) regeneration, this extracellular layer outside of protoplasts introduced dramatic variations in both mechanical and electrical properties of single plant cells. Furthermore, the effects of auxin, an essential phytohormone regulating PCW reformation, were validated on this platform. Taken together, our results revealed a novel application of microfluidic impedance flow cytometry in the field of plant science to simultaneously characterize dual biophysical properties at single cell resolution, which could be further developed as a powerful and reliable tool for plant cell phenotyping and cell fate specification.","Han, Ziyu; Chen, Lincai; Zhang, Shuaihua; Wang, Jiehua; Duan, Xuexin",Analytical chemistry,85,1

It is also unknown if e-consult utilization during the pandemic replaced or merely deferred the need for a specialty appointment. We evaluated if primary care providers' (PCPs) e-consult utilization and specialists' recommendations for specialty appointments changed after the transition to telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cohort study used an interrupted time series analysis of e-consult utilization in a large, urban academic health care system between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020; the post-telemedicine time period began March 15, 2020. The primary outcome measure was the odds of an e-consult ordered during a PCP appointment; the secondary outcome measure was the odds of a specialist recommending a specialty appointment in an e-consult. Results: During 193,263 PCP appointments, 1,318 e-consults were placed to internal medicine subspecialties. Compared to the pre-telemedicine time period, the odds of a PCP ordering an e-consult increased (OR 1.04, 95% CI [1.02-1.07]) and the odds of specialists recommending specialty appointments increased (OR 1.11, 95% CI [1.06-1.15]). Conclusions: E-consult use increased following the transition to telemedicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PCPs consider the e-consult a valuable tool for patient care when there is limited availability of specialty appointments. However, recommendations for specialty appointments following an e-consult also increased, suggesting that the e-consult may not replace the need for a specialty appointment.","Leyton, Christopher; Zhang, Chenshu; Rikin, Sharon",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,85,31

OBJECTIVES Our aim was to present an epidemiological analysis of the first two months (March and April 2020) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. PATIENTS AND METHODS This analysis was based on data from epidemiological reports collected between March 4 and April 30, 2020, by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. These epidemiological reports include data on sociodemographic characteristics of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the number of COVID-19 related deaths, the number of recovered COVID-19 patients, as well as the number of laboratory tests performed. Results: From March 4 to April 30, 2020, a total of 12,877 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were registered in Poland (55.7% women, mean age 50.6 (20.5) years). The RT-PCR test was performed on 338,000 patients. The notification rate for COVID-19 was 33.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. One-third of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were among quarantined persons, 26.1% were related to the healthcare system (hospital or clinic), and 13.3% occurred in nursing homes. As of April 30, 2020, 644 COVID-19-related deaths were registered in Poland (46.5% women). The death rate for the whole country was 1.7 per 100,000 inhabitants.

Methods: Minimally invasive autopsies from lung, heart, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, stomach, intestine, thyroid and skin were performed on three patients died of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Chongqing, China. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and histochemical staining were performed to investigate the pathological changes of indicated organs or tissues. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells as well as the expression of 2019-nCoV proteins. Real time PCR was carried out to detect the RNA of 2019-nCoV. Results: Various damages were observed in the alveolar structure, with minor serous exudation and fibrin exudation. Hyaline membrane formation was observed in some alveoli. The infiltrated immune cells in alveoli were majorly macrophages and monocytes. Moderate multinucleated giant cells, minimal lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils were also observed. Most of infiltrated lymphocytes were CD4-positive T cells. Significant proliferation of type II alveolar epithelia and focal desquamation of alveolar epithelia were also indicated. The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested, edematous and widened, with modest infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes. Hyaline thrombi were found in a minority of microvessels. Focal hemorrhage in lung tissue, organization of exudates in some alveolar cavities, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosiswere observed. Part of the bronchial epithelia were exfoliated. Coronavirus particles in bronchial mucosal epithelia and type II alveolar epithelia were observed under electron microscope. Immunohistochemical staining showed that part of the alveolar epithelia and macrophages were positive for 2019-nCoV antigen. Real time PCR analyses identified positive signals for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. Decreased numbers of lymphocyte, cell degeneration and necrosis were observed in spleen. Furthermore, degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells, formation of hyaline thrombus in small vessels, and pathological changes of chronic diseases were observed in other organs and tissues, while no evidence of coronavirus infection was observed in these organs. Conclusion: s The lungs from novel coronavirus pneumonia patients manifest significant pathological lesions, including the alveolar exudative inflammation and interstitial inflammation, alveolar epithelium proliferation and hyaline membrane formation. While the 2019-nCoV is mainly distributed in lung, the infection also involves in the damages of heart, vessels, liver, kidney and other organs.

METHODS Papers were identified by searching Medline and Google Scholar, reference lists/citations and contacting key authors, with no date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria were as follows: leukaemia, HSCT+TBI, aged ≤ 24 years at HSCT and changes in body composition (total fat, central adiposity, adipose tissue function, muscle mass, muscle function). Quality was assessed using a brief Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS Of 900 papers, 20 were included: seven controlled, five uncontrolled studies and eight case reports. Study quality appeared good. There was little evidence of differences in total fat/weight for HSCT + TBI groups (compared to healthy controls/population norms/short stature controls). There was some evidence of significantly higher central adiposity and differences in adipose tissue function (compared to leukaemic/non-leukaemic controls). Muscle mass was significantly lower (compared to healthy/obese controls). Muscle function results were inconclusive but suggested impairment. Case reports confirmed a lipodystrophic phenotype. CONCLUSIONS Early remodelling of adipose tissue and loss of skeletal muscle are evident following HSCT + TBI for CTYA leukaemia, with extreme phenotype of overt lipodystrophy. There is some evidence for reduced muscle effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS Body composition changes in patients after HSCT + TBI are apparent by early adult life and link with the risk of excess cardiometabolic morbidity seen in adult survivors.

We used a real-world dataset to characterize the health care burden associated with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) with particular emphasis on strong opioids. METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large UK primary care dataset linked to hospital data. Patients prescribed opioids during 2016 were selected and episodes of opioid therapy constructed. Episodes with ≥84 days of exposure were classified as chronic, with date of first prescription as the index date. The main analysis focused on patients prescribed strong opioids who were laxative naive. Constipation was defined by ≥2 laxative prescriptions during the opioid episode. Patients for whom initial laxative therapy escalated by switch, augmentation, or dose were defined as OIC unstable, and the first 3 lines of OIC escalation were classified. Health care costs accrued in the first 12 months of the opioid episode were aggregated and compared. FINDINGS A total of 27,629 opioid episodes were identified; 5916 (21.4%) involved a strong opioid for patients who were previously laxative naive. Of these patients, 2886 (48.8%) were defined as the OIC population; 941 (33.26%) were classified as stable. Of the 1945 (67.4%) episodes classified as unstable, 849 (43.7%), 360 (18.5%), and 736 (37.8%) had 1, 2, and ≥3 changes of laxative prescription, respectively. Patients without OIC had lower costs per patient year (£3822 [US$5160/€4242]) compared with OIC (£4786 [US$6461/€5312]). Costs increased as patients had multiple changes in therapy: £4696 (US$6340/€5213), £4749 (US$6411/€5271), and £4981 (US$6724/€5529) for 1, 2, and ≥3 changes, respectively. The adjusted cost ratio relative to non-OIC was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) for those classified as stable and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.09-1.32) for those with ≥3 laxative changes. Similar patterns were observed for patients taking anyopioid, with costs increased for those classified as having OIC (£3727 [US$5031/€4137] vs £2379 [US$3212 /€2641),and for those patients classified as unstable versus stable (£3931 [US$5307/€4363] vs £3432 [US$4633/€3810). Costs increased with each additional line of therapy from £3701 (US$4996/€4108), £3916 (US$5287/€4347), and £4318 (US$5829/€4793). IMPLICATIONS OIC was a common adverse event of opioid treatment and was poorly controlled for a large number of patients. Poor control was associated with increased health care costs. The impact of OIC should be considered when prescribing opioids. These results should be interpreted with consideration of the caveats associated with the analysis of routine data.","Morgan, Christopher Ll; Jenkins-Jones, Sara; Knaggs, Roger; Currie, Craig; Conway, Peter; Poole, Chris D; Berni, Ellen",Clinical therapeutics,85,30

While all patients with any acute aortic syndrome of the descending aorta receive prompt anti-impulse therapy, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is reserved for patients presenting with certain complications, namely malperfusion, rupture, or periaortic hematoma. Technical aspects of TEVAR for IMH include maximal endograft oversizing of 10% with 20 mm landing zones of the healthy aorta, revascularization of the left subclavian artery when covered, use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage with extensive coverage, and restoration of branch vessel perfusion. With respect to disease evolution, IMH may progress to classic AD, frank rupture, or aneurysmal dilation; yet, IMH may also regress and be completely resorbed. However, since the natural history of IMH is unpredictable, TEVAR is being used more aggressively to improve long-term survival, rates of secondary reintervention, and positive aortic remodeling. Much remains unknown for acute type B IMH, including the use of prophylactic TEVAR for stable uncomplicated presentations, as well as the optimal timing of intervention and certain technical aspects of TEVAR. As such, IMH remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for cardiovascular surgeons.","Brown, James A; Arnaoutakis, George J; Kilic, Arman; Gleason, Thomas G; Aranda-Michel, Edgar; Sultan, Ibrahim",Journal of cardiac surgery,85,1

The resulting stoma produces unique medical and biological challenges. Previously, a study using a large animal amputation model indicated that infection could be largely prevented, for at least a 12-month period, but the terminal epithelium continued to downgrow. The current study was undertaken to test the longer-term efficacy of this implant construct to maintain a stable skin-implant interface for 24 months. Using the previously successful amputation and implantation surgical procedure, a total of eight sheep were fitted with a percutaneous OI prosthesis. Two animals were removed from the study due to early complications. Of the remaining six sheep, one (16.7%) became infected at 15-months post-implantation and five remained infection-free for the intended 24 months. The histological data of the remaining animals further confirmed the grossly observable epithelial downgrowth. Albeit a receding interface, it was clear that all animals that survived to the end of the study had residual fibrous soft-tissue ingrowth into, and debris within, the exposed titanium porous-coated surface. Overall, the data demonstrated that the porous coated subdermal barrier offered initial protection against infection. However, the fibrous skin attachment was continuously lysed over time by the down-growing epithelium.","Jeyapalina, Sujee; Beck, James Peter; Agarwal, Jayant; Bachus, Kent N",Journal of materials science.

The trapezius and serratus anterior (SA) muscles are the main stabilizers and are therefore the main target muscles of therapeutic exercises. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the current literature investigating the optimal activation ratio of the scapular muscles during a range of closed kinetic chain exercises. METHODS A systematic review search was conducted to identify studies reporting shoulder electromyography (EMG) activity during rehabilitation exercises in healthy participants. The search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and ScienceDirect. The included studies reported closed kinetic chain exercises and the muscle activity as a percentage of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (%MVIC) or muscle ratios of the lower trapezius (LT), middle trapezius (MT), and SA with respect to the upper trapezius (UT). Muscle ratios were classified as optimal if they were equal to or lower than 0.6, and the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the selected studies. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies were included in this review; 7 main exercises and 30 variations of these were reported. The average electromyographic activity of the concentric and eccentric phase was considered. Half Push Up, Push Up Plus, and Scap Protraction exercises showed optimal SA activity (UT/SA < 0.6), while Press Up, Half Push Up, and One Hand Plank exercises showed optimal LT activity (UT/LT < 0.6). According to the NOS, 15 studies were classified as moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS The exercises in higher positions (e.g. exercises with the trunk closest to the vertical line) or unstable surfaces tend to favor UT activity over the MT, LT and SA. The exercises including scapular retraction showed optimal UT/MT and UT/LT ratios, while those including scapular protraction showed optimal UT/SA ratios. This will assist therapists in the correct selection of exercises for shoulder rehabilitation.","Mendez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Morales-Verdugo, Juan; Orozco-Chavez, Ignacio; Habechain, Fernanda Assis Paes; Padilla, Eleazar Lara; de la Rosa, Francisco José Berral",Journal of back and musculoskeletal rehabilitation,85,5

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.","Luis, Angela D; Hayman, David T S; O'Shea, Thomas J; Cryan, Paul M; Gilbert, Amy T; Pulliam, Juliet R C; Mills, James N; Timonin, Mary E; Willis, Craig K R; Cunningham, Andrew A; Fooks, Anthony R; Rupprecht, Charles E; Wood, James L N; Webb, Colleen T",Proceedings.

An important aspect of qPCR data that has been largely ignored is the presence of non-detects: reactions failing to exceed the quantification threshold and therefore lacking a measurement of expression. While most current software replaces these non-detects with a value representing the limit of detection, this introduces substantial bias in the estimation of both absolute and differential expression. Single imputation procedures, while an improvement on previously used methods, underestimate residual variance, which can lead to anti-conservative inference. RESULTS We propose to treat non-detects as non-random missing data, model the missing data mechanism, and use this model to impute missing values or obtain direct estimates of model parameters. To account for the uncertainty inherent in the imputation, we propose a multiple imputation procedure, which provides a set of plausible values for each non-detect. We assess the proposed methods via simulation studies and demonstrate the applicability of these methods to three experimental data sets. We compare our methods to mean imputation, single imputation, and a penalized EM algorithm incorporating non-random missingness (PEMM). The developed methods are implemented in the R/Bioconductor package nondetects. CONCLUSIONS The statistical methods introduced here reduce discrepancies in gene expression values derived from qPCR experiments in the presence of non-detects, providing increased confidence in downstream analyses.","Sherina, Valeriia; McMurray, Helene R; Powers, Winslow; Land, Harmut; Love, Tanzy M T; McCall, Matthew N",BMC bioinformatics,85,1

Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration may be a safe and promising option in treating PF. The objective of our meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of MSC therapy in preclinical models of PF. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to March 17, 2021. Studies that assessed the efficacy of MSC therapy to animals with PF were included. The SYRCLE bias risk tool was employed to evaluate the bias of included studies. The primary outcomes included survival rate and pulmonary fibrosis scores. Meta-analysis was conducted via Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (version 5.4) and Stata 14.0 statistical software. RESULTS A total of 1120 articles were reviewed, of which 24 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 studies evaluated the survival rate and 20 studies evaluated pulmonary fibrosis scores. Compared to the control group, MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in survival rate (odds ratios (OR) 3.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06 to 4.67, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and a significant reduction in pulmonary fibrosis scores (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.05, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.51, P < 0.001, I2 = 90%). CONCLUSIONS MSC therapy is a safe and effective method that can significantly improve the survival and pulmonary fibrosis of PF animals.

To date, cerebral monitoring abilities during CPR have been limited. Therefore, we investigated the time-course of cerebral oxygen saturation values (rSO₂) during advanced life support in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Our primary aim was to compare rSO₂ values during advanced life support from patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to patients who did not achieve ROSC. METHODS We performed an observational study to measure rSO₂ using Equanox (Nonin, Plymouth, MI) from the start of advanced life support in the pre-hospital setting. RESULTS rSO₂ of 49 consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were analyzed. The total increase from initial rSO₂ value until two minutes before ROSC or end of advanced life support efforts was significantly larger in the group with ROSC 16% (9 to 36) compared to the patients without ROSC 10% (4 to 15) (P = 0.02). Mean rSO₂ from the start of measurement until two minutes before ROSC or until termination of advanced life support was higher in patients with ROSC than in those without, namely 39% ± 7 and 31% ± 4 (P = 0.05) respectively. CONCLUSIONS During pre-hospital advanced life support, higher increases in rSO₂ are observed in patients attaining ROSC, even before ROSC was clinically determined. Our findings suggest that rSO₂ could be used in the future to guide patient tailored treatment during cardiac arrest and could therefore be a surrogate marker of the systemic oxygenation state of the patient.","Genbrugge, Cornelia; Meex, Ingrid; Boer, Willem; Jans, Frank; Heylen, René; Ferdinande, Bert; Dens, Jo; De Deyne, Cathy",Critical care,85,31

Method: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Participants (N = 699) between the ages of 18 and 73 (M = 27.79; SD = 12.68) completed both the FCV-19S and the Hospital, Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS). We performed descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 349), confirmatory (n = 350), and scale reliability analyses. Results: The results confirmed the factor structure of the original scale as well as the scale's goodness-of-fit indices and good internal consistency (α = .91, ω = .98). The correlations between the Spanish FCV-19S and the HADS support the scale's validity, especially for the subdimension of anxiety. Conclusions: The Spanish version of the FCV-19S appears to be a valid measure for the assessment of fear in an adult population. The present study moves research forward by providing a confirmatory analysis of the gender variable's influence on the factor analysis. The FCV-19S-Spanish provides a valid brief measure to evaluate fear of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results also revealed that fear was higher among women than among men, which is important as it suggests that more attention needs to be paid to assessing and treating women's fear.

We reviewed our surgical experience in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children. All children (n = 58) who underwent surgical repair of VRs or slings (mean age 27.4±45.60 months; 36 males [62%]) between March 2000 and April 2020 were included. The most common anatomic variant was a right aortic arch (RAA) with aberrant left subclavian artery (ALSCA)(n = 29; 50%). Kommerell's diverticulum (KD) was present in 23 of these patients (79%). The second most common variant was a double aortic arch (DAA) (n = 22; 38%), followed by pulmonary artery sling (PAS) (n = 4; 6%), RAA with mirror image branching and left ligamentum arteriosum (n = 3; 5.2%), and left aortic arch (LAA) with aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSCA) (n = 1; 1.7%). One patient had a double ring with PAS and RAA with ALSCA. Symptoms were present in 42 patients (72%). Left lateral thoracotomy was the approach in 50 patients (86%), while sternotomy was used in 8 (14%). Symptomatic improvement occurred in the majority of symptomatic patients (93%). There was one perioperative mortality (1.7%) in the symptomatic group which was non-VR related. Morbidities included recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury in three patients (5.2%) and transient chylothorax in two (3.4%). Persistence/recurrence of symptoms resulted in one early and one late reoperation. The mean follow-up was 3±5 years. In the current era, VR repair in children including asymptomatic ones can be performed with excellent results. We recommend complete repair of RAA with aberrant LSCA by resection of KD and translocation of the ALSCA to avoid recurrence.","Said, Sameh M; Marey, Gamal; Knutson, Stacie; Rodgers, Nathan; Richtsfeld, Martina; Joy, Brain; Griselli, Massimo",Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,85,19

However, there is uncertainty about the benefit to harm balance of mesh approved for pelvic organ prolapse. We, therefore, assessed the evidence at the time of approval for transvaginal mesh products and the impact of safety studies the FDA mandated in 2012 because of emerging harms. METHODS We used FDA databases to determine the evidence for approval of transvaginal mesh. To create a 'family tree' of device equivalence, we used the 510(k) regulatory approval of the 1985 Mersilene Mesh (Ethicon) and the 1996 ProteGen Sling (Boston Scientific), searched for all subsequently related device approvals, and for the first published randomised trial evidence. We assessed compliance with all FDA 522 orders issued in 2012 requiring postmarketing surveillance studies. RESULTS We found 61 devices whose approval ultimately relied on claimed equivalence to the Mersilene Mesh and the ProteGen Sling. We found no clinical trials evidence for these 61 devices at the time of approval. Publication of randomised clinical trials occurred at a median of 5 years after device approval (range 1-14 years). Analysis of 119 FDA 522 orders revealed that in 79 (66%) the manufacturer ceased market distribution of the device, and in 26 (22%) the manufacturer had changed the indication. Only seven studies (six cohorts and new randomised controlled trial) covering 11 orders were recruiting participants (none had reported outcomes). CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal mesh products for pelvic organ prolapse have been approved on the basis of weak evidence over the last 20 years. Devices have inherited approval status from a few products. A publicly accessible registry of licensed invasive devices, with details of marketing status and linked evidence, should be created and maintained at the time of approval.","Heneghan, Carl J; Goldacre, Ben; Onakpoya, Igho; Aronson, Jeffrey K; Jefferson, Tom; Pluddemann, Annette; Mahtani, Kamal R",BMJ open,85,1

Therefore, a phase II trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib induction followed by CRT in this disease setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with unresectable, EGFR-mutant, stage III NSCLC were administered gefitinib monotherapy (250 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, patients without disease progression during induction therapy were administered cisplatin and docetaxel (40 mg/m2 each) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with concurrent radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy. The primary endpoint was the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate, which was hypothesized to reach 85%, with a threshold of the lower limit of 60%. RESULTS Twenty patients (median age: 66 years; male/female: 9/11; histology: 20 adenocarcinoma; stage IIIA/IIIB: 9/11; and exon 19/21: 10/10) were enrolled. The 2-year OS rate was 90% (90% confidence interval: 71.4% to 96.8%), indicating that this trial met the primary objective. The overall response rate and 1- and 2-year progression-free survival rates were 85.0%, 58.1%, and 36.9%, respectively.

Candidates (either for targeted/quadrant ablation or for hemigland ablation) were defined based on good focality, grade group (GG) ≤2, and low-volume disease. Patients were classified as favorable (GG ≤ 2 with good focality and concordant multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [mpMRI]) or unfavorable (poor focality or high-volume disease or discordant mpMRI) for FT at surveillance biopsies. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 1057 men met the inclusion criteria. The median number of biopsies per patient was three (interquartile range 2-4), and 196 patients (18.5%) underwent five or more biopsies. At confirmatory biopsy, 43% remained candidates for FT (67% for targeted/quadrant ablation and 33% for hemigland ablation) and 20% had a negative biopsy. Of the candidates for FT at initial biopsy, 11% had less favorable characteristics at confirmatory biopsy. Among candidates for FT based on both initial and confirmatory biopsies, 70% remained favorable for hemigland ablation at subsequent biopsies. Limitations include retrospective design and mpMRI information only at surveillance biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Serial biopsy findings in men with early-stage cancer on AS show that tumor location remains relatively stable and significant changes in grade and/or volume occur largely in the DT. Combined diagnostic and confirmatory biopsy findings help better select patients for FT than the use of the diagnostic biopsy alone. PATIENT SUMMARY In a large cohort of patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer, we evaluated changes across serial biopsies to identify potential candidates for focal therapy (FT). Our findings showed that the dominant tumor remained stable over time and the majority of men were favorable candidates for FT.","Fasulo, Vittorio; Cowan, Janet E; Maggi, Martina; Washington, Samuel L; Nguyen, Hao G; Shinohara, Katsuto; Lazzeri, Massimo; Casale, Paolo; Carroll, Peter R",European urology oncology,85,30

The article highlights the natural history, anatomy, embryology, imaging, clinical implications, and neurosurgical significance of these lesions, which the authors believe represent a continuum, with different entities characterized by distinct embryopathologic features. The indications and surgical management options are discussed for these individual intracranial pathologies with relevant illustrations, and a novel classification is proposed for persistent falcine sinus (PFS). The role of neurointervention and/or microsurgery in specific cases such as sinus pericranii and enlarged emissary veins of the skull is highlighted. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and developmental anatomy of these lesions can reduce treatment morbidity and mortality. Some patients, including those with vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), can present with the added systemic morbidity of a high-output cardiac failure. Although VOGM is the most studied and classified of the above-mentioned eDVAs, the authors believe that grouping the former with the other venous anomalies/abnormalities listed above would enable the clinician to convey the exact morphophysiological configuration of these lesions, predict their natural history with respect to evolving venous hypertension or stroke, and extrapolate invaluable insights from VOGM treatment to the treatment of other eDVAs. In recent years, many of these symptomatic venous malformations have been treated with endovascular interventions, although these techniques are still being refined. The authors highlight the broad concept of eDVAs and hope that this work will serve as a basis for future studies investigating the role of evolving focal venous hypertension/global intracranial hypertension and possibilities of fetal surgical intervention in these cases.","Manjila, Sunil; Bazil, Timothy; Thomas, Matthew; Mani, Sunithi; Kay, Matthew; Udayasankar, Unni",Neurosurgical focus,85,32

Most of the studies adapted CBT to address PD related concerns. Caregivers were frequently part of the CBT programs. Among the studies reviewed, randomized controlled trials showed significant effects in treating depression with CBT in PD patients.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective case series. ANIMALS Six healthy research cats. METHODS Cats were placed under anesthesia for computed tomography lymphangiography (CTLA) to identify thoracic duct anatomy. On the basis of CTLA findings, cats were positioned in either right or left lateral recumbency for a 3-port VATS TDL. Thoracic duct branches were dissected from the aorta after subcutaneous indirect near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) lymphography with indocyanine green was performed to optimize detection. A vessel-sealing device was used to seal each thoracic duct in 1 or more locations. Postattenuation, indirect NIRF lymphography was repeated to confirm complete occlusion of thoracic duct flow. CTLA was repeated in all cats 3 months postoperatively. RESULTS The thoracic duct was surgically approached from the right in 3 cats and from the left in 3 cats. A median of 2.5 (range 1-6) TDL seal sites were applied. In 2 cats, leakage of chyle was detected during dissection. At 3 months postoperatively, CTLA confirmed reestablished chylous flow in 5 of 6 cats, appearing to occur through recanalization of previously sealed sites rather than through development of de novo lymphatic vessels. CONCLUSION VATS TDL is feasible in cats, although the variable and delicate nature of feline thoracic duct anatomy should be considered preoperatively. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Bipolar vessel-sealing devices are not a durable modality for thoracic duct sealing in healthy cats in a seal only fashion.","Mitchell, Jeffrey W; Mayhew, Philipp D; Johnson, Eric G; Steffey, Michele A; Pascoe, Peter J",Veterinary surgery : VS,85,16

In Egypt, several biobanks have been established, but there are no specific local ethical guidelines to guide their work. The aim of this study is to develop recommendations for the Egyptian human biobanking ethical guidelines, which take into consideration the specific cultural and legal framework in Egypt. Methods: We searched the literature for available biobanking ethical guidelines. Six themes were the concern of search, namely; informed consent, data protection, return of results, sharing of samples and data, community engagement, and stakeholder engagement. If a document refers to another guideline, the new source is identified and the previous step is repeated. Results: Ten documents were identified, which were analyzed for the themes mentioned above. Guidelines and best practices were identified, and then compared with the published documents about ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) related to biomedical research in Egypt to reach best recommendations. Conclusions: We have proposed, by way of recommendations, key characteristics that a national ethics framework in Egypt could have. On informed consent, the practice of broad consent may be harmonized among biobanks in Egypt. Clear policies on return of research results, training requirements and availability of genetic counseling could also be instituted through the national framework. Additionally, such a framework should facilitate community and stakeholders engagement, which is important to secure trust and build consensus on contentious issues arising from sample and data sharing across borders and commercialization, among other concerns.","Samir Abdelhafiz, Ahmed; W L Ho, Calvin; Chuan Voo, Teck",Wellcome open research,85,5

We conducted this study to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the management of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients who were enrolled in the nation-wide inception cohort. METHODS A questionnaire was administered to the SLE patients enrolled in the inception cohort. Questions related to the effect on disease activity, preventive measures adopted against COVID-19, the incidence of COVID-19, hardships faced in getting access to health care professionals and availability of medicines, adherence, fear of COVID-19 and the potential benefits of being part of the registry. RESULTS A total of 1040 (90% females) patients completed the questionnaire. The mean age was 27.5 ± 19.1 years and the mean disease duration was 1.25 years. Twenty-Four (2.3%) patients had developed fever (>1 day) during this period, including one patient with additional symptoms of diarrhoea and anosmia, however, none of the patients developed COVID-19 infection. 262 patients (25.2%) reported financial difficulty during this period and patients reported an average excess expenditure of at least 2255.45 INR ($30) per month. 378 patients (36%) reported problems in getting their prescribed medicines due to lockdown. Of these, 167 (40%) patients needed to change their medication schedule due to this non-availability. Almost 54% of patients missed their scheduled follow up visits during the lockdown period and 37% of patients were unable to get their investigations done due to closure of laboratories and hospitals. 266 patients (25.5%) reported worsening of various symptoms of SLE during this period. Almost 61% patients felt confident that being associated with the inception cohort had helped them in managing their disease better during this period of lockdown as they received help in the form of timely and frequent telephonic consults, assistance in making the medicines available, and regular counselling resulting in abetment of their fears and anxieties. CONCLUSION The current COVID-19 pandemic has made a huge impact on our SLE patients. Patients faced difficulty in the availability of medicines, missed the doses of medicines, had financial constraints, and spent more money on health during the pandemic.","Rathi, Manish; Singh, Parmeshar; Bi, Hayath Peta; Shivanna, Archana; Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Tripathy, Saumya Ranjan; Parthasarathy, Janani; Tota, Sneha; Maurya, Supriya; Vijayalekshmi, Vishnupriya; Bhavani, D; Jain, Avinash; Gupta, Ranjan; Danda, Debashish; Rajasekhar, Liza; Negi, Vir Singh; Shobha, Vineeta; Das, Bidyut; Aggarwal, Amita",Lupus,85,1

Insights on S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with ACE2 receptor and drug repurposing has accelerated drug discovery for the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding small molecule binding sites in the S protein and ACE2 interface is crucial in the search of effective drugs to prevent viral entry. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents together with virtual screening to identify small molecules that could be potential inhibitors of S protein ACE2 interaction. Observation of organic probe molecule localization during the simulations revealed multiple sites at the S protein surface related to a small molecule, antibody, and ACE2 binding. In addition, a novel conformation of the S protein was discovered that could be stabilized by small molecules to inhibit attachment to ACE2. The most promising binding site on the RBD-ACE2 interface was targeted with virtual screening and top-ranked compounds (DB08248, DB02651, DB03714, and DB14826) are suggested for experimental testing. The protocol described here offers an extremely fast method for characterizing key proteins of a novel pathogen and for the identification of compounds that could inhibit or accelerate the spreading of the disease.","Jokinen, Elmeri M; Gopinath, Krishnasamy; Kurkinen, Sami T; Pentikainen, Olli T",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,85,1

We hypothesized that goal-directed therapy during interfacility transport would decrease hospital length of stay, prevent multiple organ dysfunction, and reduce subsequent ICU interventions. DESIGN Before-and-after intervention trial. SETTING During interfacility transport of critically ill patients by a specialized pediatric transport team, back to a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS Before-and-after intervention trial. DESIGN Interfacility pediatric transport patients, age 1 month to 17 years, with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. INTERVENTIONS Prospective data were collected on all pediatric interfacility transport patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome transported by the Angel One Transport team at Arkansas Children's Hospital. A 10-month data collection period was followed by institution of a goal-directed resuscitation protocol. Data were subsequently collected for 10 additional months followed by comparison of pre- and postintervention groups. All transport personnel underwent training with didactics and high-fidelity simulation until mastery with goal-directed resuscitation was achieved. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All transport patients were screened for systemic inflammatory response syndrome using established variables and 235 (123 preintervention and 112 postintervention) were enrolled. Univariate analysis revealed shorter hospital stay (11 ± 15 d vs 7 ± 10 d; p = 0.02) and fewer required therapeutic ICU interventions in the postintervention group (Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 Scores, 19.4 ± 6.8 vs 17.3 ± 6.6; p = 0.04). ICU stay and prevalence of organ dysfunction were not statistically different. Multivariable analysis showed a 1.6-day (95% CI, 1.3-2.03; p = 0.02) decrease in hospital stay in the postintervention group. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that goal-directed therapy administered by a specialized pediatric transport team has the potential to impact the outcomes of critically ill children. Findings from this study should be confirmed across multiple institutions, but have the potential to impact the clinical outcomes of critically ill children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.","Stroud, Michael H; Sanders, Ronald C; Moss, M Michele; Sullivan, Janice E; Prodhan, Parthak; Melguizo-Castro, Maria; Nick, Todd",Critical care medicine,85,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study involved 20 patients with a total of 91 recessions. Those on one side of the mandible received MCAT plus CM while the contralateral ones MCAT plus SCTG. The evaluation of MMP-1 and MMP-8 concentrations in Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) took place at baseline, then at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and finally at 3 months after surgery. Elisa protocol was applied to determine the levels of MMP-1 and MMP-8 in GCF. RESULTS Three-month observation revealed statistically significant changes in MMP-1, MMP-8 and Sulcus Fluid Flow Rate (SFFR) values after implementation of both techniques. A correlation was found between a difference in MMP-1 concentrations and gain in Keratinized Tissue (KT) after SCTG and CM.

Therefore, this study reports on the experience of using endoscopic and laparoscopic full-thickness resection (ELFR) with laparoscopic two-layer suturing in such tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six patients with gastric SMTs very close to the EGJ underwent ELFR with laparoscopic two-layer suturing at Kyungpook National University Medical Center. With the patient under general anesthesia, the lesser curvature and posterior aspect adjacent to the EGJ were meticulously dissected and visualized using a laparoscopic approach. A partially circumferential full-thickness incision at the distal margin of the tumor was then made using an endoscopic approach under laparoscopic guidance. The SMT was resected using laparoscopic ultrasonic shears, and the gastric wall was closed using two-layer suturing. Thereafter, the patency and any leakage were checked through endoscopy. RESULTS All the ELFR procedures with laparoscopic two-layer suturing were performed successfully without an open conversion. The mean operation time was 139.2±30.9 minutes and the blood loss was too minimal to be measured. The tumors from four patients were leiomyomas, while the tumors from the other two patients were gastrointestinal stromal tumors with clear resection margins. All the patients started oral intake on the third postoperative day. There was no morbidity or mortality. The mean hospital stay was 7.7±0.8 days. CONCLUSIONS ELFR with laparoscopic two-layer suturing is a safe treatment option for patients with an SMT close to the EGJ, as major resection of the stomach is avoided.","Kwon, Oh Kyoung; Yu, Wansik",Journal of gastric cancer,85,1

However, vertical vergence can also be induced by seemingly unrelated visual conditions, such as optokinetic rotations. This study aims to investigate the effect of vision on this latter form of vertical vergence. Eight subjects (4m/4f) viewed a visual scene in head erect position in two different viewing conditions (monocular and binocular). The scene, containing white lines angled at 45° against a black background, was projected at an eye-screen distance of 2 m, and rotated 28° at an acceleration of 56°/s2. Eye movements were recorded using a Chronos Eye-Tracker, and eye occlusions were carried out by placing an infrared-translucent cover in front of the left eye during monocular viewing. Results revealed vergence amplitudes during binocular viewing to be significantly lower than those seen for monocular conditions (p = 0.003), while torsion remained unaffected. This indicates that vertical vergence to optokinetic stimulation, though visually induced, is visually suppressed during binocular viewing. Considering that vertical vergence is generally viewed as a vestibular signal, the findings may reflect a visually induced activation of a vestibular pathway.","Wibble, Tobias; Pansell, Tony",Scientific reports,85,16

To date, treatment with the embolic agent Onyx, followed by radiosurgery, has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in a homogeneous, monocentric series. MATERIALS AND METHODS From April 2003 to June 2008, a total of 20 patients (11 women and 9 men; age range, 10-55 years) were treated for AVMs with Onyx embolization followed by radiosurgery. AVM sizes were <3 cm in 7 patients and ≥3 cm in 13 patients. Modalities and complications of the procedure were analyzed as well as the long-term clinical and anatomic outcomes (2-5 years after treatment). RESULTS Of 17 patients evaluated by DSA after radiosurgery, 10 (58.8%) were observed to have complete occlusion of the AVM nidus. Complete occlusion was observed in 5 (71.4%) of 7 Spetzler-Martin grade I-II AVMs and in 5 (50.0%) of 10 Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs. Complete occlusion was observed in 4 (80.0%) of 5 AVMs of <3 cm and 6 (50.0%) of 12 AVMs of >3 cm. One of 20 patients had significant worsening of clinical status (mRS ≥2) at long-term follow-up.

Our study sought to determine the external validity of that model. METHODS A cohort study [2005-2013] was performed of lung cancer patients with a negative mediastinum by PET. Previously published model coefficients were used to estimate the probability of pN2 based on tumor location and size, nodal enlargement by computed tomography (CT), maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor, N1 disease by PET, and pretreatment histology. RESULTS Among 239 patients, 18 had pN2 [7.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.5-12%]. Model discrimination was excellent (c-statistic 0.80, 95% CI: 0.75-0.85) and the model fit the data well (P=0.191). The accuracy of the model was as follows: sensitivity 100%, 95% CI: 81-100%; specificity 49%, 95% CI: 42-56%; positive predictive value (PPV) 14%, 95% CI: 8-21%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 100%, 95% CI: 97-100%. CI inspection revealed a significantly higher c-statistic in this external validation cohort compared to the internal validation cohort. The model's apparently poor specificity for patient selection is in fact significantly better than usual care (i.e., aggressive but allowable guideline concordant staging) and minimum guideline mandated selection criteria for invasive staging. CONCLUSIONS A prediction model for pN2 is externally valid. The high NPV of this model may allow pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons to more comfortably minimize the number of invasive procedures performed among patients with a negative mediastinum by PET.","Farjah, Farhood; Backhus, Leah M; Varghese, Thomas K; Manning, James P; Cheng, Aaron M; Mulligan, Michael S; Wood, Douglas E",Journal of thoracic disease,85,27

Recently there has been an acceleration in the development of candidate RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutics. However, the effects of RSV genomic variability on the implementation of vaccines and therapeutics remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Fogarty International Center held a workshop to summarize what is known about the global burden and transmission of RSV disease, the phylogeographic dynamics and genomics of the virus, and the networks that exist to improve the understanding of RSV disease. Discussion at the workshop focused on the implications of viral evolution and genomic variability for vaccine and therapeutics development in the context of various immunization strategies. This paper summarizes the meeting, highlights research gaps and future priorities, and outlines what has been achieved since the meeting took place. It concludes with an examination of what the RSV community can learn from our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 genomics and what insights over sixty years of RSV research can offer the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kim, Sonnie; Williams, Thomas C; Viboud, Cecile; Campbell, Harry; Chen, Jiani; Spiro, David J",Vaccine,85,1

The recent outbreak of a novel corona virus (MERS-CoV) highlighted the importance of PH services and the need for a competent PH workforce. The urgency and panic induced by infectious disease outbreaks explain the heightened interest. Decision makers' interest in public health was observed through a series of decisions, including creating a position for Deputy Minister for Public Health, changing the name of ""Directorate of Primary Healthcare Centers"" to ""Directorate of Public Health"" in all health regions and initiating a special scholarship program to prepare health administration professionals in collaboration with US-based universities. A distinguished group of PH leaders in Saudi Arabia was gathered in a structured workshop that was organized by the Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, college of medicine to discuss the current status and future needs of PH education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The workshop highlighted the need for PH education development and outlined the challenges ahead. The main challenges laid out by participants in the workshop were the development of an appropriate PH curriculum, appropriate training spots for practical placement, the development of research priorities for PH to satisfy the needs of PH programs and agencies, attracting the most qualified academic staff, the enrolment of highly motivated students and finally, the establishment of a quality assurance program to ensure the quality of PH education programs. The development of a framework for graduate competencies in PH was perceived to be a top priority. Moreover, setting a PH workforce surveillance system, building partnership between PH academic institutions and PH services providers, implementing national campaigns to explain what PH is about and illuminating the role of PH workers were also of utmost importance.","Mahmoud, Mahmoud Abdulrahman; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen H; Bin Abdulrahman, Khalid A",Medical teacher,85,1

However, there is little known about the demand pattern for calcium salts and collagen needed by biomineralization. In this study, natural bone biomineralization is analyzed, and a novel interplay between calcium concentration and collagen production is observed. Any quantitative change in one of the entities causes a corresponding change in the other. Translocation-associated membrane protein 2 (TRAM2) is identified as an intermediate factor whose silencing disrupts this relationship and causes poor mineralization. TRAM2 directly interacts with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and modulates SERCA2b activity to couple calcium enrichment with collagen biosynthesis. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts can independently and directly regulate the process of biomineralization via this coupling.

METHODS Narrative article with analysis of self-harm incident data during the initial CR period of March to May 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS During the initial CR period (March to May 2020), there was a highly significant, four-fold reduction in self-harming incidents recorded by both YJNSW and JHFMHN compared with the equivalent time period in 2019 (p < .00001). CONCLUSION The greater than four-fold reduction in self-harm by young people during the early CR may relate to the 'interagency response', with an increase in positive interactions between staff, and between staff and young people. The reduction in self-harm and improvements in mental health will be further explored through standardised interviews with the young people and staff.","Kasinathan, John; Haysom, Leigh; Andriotis, Helen; Wheaton, Mike; Lloyd, Trisha; Langstaff, Rohan; McClelland, Renee; Whiting, Nick; Southgate, Steven; Vita, Michael; McGrath, Colette; Palmai, Marlene; Armstrong, Christine; O'Donovan, Connie; Oyan, Marcus; Woodward, Jenny; Wilson, Cindy",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,85,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS 568 surgical procedures for unilateral inguinal hernia repair using the Valenti (group V) or the Lichtenstein technique (group L) were performed. After the mean follow-up time of 9 years (8-12), 185 patients (70.1%) treated using Valenti method and 186 patients (71.3%) treated using Lichtenstein method were clinically assessed. All clinical data were registered in National Hernia Registry. The rate of recurrence was assessed as primary outcome. The secondary outcome involved chronic pain (VAS). RESULTS 9-year recurrence rate was 2.2% in both groups. No significant difference in recurrence rate was demonstrated in analysis adjusted for surgeon's education, type of hernia, hernia size, hernia duration, or BMI between two groups (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.67; p = 1.0). In follow-up the majority of patients reported no pain (71.9% in V; 73.7% in L). A constant pain was reported by four patients in each group. Severe pain was reported by 1.6% in V and 2.1% in L (p = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS Inguinal hernia repairs using Valenti and Lichtenstein methods show high, long-term effectiveness and do not significantly differ in the recurrence rate. Both methods ensure a low rate of chronic pain. The use of a single mesh size with a precisely defined shape and of a uniform mesh fixation method ensures the standardization of surgical technique. The Valenti method is an uncomplicated, technically reproducible procedure with a low learning curve.","Mitura, K; Garnysz, K; Michałek, I",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,85,16

Enteric (BECoV) strains of BCoV are predominant in South America, and genetic investigations have been conducted to identify its relationship with isolates of respiratory origin (BRCoV). In this study, we used a BRCoV strain (BR-UEL11) derived from an outbreak of respiratory disease in feedlot cattle in southern Brazil, and compared the partial sequence of the polymorphic region of Spike (which was detected and sequenced by two distinct reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions) with those of other BCoV strains. The phylogenetic relationship of BR-UEL11 with Brazilian BCoV, which is associated with calf diarrhea and winter dysentery (enteric, BECoV; respiratory, BRCoV), and classical reference prototypes was analyzed. The analysis showed that the BRCoV strains from Brazil clustered with a clade that was distinct from most isolates associated with calf diarrhea (BECoV) and ancestral prototype strains such as Mebus, Nebraska, and LYVB. Furthermore, the BRCoV strains from Brazil clustered with a clade that contained recent strains associated with winter dysentery, showing 98-99% nucleotide identity with those strains. These results suggested that the Brazilian BCoV evolved from being solely enteric to a dual enteric and respiratory tropic virus.","Beuttemmuller, E A; Alfieri, A F; Headley, S A; Alfieri, A A",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,85,13

METHODS A multidisciplinary planning committee of 15 individuals developed and implemented a new PSH program. A total of 878 subjects were included in the preimplementation period (T-fast), and 1082 patients were included in the postimplementation period (PSH) based on the date of their surgery. The primary goal of this report was to assess the changes in patient outcomes associated with this new PSH implementation on variables such as total length of stay and unplanned hospital admission (UHA). RESULTS Patients assigned to the PSH model had a significantly shorter mean length of stay compared with patients in the T-fast group (162 ± 308 vs 369 ± 790 minutes, P = .00005). UHA was significantly higher in the T-fast group as compared with the PSH group (8.5% [95% CI 6.6-10.4] vs 1.7% [0.9-2.5], P < .00005). There was no difference in the 7 days readmission rates between patients managed in the T-fast track and the PSH track (5.4% [3.8-7.0] vs 5.0% [3.6-6.3], P = .066). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of the PSH into a Kaiser Permanente model of care was associated with a simultaneous decrease of length of stay and UHA for laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients.","Qiu, Chunyuan; Rinehart, Joseph; Nguyen, Vu T; Cannesson, Maxime; Morkos, Atef; LaPlace, Diana; Trivedi, Narendra S; Mercado, Philip D; Kain, Zeev N",Anesthesia and analgesia,85,1

Here, we have identified CddA (cyanobacterial deacetylase/depropionylase), a lysine deacylase enzyme expressed in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 that has both deacetylase and depropionylase activity. Loss of the gene cddA led to slower growth and impaired linear and cyclic photosynthetic electron transfer. We determined the crystal structure of this depropionylase/deacetylase at 2.1 Å resolution and established that it has a unique and characteristically folded α/β structure. We detected an acyl binding site within CddA via site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrated that this site is essential for the deproprionylase activity of this enzyme. Through a proteomic approach, we identified a total of 598 lysine residues across 382 proteins that were capable of undergoing propionylation. These propionylated proteins were highly enriched for photosynthetic and metabolic functionality. We additionally demonstrated that CddA was capable of catalyzing in vivo and in vitro lysine depropionylation and deacetylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F/SBPase), thereby regulating its enzymatic activity. Our identification of a lysine deacylase provides insight into the mechanisms globally regulating photosynthesis and carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria and potentially in other photosynthetic organisms as well.","Liu, Xin; Yang, Mingkun; Liu, Yingfang; Ge, Feng; Zhao, Jindong",Plant physiology,85,1

The 2020 seismic noise quiet period is the longest and most prominent global anthropogenic seismic noise reduction on record. While the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth. This provides an opportunity to detect subtle signals from subsurface seismic sources that would have been concealed in noisier times and to benchmark sources of anthropogenic noise.

The TLIF procedure can be performed open or using minimally invasive techniques. While several studies have found that minimally invasive TLIF (MI-TLIF) has advantages over open TLIF procedures with less blood loss, postoperative pain and hospital length of stay, opponents of the minimally invasive technique cite the lack of restoration of lumbar lordosis as a major drawback. With the increasing awareness of restoring sagittal alignment parameters in degenerative and deformity procedures, surgeons should understand the capabilities of different procedures to achieve surgical goals. To our knowledge, few studies have specifically studied the radiographic restoration of lumbar lordosis after MI-TLIF procedures. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature describing the sagittal lumbar radiographic parameter changes after MI-TLIF. METHODS Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic review was performed. With the assistance of a medical librarian, a highly-sensitive search strategy formulated on 1/19/2018 utilized the following search terms: ""minimally invasive procedures,"" ""transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion,"" ""lumbar interbody fusion,"" ""diagnostic imaging,"" ""radiographs,"" ""radiography,"" ""x-rays,"" ""lordosis,"" ""lumbar vertebrae,"" ""treatment,"" ""outcome,"" and ""lumbosacral"" using Boolean operators 'AND' and 'OR'. Three databases were searched (PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library). An online system (www.covidence.org) was used to standardize article review. All studies were independently analyzed by two investigators and discrepancies mitigated by a third reviewer. Study selection for each cycle was Yes/No/Maybe. Cycles were: (1) (Title/Abstract); (2) (Full Text); (3) (Extraction). Inclusion criteria were: (1) All study designs, (2) MI-TLIF procedures, (3) Reporting total lumbar lordosis (LL) and/or segmental lordosis (SL) pre- and postoperatively. Exclusion criteria were: (1) non MI-TLIF procedures (ALIF, XLIF, LLIF, conventional TLIF, OLIF), (2) No reported LL or SL. RESULTS The search yielded 4,036 results with 836 duplicates leaving 3,200 studies for review. Cycle 1 eliminated 3,153 studies as irrelevant, thus, 47 were eligible for full-text review. Cycle 2 excluded 31 studies for No English full text (9), Oral/Poster (8), Wrong intervention/outcome (10), Duplicate listing (2), Full text not available (1), Literature review (1) resulting in 16 included studies. Study designs were: Randomized-controlled trial (3), Case series (6) and Retrospective (7). Mean # of subjects were 32.0 (range 8-95). Weighted-mean LL was 39.6°±9.2 (range 28-57) and postoperative LL was 45.0°±7.4 (range 36-67) with a LL post-pre difference of 5.2°±5.9 (range -7 to 15). Weighted-mean preoperative SL was 12.7°±4.3 (range 5-21) and postoperative SL was 15.0°±4.5 (range 5-22) with a SL post-pre difference of 2.1°±1.7 (range 0-8). CONCLUSIONS The current literature on MI-TLIF and restoration of LL/SL is limited to 16 published studies, 44% of which are retrospective. The published evidence supporting LL and SL restoration with MI-TLIF is sparse with variable results. This systematic review demonstrates the need for future high-level studies to fully elucidate the capabilities of MI-TLIF procedures for restoring lumbar and segmental lordosis.","Carlson, Brandon B; Saville, Philip; Dowdell, James; Goto, Rie; Vaishnav, Avani; Gang, Catherine Himo; McAnany, Steven; Albert, Todd J; Qureshi, Sheeraz",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,85,19

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents are widely used worldwide. However, a significant proportion of patients still need surgical resections. The impact of previous exposure to these agents on the perioperative and postoperative outcomes is still controversial. In this critical review, we aimed to position the strategy of intentional preoperative use of anti-TNF agents in the management of CD. The indications and contraindications for this strategy are detailed, and despite scarce evidence, the possible advantages and disadvantages of the intentional use of anti-TNF agents before abdominal surgery in CD are discussed.","Kotze, Paulo Gustavo; Ghosh, Subrata; Bemelman, Willem A; Panaccione, Remo",Intestinal research,85,16

One of the factors is perfectionism, and few researches have been conducted to examine the role of self-compassion in perfectionism and depression link. The purpose of the study was to explore the relationships between perfectionism, self-compassion, and depression in the context of Chinese undergraduates. METHODS The anonymous self-reported questionnaires including three scales on perfectionism, selfcompassion, and depression were utilized in the study. A total of 540 undergraduates were recruited from three universities in Nanjing and Xi'an by using convenient cluster sampling and were required to complete the questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the predictive effects of perfectionism and selfcompassion on depression. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the mediating effect of self-compassion. RESULTS Regression analyses demonstrated that the maladaptive perfectionism was positively associated with depression, while adaptive perfectionism and self-compassion were negatively associated with depression. The mediation tests showed that the self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between the two types of perfectionism and depression. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed the mediating effect of self-compassion in the relation between perfectionism and depression in Chinese undergraduates. Self-compassion is likely to be an effective psychological intervention method to relieve the depressive symptoms in college students, and further study is needed to verify this possibility.","Wei, Shujuan; Li, Lan; Shi, Jianping; Liang, Huixin; Yang, Xianfeng",Annals of palliative medicine,85,28

Efficient recruitment of the 40S particle is particularly important for translation of mRNAs encoding oncoproteins and growth-promoting factors, which often harbor complex 5' UTRs and require efficient initiation. Thus, inhibiting the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction has emerged as a previously unpursued route for developing anticancer agents. Indeed, we discovered small-molecule inhibitors of this eIF4E/eIF4G interaction (4EGIs) that inhibit translation initiation both in vitro and in vivo and were used successfully in numerous cancer-biology and neurobiology studies. However, their detailed molecular mechanism of action has remained elusive. Here, we show that the eIF4E/eIF4G inhibitor 4EGI-1 acts allosterically by binding to a site on eIF4E distant from the eIF4G binding epitope. Data from NMR mapping and high-resolution crystal structures are congruent with this mechanism, where 4EGI-1 attaches to a hydrophobic pocket of eIF4E between β-sheet2 (L60-T68) and α-helix1 (E69-N77), causing localized conformational changes mainly in the H78-L85 region. It acts by unfolding a short 310-helix (S82-L85) while extending α-helix1 by one turn (H78-S82). This unusual helix rearrangement has not been seen in any previous eIF4E structure and reveals elements of an allosteric inhibition mechanism leading to the dislocation of eIF4G from eIF4E.","Papadopoulos, Evangelos; Jenni, Simon; Kabha, Eihab; Takrouri, Khuloud J; Yi, Tingfang; Salvi, Nicola; Luna, Rafael E; Gavathiotis, Evripidis; Mahalingam, Poornachandran; Arthanari, Haribabu; Rodriguez-Mias, Ricard; Yefidoff-Freedman, Revital; Aktas, Bertal H; Chorev, Michael; Halperin, Jose A; Wagner, Gerhard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,85,16

Clinically, more than 50% of SCI affect the cervical spine. As a consequence of the primary injury, a cascade of secondary mechanisms including inflammation, apoptosis, and demyelination occur finally leading to tissue scarring and development of intramedullary cavities. Both represent physical and chemical barriers to cell transplantation, integration, and regeneration. Therefore, shaping the inhibitory environment and bridging cavities to create a supportive milieu for cell transplantation and regeneration is a promising therapeutic target. Here, a contusion/compression model of cervical SCI using an aneurysm clip is described. This model is more clinically relevant than other experimental models, since complete transection or ruptures of the cord are rare. Also in comparison to the weight drop model, which in particular damage the dorsum columns, circumferential compression of the spinal cord appears advantageous. Clip closing force and duration can be adjusted to achieve different injury severity. A ring spring facilitates precise calibration and constancy of clip force. Under physiological conditions, synthetic self-assembling peptides (SAP) self-assemble into nanofibers and thus, are appealing for application in SCI. They can be injected directly into the lesion minimizing damage to the cord. SAPs are biocompatible structures erecting scaffolds to bridge intramedullary cavities and thus, equip the damaged cord for regenerative treatments. K2(QL)6K2 (QL6) is a novel SAP introduced by Dong et al. In comparison to other peptides, QL6 self-assembles into β-sheets at neutral pH. 14 days after SCI, after the acute stage, SAPs are injected into the center of the lesion and neural precursor cells (NPC) are injected into adjacent dorsal columns. In order to support cell survival, transplantation is combined with continuous subdural administration of growth factors by osmotic micro pumps for 7 days.","Zweckberger, Klaus; Liu, Yang; Wang, Jian; Forgione, Nicole; Fehlings, Michael G",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,85,16

Doppler ultrasonography measured testicular volume, testicular artery velocity preoperative and 3rd month post operative. Blood flow in the testicles was represented by resistive index (RI). No case of testicular atrophy occurred in either group, however, in both groups a significant postoperative decrease in testicular volume (p = 0.001 in group I and p < 0.001 in group II) was accompanied by a significant increase in RI as compared to their pre-operative values (p < 0.001 in group I and p = 0.009 in group II). Comparing the two groups, patients in group I showed higher values of decrease in testicular volume accompanied by more increase in RI values postoperatively compared to group II patients, but these values did not reach a significant value (p = 0.107, p = 0.136). There was a significant increase in the number of post-operative varicocele and hydrocele in group I compared to group II. Mesh implantation has an effect on testicular size and blood flow by decreasing the testicular size and increasing the RI. This effect was more obvious in the parietex progrip. Although there is an indirect relation between RI and the sperm count, testicular blood flow alone is not enough to judge fertility.","El-Komy, Heba; El-Gendi, Ahmed; Abdel-Salam, Wael; Elseidy, Mohamed; Elkayal, Elsaid",Updates in surgery,85,1

Laparoscopic fundoplication is a standard surgical treatment for GERD, and laparoscopic gastric bypass has been shown to effectively resolve GERD symptoms in the morbidly obese. We sought to compare the in-hospital outcomes of morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of GERD versus laparoscopic gastric bypass for the treatment of morbid obesity and related conditions, including GERD, at U.S. academic medical centers. METHODS Using the ""International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision"" procedural and diagnoses codes for morbidly obese patients with GERD, we obtained data from the University HealthSystem Consortium database for all patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication or laparoscopic gastric bypass from October 2004 to December 2007 (n=27,264). The outcome measures included the patient demographics, length of stay, in-hospital overall complications, mortality, risk-adjusted mortality ratio (observed to expected mortality), and hospital costs. RESULTS Compared with the patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass, those who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication had a lower severity of illness score (P<.05). The overall in-hospital complications were significantly lower in the laparoscopic gastric bypass group (P<.05). The mean length of stay, observed mortality, risk-adjusted mortality, and hospital costs were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic gastric bypass is as safe as laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of GERD in the morbidly obese. Hence, morbidly obese patients with GERD should be referred for bariatric surgery evaluation and offered laparoscopic gastric bypass as a surgical option.","Varela, J Esteban; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,85,16

CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices were subjected to ELF-EMFs stimulation with different frequencies (15 and 50 Hz), intensities (0.5, 1 and 2 mT) and durations (10, 20 and 30 min). The INa, IA and IK of neurons were recorded by a whole-cell patch-clamp method. ELF-EMFs stimulation enhanced INa densities, and depressed IA and IK densities. In detail, INa was more sensitive to the variation of intensities and frequencies of ELF-EMFs, whereas IA and IK were mainly affected by the variation of the duration of ELF-EMFs. ELF-EMFs stimulation altered activation and deactivation properties of INa, IA and IK. ELF-EMFs stimulation plays a role as a regulator rather than an inducer for ion channels. It might change the transition probability of ion channel opening or closing, and might also change the structure and function of the ion channel which need to be proved by the further technical method.","Zheng, Yu; Xia, Pei; Dong, Lei; Tian, Lei; Xiong, Chan",Electromagnetic biology and medicine,85,16

Our aim was to identify clinical factors predictive of IAVT and/or poor outcome. METHODS A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was performed of 130 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage including patients without and with symptomatic cerebral vasospasm requiring IAVT. The data were analysed by Student t test, univariate analysis and binary logistic regression. RESULTS The mean±SD patient age was 54±12.2 years, admission hemoglobin was 13.6±1.5 g/dL, and neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) hemoglobin 11±1.4 g/dL. The median Hunt and Hess grade was 2 (range 1,4), Fisher grade 3 (range 3,3), and discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0.5 (range 0,2). Lower mean NICU hemoglobin was found in patients receiving IAVT than in those not receiving IAVT (M=10.4±0.9 g/dL vs M=11.2±1.4 g/dL, t(115)=-2.52, p=0.01). Further, lower mean NICU hemoglobin was associated with increased IAVT (ρ=-0.3, p<0.01) and higher discharge mRS (ρ=-0.5, p<0.01). In binary logistic regression, lower mean NICU hemoglobin was an independent predictor of IAVT (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9, p<0.05) as well as poor discharge mRS (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9, p<0.05). Hunt and Hess grade was also an independent predictor of these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Lower mean hemoglobin during the acute phase of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm is an independent predictor of IAVT and poor discharge mRS. This relationship warrants further evaluation.","Bell, Donnie L; Kimberly, W Taylor; Yoo, Albert J; Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M; Rabinov, James D; Bell, Jania E; Mehta, Brijesh P; Hirsch, Joshua A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,85,27

High-flow therapy by nasal cannula (HFNC) for preoxygenation before intubation has never been assessed by randomized study. Our objective was to evaluate the efficiency of HFNC for preoxygenation, compared to high fraction-inspired oxygen facial mask (HFFM). METHODS Multicenter, randomized, open-labelled, controlled PREOXYFLOW trial (NCT 01747109) in six French intensive care units. Acute hypoxemic adults requiring intubation were randomly allocated to HFNC or HFFM. Patients were eligible if PaO2/FiO2 ratio was below 300 mmHg, respiratory rate at least 30/min and if they required FiO2 50% or more to obtain at least 90% oxygen saturation. HFNC was maintained throughout the procedure, whereas HFFM was removed at the end of general anaesthesia induction. Primary outcome was the lowest saturation throughout intubation procedure. Secondary outcomes included adverse events related to intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS A total of 124 patients were randomized. In the intent-to-treat analysis, including 119 patients (HFNC n = 62; HFFM n = 57), the median (interquartile range) lowest saturation was 91.5% (80-96) for HFNC and 89.5% (81-95) for the HFFM group (p = 0.44). There was no difference for difficult intubation (p = 0.18), intubation difficulty scale, ventilation-free days (p = 0.09), intubation-related adverse events including desaturation <80% or mortality (p = 0.46).

Recent precedent, beginning with the seminal Stewart v. Azar case, strongly suggests that a legal challenge would be successful on the merits. The features and justifications of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, examined in light of current data on work requirements in entitlement programs, make it likely that approval of the program would be found arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.

Since sleep patterns of employed individuals may differ to those of their unemployed counterparts, the nature of their sleep-mortality relationship may vary. We therefore investigated the association between self-reported sleep duration and all-cause mortality (ACM) or cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM) in employed individuals. DATA SOURCES Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, searches between January 1990 and May 2020 were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: Included were prospective cohort studies of 18-64-year-old disease-free employed persons with sleep duration measured at baseline, and cause of death recorded prospectively as the outcome. Gray literature, case-control or intervention design studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the studies, participants, and study outcomes were extracted. The quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS The pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained with a random-effects model and results presented as forest plots. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were assessed. RESULTS Shorter sleep duration (≤6 h) was associated with a higher risk for (ACM) (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11 -1.22) and CVDM (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12 -1.41) compared to 7-8 h of sleep, with no significant heterogeneity. The association between longer sleep (≥8 h) and ACM (RR: 1.18, 95% CI:1.12 -1.23, P < 0.001) needs to be interpreted cautiously owing to high heterogeneity (I2 = 86.0%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Interventions and education programs targeting sleep health in the workplace may be warranted, based on our findings that employed individuals who report shorter sleep appear to have a higher risk for ACM and CVDM.","Pienaar, Paula R; Kolbe-Alexander, Tracy L; van Mechelen, Willem; Boot, Cécile R L; Roden, Laura C; Lambert, Estelle V; Rae, Dale E",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,85,8

The virus causes a debilitating infection with multiorgan injury and has a high mortality rate estimated to be around 3.70%. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain the liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients which include collateral damage from cytokine storm, drug-induced liver injury, viral-induced hepatitis and hypoxia-induced damage. Through this case series, we would like to highlight that liver enzyme abnormalities are often seen in COVID-19 patients and would like to highlight that physicians need to serially monitor biochemical testing until the liver enzymes return to baseline. Physicians also need to be vigilant of liver enzyme abnormalities in these patients, especially before starting new medications.","Kudaravalli, Pujitha; Saleem, Sheikh A; Ibeche, Bashar; John, Savio",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,85,1

Despite the medical and/or surgical management of endometriosis, the presence of persistent pelvic pain and psychological distress often continues, suggesting a role for psychological interventions in treatment planning. The present study aimed to conduct the first systematic review, with narrative data synthesis, on psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms. The study also aimed to determine the effectiveness of current interventions in resolving psychological and pain-related loss of function associated with endometriosis and to identify gaps in the literature requiring further research. A total of 15,816 studies were retrieved through database searching and handsearching, with two researchers identifying 11 full-text studies that met inclusion criteria. Three studies of 'moderate' quality were identified, although the overall quality of studies was found to be 'weak', with a 'high' risk of bias. The findings regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions for endometriosis-related symptoms remain inconclusive. Further research into psychological interventions for women with endometriosis that employ evidence-based protocols with high intervention integrity is recommended.","Van Niekerk, Leesa; Weaver-Pirie, Bronwyn; Matthewson, Mandy",Archives of women's mental health,85,1

In primary autoimmune neutropenia, anti-neutrophil antibodies (ANeuA) bind to membrane antigens of neutrophils, which give rise to peripheral destruction of neutrophils. However, it is not always easy to detect these antibodies. This study aims to investigate the etiology of neutropenia, and at the same time to evaluate the immune mechanisms by ANeuA testing using granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test. In our study, 310 neutropenic patients who were between 3 months and 18 years of age were evaluated. ANeuA screening tests were performed in 108 neutropenic patients (group 1), and these patients were divided into 2 subgroups as persistent neutropenia (group 1P, n=12) and recovered neutropenia (group 1R, n=96). Besides, a control group in the same age range was formed, consisting of 39 non-neutropenic children (group 2). ANeuA serum levels were also checked in these groups, and no statistically significant difference could be found between groups 1 and 2, or between groups 1P and 1R, regarding ANeuA levels. As a conclusion, our study was the first comprehensive research in Turkey investigating the large-scale etiology of neutropenia. Moreover, while ANeuA screening tests did not provide sufficient insight for immune neutropenia, we argue that it is not necessary for routine use and that further research in the etiology of neutropenia is required.","Karakilic-Ozturan, Esin; Karaman, Serap; Soguksu, Pinar; Mese, Sevim; Agacfidan, Ali; Mutlu, Umit D; Karakas, Zeynep; Tugcu, Deniz; Karagenc-Ozkan, Ayse; Devecioglu, Omer",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,85,13

METHODS (81m)Kr-gas ventilation study was performed in a plastinated human cast with and without the addition of vibrating acoustic airflow. Similarly, intrasinus drug deposition in a nasal replica using gentamicin as a marker was studied with and without the superposition of different modes of acoustic airflow. RESULTS Ventilation experiments demonstrate that no sinus ventilation was observed without acoustic airflow although sinus ventilation occurred whatever the modes of acoustic airflow applied. Intrasinus drug deposition experiments showed that the high frequency acoustic airflow led to 4-fold increase in gentamicin deposition into the left maxillary sinus and to 2-fold deposition increase into the right maxillary sinus. Besides, the low frequency acoustic airflow demonstrated a significant increase of 4-fold and 2-fold in the right and left maxillary sinuses, respectively. CONCLUSION We demonstrated the benefit of different modes of vibrating acoustic airflow for maxillary sinus ventilation and intrasinus drug deposition. The degree of gentamicin deposition varies as a function of frequency of the vibrating acoustic airflow and the geometry of the ostia.","Leclerc, Lara; Merhie, Amira El; Navarro, Laurent; Prévôt, Nathalie; Durand, Marc; Pourchez, Jérémie",International journal of pharmaceutics,85,1

BACKGROUND Smoking has been associated with the ""paradox"" of reduced mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). This is thought to be due to favorable baseline characteristics and less diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) among smokers. METHODS In the ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial, 13,819 patients (29.1% smokers) with moderate- to high-risk NSTE-ACS underwent angiography and, if indicated, revascularization. RESULTS Smokers were significantly younger and had fewer comorbidities than nonsmokers. Incidence of death and MI were comparable at 30 days, although smokers had significantly reduced risks of 30-day major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67 to 0.96; p = 0.016) and 1-year mortality (HR: 0.797, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.027). After correction for baseline and clinical differences, smoking was no longer predictive of major bleeding (odds ratio: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.32; p = 0.56) and was associated with higher 1-year mortality (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.7; p = 0.013). This pattern of reversed risk after multivariable correction held true for those smokers requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. Core laboratory angiographic analysis showed that smokers and nonsmokers were comparable in terms of the extent of CAD, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow, myocardial blush, and the presence of thrombi. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the paradox previously described in ST-segment elevation MI, our analysis finds smoking to be an independent predictor of higher 1-year mortality in patients presenting with NSTE-ACS, and our angiographic study demonstrates CAD in smokers that is comparable to that in nonsmokers but evident ∼1 decade earlier.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. From January 1 to December 23, 2019, a total of 46 patients with chronic sinus tract wounds, who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the Wound Healing Center of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, including 23 males and 23 females, aged 18-81 (48±21) years. On admission, computer tomography (CT) imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to examine the shapes of wound sinus tract and classify the wounds, and the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by CT imaging (hereinafter referred to as reference lengths) were recorded; the lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds were examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy and measured. The wounds with and without obviously curved sinus tract were classified into curve group and straight group respectively, and the deviation rates between the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy or hard endoscopy and the reference lengths (hereinafter referred to as deviation rates of lengths) in each group were calculated and compared. The differences between the deviation rates of lengths examined by soft endoscopy and hard endoscopy and the deviation rate of reference lengths (0) in each group were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. Results: CT imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that there were 4 types of wound sinus tract, including tubular (36/46), lamellar (4/46), club-mallet (4/46), and irregular (2/46). Tubular wounds were further divided into type I (23/36), type L (4/36), and type Y (9/36). Wounds with type I tubular, lamellar, and club-mallet sinus tract were classified into linear group (31/46), while those with type Y tubular, type L tubular, and irregular sinus tract were classified into curve group (15/46). In linear group, the deviation rates of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy were 0. In curve group, the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by soft endoscopy was 0 (0, 0.58%), which was significantly lower than 41.18% (31.68%, 48.41%) examined by hard endoscopy, Z=-3.408, P<0.01; the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy (40±19)% was significantly higher than the deviation rate of reference lengths (t=8.343, P<0.01), while the deviation rate of the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy was similar to the deviation rate of reference lengths (Z=-1.342, P>0.05). Conclusions: Compared with hard endoscopy, soft endoscopy can observe the internal characteristics of chronic sinus tract wounds in a wider range in the clinical examination of this kind of wound, especially for the exploration of curved chronic sinus tract wounds. The promotion of this method will be conducive to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic sinus tract wounds.","Tao, G L; Liu, Y K; Tang, J J; Ma, X; Huang, L F; Zhou, J Q; Wu, F Y; Yakupu, Aobuliaximu; Wang, H Q; Guan, H N; Dong, J Y; Lu, S L",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,85,27

Here, we experimentally tested the vulnerability of a demersal temperate fish (Sparus aurata) to long-lasting heatwaves, on larval, juvenile and adult life-stages. Fish were exposed to simulated coastal (18 °C), estuarine (24 °C) summer temperatures, and heatwave conditions (30 °C) and their physiological responses were assessed based on cellular stress response biomarkers (heat shock protein 70 kDa, ubiquitin, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) and phenotypic measures (histopathology, condition and mortality). Life-stage vulnerability can be ranked as larvae > adults > juveniles, based on mortality, tissue pathology and the capacity to employ cellular stress responses, reflecting the different environmental niches of each life stage. While larvae lacked acclimation capacity, which resulted in damage to tissues and elevated mortality, juveniles coped well with elevated temperature. The rapid induction of cytoprotective proteins maintained the integrity of vital organs in juveniles, suggesting adaptive phenotypic plasticity in coastal and estuarine waters. Adults displayed lower plasticity to heatwaves as they transition to deeper habitats for maturation, showing tissue damage in brain, liver and muscle. Life cycle closure of sea breams in coastal habitats will therefore be determined by larval and adult stages.","Madeira, Diana; Madeira, Carolina; Costa, Pedro M; Vinagre, Catarina; Pörtner, Hans-Otto; Diniz, Mário S",Marine environmental research,85,28

Using microarray mRNA expression profiling, we identified genes whose expression in the hearts of dKO mice changed substantially during disease progression [at 21 d of age (no CAD), 31 d of age (small myocardial infarctions), and 43 d of age (extensive myocardial infarctions) vs. CAD-free SR-BI(+/-)/apoE(-/-) controls]. Expression of most genes that increased >sixfold in dKO hearts at 43 d also increased after coronary artery ligation. We examined the influence and potential mechanism of action of apolipoprotein D (apoD) whose expression in dKO hearts increased 80-fold by 43 d. Analysis of ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction in both apoD KO mice and wild-type mice with abnormally high plasma levels of apoD (adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression) established that apoD reduces myocardial infarction. There was a correlation of apoD's ability to protect primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation injury with its potent ability to inhibit oxidation in a standard antioxidation assay in vitro. We conclude that dKO mice represent a useful mouse model of CAD and apoD may be part of an intrinsic cardioprotective system, possibly as a consequence of its antioxidation activity.","Tsukamoto, Kosuke; Mani, D R; Shi, Jianru; Zhang, Songwen; Haagensen, Darrow E; Otsuka, Fumiyuki; Guan, Jian; Smith, Jonathan D; Weng, Wei; Liao, Ronglih; Kolodgie, Frank D; Virmani, Renu; Krieger, Monty",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,85,23

This approach, however, is associated with significant morbidity. We postulate that a less radical resection of the levators done laparoscopically could significantly decrease the rate of perineal complications while ensuring an oncologically adequate specimen. To date, to our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature describing a laparoscopic translevator approach for APR. The purpose of this study is to describe our initial experience with this approach and assess our short-term oncologic and clinical outcomes. METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent laparoscopic APR with intra-abdominal levator transection for rectal cancer from 2012 to 2014 at a single tertiary care institution. Main outcome measures include: perineal flap rates, post-operative complications, length of stay, distance from tumour to circumferential resection margin, R0 status, and disease recurrence. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) unless otherwise noted. RESULTS Seventeen cases were identified. Patient age was 61 (range 34-75), and 59 % were male. Pre-operative distance of the tumour from the anal verge was 2.6 cm (0.4-3.9). Post-operative length of stay was 4 (4-6) days. One patient required a perineal flap for reconstruction. Four patients (22 %) had perineal complications (three wound infections and one hernia). No patients reported sexual dysfunction, and one (5 %) developed urinary retention. Five (29 %) patients had a complete pathological response. The circumferential resection margin was 1.5 (0.8-2.5) cm, with no positive margins reported. The number of retrieved lymph nodes was 12 (range 2-30). Follow-up was 9.7 months (range 20 days-23 months), during which one patient developed recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS This study describes a novel surgical approach to APR that has the potential to both decrease perineal complications and provide excellent oncologic results.","Palter, Vanessa N; MacLellan, Steven; Ashamalla, Shady",Surgical endoscopy,85,1

OBJECTIVE To compare the angiographic results and clinical outcomes of both strategies in the Safety and Efficacy of Neuroform for Treatment of intracranial Aneurysms (SENAT) registry. METHODS SENAT was a prospective, multicenter registry that allowed BRT in conjunction with stenting and coiling with bare platinum coils. Clinical and angiographic outcomes of 97 patients with unruptured aneurysms treated with stenting, 51 after BRT (BRT+) and 46 without balloon assistance (BRT-), were retrieved from the SENAT database. Technical, clinical, and angiographic outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Periprocedural morbimortality and midterm clinical outcomes were not different between groups. Residual aneurysms were observed in 7.8% of BRT+ and in 21.7% of BRT- (P = .08) at the end of the stenting procedure. Four retreatments were performed during the follow-up period (2 BRT+, 2 BRT-). Twelve- to 18-month anatomic results showed a significant difference between groups, with a residual aneurysm being observed in 6.1% of BRT+ as compared to 22.7% of BRT- patients (P = .03). CONCLUSION Primary BRT followed by stent-assisted coiling may be associated with fewer residual aneurysms at 12 to 18 months as compared to stent-assisted coiling alone.","Gentric, Jean-Christophe; Biondi, Alessandra; Piotin, Michel; Mounayer, Charbel; Lobotesis, Kyriakos; Bonafé, Alain; Costalat, Vincent",Neurosurgery,85,7

The aim was to analyze the correlation between a wide panel of urinary biomarkers and serum concentrations of anti C1q antibodies with histological items of activity and chronicity on kidney biopsy in LN patients. METHODS Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were included. LN diagnosis was based on ACR criteria. Histologic features of activity and chronicity indices were analyzed according to the Austin classification. Serum Anti C1q levels were determined by commercial ELISA. Urinary levels of transferrin, ceruloplasmin (CP), VCAM-1, TWEAK, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein were measured by commercial ELISA. RESULTS We included 120 SLE patients (81% female, mean age 33.1 ± 9.3 years, 59.4% Mestizo, 37.8% Afro-Latin American): 64% had LN. Kidney biopsy was performed in 55 patients, but only 37 were made in our center. Anti C1q antibodies were associated with endocapillary proliferation. In patients with cellular crescents, urinary concentrations of CP were significantly higher. In patients with a chronicity index (CI) ≥ 4, fibrous crescents, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis, urinary MCP-1 levels were higher. CONCLUSIONS In SLE patients, serum anti C1q antibodies and urinary CP were associated with activity on kidney biopsy and MCP-1 with chronic damage. This panel of biomarkers could be validated in larger, multi-ethnic population as a complementary tool for better stratification of LN patients. Key Points • Urinary biomarkers are complementary useful tools for the assessment of SLE patients. • Urinary levels of CP correlated with activity findings on kidney biopsy in LN patients. • Urinary levels of MCP-1 correlated with chronic damage, especially with fibrous crescents, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.","Urrego-Callejas, Tomás; Álvarez, Simón Sandoval; Arias, Luis F; Reyes, Blanca Ortiz; Vanegas-García, Adriana L; González, Luis A; Muñoz-Vahos, Carlos H; Vásquez, Gloria; Quintana, Luis F; Gómez-Puerta, José A",Clinical rheumatology,85,1

Small tumor cell deposits, which are not detectable by routine clinical imaging, may be stimulated by hepatic regeneration factors after liver resection. It is not entirely clear, however, which factors are crucial for tumor recurrence. The presented mouse model may be useful to explore the mechanisms that play a role in the development of recurrent malignant lesions after liver resection. The model combines the easy-to-perform and reproducible techniques of defined amounts of liver tissue removal and tumor induction (by injection) in mice. The animals were treated with either a single laparotomy, a 30% liver resection, or a 70% liver resection. All animals subsequently received a tumor cell injection into the remaining liver tissue. After two weeks of observation, the livers and tumors were evaluated for size and weight and examined by immunohistochemistry. After a 70% liver resection, the tumor volume and weight were significantly increased compared to a laparotomy alone (p <0.05). In addition, immunohistochemistry (Ki67) showed an increased tumor proliferation rate in the resection group (p <0.05). These findings demonstrate the influence of hepatic regeneration mechanisms on intrahepatic tumor growth. Combined with methods like histological workup or RNA analysis, the described mouse model could serve as foundation for a close examination of different factors involved in tumor growth and metastatic disease recurrence within the liver. A considerable number of variables like the length of postoperative observation, the cell line used for injection or the timing of injection and liver resection offer multiple angles when exploring a specific question in the context of post-hepatectomy metastases. The limitations of this procedure are the authorization to perform the procedure on animals, access to an appropriate animal testing facility and acquisition of certain equipment.","Brandt, Hannes H; Nißler, Valérie; Croner, Roland S",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,85,31

We investigated the effect of the deficient and excessive VitD on emotion, behavior and attention. METHODS 351 preschool children in a multicenter study in Shanghai, China that had serum 25(OH)D measurements and emotion, behavior and attention measures were included in the analyses. In animal experiments, C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8): control (C) group, VitD deficiency (VDD) group, and VitD overdose (VDO) group. The emotion, behavior and attention of juvenile mice were evaluated through the behavioral experiments. RESULTS There was an ""U"" relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and emotion, behavior and attention. Compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.5 (1.0, 4.8) for emotional problem, 3.8 (1.2, 12.1) for conduct problem and 1.8 (1.1, 5.7) for inattention in <20 ng/mL group. Meanwhile, compared with 20-40 ng/mL group, ORs were 9.5 (2.9, 31.4) for impulsive hyperactivity, and 3.9 (1.2, 12.9) for conduct problem in >40 ng/mL group. Consistent with the results in children, animal experiments showed that the attention level decreased in VDD group, while the anxiety level, hyperactive level and aggressiveness in VDD group and VDO group were significantly increased, respectively. LIMITATIONS 25(OH)D measurements were only available in one season. CONCLUSION The deficient and excessive VitD status both adversely affected children's emotion, behavior and attention.","Wang, Xirui; Jiao, Xianting; Xu, Mingqing; Wang, Bin; Li, Juan; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Lishan; Xu, Lei; Yu, Xiaodan",Journal of affective disorders,85,19

Resolving conflicts with conspecifics over valuable resources is an essential task for animals, and this takes an unusual form in mantis shrimp due to their powerful raptorial appendages. Decades of field and laboratory research have provided key insights into the natural agonistic interactions of diverse mantis shrimp species, including how they use their raptorial weapons against one another in telson sparring matches over cavities. These insights provided the foundation for functional morphologists, biomechanists, and engineers to work through different levels of organization: from the kinematics of how the appendages move, to the elastic mechanisms that power the strike, and down to the structure, composition, and material properties that transmit and protect against high-impact forces. Completing this narrative are studies on the defensive telson and how this structure is biomechanically matched to the weapon and the role it plays in ritualized fighting. The biomechanical understanding of the weapon and defense in mantis shrimp has, in turn, enabled a better understanding of whether mantis shrimp assess one another during contests and encouraged questions of evolutionary drivers on both the arsenal and behavior. Altogether, the body of research focused on mantis shrimp has presented perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of fighting, weapons, and defenses among crustaceans, from morphology and biomechanics to behavior and evolution. While this multi-level analysis of ritualized fighting in mantis shrimp is comprehensive, we implore the need to include additional levels of analysis to obtain a truly holistic understanding of this and other crustacean agonistic interactions. Specifically, both molting and environmental conditions are often missing from the narrative, yet they greatly affect crustacean weapons, defenses, and behavior. Applying this approach more broadly would generate a similarly profound understanding of how crustaceans carry out a variety of important tasks in diverse habitats.","deVries, Maya S; Lowder, Kaitlyn B; Taylor, Jennifer R A",Integrative and comparative biology,85,1

Observations over the last ~20 yr have revealed X-ray flares that rise above a quiescent thermal background about once per day, while faint X-ray flares from Sgr A* are undetectable below the constant thermal emission. In contrast, the IR emission of Sgr A* is observed to be continuously variable. Recently, simultaneous observations have indicated a rise in IR flux density around the same time as every distinct X-ray flare, while the opposite is not always true (peaks in the IR emission may not be coincident with an X-ray flare). Characterizing the behavior of these simultaneous X-ray/IR events and measuring any time lag between them can constrain models of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and the flare emission mechanism. Using 100+ hours of data from a coordinated campaign between the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present results of the longest simultaneous IR and X-ray observations of Sgr A* taken to date. The cross-correlation between the IR and X-ray light curves in this unprecedented data set, which includes four modest X-ray/IR flares, indicates that flaring in the X-ray may lead the IR by approximately 10-20 min with 68% confidence. However, the 99.7% confidence interval on the time-lag also includes zero, i.e., the flaring remains statistically consistent with simultaneity. Long-duration and simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of additional bright flares will improve our ability to constrain the flare timing characteristics and emission mechanisms, and must be a priority for Galactic Center observing campaigns.","Boyce, H; Haggard, D; Witzel, G; Willner, S P; Neilsen, J; Hora, J L; Markoff, S; Ponti, G; Baganoff, F; Becklin, E E; Fazio, G G; Lowrance, P; Morris, M R; Smith, H A",The Astrophysical journal,85,29

The health status of the populations of pampas foxes Lycalopex gymnocercus) and crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) is largely unknown and the landscapes occupied by these animals in southern Brazil have been threatened by human occupation and expansion of agriculture. In this work, the search of genomes of human and canine adenoviruses in feces from these wild carnivores was used to track the dissemination of domestic animals and human pathogens to the free-living populations in a wildlife reserve located in southern Brazil. This was performed by virus-specific differential real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) on stool specimens, avoiding capture and additional stress to the animals. Genus-specific conventional reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was complementarily performed aiming the detection of enteroviruses (EV) and rotaviruses (RV) on these same samples. HAdV genomes were found on 14 out of the 17 (82.35%) stool samples analysed, whereas CAV was found co-infecting 5 of these samples. RV genomes were detected on 7 of the 17 samples (41.18%) and all samples were negative for EV. The results point to the dispersion of HAdV and RV at a high rate to these species of South American wild carnivores, which can be an effect of growing anthropisation of the habitat of these animals.","Monteiro, G S; Fleck, J D; Kluge, M; Rech, N K; Soliman, M C; Staggemeier, R; Rodrigues, M T; Barros, M P; Heinzelmann, L S; Spilki, F R",Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,85,1

Men are more able to show higher propulsive forces than women counterparts. Short- and long-term effects were observed while using dry-land and in-water training programmes. The magnitude of propulsive force is dependent on the type of assessment method, swimming stroke, number of body limbs and gender. While the short-term effects supporting the different training programmes lead to an increase in propulsive force, there is a lack of long-term evidence.","Santos, Catarina C; Marinho, Daniel A; Neiva, Henrique P; Costa, Mário J",Sports biomechanics,85,8

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the ADD patients diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings of TMJ in the Department of Stomatology, General Hospital of Chinese PLA from January 2018 to December 2019. A total of 111 ADD patients [33 males and 78 females, aged(31.0±10.9) years old] were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had CSP: non-CSP group (n=40) and CSP group (n=71). The clinical symptoms and types of ADD were observed and recorded. According to the specific side of CSP in the CSP group, the patients were further divided into the ipsilateral side and the contralateral side of CSP. The pain, TMJ sounds and the ADD types were also observed. Chi square test was used to compare the pain, TMJ sounds, limited mouth opening and ADD types of the two groups. Binary Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between CSP and clinical symptoms and ADD characteristics. Results: The incidence of pain in the CSP group [89% (63/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [70% (28/40)] (P<0.05). In CSP patients, the incidences of pain and joint sounds on the ipsilateral side of CSP were significantly higher than that on the contralateral side (P<0.05). MRI showed that the incidence of bilateral ADD in the CSP group [58%(41/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [37%(15/40)] (P<0.05).There were significant differences in the incidences of no disc displacement (DD), anterior disk displacement with reduction(ADDwR) and anterior disk displacement without reduction (ADDwoR) between ipsilateral and contralateral joints of the CSP patients (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidences of no DD, ADDwR and ADDwoR between left and right joints of the non-CSP patients (P>0.05). The incidence of ADDwoR in ipsilateral side of the CSP patients was significantly higher than that in contralateral side (P<0.05). Pain (OR=3.375) and the side of disc displacement (OR=2.278) in patients with ADD were positively correlated with CSP (P<0.05). Conclusions: The clinical symptoms and types of disc displacement between patients with and without CSP were significantly different. The incidences of pain and bilateral disc displacement in the CSP group were significantly higher than those in the non-CSP group. In addition, the incidences of pain, TMJ sounds and anterior disk displacement without reduction on the ipsilateral side of patients with CSP were significantly higher than those on the contralateral side. The pain symptoms and side of disc displacement were positively related to CSP.","Huang, D Z; Zhang, Q; Zhai, X T; Wang, Y; Liu, G; Hu, M; Liu, H C; Jiang, H",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,85,28

There is limited evidence on COVID-19 preparedness of such services in the Asia-Pacific region. AIM To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of hospice and palliative care services in the Asia-Pacific region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD An online cross-sectional survey was developed based on methodology guidance. Asia-Pacific Hospice and Palliative Care Network subscribers (n = 1551) and organizational members (n = 185) were emailed. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS Ninety-seven respondents completed the survey. Around half of services were hospital-based (n = 47, 48%), and public-funded (n = 46, 47%). Half of services reported to have confirmed cases (n = 47, 49%) and the majority of the confirmed cases were patients (n = 28, 61%). Staff perceived moderate risk of being infected by COVID-19 (median: 7/10). > 85% of respondents reported they had up-to-date contact list for staff and patients, one-third revealed challenges to keep record of relatives who visited the services (n = 30, 31%), and of patients visited in communities (n = 29, 30%). Majority of services (60%) obtained adequate resources for infection control except face mask. More than half had no guidance on Do Not Resuscitate orders (n = 59, 66%) or on bereavement care for family members (n = 44, 51%).

BACKGROUND LSG is growing in popularity as a primary bariatric procedure. Technical aspects of LSG including bougie size remain controversial. METHODS Our systematic review yielded 112 studies encompassing 9991 LSG patients. A general estimating equation (GEE) model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for leak based on bougie size, distance from the pylorus, and use of buttressing on the staple line. Baseline characteristics, including age and body mass index (BMI), were included. A linear repeated measures regression model compared excess weight loss (%EWL) between bougie sizes. RESULTS A total of 198 leaks in 8922 patients (2.2%) were identified. The GEE model revealed that the risk of leak decreased with bougie ≥40 Fr (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = [0.37-0.77]; P = 0.0009). Buttressing did not impact leak. There was no difference in %EWL between bougie <40 Fr and bougie ≥40 Fr up to 36 months (mean: 70.1% EWL; P = 0.273). Distance from the pylorus did not affect leak or %EWL. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing bougie ≥40 Fr may decrease leak without impacting %EWL up to 3 years. Distance from the pylorus does not impact leak or weight loss. Buttressing does not seem to impact leak; however, if surgeons desire to buttress, bioabsorbable material is the most common type used. Longer-term studies are needed to definitively determine the effect of bougie size on weight loss after LSG.","Parikh, Manish; Issa, Reda; McCrillis, Aileen; Saunders, John K; Ude-Welcome, Aku; Gagner, Michel",Annals of surgery,85,5

We conducted this study to assess how COVID-19 cases clustered across districts in Bangladesh and whether the pattern and duration of clusters changed following the country's containment strategy using Geographic Information System (GIS) software. We calculated the epidemiological measures including disease incidence, case fatality rate (CFR), and spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19. We used Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Moran's I, and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics for prediction, spatial autocorrelation, and hotspot. We used retrospective space-time scan statistic to analyze clusters of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 has a CFR of 1.4%. Over 50 % of infected cases were reported among young adults (21-40 year age group). The incidence varies from 0.03-0.95 at the end of March to 15.59-308.62 per 100000, at the end of July. Global Moran's Index indicates a robust spatial autocorrelation of COVID-19 cases. Local Moran's I analysis stated a distinct High-High (HH) clustering of COVID-19 cases among the Dhaka, Gazipur, and Narayanganj districts. Twelve statistically significant high rated clusters were identified by space-time scan statistics using a discrete Poisson model. IDW predicted the cases at the undetermined area, and GWR showed a strong relationship between population density and case frequency, which was further established with Moran's I (0.734; P≤0.01). Dhaka and its surrounding six districts were identified as the significant spatial hotspot where Chattogram is an extended diseased area.

Moreover, the combination therapy was less effective compared to (177)Lu-DOTATATE-only. In the current study, we address the following questions: (1) Why was the combination therapy less effective? Is (177)Lu-DOTATATE tumor uptake affected by pretreatment with RAD001? (2) Could sudden cessation of RAD001 therapy cause the development of distant metastases? (3) Is (177)Lu-DOTATATE an effective treatment option for these metastases? METHODS Lewis rats (HanHsd or SsNHsd substrain with a slight difference in immune response) bearing subcutaneous CA20948 tumors were treated with either 125 or 275 MBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE, RAD001, or their combination. RAD001 was given twice a week for 4.5 or 12 weeks, whereas (177)Lu-DOTATATE was given as a single injection. When combined, RAD001 was started either 3 days prior to or 3 days post administration of (177)Lu-DOTATATE. SPECT/CT was performed to quantify (177)Lu-DOTATATE tumor uptake. Where indicated, primary tumors were surgically removed when tumor size is >6,000 mm(3) to enable monitoring for possible metastasis. If metastases were suspected, an (111)In-DTPA-octreotide SPECT/CT scan was performed. Seven rats with metastases were treated with 400 MBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. RESULTS Lu-DOTATATE tumor uptake was not significantly affected by RAD001 pretreatment. The occurrence of metastases after RAD001 treatment was not dose dependent in the dose range tested, nor was it related to the duration of RAD001 treatment. In the experiment in which the LEW/SsNsd substrain was used, only 12.5% of RAD001-treated rats showed complete response (CR), compared to 50% tumor regression in the control group. Re-treatment with a high dose of (177)Lu-DOTATATE resulted in CR in only two out of seven animals. CONCLUSION Less effective anti-tumor effects after the combination of RAD001 + (177)Lu-DOTATATE could not be explained by reduced (177)Lu-DOTATATE tumor uptake after RAD001. Our current data support RAD001-induced immune suppression as the reason for this observation. No evidence was found that cessation of RAD001 treatment caused development of metastases. Metastases appeared to be less sensitive to (177)Lu-DOTATATE treatment than primary tumors.","Bison, Sander M; Pool, Stefan E; Koelewijn, Stuart J; van der Graaf, Linda M; Groen, Harald C; Melis, Marleen; de Jong, Marion",EJNMMI research,85,12

Reoperations were subdivided into corrective operations and conversions. RESULTS Out of 449,753 bariatric operations, 28,720 (6.3%) underwent reoperations of which 19,970 (69.5%) were corrective and 8,750 (30.5%) were conversions. The conversion group compared to primary operations was older (47.63 ± 10.8 vs. 45.5 ± 11.8 years), had less males (13.5 vs. 21.3%), and had more African Americans (14.6 vs. 12%). Comparing primary operations to corrective and conversions operations, respectively, the following were observed: length of stay (1.78 ± 4.95 vs. 2.04 ± 6.44 and 2.86 ± 4.58 days), severe adverse events at 30 days (1.6 vs. 1.7 and 3.3%), severe adverse events at 1 year (2.15 vs. 1.9 and 3.61%), percent excess weight loss at 1 year (43.2 vs. 35.9 ± 92.4 and 39.3 ± 39.9%), 30-day mortality rate (0.1 vs. 0.12 and 0.21%), and 1-year mortality rate (0.17 vs. 0.24 and 0.31%).

However, it is often difficult to maintain an adequate surgical field during the procedure. As in open laparotomy, securing an adequate surgical field is important for adequate visualization. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the Endoractor, an organ retraction sponge that can be inserted through a 12-mm trocar to secure a surgical field in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. The Endoractor, a 100% cellulose compressed sponge, can be expanded using physiologic saline solution, with the result that the swollen sponge displaces organs away from the surgical field. Between October 2009 and April 2010, we used the Endoractor in 24 patients, placed in a Trendelenberg position, during laparoscopic surgery. In no patients, even with return to a horizontal position, did the intestines fall into the pelvis, and surgery was easily performed. Mean (SD; 95% CI) operative time was 92.7 (44.5; 74.0-111.6) minutes, and blood loss was 54.1 (73.1; 22.9-82.1) mL. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 3. Even with the patient in a horizontal position without use of the Trendelenberg position, the Endoractor enables a good surgical field to be secured. It remains to be seen whether this device works as well in obese patients.","Matsuoka, Shozo; Kikuchi, Iwaho; Kitade, Mari; Kumakiri, Jun; Jinushi, Makoto; Tokita, Sachiko; Takeda, Satoru",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,85,1

However, the role of a novel circRNA, circ_0079593, in melanoma is unclear. The expression levels of circ_0079593 and miR-516b were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell migration and invasion were evaluated using transwell assay. Meanwhile, western blot (WB) analysis was employed to determine the levels of proliferation and metastasis-related proteins, as well as metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) protein. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was tested by detecting the cell apoptosis rate and Caspase-3 activity. The glucose consumption and lactate production of cells were measured to evaluate cell glucose metabolism. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter assay and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the interaction between miR-516b and circ_0079593 or GRM3. In addition, mice xenograft models were constructed to explore the effect of circ_0079593 on melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our results discovered that circ_0079593 was highly expressed in melanoma, and its silencing suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, glucose metabolism and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, we found that circ_0079593 could serve as a sponge of miR-516b, and miR-516b could target GRM3 in melanoma. The rescue experiments revealed that both miR-516b inhibitor and GRM3 overexpression could reverse the inhibition effect of circ_0079593 knockdown on melanoma progression. Additionally, in vivo experiments also revealed that circ_0079593 interference suppressed melanoma tumor growth. Our study concluded that circ_0079593 accelerated melanoma progression via upregulating GRM3 by sponging miR-516b, which suggested that circ_0079593 had the potential to be a new therapeutic biomarker for melanoma.","Lu, Jiajing; Li, Ying",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,85,31

Management of thrombi in ECMO is generally an important issue, however especially in ECMO for COVID-19 patients who are prone to thrombus formation, the thrombus formation in oxygenators is an unresolved issue for medical professionals, and it is very difficult to deal with. To prevent thromboembolic complications, it is necessary to develop a method for early thrombus detection. We developed a novel method for detailed real-time observation of thrombi formed in oxygenators using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of this novel method through animal experiments. The experiments were performed three times using three pigs equipped with veno-arterial ECMO comprising a centrifugal pump (CAPIOX SL) and an oxygenator (QUADROX). To create thrombogenic conditions, the pump flow rate was set at 1 L/min without anticoagulation. Diluted ICG was intravenously administered, and the oxygenator was observed with both an optical detector (PDE-neo) and the naked eye every hour until 8 h after measurement initiation. Under ICG fluorescence imaging, the inside of the oxygenator was observed as a white area. A black dot-like area suspected to be the thrombus appeared 6-8 h after measurement initiation. The thrombus could not be recognized in detail with the naked eye observation until the oxygenator was rinsed with physiological saline. The thrombus and the black area on ICG fluorescence imaging were finely matched in terms of morphology. Thus, we succeeded in real-time thrombus detection in an oxygenator using ICG fluorescence imaging. The combined use of ICG imaging and conventional routine screening tests could compensate for each other's weaknesses and significantly improve the safety of ECMO.","Sakurai, Hironobu; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Ohuchi, Katsuhiro; Hijikata, Wataru; Inoue, Yusuke; Seki, Haruna; Tahara, Tomoki; Yokota, Sachie; Ogata, Asato; Mizuno, Tomohiro; Arai, Hirokuni",Artificial organs,85,1

Cadaver dissections were performed to identify and name important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area; a histopathologic analysis of surgical specimens was completed to determine the incidence and extent of microscopic disease; and clinical outcomes were compared to determine the efficacy of a specific anatomic dissection. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. METHODS Standardized dissections of four adult cadavers were performed. Consecutive surgical specimens were examined for evidence of microscopic TDGC disease in the suprahyoid region, measuring the greatest width and length of disease. A retrospective review of all consecutive TGDC procedures was completed. RESULTS The important surgical landmarks in the suprahyoid area were identified in all cadavers. Microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area was found in 79% (37 of 47) of surgical specimens. The mean greatest length and width of microscopic disease was 12.4 mm and 1.4 mm, respectively. Following identification of these landmarks, the incidence of recurrent or persistent disease decreased (P = .02) from 5% (8 of 159) to 0% (0 of 112). CONCLUSION The majority of pediatric patients with a TGDC will have microscopic disease in the suprahyoid area. The surgical landmark of the fascial plane between the geniohyoid and genioglossus muscles demarcates the anterior and lateral borders of resection in the suprahyoid area. This approach can be used as a reliable and easily reproducible technique in TGDC surgery to increase confidence of achieving complete removal of disease in the suprahyoid area, avoiding persistent or recurrent disease and a revision procedure.

Hence we report the first case of single-port laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy in an obese patient who was affected by a left adnexal mass and who had previously undergone 3 midline vertical laparotomies. CASE DESCRIPTION A postmenopausal 57-year-old woman with a body mass index of 31.2 kg/m(2) and a history of 3 midline vertical cesarean deliveries and a right salpingooophorectomy was diagnosed with a left adnexal mass and underwent a single-incision laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. DISCUSSION The patient was treated successfully. The operative blood loss was minimal. The postoperative hospital stay lasted 18 hours, and postoperative pain was short-lasting. No early or long-term postoperative complications were registered. On histopathologic examination, a diagnosis of ovarian serous cystadenoma was made. Even though this unique case is the first to be reported in the literature, its encouraging results suggest the use of this new surgical technique in similar clinical situations to verify whether the feasibility and safety reported in this article are confirmed.","Sesti, Francesco; Boccia, Claudio; Sorrenti, Giuseppe; Baffa, Alberto; Piccione, Emilio",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,85,5

By building on basic science discoveries in the academic setting, applied science can perform proof-of-concept work with simple, benchtop experiments. Eventually, simple models need to be translated to more robust ones where cells, tissues, and entire organisms are incorporated. Successful translation also includes performing due diligence of the intellectual property, understanding the market needs, undertaking clinical development, meeting regulatory requirements, and eventually scale up manufacturing. Different stages of the translation can occur in different environments, including moving from academia to industry, from one company to another, or between veterinary and human applications. The translation process may also rely on contract organizations to move through the complex landscape.

Our hernia center has a growing experience with redo-transversus abdominis release (redo-TAR) to address large, complex hernia recurrences after failed TAR. Here, we describe our outcomes after abdominal wall reconstruction with redo-TAR. STUDY DESIGN Adults undergoing elective open, redo-TAR at our institution from January 2015 to February 2021 were queried from a prospectively collected database in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative. The primary outcome was 30-day wound morbidity. Secondary outcomes were long-term composite hernia recurrence and patient-reported quality of life. RESULTS Sixty-five patients underwent redo-TAR. Median age was 60 years, 50.8% were female, and median BMI 31.8 kg/m2. Median recurrent hernias were 16 cm wide by 25 cm long. Frequent mechanisms of recurrence included linea semilunaris injury (27.7%), mesh fracture (18.5%), infection (16.9%), and posterior sheath disruption (15.4%). Wound complications occurred in 33.8% and 16.9% required procedural intervention. With median clinical and PRO follow-up of 12 and 19 months, respectively, the composite hernia recurrence rate was 22.5% and patients reported significantly improved quality of life (HerQLes: median + 36.7, PROMIS: median - 9.5). CONCLUSION Redo-TAR may be performed as a salvage procedure to reconstruct complex defects after failed TAR, however, in our center, it is associated with increased wound morbidity and fairly high composite recurrence rates. Despite this, patients report improvements in quality of life and pain.

Because TSD is not often formally addressed during training, therapists across the spectrum of clinical child psychology and psychiatry are often left with the belief that disclosures are rare or inherently negative occurrences that should be avoided. As a byproduct, therapists often develop a blind spot to many disclosures that they make and are thus underprepared to navigate the complex decision-making process that surrounds TSD. In our article, we address the elephant in the room: that most therapists disclose in some form or other. In addressing this topic, we hope to encourage replacement of avoidance and silence with discourse and reflection around TSD occurrences.

We will also review the importance of respiratory infections and exacerbations of asthma and will discuss genetic factors controlling host immune responses to respiratory infection and the influence these may exert on asthma pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS Birth cohort studies have demonstrated bidirectional relationships between early life severe respiratory infections and asthma development; however, whether there is a clear causal role for severe respiratory infection early in life leading directly to asthma development remains unknown. The role of rhinovirus infection in asthma exacerbations has been investigated experimentally, with asthmatic patients exhibiting greater clinical illness severity, which was related to increased virus load and lower airways inflammation. Polymorphisms in genes involved in innate, antiviral and Th1 and Th2 immune responses have been linked to asthma as well as to early life severe respiratory infections, suggesting that host factors are likely to play an important role in their association. SUMMARY Early in life, such genetic factors contribute to the risk of severe lower respiratory tract viral infection as well as later development of wheezing illness and asthma. Respiratory viruses are also the most frequent cause of asthma exacerbations at all ages.","Bartlett, Nathan W; McLean, Gary R; Chang, Yoon-Seok; Johnston, Sebastian L",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,85,27

Although patients with anxiety and mood disorders experienced greater pain, physicians were less likely to order opioids for these patients. Analyses also disclosed an interaction of anxiety with pain-the pain-opioid relation was stronger for patients without an anxiety disorder than for patients with an anxiety diagnosis. Instead, physicians were more likely to place non-opioid analgesic orders to manage the pain of patients with anxiety disorders.

To develop new recruitment and retention strategies, therefore, we need to draw on as wide a variation in blood donor motivations as possible. The primary aim of this study is to draw on a large survey of donors to develop a broad, theoretically instantiated typology of donor motivations to identify new and less common, yet practically important, motivations that have not been previously reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Using data from the UK Blood Donor Survey run by NHS Blood and Transplant/Public Health England Epidemiology Unit (N = 61 123 donors), we analyze fixed (N = 52 225) and free (N = 8867) responses to develop a more comprehensive typology of blood donor motivations based on theories from the biology, psychology, philosophy, economics, and sociology of altruism. RESULTS We identified 54 motivations, including a number of newly identified motivations, for blood donations which we organized into 12 superordinate categories (eg, ""inspiration via moral elevation,"" ""perceived social closeness,"" and ""fungibility of donations""). These are linked to intervention suggestions such as donating blood in memoriam or donating blood as an alternative to other charitable acts. CONCLUSION We present the most comprehensive account of blood donor motivations to-date. This work also offers a structure for coding free-text responses, developing motivational measures, and identifying tangible interventions. Thus, we feel that this is a valuable resource for blood donor researchers, marketers, and policy makers.","Ferguson, Eamonn; Hill, Alexandra; Lam, Michael; Reynolds, Claire; Davison, Katy; Lawrence, Claire; Brailsford, Susan R",Transfusion,85,24

Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8% to 4.4% in women, and from 2.4% to 5% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2%-2.3%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5% to 6% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14% to 15%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.","Siegel, Rebecca L; Miller, Kimberly D; Fuchs, Hannah E; Jemal, Ahmedin",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,85,1

Although sedatives are often administered to improve comfort and facilitate ventilation, they can be deleterious. Whether opioids improve asynchronies with fewer negative effects is unknown. We hypothesized that opioids alone would improve asynchronies and result in more wakeful patients than sedatives alone or sedatives-plus-opioids. METHODS This prospective multicenter observational trial enrolled critically ill adults mechanically ventilated (MV) > 24 h. We compared asynchronies and sedation depth in patients receiving sedatives, opioids, or both. We recorded sedation level and doses of sedatives and opioids. BetterCare™ software continuously registered ineffective inspiratory efforts during expiration (IEE), double cycling (DC), and asynchrony index (AI) as well as MV modes. All variables were averaged per day. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyze the relationships between asynchronies, sedation level, and sedative and opioid doses. RESULTS In 79 patients, 14,166,469 breaths were recorded during 579 days of MV. Overall asynchronies were not significantly different in days classified as sedatives-only, opioids-only, and sedatives-plus-opioids and were more prevalent in days classified as no-drugs than in those classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, irrespective of the ventilatory mode. Sedative doses were associated with sedation level and with reduced DC (p < 0.0001) in sedatives-only days. However, on days classified as sedatives-plus-opioids, higher sedative doses and deeper sedation had more IEE (p < 0.0001) and higher AI (p = 0.0004). Opioid dosing was inversely associated with overall asynchronies (p < 0.001) without worsening sedation levels into morbid ranges. CONCLUSIONS Sedatives, whether alone or combined with opioids, do not result in better patient-ventilator interaction than opioids alone, in any ventilatory mode. Higher opioid dose (alone or with sedatives) was associated with lower AI without depressing consciousness. Higher sedative doses administered alone were associated only with less DC.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect size of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on post-operative mortality by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was performed. A search was undertaken using electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library to identify eligible studies published from 1 November 2019 until 21 August 2020. Eligible papers for meta-analysis were those that provided mortality rates following elective and emergency surgery in both COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Forest plots and estimates of odds of death related to having COVID-19 were formed using MedCalc version 9.6 software. Funnel plots to assess for publication bias and heterogeneity were formed in Meta-Essentials. RESULTS There were 140 records screened for inclusion. Full texts of 39 articles were reviewed, and 36 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. There were eight studies eligible for meta-analysis. There was a total of 193 operations performed on patients with a concurrent COVID-19 infection and 910 performed on patients who were COVID-19 negative. The odds ratio for mortality in patients who underwent a surgical procedure while COVID-19 positive was 7.9 (95% confidence interval: 3.2-19.4). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis confirms that concurrent COVID-19 infection increases the risk of surgical mortality. The magnitude of this risk mandates that strategies are developed to mitigate the risk at both an individual and system level.","Brown, Wendy A; Moore, Eileen M; Watters, David A",ANZ journal of surgery,85,9

Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities. However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs. The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic. In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications. In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

Despite this promise, one challenge with identifying optimal solutions is the absence of unified evaluation methods and datasets that are not specific to a single research group. This paper introduces the largest known international database of ultrasound channel data and describes associated evaluation methods that were initially developed for the Challenge on Ultrasound Beamforming with Deep Learning (CUBDL), which was offered as a component of the 2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium. We summarize the challenge results and present qualitative and quantitative assessments using both the initially closed CUBDL evaluation test dataset (which was crowd-sourced from multiple groups around the world) and additional in vivo breast ultrasound data contributed after the challenge was completed. As an example quantitative assessment, single plane wave images from the CUBDL Task 1 dataset produced a mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) of 0.67 and a mean lateral resolution of 0.42 mm when formed with delay-and-sum beamforming, compared to a mean gCNR as high as 0.81 and a mean lateral resolution as low as 0.32 mm when formed with networks submitted by the challenge winners. We also describe contributed CUBDL data that may be used for training of future networks. The compiled database includes a total of 576 image acquisition sequences. We additionally introduce a neural network-based global sound speed estimator implementation that was necessary to fairly evaluate results obtained with this international database. The integration of CUBDL evaluation methods, evaluation code, network weights from the challenge winners, and all datasets described herein are publicly available (visit https://cubdl.jhu.edu for details).","Hyun, Dongwoon; Wiacek, Alycen; Goudarzi, Sobhan; Rothlubbers, Sven; Asif, Amir; Eickel, Klaus; Eldar, Yonina C; Huang, Jiaqi; Mischi, Massimo; Rivaz, Hassan; Sinden, David; Van Sloun, Ruud J G; Strohm, Hannah; Lediju Bell, Muyinatu A","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",85,5

Furthermore, the disease incidence has increased recently, especially in countries that have switched from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines. AREAS COVERED Here, we provide a state-of-the art summary of the reasons for the pertussis resurgence and to discuss potential solutions using current vaccines and challenges for the development of novel vaccines. PubMed was searched for publications with the terms pertussis and vaccines. Many new vaccine candidates are proposed but have not reached clinical development. Most of them induce strong systemic immune responses and protection in mice. However, since B. pertussis is a mucosal pathogen, albeit with systemic effects, local immunity may be crucial to prevent B. pertussis infection and transmission. Recent efforts have focused on vaccine candidates able to induce immunity in the nasal cavity, and one of them is currently in clinical development. EXPERT COMMENTARY New pertussis vaccines are needed to durably control the disease and circulation of B. pertussis. A major challenge is to prove efficacy against disease in randomized controlled trials, while it is feasible to provide evidence for prevention of infection, since asymptomatic carriage of B. pertussis is wide spread.","Locht, Camille",Expert review of vaccines,85,12

DESIGN Prospective, internally controlled, observational study. SETTING A University Teaching Hospital ANIMALS Six apparently healthy, owned cats. INTERVENTIONS Blood collection by jugular venipuncture. Transfusion with labeled, autologous, fresh RBCs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Anticoagulated whole blood (35 mL/cat) was collected in 2 equal aliquots. RBCs were washed and labeled at 2 different biotin densities, before suspension in autologous plasma. Labeled RBCs were then transfused using 2 methods, gravity flow and pump delivery using a 20 mL syringe and 18 μm microaggregate filter. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat at 2-hour intervals for 12 hours following completion of the transfusions. Additional samples were collected at weekly intervals up to 6 weeks to assess circulating half-life of the transfused cells. Cell survival was assessed via flow cytometry. The proportion of transfused cells remaining in each of the 2 populations was measured. Biotinylated RBCs were readily detected in all cats over the 6-week sampling period. There was a significant decrease in both populations of labeled cells over the 6-week period (P < 0.01), as expected. There was no difference in probability that the RBCs would survive up to 12 hours immediately following transfusion, and no significant difference in survival between the 2 groups over 6 weeks. The average half-life of all labeled cells was approximately 23 days. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that, in contrast to findings from dogs, transfusion of autologous feline RBCs using a syringe + aggregate filter method does not significantly impact short- or long-term survival of the transfused cells.","Heikes, Brandon W; Ruaux, Craig G",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,85,1

The approach of SP has been applied in multiple laparoscopic disciplines owing to its improved cosmetic result. However, in SP surgery, instrument movements are further restricted, resulting in increased instrument collisions compared with standard multiport (MP) laparoscopy. METHODS Our goal was to develop a trainer that can quantitatively measure task time, force and motion data during both MP and SP training to investigate the influence of instrument configuration on performance. Custom-made abdominal force sensors and accelerometers were integrated into a new training box that can be used in an SP and an MP configuration. This new box trainer measures forces, acceleration, and tilt angles during training of SP and MP laparoscopy. With the new trainer, 13 novices performed a tissue manipulation task to test whether significant differences exist between MP and SP in maximum abdominal force, maximum tissue manipulation force, maximum acceleration, and tilt angles of the handles. RESULTS The results show that the task time (SP-145s, standard deviation (SD) = 103 vs MP-61s SD = 16), maximum abdominal force (SP-8.4N, SD = 2.0 vs MP-left (L)-3.3N, SD = 0.8 and MP-right (R)-5.8N, SD = 2.1), tissue manipulation force (SP-10.4N, SD = 3.6 and MP-5.6N, SD = 1.3), maximum acceleration (MP-L-9m/s(2), SD = 5 vs SP-L-14m/s(2), SD = 7), and tilt angles of the left handle are significantly higher in SP. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION This study shows that the new trainer can be used to find the most important differences in instrument and tissue handling, which is an important step toward the assessment of surgical skills needed for safe SP surgery depending on force and motion-based parameters.","Horeman, Tim; Sun, Siyu; Tuijthof, Gabrielle J M; Jansen, Frank William; Meijerink, Jeroen W J H J; Dankelman, Jenny",Journal of surgical education,85,7

However, transcript quantification commonly relies on alignment methods requiring a lot of computational resources and processing time, which does not scale easily to large datasets. K-mer decomposition constitutes a new way to process RNA-seq data for the identification of transcriptional signatures, as k-mers can be used to quantify accurately gene expression in a less resource-consuming way. We present the Kmerator Suite, a set of three tools designed to extract specific k-mer signatures, quantify these k-mers into RNA-seq datasets and quickly visualize large dataset characteristics. The core tool, Kmerator, produces specific k-mers for 97% of human genes, enabling the measure of gene expression with high accuracy in simulated datasets. KmerExploR, a direct application of Kmerator, uses a set of predictor gene-specific k-mers to infer metadata including library protocol, sample features or contaminations from RNA-seq datasets. KmerExploR results are visualized through a user-friendly interface. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Kmerator Suite can be used for advanced queries targeting known or new biomarkers such as mutations, gene fusions or long non-coding RNAs for human health applications.","Riquier, Sébastien; Bessiere, Chloé; Guibert, Benoit; Bouge, Anne-Laure; Boureux, Anthony; Ruffle, Florence; Audoux, Jérôme; Gilbert, Nicolas; Xue, Haoliang; Gautheret, Daniel; Commes, Thérèse",NAR genomics and bioinformatics,85,16

About 87% of strokes are ischemic in origin and occur in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

However, tPA has a small therapeutic window for administration (3 - 6 hr), and is only effective in 4% of the patients who actually receive it. Current research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology of stroke in order to find potential therapeutic targets. Thus, reliable models are crucial, and the MCA occlusion (MCAo) model (also termed the intraluminal filament or suture model) is deemed to be the most clinically relevant surgical model of ischemic stroke, and is fairly non-invasive and easily reproducible. Typically the MCAo model is used with rodents, especially with mice due to all the genetic variations available for this species.

Herein, we report long-term outcomes of combined ER and RFA for BO (HGD and/or EC) from a single-arm multicentre interventional study. DESIGN In 13 European centres, patients with BO ≤ 12 cm with HGD and/or EC on 2 separate endoscopies were eligible for inclusion. Visible lesions (<2 cm length; <50% circumference) were removed with ER, followed by serial RFA every 3 months (max 5 sessions). Follow-up endoscopy was scheduled at 6 months after the first negative post-treatment endoscopic control and annually thereafter. OUTCOMES complete eradication of neoplasia (CE-neo) and intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM); durability of CE-neo and CE-IM (once achieved) during follow-up. Biopsy and resection specimens underwent centralised pathology review. RESULTS 132 patients with median BO length C3M6 were included. After entry-ER in 119 patients (90%) and a median of 3 RFA (IQR 3-4) treatments, CE-neo was achieved in 121/132 (92%) and CE-IM in 115/132 patients (87%), per intention-to-treat analysis. Per-protocol analysis, CE-neo and CE-IM were achieved in 98% and 93%, respectively. After a median of 27 months following the first negative post-treatment endoscopic control, neoplasia and IM recurred in 4% and 8%, respectively.

METHODS A non-systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted using the PubMed database, and the main companies that provide surgical devices were contacted for information. RESULTS Most commercially available smoke evacuators use a combination of suction and mechanical filtering. There are also electrostatic precipitators that charge surgical smoke and retain the particles via electrostatic attraction. The search identified three insufflators with desufflation mode, four modular smoke evacuators using mechanical filtration, and only one device using electrostatic precipitation.

From February 21 to March 21, 2020, of 672 suspected COVID-19 patients from two centers who underwent CT, 45 RT-PCR-positives (28 males, median age 75, IQR 66-81 years) with previous CTs performed a median 36 months before (IQR 12-72 months) were included. We assessed PnE, pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, ascending aorta (Ao) diameter, and PA/Ao ratio. Most common presentations were fever and dyspnea (15/45) and fever alone (13/45). Outcome was available for 41/45 patients, 15/41 dead and 26/41 discharged. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) alone were found in 29/45 patients, GGOs with consolidations in 15/45, consolidations alone in 1/45. All but one patient had bilateral pneumonia, 9/45 minimal, 22/45 mild, 9/45 moderate, and 5/45 severe PnE. PA diameter (median 31 mm, IQR 28-33 mm) was larger than before (26 mm, IQR 25-29 mm) (P<0.001), PA/Ao ratio (median 0.83, IQR 0.76-0.92) was higher than before (0.76, IQR 0.72-0.82) (P<0.001). Patients with adverse outcome (death) had higher PA diameter (P=0.001), compared to discharged ones. Only weak correlations were found between ΔPA or ΔPA/Ao and PnE (ρ≤0.453, P≤0.032), with 4/45 cases with moderate-severe PnE and minimal increase in PA metrics. In conclusion, enlarged PA diameter was associated to death in COVID-19 patients, a finding deserving further investigation as a potential driver of therapy decision-making.","Spagnolo, Pietro; Cozzi, Andrea; Foà, Riccardo Alessandro; Spinazzola, Angelo; Monfardini, Lorenzo; Bnà, Claudio; Alì, Marco; Schiaffino, Simone; Sardanelli, Francesco",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,85,1

METHOD Bilateral surface EMG activity of the anterior temporalis (AT), masseter (MM), and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles was recorded in 43 subjects during unilateral chewing and tooth grinding. Thirteen patients had TMD and a natural mediotrusive contact (Group 1), 15 had TMD without a natural mediotrusive contact (Group 2), and 15 were healthy subjects without mediotrusive contacts (Group 3). All subjects were examined according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). All EMG values were standardized as the percentage of EMG activity recorded during maximum isometric contraction on cotton rolls. RESULTS EMG activity from all muscles measured showed no significant differences between groups during chewing and grinding. Overall, in all groups, the EMG activity during chewing was higher in the working side than the non-working side in AT and MM muscles. During grinding, these differences were only found in masseter muscles (mainly in eccentric grinding). SCM EMG activity did not show significant differences during chewing and grinding tasks. Symmetry, muscular balance, and absence of lateral jaw displacement were common findings in all groups. DISCUSSION EMG results suggest that the contribution of a natural mediotrusive occlusal contact to EMG patterns in TMD patients is minor. Therefore, the elimination of this occlusal feature for therapeutic purposes could be not indicated.","Fuentes, Aler D; Sforza, Chiarella; Miralles, Rodolfo; Ferreira, Cláudia L; Mapelli, Andrea; Lodetti, Gianluigi; Martin, Conchita",Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,85,26

This study evaluates the perioperative outcome and the learning curves for two surgeons while introducing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS Morbidly obese patients undergoing primary LRYGB were included. Lengths of surgery and postoperative hospital stay, and 30-day rates of morbidity, reoperations, and readmissions were set as indicators of the learning curve. Learning effects were evaluated by graphical analyses and comparing the first and last 40 procedures for both surgeons. RESULTS The 292 included patients had a mean age of 40.0 +/- 9.5 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 46.7 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2). The mean length of surgery was 101 +/- 55 min. Complications occurred in 43 patients (14.7%), with no conversions to open surgery in the primary procedure and no mortality. Reoperations were performed in 14 patients (4.8%), of which five patients required open surgery. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 1-77), and 19 patients (6.5%) were readmitted. High patient age, but not high BMI, was associated with an increased risk of complication. For both surgeons, lengths of surgery and hospital stay were significantly reduced (p < 0.001), leveling out after 100 procedures. Reductions in the rates of morbidity, reoperations and readmissions were not found. CONCLUSION LRYGB was introduced with an acceptable morbidity rate and no mortality. Only the length of surgery and postoperative hospital stay were suitable indicators of a learning curve, which comprised about 100 cases.","Søvik, Torgeir T; Aasheim, Erlend T; Kristinsson, Jon; Schou, Carl Fredrik; Diep, Lien My; Nesbakken, Arild; Mala, Tom",Obesity surgery,85,23

Computed tomography-guided dual marking was performed on 36 pulmonary nodules of 32 patients and needlescopy-assisted resection was performed monitored by C-arm fluoroscopy. The mean age of the patients was 58 ± 12 (range 12-77) yrs. The mean size of the nodules was 7.5 ± 3.7 (3-17) mm. Their mean distance from the pleural surface was 7.3 ± 7.5 (0-35) mm. There were nine pure ground-glass opacity lesions, five semi-solid lesions and 22 solid lesions. The time of the dual localisation procedure was 13.1 ± 4.8 (7-23) min. Complications of the marking were pneumothorax in nine patients, and intrapulmonary bleeding in three. One hookwire dislodged during the operation. All nodules were successfully resected under needlescopy without conversion to a conventional thoracoscopy (5 mm or 10 mm thoracoscopy) or a minithoracotomy. There was no complication related to needlescopy-assisted resection. Dual marking with hookwire and lipiodol is a safe and none time consuming procedure, and needlescopy-assisted lung resection for small nodules is technically feasible and useful for histological diagnosis and treatment.","Kang, D-Y; Kim, H K; Kim, Y K; Yong, H S; Kang, E-Y; Choi, Y H",The European respiratory journal,85,15

METHODS The study design was a retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer clinically limited to the uterus and/or cervix undergoing TLH-BSO or TAH-BSO, aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy(APLNDx), peritoneal washings with/without omentectomy from May 1996 to April /2006. A ""senior"" surgeon taught three board-certified or board-eligible gynecologic oncologists a ""new-to-them"" technique to perform both TLH-BSO and TAH-BSO with APLNDx using argon beam coagulation and endoscopic staplers in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. The main outcome measures were: a) length of surgery; b) surgical measures, e.g. lymph node count; and c) peri-operative morbidity. A comparison of outcomes with the ""senior"" surgeon was undertaken. The learning curve characteristics were analyzed by ANOVA and curve estimate analysis. RESULTS The mean operative times associated with learning a new technique to perform TLH-BSO with APLNDx and TAH-BSO with APLNDx were 155.39+/-26.32 and 102.28+/-34.22 min, respectively, with significant improvement after 20 cases (150.27+/-26.68 vs. 172.30+/-22.28, p=0.030) and 30 cases (93.30+/-24.97 vs. 124.63+/-29.73, p=0.030), respectively. Intra- and peri-operative morbidity and lymph node count were unaffected by experience. CONCLUSION While mean operative times decreased, outcome measures of surgical quality were not adversely affected during the learning curve for post-fellowship training while acquiring ""new-to-them"" surgical techniques. This study emphasizes the need for ""senior"" surgical supervision during the initial training period. The results of this study are likely transferable to fellowship-trained gynecologic oncologists learning other ""new-to-them"" surgical techniques and procedures.","Miao, Jinwei; Fleury, Aimee C; Kushnir, Christina L; Silver, David F; Naik, Raj; Spirtos, Nick M",Gynecologic oncology,85,16

However, the adsorbed structures are not well characterized; therefore, fundamental investigation on vesicle adsorption behavior is necessary for correct understanding of the monolayer systems. Herein, we investigated the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine vesicles onto silicone oil-water interfaces using fluorescence microscopy and pendant drop tensiometry. The interfacial monolayer coverage, S, was determined by assuming S = 1 for tightly packed monolayers. Adsorption for 10 min with a lipid concentration of 0.2 mM resulted in S ≈ 0.4. An increase in lipid concentration (0.5-2 mM) and adsorption time (1 h) moderately increased monolayer coverage (S ≈ 0.6). However, extended adsorption for 24 h only slightly increased coverage (S ≈ 0.7). Monolayers with an S < 0.6 were homogeneous while those with an S > 0.6 were associated with several vesicular structures. The surface density of these bound vesicles increased with increasing S. We conclude that vesicles readily fused with the interface to form monolayers at S < 0.6 and that their fusogenicity considerably decreased at S > 0.6. These results demonstrate that the ability of vesicles to form monolayers is determined by the interfacial coverage.","Kataoka-Hamai, Chiho; Kawakami, Kohsaku",The journal of physical chemistry.

Arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction (ASCR) is a new treatment option originally described using a fascia lata autograft harvested through an open approach. However, concerns about donor site morbidity have discouraged surgeons from using this type of graft. Hypothesis ASCR using a minimally invasive harvested fascia lata autograft produces good 6-month and 2-year shoulder outcomes in IRCTs, with low-impact thigh morbidity at 2 years. Study Design Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods From 2015 to 2016, a total of 22 consecutive patients (mean age, 64.8 ± 8.6 years) with chronic IRCTs (Hamada grade 1-2; Goutallier cumulative grade ≥3; Patte stage 1: 2 patients; Patte stage 2: 6 patients; Patte stage 3: 14 patients) underwent ASCR using a minimally invasive harvested fascia lata autograft. All patients completed preoperative and 6-month evaluations consisting of the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), subjective shoulder value (SSV), Constant score (CS), range of motion (ROM), acromiohumeral interval (AHI), and magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-one patients completed the 2-year shoulder and donor site morbidity assessments. Results The mean active ROMs improved significantly (P < .001): elevation, from 74.8° ± 55.5° to 104.5° ± 41.9° (6 months) and 143.8° ± 31.7° (2 years); abduction, from 53.2° ± 43.3° to 86.6° ± 32.9° (6 months) and 120.7° ± 37.7° (2 years); external rotation, from 13.2° ± 18.4° to 27.0° ± 16.1° (6 months) and 35.6° ± 17.3° (2 years); and internal rotation, from 1.2 ± 1.5 points to 2.6 ± 1.5 points (6 months) and 3.8 ± 1.2 points (2 years). The mean functional shoulder scores improved significantly (P < .001): SST, from 2.1 ± 2.9 to 6.8 ± 3.5 (6 months) and 8.6 ± 3.5 (2 years); SSV, from 33.0% ± 17.4% to 55.7% ± 25.6% (6 months) and 70.0% ± 23.0% (2 years); CS, from 17.5 ± 13.4 to 42.5 ± 14.9 (6 months) and 64.9 ± 18.0 (2 years). The mean shoulder abduction strength improved significantly (P < .001) from 0.0 to 1.1 ± 1.4 kg (6 months) and 2.8 ± 2.6 kg (2 years). The mean AHI improved from 6.4 ± 3.3 mm to 8.0 ± 2.5 mm (6 months) and decreased to 7.1 ± 2.5 mm (2 years). This 0.7 ± 1.5-mm overall decrease was statistically significant (P = .042). At 6 months, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) had no graft tears. At 2 years, 12 of 21 patients (57.1%) were bothered by their harvested thigh, 16 (76.2%) noticed donor site changes, 16 (76.2%) considered that the shoulder surgery's end result compensated for the thigh's changes, and 18 (85.7%) would undergo the same surgery again. Conclusion ASCR using a minimally invasive harvested fascia lata autograft produced good 6-month and 2-year shoulder outcomes in IRCTs, with low-impact thigh morbidity at 2 years.","de Campos Azevedo, Clara Isabel; Ângelo, Ana Catarina Leiria Pires Gago; Vinga, Susana",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,85,20

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, predictors and management of catheter entrapment due to severe RAS. METHODS A total of 723 patients undergoing transradial coronary catheterization at a single center were retrospectively enrolled in the present study. Patients were divided into two groups: those with catheter entrapment due to severe RAS and those without. RESULTS The incidence of catheter entrapment was 0.8%. Height (161.2 ± 9.1 cm vs. 169.6 ± ± 10 cm, p = 0.047) and body surface area (1.86 ± 0.04 vs. 1.95 ± 0.18, p = 0.002) were found to be lower, and total procedure time 33.2 ± 13.4 min vs. 15.2 ± 12.3 min, p < 0.001) was longer in the entrapment group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that total procedure time independently predicted catheter entrapment (odds ratio: 1.057, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.004-1.114, p = 0.035). Receiver-operating characteristic curve demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy for prolonged total procedure time in predicting catheter entrapment (area under curve = 0.8, 95% CI 0.63-0.97, p = 0.01). Patients were effectively treated with stepwise administration of systemic vasodilators, forearm heating, sedation and as a last resort general anesthesia with no significant complication. CONCLUSIONS Catheter entrapment due to severe RAS during transradial approach was rare and prolonged total procedure time is an independent predictor of catheter entrapment. Treatment with stepwise administration of different treatment modalities is possible with no significant complication.","Zencirci, Ertuğrul; Değirmencioğlu, Aleks",Cardiology journal,85,1

Our goal was to provide guidance for the development of eHealth tools for diverse older populations for use in geriatric care models. DESIGN Guidance for eHealth tools was compiled from user design resources and eHealth design literature. Pragmatic examples were provided from an evidenced-based eHealth tool called PREPAREforYourCare.org (PREPARE). We used quantitative feasibility data from PREPARE research studies and qualitative analysis of PREPARE focus groups, cognitive interviews, and feedback from randomized trials to further inform our recommendations. RESULTS Guidance and lessons learned include: (1) define clear objectives and a conceptual framework; (2) co-create with the target population; (3) optimize the design and layout for accessibility and ease of use, such as text at the 5th grade reading level, closed captioning, etc.; (4) use simple, standardized navigation design; (5) use actionable information to enhance behavior change, such as modeling of behaviors; (6) align accompanying written materials with the eHealth tool; and (7) create tracking mechanisms for ongoing user feedback. PREPARE is used as a case example to provide pragmatic illustrations for how the guidance may be operationalized. CONCLUSION eHealth tools can be tailored to the unique characteristics, preferences, and needs of diverse older populations. Following the ""lessons learned"" may help decrease health disparities among diverse older adults and ensure eHealth tools are readily accessible and culturally appropriate.","Scheerens, Charlotte; Gilissen, Joni; Volow, Aiesha M; Powell, Jana L; Ferguson, Clarissa M; Farrell, David; Li, Brookelle; Berry, Corinne; Sudore, Rebecca L",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,85,27

METHODS This was a pooled analysis encompassing 3 pexidartinib-treated TGCT cohorts: 1) a phase 1 extension study (NCT01004861; 1000 mg/d; n = 39), 2) ENLIVEN patients randomized to pexidartinib (1000 mg/d for 2 weeks and then 800 mg/d; n = 61), and 3) ENLIVEN crossover patients (NCT02371369; 800 mg/d; n = 30). Eligible patients were 18 years old or older and had a histologically confirmed TGCT that was unresectable and symptomatic. Efficacy endpoints included the best overall response (complete or partial response) and the duration of response (DOR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and the tumor volume score (TVS). The safety assessment included the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and hepatic laboratory abnormalities (aminotransferase elevations and mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity). The data cutoff was May 31, 2019. RESULTS One hundred thirty patients with TGCT received pexidartinib (median treatment duration, 19 months; range, 1 to 76+ months); 54 (42%) remained on treatment at the end of the analysis (26 months after initial data cut of March 2017). The RECIST overall response rate (ORR) was 60%; the TVS ORR was 65%. The median times to response were 3.4 (RECIST) and 2.8 months (TVS), with 48 of the responding patients (62%) achieving a RECIST partial response by 6 months and with 72 (92%) doing so by 18 months. The median DOR was reached for TVS (46.8 months). Reported TEAEs were mostly low-grade, with hair color changes being most frequent (75%). Most liver abnormalities (92%) were aminotransferase elevations; 4 patients (3%) experienced mixed/cholestatic hepatotoxicity (all within the first 2 months of treatment), which was reversible in all cases (recovery spanned 1-7 months).

Furthermore, we assessed cross-district patient migration for MT for the first time using hospitals' structured quality reports and German Diagnosis-Related Groups data in 2019. FINDINGS Number of hospitals performing more than 100 MT procedures/year doubled in Germany from 2016 (n = 36) to 2019 (n = 71), and these neurointerventional centers performed 71% of all MT procedures in 2019. The overall increase in MT procedures was largely driven by these high-volume neurointerventional centers with ability to perform MT 24/7 (121% increase as compared with 8% increase in hospitals performing less than 100 MT procedures/year). The highest cross-district patient mobility/transfer of stroke patients for MT was observed in districts adjacent to these high-volume neurointerventional centers with existing neurovascular networks. CONCLUSION The substantial increase in MT procedures observed in Germany between 2016 and 2019 was almost exclusively delivered by high-volume stroke centers performing more than 100 MT procedures per year in established neurovascular networks. As there is still a reasonable number of districts with low MT rates, further structural improvement including implementation of new or expansion of existing neurovascular networks and regional tailored MT triage concepts is needed.","Weber, Ralph; Bartig, Dirk; Krogias, Christos; Richter, Daniel; Hacke, Werner; Eyding, Jens",Neurological research and practice,85,17

Additionally, previous studies have been underpowered to robustly assess heterogeneity of effects on kidney outcomes by different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. We aimed to do a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on major kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine the consistency of effect size across trials and different levels of eGFR and albuminuria. METHODS We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, controlled, cardiovascular or kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that reported effects on major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to June 14, 2019, to identify eligible trials. The primary outcome was a composite of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease. We used random-effects models to obtain summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs and random-effects meta-regression to explore effect modification by subgroups of baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. This review is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019131774). FINDINGS From 2085 records identified, four studies met our inclusion criteria, assessing three SGLT2 inhibitors: empagliflozin (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), canagliflozin (CANVAS Program and CREDENCE), and dapagliflozin (DECLARE-TIMI 58). From a total of 38 723 participants, 252 required dialysis or transplantation or died of kidney disease, 335 developed end-stage kidney disease, and 943 had acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors substantially reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·52-0·86, p=0·0019), an effect consistent across studies (I2=0%, pheterogeneity=0·53). SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced end-stage kidney disease (0·65, 0·53-0·81, p<0·0001), and acute kidney injury (0·75, 0·66-0·85, p<0·0001), with consistent benefits across studies. Although we identified some evidence that the proportional effect of SGLT2 inhibitors might attenuate with declining kidney function (ptrend=0·073), there was clear, separate evidence of benefit for all eGFR subgroups, including for participants with a baseline eGFR 30-45 mL/min per 1·73 m2 (RR 0·70, 95% CI 0·54-0·91, p=0·0080). Renoprotection was also consistent across studies irrespective of baseline albuminuria (ptrend=0·66) and use of RAS blockade (pheterogeneity=0·31). INTERPRETATION SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes and provided protection against acute kidney injury. These data provide substantive evidence supporting the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent major kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

An imbalance of coagulation factors may play an important role in progression and prognosis of these patients. In this systematic review, we assessed the current literature on hemostasis biomarkers and the association with poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Approach and Results- A systematic search of Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed on studies reporting on hemostasis biomarkers and clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Studies were considered eligible if blood samples were collected within 72 hours after symptom onset. Additionally, clinical outcome should be assessed using a disability score (Barthel Index or modified Rankin scale). Methodological quality of included studies was assessed with an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies questionnaire. A total of 80 articles were read full text, and 41 studies were considered eligible for inclusion, reporting on 37 different hemostasis biomarkers. No single biomarker appeared to be effective in predicting poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. Conclusions- Based on current literature, no clear recommendations can be provided on which hemostasis biomarkers are a predictor of clinical outcome after acute ischemic stroke. However, some biomarkers show promising results and need to be further investigated and validated in large populations with clear defined study designs.","Donkel, Samantha J; Benaddi, Boutaina; Dippel, Diederik W J; Ten Cate, Hugo; de Maat, Moniek P M","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",85,28

It is believed that early reports of COVID-19 cases were noticed in December 2019 and soon after became a global public health emergency. It is advised that COVID-19 transmits through human to human contact and in most cases it remains asymptomatic. Several approaches are being utilized to control the outbreak of this fatal viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are known signature therapeutic tool for the viral diseases; they are small non-coding RNAs that target the mRNAs to inhibit their post-transcriptional expression, therefore, impeding their functions, thus can serve as watchdogs or micromanagers in the cells. AREAS COVERED This review work delineated COVID-19 and its association with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the possible role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and therapeutic potential of microRNAs and their effective delivery to treat COVID 19. EXPERT OPINION This review highlighted the importance of various miRNAs and their potential role in fighting with this pandemic as therapeutic molecules utilizing nanotechnology.","Chauhan, Neeraj; Jaggi, Meena; Chauhan, Subhash C; Yallapu, Murali M",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,85,1

Acoustic detection can be used to assess the likelihood of insect infestations in bags of grain, flour, and other commodities that are stored in small holdings in developing countries, enabling rapid targeting of treatments. A portable postharvest insect detection system was developed with the goal to provide low-cost capability to acoustically assess infestations in small-scale storage facilities. Electret microphones input pest insect sounds to a 32-bit microcontroller platform that digitized and stored the signals on a digital memory card transferable to a portable laptop computer. The insect sounds then were analyzed by custom-written software that matched their spectra to those of known pests. Infestations of Sitophilus oryzae (L) in 2.6-kg bags could be detected down to densities of 1.9 adults/kg in grain and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) down to 3.8 adults/kg in flour in laboratory settings. Also, differences in the rates of sounds per insect in treatments with different numbers ranging from 5 to 50 insects suggested that the sound rates of adults of different species at different population densities may be noticeably affected by aggregation pheromones or other behaviorally active semiochemicals. Further testing is needed but previous experience with acoustic detection systems suggests that the prototype has potential for use in small storage facilities where early detection of infestations is difficult to provide.","Mankin, R W; Jetter, E; Rohde, B; Yasir, M",Journal of economic entomology,85,17

In the robotic setting the surgeon must rely on visual cues in the absence of tactile feedback. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a dye that can be visualized under near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF). OBJECTIVE To describe our novel technique, which utilizes intraureteral injection of ICG and subsequent visualization under NIRF to facilitate RUR, and report our outcomes after these procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective review of 25 patients who underwent 26 RURs for various ureteral pathologies between June 2012 and October 2013. SURGICAL PROCEDURE After full disclosure, all patients consented to off-label use of ICG. A ureteral catheter and/or percutaneous nephrostomy tube were used to inject 10ml of ICG into the diseased ureter, above and below the stricture. Intraoperatively, NIRF was activated to assist in identification of the ureter and to localize the margins of ureteral strictures. MEASUREMENTS Postoperatively, RURs were assessed for clinical success (absence of symptoms attributable to ureteral pathology) and radiological success (absence of a ureteral stricture on imaging). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Our technique provided visual cues and aided in successful performance of 26 RURs in 25 patients. The procedures included ureterolysis (n=4), pyeloplasty (n=8), ureteroureterostomy (n=9), and ureteroneocystostomy (n=5). There were no perioperative complications attributable to ICG use. At a mean overall follow-up of 12 mo, all procedures were clinically and radiologically successful. This study is limited by the small sample size and short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Intraureteral injection of ICG and subsequent visualization under NIRF facilitates RUR by aiding in rapid and accurate identification of the ureter, and precise localization of the proximal and distal ureteral stricture margins. In our experience, our technique is safe, easy to perform, and reproducible. PATIENT SUMMARY In this report, we describe a new technique to facilitate robot-assisted ureteral reconstructions using intraureteral injection of ICG and subsequent visualization under near-infrared fluorescence. More specifically, our technique allows for rapid and accurate identification of the ureter, and precise localization of ureteral strictures.","Lee, Ziho; Moore, Blake; Giusto, Laura; Eun, Daniel D",European urology,85,11

Methods The case group comprised of 133 children born with cleft lip and/or palate, and the control was 133 non-cleft children born full-term. Data was collected including age, gender, origin and risk factors for cleft lip and palate from patients' files, interviewing supervising doctors, and the patient. Data was then filled out into Excel and underwent statistical analysis using the Goodness of Fit Test and Chi-Square to determine the significance of the results. Results Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) was slightly higher among males (51.9%). Combined cleft lip and palate (CLP) was the most common presentation (42.1%). Cleft lips (CL) were mostly complete cleft (51,5%) incomplete cleft comprised (41.1%), In the sample 35.4% of the cases were bilateral, 32.3% were right unilateral, 28.3% were left unilateral and 4% were median cleft. Cleft palate (CP) was mostly complete (46.6%) there were incomplete clefts (40%), and the remainder were submucosal (13.4%). Isolated CL and combined CLP were higher in males (51.6%, 62.5% respectively). Both isolated CP and Tessier anomaly were more common in females (64.7% and 58.3% respectively). consanguineous marriages accounted for 36.1% of cases. 21.8% of the sample had a first-degree relative and 24.8% had a second degree relative born with CL/P. There were only 7 cases (0.05%) of syndromic CL/P: Down's (4), Pierre Robin's (2), and Van der Woude Syndrome (1). A relationship was found between CL/P and the risk factors: taking anticonvulsants (without specifying the drug) (p = 0.025, OR = 10.73 C.I. 95%), taking retinoic acid (p-value = 0.049, OR = 4.75 C.I. 95%), not consuming folic acid (p-value = 0.00, OR = 28.23 C.I. 95%), and smoking cigarettes (p-value = 0.046, OR = 2.00 C.I. 95%). There was no relationship with maternal alcohol consumption or maternal diabetes (p-values = 0.652 and 0.210, respectively). SOM was present in 63.2% of patients with CL/P and were mostly isolated CP. Conclusion CL/P was only slightly higher among males. The most common condition was CLP. There was higher incidence of CL/P among second-degree relatives than first degree. Down's, Pierre Robin's, and Van der Woude Syndromes may be associated with CL/P. Taking anticonvulsants, taking retinoic acid, not consuming folic acid, and smoking cigarettes all have a role in the incidence of CL/P. More than half of the sample had an associated SOM.","Nahas, Louei Darjazini; Alzamel, Omar; Dali, Mammdouh Yassin; Alsawah, Rama; Hamsho, Ahmad; Sulman, Rafi; Alzamel, Mohamad; Omar, Abdullah",Heliyon,85,1

Here we applied innovative metrics to a physical neurosurgery trainer to explore whether these metrics differentiate between different levels of experience across different tasks. METHODS Twenty-four participants (9 experts, 15 novices) performed four tasks (dissection, spatial adaptation, depth adaptation, and the A-B-A task) using the PsT1 training system. Four performance metrics (collision, precision, dissected area, and time) and six kinematic metrics (dispersion, path length, depth perception, velocity, acceleration, and motion smoothness) were collected. RESULTS For all tasks, the execution time (t) of the experts was significantly lower than that of novices (p<0.05). The experts performed significantly better in all but two of the other metrics, dispersion and sectional area, corresponding to the A-B-A task and dissection task, respectively, for which they showed a non-significant trend towards better performance (p = 0.052 and p = 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSION It is possible to differentiate between the skill levels of novices and experts according to parameters derived from the PsT1 platform, paving the way for the quantitative assessment of training progress using this system. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, neurosurgical simulators that gather surgical performance metrics offer a solution to the educational needs of residents.","Espinoza, Daniel Lorias; Carranza, Vicente González; Escamirosa, Fernando Perez; Chico-Ponce de León, Fernando; Martinez, Arturo Minor; Gutiérrez-Gnecchi, Jose Antonio",World neurosurgery,85,31

Despite efforts taken at the international level, there is no consensus on unified prevention/treatment strategies, largely stemming from inconsistencies of outcome reporting. Our objective was to comprehensively assess outcome reporting perinatal iron intervention trials as Phase 1 of core outcome set (COS) development to inform future research. METHODS Systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Databases, and CINAHL (January 2000 - April 2016), with inclusion of trials involving pregnant or postpartum women with ID/IDA confirmed before recruitment. Articles were independently screened and selected by 2 reviewers; data were extracted in duplicate. Quality was assessed using published scoring systems. Outcome definitions and measurement methods were tabulated. RESULTS Of 7,046 citations, 33 randomized controlled trials were included. Sixty-nine reported outcomes were categorized into 8 domains. High methodological quality characterized 25 (76%) studies. Reporting quality was low in 16 (49%), moderate in 13 (39%), and high in 4 (12%) studies. Variation was greatest for outcome definition, timing of assessment and measurement methods. CONCLUSION This review identifies a comprehensive long-list of outcomes reported of perinatal iron interventions for ID/IDA. Beyond highlighting existing variation in outcome reporting, it provides a foundation for development of a COS for future trials.","Malinowski, Ann Kinga; D'Souza, Rohan; Khan, Khalid S; Shehata, Nadine; Malinowski, Marcin; Daru, Jahnavi",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,85,30

Predictors of the initial drop and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown. To assess this, we performed a post-hoc analysis of 4289 participants in the CREDENCE trial with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease equally split into treatment and placebo groups who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week three. The eGFR was categorized at week three as greater than a 10% decline; between 0 and 10% decline; and no decline. Long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes were estimated in each category of acute eGFR change by linear mixed effects models and Cox regression after adjustment for baseline characteristics and medications use. Significantly more participants in the canagliflozin (45%) compared to the placebo (21%) group experienced an acute drop in eGFR over 10%. An over 30% drop occurred infrequently (4% of participants with canagliflozin and 2% with placebo). The odds ratio for a drop in eGFR over 10% with canagliflozin compared to placebo was significant at 3.03 (95% confidence interval 2.65, 3.47). Following the initial drop in eGFR, multivariable adjusted long-term eGFR trajectories, as well as overall and kidney safety profiles, in those treated with canagliflozin were similar across eGFR decline categories. Thus, although acute drops in eGFR over 10% occurred in nearly half of all participants following initiation of canagliflozin, the clinical benefit of canagliflozin was observed regardless. Additionally, safety outcomes were similar among subgroups of acute eGFR drop.","Oshima, Megumi; Jardine, Meg J; Agarwal, Rajiv; Bakris, George; Cannon, Christopher P; Charytan, David M; de Zeeuw, Dick; Edwards, Robert; Greene, Tom; Levin, Adeera; Lim, Soo Kun; Mahaffey, Kenneth W; Neal, Bruce; Pollock, Carol; Rosenthal, Norman; Wheeler, David C; Zhang, Hong; Zinman, Bernard; Perkovic, Vlado; Heerspink, Hiddo J L",Kidney international,85,1

However, in engineering disciplines, an arguably more important goal is that of feature extraction, the identification of relevant features associated with the various outcomes. For instance, in microbial communities, the identification of keystone species can often lead to improved prediction of future behavioral shifts. This paper proposes a novel feature extractor based on Deep Learning, which is largely agnostic to underlying assumptions regarding the training data. Starting from a collection of microbial species abundance counts, the Deep Learning model first trains itself to classify the selected distinct habitats. It then identifies indicator species associated with the habitats. The results are then compared and contrasted with those obtained by traditional statistical techniques. The indicator species are similar when compared at top taxonomic levels such as Domain and Phylum, despite visible differences in lower levels such as Class and Order. More importantly, when our estimated indicators are used to predict final habitat labels using simpler models (such as Support Vector Machines and traditional Artificial Neural Networks), the prediction accuracy is improved. Overall, this study serves as a preliminary step that bridges modern, black-box Machine Learning models with traditional, domain expertise-rich techniques.","Tsai, Yiting; Baldwin, Susan A; Gopaluni, Bhushan",PloS one,85,19

Infections with the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus have been shown to have a high prevalence in hospitals around the world. The spread of this virus might be impacted by the density of patients inside hospital bays. To investigate this aspect, in this study we consider a mathematical modelling and computational approach to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalised patients. We focus on 4-bed bays and 6-bed bays, which are commonly used to accommodate various non-COVID-19 patients in many hospitals across the United Kingdom (UK). We investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients in non-COVID bays, in the context of various scenarios: placing the initially-exposed individual in different beds, varying the recovery and incubation periods, having symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients, removing infected individuals from these hospital bays once they are known to be infected, and the role of periodic testing of hospitalised patients. Our results show that 4-bed bays reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 compared to 6-bed bays. Moreover, we show that the position of a new (not infected) patient in specific beds in a 6-bed bay might also slow the spread of the disease. Finally, we propose that regular SARS-CoV-2 testing of hospitalised patients would allow appropriate placement of infected patients in specific (COVID-only) hospital bays.","Martos, David Moreno; Parcell, Benjamin J; Eftimie, Raluca",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,85,0

Although many viruses encode RNA helicases and chaperones, their in vitro activities and their roles in infected cells largely remain elusive. Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Caliciviridae and constitute a significant and potentially fatal threat to human health. Here, we report that the protein NS3 encoded by human norovirus has both ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices and ATP-independent RNA-chaperoning activity that can remodel structured RNAs and facilitate strand annealing. Moreover, NS3 can facilitate viral RNA synthesis in vitro by norovirus polymerase. NS3 may therefore play an important role in norovirus RNA replication. Lastly, we demonstrate that the RNA-remodeling activity of NS3 is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound, and, more importantly, that it reduces the replication of the norovirus replicon in cultured human cells. Altogether, these findings are the first to demonstrate the presence of RNA-remodeling activities encoded by Caliciviridae and highlight the functional significance of NS3 in the noroviral life cycle.IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a diverse group of positive-strand RNA viruses, which annually cause hundreds of millions of human infections and over 200,000 deaths worldwide. For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases and/or chaperones have long been considered to play pivotal roles in viral life cycles. However, neither RNA helicase nor chaperoning activity has been demonstrated to be associated with any norovirus-encoded proteins, and it is also unknown whether norovirus replication requires the participation of any viral or cellular RNA helicases/chaperones. We found that a norovirus protein, NS3, not only has ATP-dependent helicase activity, but also acts as an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. Also, NS3 can facilitate in vitro viral RNA synthesis, suggesting the important role of NS3 in norovirus replication. Moreover, NS3 activities can be inhibited by an FDA-approved compound, which also suppresses norovirus replicon replication in human cells, raising the possibility that NS3 could be a target for antinoroviral drug development.","Li, Teng-Feng; Hosmillo, Myra; Schwanke, Hella; Shu, Ting; Wang, Zhaowei; Yin, Lei; Curry, Stephen; Goodfellow, Ian G; Zhou, Xi",Journal of virology,85,1

132508,132508,132508,Oral Abstracts.,11.967393,4.6484118,2013,"BACKGROUND Etiology of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is multifactorial, but incompetence of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) appears to be of crucial importance. Established manometric parameters for assessment of EGJ barrier function are sub-optimal, potentially because they reflect only a very brief (up to 30 seconds), not necessarily representative period. This prospective, case-control study tested the performance of novel, high-resolution manometry (HRM) parameters of EGJ function in the assessment of GERD. METHODS Patients with reflux symptoms and healthy controls (HC) underwent standard HRM and 24-hour pH±impedance measurements. EGJ morphology, lower esophageal sphincter pressure integral (LES-PI), EGJ contractile integral (EGJ-CI) were compared with total-EGJ-CI, a novel parameter summarizing EGJ barrier function during the entire HRM protocol. Esophageal acid exposure ≥4.2%/24 h (A-Reflux-pos) or ≥73 reflux episodes in 24 hours (V-Reflux-pos) were considered pathological. KEY RESULTS Sixty five HC and 452 patients completed HRM, 380 (84%) patients underwent ambulatory reflux-monitoring. LES-PI, EGJ-CI and total-EGJ-CI correlated with EGJ morphology subtypes (all P<.00001). Only total-EGJ-CI was consistently lower in A-Reflux-pos and V-Reflux-pos subjects compared with HC and patients without GERD. Total-EGJ-CI was also the single best parameter for prediction of pathological reflux (optimal cut-off 47 mmHg cm, AUC 0.746, P<.0001). This cut-off value, approximately 1 SD below the mean normal value, showed modest sensitivity 54% and positive predictive value 46%, but good specificity 85% and negative predictive value 89% for GERD diagnosis. CONCLUSION & INFERENCES Total EGJ-CI, a new metric that summarizes EGJ contractility over time, allows an improved assessment of EGJ barrier function. Pathological reflux is unlikely if this metric is within the upper two-thirds of the normal range.","Jasper, D; Freitas-Queiroz, N; Hollenstein, M; Misselwitz, B; Layer, P; Navarro-Rodriguez, T; Fox, M; Keller, J",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,85,1

Recently anticoagulation has shown to decrease mortality, but it is unclear if this contributes to increased GI bleeding. The aims of this study are: 1) to examine if there are risk factors for GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients 2) to study whether there is a mortality difference between hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without GI bleeding. METHODS This is a propensity score matched case-control study from a large health system in the New York metropolitan area between March 1st and April 27th . COVID-19 patients with GI bleeding were matched 1:1 to COVID-19 patients without bleeding using a propensity score that took into account comorbidities, demographics, GI bleeding risk factors, and length of stay. RESULTS Of 11, 158 hospitalized with COVID-19, 314 patients were identified with GI bleeding. The point prevalence of GI bleeding was 3%. There were no identifiable risk factors for GI bleeding. Use of anticoagulation medication or antiplatelet agents were not associated with increased risk of GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients. For patients that developed a GI bleed during the hospitalization, there was an increased mortality risk in the GI bleeding group (OR 1.58, p=0.02). CONCLUSION Use of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents were not risk factors for GI bleeding in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Those with GI bleeding during the hospitalization had increased mortality.","Trindade, Arvind J; Izard, Stephanie; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie S; Lee, Calvin; Satapathy, Sanjaya K",Journal of internal medicine,85,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant disruption in the provision of dental services globally. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on dental services provided in Australia through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of Medicare data on utilization of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule obtained from the Australian Government. Data were analysed for the period February to September 2020, with the number of services provided per month across five categories (diagnostic, preventive, restorative, endodontic and oral surgery) compared with the monthly average for 2019 (95% CI) and the same month for 2019. Total services by month were reported for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to compare the yearly trend with 2020. Differences in services provision by State/Territory were also described. RESULTS Over the period of March to September, there were 881 454 fewer dental services provided in 2020 than 2019, with the largest decline seen in April. There was a greater decline in preventive and diagnostic services, and a smaller decline in endodontic and oral surgery services. A second wave of COVID-19 in Victoria saw 198 609 fewer dental services provided in that state from July to September 2020 than 2019. Dental service provision had still not returned to normal levels across Australia by September 2020. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of dental services to children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who already experience higher levels of dental disease and disadvantage in accessing dental care. Although the restriction of dental services was deemed necessary in order to minimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the dental setting, the impact of these restrictions on oral health will be long lasting. Given the chronic and progressive nature of dental disease, the deferral of necessary dental care is likely to contribute to poorer oral health and long-term problems for many Australians.","Hopcraft, Matthew; Farmer, Glenda",Community dentistry and oral epidemiology,85,1

A formal long-distance mentorship program could address these barriers and potentially bridge the gap of traditional face-to-face mentorship. This study was done to determine the feasibility of implementing a formal long-distance mentorship program amongst public health physicians of Nigeria. METHOD A mixed-method study comprising of in-depth interviews and surveys was used to collect information from members of the Association of Public Health Physicians in Nigeria. A total of 134 survey participants were recruited consecutively during an annual scientific meeting of the association. In-depth interviewees were purposively selected to ensure diversity in expertise, experience, and social stratifiers such as age. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS Public health physicians of Nigeria are willing to participate in a formal Long-Distance Mentorship Program, and four elements of feasibility were highlighted as necessary for implementing the program. Namely i) capacity to coordinate LDMP, ii) technical expertise and individual competence to provide mentorship, iii) financial capacity to implement and sustain LDMP, and iv) demand for mentorship by mentees. There is a consensus that the organizational structure of the National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria and West African College of Physicians provide an enabling environment to initiate a LDMP for public health physicians of Nigeria. The vast human resources with various expertise and the annual National conferences can be leveraged upon to champion and administer the program. However, there is a need for an administrative structure and technical expertise to enable proper coordination. More so, the need for demand creation and the financial requirement was considered gaps that need to be filled to be able to ensure feasibility. Bivariate analysis showed a significant relationship between the dependent variable (preferred role- mentor/mentee) and independent variables (age, year of graduation, and the number of years of practice), while the binary logistic regression model showed that physicians are more likely to participate as mentors with each unit increase in the number of years of practice. This further buttressed the need to commence the mentoring process as soon as trainees gain entrance into the program, as mentorship does not just prepare them for excellent public health practice, but also builds their capacity to mentor the younger and upcoming public health physicians. CONCLUSION There are enabling structures to incorporate a formal long-distance mentorship program for public health physicians in Nigeria, and physicians are willing to participate in such a program. However, the feasibility of establishing a successful and sustainable program will require robust coordination, technical expertise, demand creation, and financial commitment at both institutional and college levels.","Obi, Uche Shalom; Mbachu, Chinyere; Uzochukwu, Benjamin S C",BMC public health,85,10

The normal response to high minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) fraction of anesthetics is hypotension and low Bispectral Index (BIS) scores. Low MAP and/or BIS at lower MAC fractions may represent anesthetic sensitivity. The authors sought to characterize the effect of the triple low state (low MAP and low BIS during a low MAC fraction) on duration of hospitalization and 30-day all-cause mortality. METHODS Mean intraoperative MAP, BIS, and MAC were determined for 24,120 noncardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio. The hazard ratios associated with combinations of MAP, BIS, and MAC values greater or less than a reference value were determined. The authors also evaluated the association between cumulative triple low minutes, and excess length-of-stay and 30-day mortality. RESULTS Means (±SD) defining the reference, low, and high states were 87 ± 5 mmHg (MAP), 46 ± 4 (BIS), and 0.56 ± 0.11 (MAC). Triple lows were associated with prolonged length of stay (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Thirty-day mortality was doubled in double low combinations and quadrupled in the triple low group. Triple low duration ≥60 min quadrupled 30-day mortality compared with ≤15 min. Excess length of stay increased progressively from ≤15 min to ≥60 min of triple low. CONCLUSIONS The occurrence of low MAP during low MAC fraction was a strong and highly significant predictor for mortality. When these occurrences were combined with low BIS, mortality risk was even greater. The values defining the triple low state were well within the range that many anesthesiologists tolerate routinely.","Sessler, Daniel I; Sigl, Jeffrey C; Kelley, Scott D; Chamoun, Nassib G; Manberg, Paul J; Saager, Leif; Kurz, Andrea; Greenwald, Scott",Anesthesiology,85,12

CONTENT COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 disease a pandemic principally contaminating the respiratory tract and bringing about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is liable for significant mortality around the world. Far-fetched, there is no exact treatment accessible till today. Consequently, it is critical to discover the alternative methodology which can decrease the weight of illness. Trikatu powder recommended by authorities for the management of mild cases of COVID-19 is a conventional ayurvedic formulation containing three spices; Zingiber officinale, Piper nigrum, and Piper longum. A comprehensive search of the articles published since inception to 01/08/2020 on Trikatu was carried out. Major electronic medical databases such as Pub Med/MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used for the literature search. SUMMARY A total of 21 records were identified by electronic searches between since inception to 01/08/2020 of which 13 records were included for review. The reviewed articles highlight Trikatu as a safe, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory property by suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-17, alteration in levels of circulating immune complexes, anti-dyslipidaemia agent by reduced triglycerides and LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol, enhancing bio-availability of co-drug by reducing the elimination half-life (t1/2β) and zero time intercept of the elimination phase. OUTLOOK The findings of this review seem to show Trikatu as a potential anti-inflammatory, anti-dyslipidaemia, and immune-modulatory ayurvedic formulation can be used for combating flu like illnesses and also in the management of COVID-19 as an adjuvant. However, rigorous double blind randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are warranted for better validation in such clinical conditions.","Javed, Danish; Dixit, Ashish Kumar",Journal of complementary & integrative medicine,85,4

We collected 107 faecal samples from domestic dogs with obvious diarrhoea. Forty-two diarrhoeic samples (39.3 %) were positive for CaAstV by RT-PCR, and 41/42 samples showed co-infection with canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV). Phylogenetic analysis based on 26 CaAstV partial ORF1a and ORF1b sequences revealed that most CaAstV strains showed unique evolutionary features. Interestingly, putative recombination events were observed among four of the five complete ORF2 sequences cloned in this study, and three of the five complete ORF2 sequences formed a single unique group, suggesting that these strains could be a novel genotype. We successfully sequenced the complete genome of one CaAstV strain (designated 2017/44/CHN), which was 6628 nt in length. The features of this genome include putative recombination events in the ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 genes, while the ORF2 gene had a continuous insertion of 7 aa in region II compared with the other complete ORF2 sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 2017/44/CHN formed a single group based on genome sequences, suggesting that this strain might be a novel genotype. The results of this study revealed that CaAstV circulates widely in diarrhoeic dogs in southwest China and exhibits unique evolutionary events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of recombination events in CaAstV, and it contributes to further understanding of the genetic evolution of CaAstV.","Li, Mingxiang; Yan, Nan; Ji, Conghui; Wang, Min; Zhang, Bin; Yue, Hua; Tang, Cheng",The Journal of general virology,85,12

Welding fumes have been classified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); this assessment found sufficient evidence from studies in humans that welding fumes are a cause of lung cancer. In this article, we present the protocol for a systematic review of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from trachea, bronchus and lung cancer attributable to occupational exposure to welding fumes, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aim to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of occupational exposure to welding fumes on trachea, bronchus and lung cancer, applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework. DATA SOURCES We will search electronic bibliographic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CISDOC. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any Member State of WHO and/or ILO but exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. The eligible risk factor will be occupational exposure to welding fumes, measured directly or indirectly (i.e., through proxy of relevant occupation, work task, job-exposure matrix, expert judgment or self-report). The eligible outcomes will be trachea, bronchus and lung cancer. We will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of any occupational exposure to welding fumes on the prevalence of, incidence of or mortality from trachea, bronchus and lung cancer, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level of no occupational exposure to welding fumes. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Two or more review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the Navigation Guide tool or approach. If feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA).","Pega, Frank; Chartres, Nicholas; Guha, Neela; Modenese, Alberto; Morgan, Rebecca L; Martínez-Silveira, Martha S; Loomis, Dana",Environment international,85,1

Nevertheless, the early detection of muscle wasting is difficult. Therefore, we investigated the reliability and accuracy of ultrasonography to evaluate skeletal muscle wasting in critically ill children and adults. METHODS This prospective observational study enrolled 30 sedated critically ill children and 14 critically ill adults. Two independent investigators made 210 ultrasonographical assessments of muscle thigh thickness. Inter- and intraobserver reliability and cutoff levels were calculated as a function of muscle thickness and the expected reduction in muscle size (predefined at 20% and 30%). RESULTS Mean ± SD muscle thickness was 1.67 ± 0.55 cm in the pediatric and 2.10 ± 0.85 cm in the adult population. The median absolute interobserver variability was 0.07 cm (interquartile range [IQR], 0.04-0.20 cm) in the pediatric population and 0.05 cm (IQR, 0.03-0.09 cm) in the adult population. However, the absolute intraobserver accuracy had a 95% confidence interval of 0.43 cm in children and 0.22 cm in adults. Only a 30% decrease (0.50 cm) in muscle thickness can be detected in critically ill children. CONCLUSION Although the interobserver variability is acceptable in the pediatric population, the intraobserver variability is too large with respect to the expected reduction in muscle thickness. In adults, ultrasonography may be a reliable tool for early detection of muscle mass wasting.","Fivez, Tom; Hendrickx, Alexandra; Van Herpe, Tom; Vlasselaers, Dirk; Desmet, Lars; Van den Berghe, Greet; Mesotten, Dieter",JPEN.

Existing policies and protocols for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) are primarily for institutional settings such as hospitals, not for home visits for patient care. We describe a protocol for donning and doffing PPE in home settings. METHODS We used an iterative, rapid-prototyping approach to develop the protocol. A small workgroup created preliminary drafts, drawing on hospital-based protocols and modifying them, while undertaking simulations. Wider input was solicited via 2 webinars; 1 regional (Hamilton, Ontario) with palliative clinicians, and 1 national (Canada) with varying professions. We also consulted a group of infectious disease experts. A ""how-to"" video accompanies the protocol. RESULTS Twelve versions of the protocol were produced, with major changes occurring within the first 6 versions. A national webinar mid-development provided further validation and minor modifications. Subsequent versions involved minor changes. The protocol has 4 phases: (1) Preparing, (2) Entering the Home, (3) Leaving the Home, and (4) After the Visit and Reprocessing. In addition to PPE-related equipment, the protocol requires additional materials including 2 pails for transporting supplies, plastic bags, hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and printed easy-to-use checklists. CONCLUSIONS This protocol addresses gaps in COVID-19-related guidelines, specifically the process of donning and doffing PPE during home visits while supplementing jurisdictional PPE guidelines and protocols.","Kerley, Brian; Tan, Lana; Marshall, Denise; O'Neill, Cindy; Bialachowski, Anne; Pereira, José",Annals of family medicine,85,1

However, electronic applications (apps) for the testing of ophthalmology vital signs, such as visual acuity, can be published and used without any verification of accuracy, validity, or reliability. Objective To reassess the accuracy of visual acuity-testing apps and assess their viability for telehealth. Design, Setting, and Participants The US Apple App Store was queried for apps for visual acuity testing. Anticipated optotype size for various visual acuity lines were calculated and compared against the actual measured optotype size on 4 different Apple hardware devices. No human participants were part of this study. Main Outcomes and Measures Mean (SD) errors were calculated per device and across multiple devices. Results On iPhones, 10 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 109.9%. On the iPads, 9 apps met inclusion criteria, with mean errors ranging from 0.2% to 398.1%. Six apps met criteria and worked on both iPhone and iPad, with mean errors from 0.2% to 249.5%. Of the 6 apps that worked across devices, the top 3 most accurate apps were Visual Acuity Charts (mean [SD] error, 0.2% [0.0%]), Kay iSight Test Professional (mean [SD] error, 3.5% [0.7%]), and Smart Optometry (mean [SD] error, 15.9% [4.3%]). None of the apps tested were ideal for telemedicine, because some apps displayed accurate optotype size, while others displayed the same letters on separate devices; no apps exhibited both characteristics. Conclusions and Relevance Both Visual Acuity Charts and Kay iSight Test Professional had low mean (SD) errors and functionality across all tested devices, but no apps were suitable for telemedicine. This suggests that new and/or improved visual acuity-testing apps are necessary for optimal telemedicine use.","Steren, Benjamin J; Young, Benjamin; Chow, Jessica",JAMA ophthalmology,85,7

A novel liver retractor device and technique is described, which applies a vacuum between the liver and diaphragm to lift the liver, and which does not require additional incisions. METHODS A novel liver retractor was tested in two anesthetized sheep at incrementally higher levels of suction from -100 to -700 mmHg (-13 to -93 kPa), and any signs of trauma were recorded. The animals recovered for 5 days, then were humanely killed and postmortem examination of the liver and diaphragms performed. RESULTS Successful liver retraction was achieved from -200 to -600 mmHg (-27 to -80 kPa) suction. An imprint of the retractor was observed on the liver surface, but there was no breach of the liver serosa. Negligible ecchymoses were observed on the corresponding surface of the diaphragms. Both sheep recovered well after surgery. There was no macroscopic evidence of injury to the liver and diaphragm 5 days postoperatively. Histological examination revealed normal liver parenchyma deep to the site where the devices had been placed, and hemorrhagic changes within the serosa only varied between a few microns to a maximum of 1.4-mm depth. CONCLUSIONS The novel liver retractor described achieved an effective liver retraction without trauma. It has potential application in reduced or single-port laparoscopic upper abdominal surgery.","Gan, Philip",Surgical endoscopy,85,8

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to develop a machine-learning model based on routine, quantitative, and easily measured variables to predict the presence and extent of subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) in young, asymptomatic individuals. The risk of having SA estimated by this model could be used to refine risk estimation and optimize the use of imaging for risk assessment. METHODS The Elastic Net (EN) model was built to predict SA extent, defined by a combined metric of the coronary artery calcification score and 2-dimensional vascular ultrasound. The performance of the model for the prediction of SA extension and progression was compared with traditional risk scores of cardiovascular disease (CVD). An external independent cohort was used for validation. RESULTS EN-PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) yielded a c-statistic of 0.88 for the prediction of generalized subclinical atherosclerosis. Moreover, EN-PESA was found to be a predictor of 3-year progression independent of the baseline extension of SA. EN-PESA assigned an intermediate to high cardiovascular risk to 40.1% (n = 1,411) of the PESA individuals, a significantly larger number than atherosclerotic CVD (n = 267) and SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) (n = 507) risk scores. In total, 86.8% of the individuals with an increased risk based on EN-PESA presented signs of SA at baseline or a significant progression of SA over 3 years. CONCLUSIONS The EN-PESA model uses age, systolic blood pressure, and 10 commonly used blood/urine tests and dietary intake values to identify young, asymptomatic individuals with an increased risk of CVD based on their extension and progression of SA. These individuals are likely to benefit from imaging tests or pharmacological treatment.

DESIGN Online cross-sectional survey conducted 10-13 February 2020 (n = 2006, people aged 16 years or over and living in the UK). METHODS We asked participants to what extent they agreed it was best to avoid areas heavily populated by Chinese people because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Survey materials also asked about: worry, perceived risk, knowledge, information receipt, perception of government response to COVID-19, and personal characteristics. We ran binary logistic regressions to investigate associations between holding a stigmatizing attitude, personal characteristics, and psychological and contextual factors. RESULTS 26.1% people (95% CI 24.2-28.0%, n = 524/2006) agreed it was best to avoid areas heavily populated by Chinese people. Holding a stigmatizing attitude was associated with greater worry about COVID-19, greater perceived risk of COVID-19, and poorer knowledge about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large percentage of the UK public endorsed avoiding areas in the UK heavily populated by people of Chinese origin. This attitude was associated with greater worry about, and perceived risk of, the COVID-19 outbreak as well as poorer knowledge about COVID-19. At the start of future novel infectious disease outbreaks, proactive communications from official sources should provide context and facts to reduce uncertainty and challenge stigmatizing attitudes, to minimize harms to affected communities.","Smith, Louise E; Potts, Henry W W; Amlȏt, Richard; Fear, Nicola T; Michie, Susan; Rubin, G James",British journal of health psychology,85,19

This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh implantation compared with conventional abdominal wall closure in patients with peritonitis undergoing emergency laparotomy. METHOD A matched case-control study was performed. To analyze a high-risk population for incisional hernia formation, only patients with at least two of the following risk factors were included: male sex, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), malignant tumor, or previous abdominal incision. In 63 patients with peritonitis, a prophylactic nonabsorbable mesh was implanted intraperitoneally between 2005 and 2010. These patients were compared with 70 patients with the same risk factors and peritonitis undergoing emergency laparotomy over a 1-year period (2008) who underwent conventional abdominal closure without mesh implantation. RESULTS Demographic parameters, including sex, age, BMI, grade of intraabdominal infection, and operating time were comparable in the two groups. Incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) was not different between groups (61.9 vs. 60.3 %; p = 0.603). Enterocutaneous fistula occurred in three patients in the mesh group (4.8 %) and in two patients in the control group (2.9 %; p = 0.667). The incidence of incisional hernia was significantly lower in the mesh group (2/63 patients) than in the control group (20/70 patients) (3.2 vs. 28.6 %; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic intraperitoneal mesh can be safely implanted in patients with peritonitis. It significantly reduces the incidence of incisional hernia. The incidences of SSI and enterocutaneous fistula formation were similar to those seen with conventional abdominal closure.","Kurmann, Anita; Barnetta, Corina; Candinas, Daniel; Beldi, Guido",World journal of surgery,85,7

However, it remains challenging both methodologically and with respect to data requirements, as disease spread is influenced by numerous factors, including the pathogen's underlying transmission parameters and epidemiological dynamics, social networks and population connectivity, and environmental conditions. Here, using data from Sierra Leone, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen's incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel farther before becoming infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease trajectories, as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter incubation periods, such as cholera.","Kahn, Rebecca; Peak, Corey M; Fernández-Gracia, Juan; Hill, Alexandra; Jambai, Amara; Ganda, Louisa; Castro, Marcia C; Buckee, Caroline O",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,85,1

However, in the setting of infection control policies, visitor restrictions, social distancing, and a lack of personal protective equipment, many of these important conversations are occurring by virtual visits. Objective: From our experience with a multisite study exploring the effectiveness of virtual palliative care, we have identified key elements of webside manner that are helpful when conducting serious illness conversations by virtual visit. Results: The key elements and components of webside manner skills are proper set up, acquainting the participant, maintaining conversation rhythm, responding to emotion, and closing the visit. Other considerations that may require conversion to phone visits include persistent technical difficulties, lack of prerequisite technology to conduct virtual visits, patients who are too ill to participate, or who find virtual visits too technically challenging. Conclusions: Similar to bedside manner, possessing nuanced verbal and nonverbal webside manner skills is essential to conducting serious illness conversations during virtual visits.","Chua, Isaac S; Jackson, Vicki; Kamdar, Mihir",Journal of palliative medicine,85,1

Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCWs and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","Contejean, Adrien; Leporrier, Jérémie; Canouï, Etienne; Alby-Laurent, Fanny; Lafont, Emmanuel; Beaudeau, Lauren; Parize, Perrine; Lecieux, Fabienne; Greffet, Agnès; Chéron, Gérard; Gauzit, Rémy; Fourgeaud, Jacques; L'Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Charlier, Caroline; Casetta, Anne; Frange, Pierre; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Rozenberg, Flore; Lortholary, Olivier; Kernéis, Solen",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,85,11

Our goal was to report our initial experience with combined transcatheter Inovare bioprosthesis implants for severe valve dysfunction. METHODS Among 300 transcatheter procedures, a total of 6 patients had concurrent simultaneous transcatheter bioprosthesis implants for severe mitral bioprosthesis failure (valve-in-valve), with a second valve procedure that included native aortic (n = 2) or degenerated bioprostheses in the aortic position (n = 4). During the procedures, all patients were treated with a balloon-expandable Inovare transcatheter valve, using the transapical approach. RESULTS Patients were highly symptomatic [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV: 100%], with a mean age of 62 ± 5 years, yielding a mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk II (EuroSCORE II) of 24.0 ± 10.1%. There was a mean of 1.6 ± 0.4 prior valve operations/patient, with a median time from prior mitral bioprosthesis surgery of 13.0 (9.2-20.0) years. Device success was 100% according to the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium and the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. During the hospital stay, only 1 patient required dialysis, and the median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 5.0 (3.2-6.7) days and 16.0 (12.2-21.2) days, respectively. No deaths occurred at 30 days; at a median follow-up of 287 (194-437) days, 1 patient died of a non-cardiac cause and the rest of patients were in NYHA functional class I or II, with normofunctioning bioprostheses. CONCLUSIONS Transcatheter double valve interventions using the Inovare bioprosthesis in this initial series were shown to be a reasonable alternative to redo surgical operations.

Schools present a valuable opportunity to reach a large section of the country's adolescent population with nutrition-oriented interventions. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the current state of adolescent school nutrition interventions in Dodoma, Tanzania, with emphases on 3 potential school-based nutrition interventions, school vegetable gardens, school meals, and education (on nutrition, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene). METHODS Focus group discussions were conducted with several regional and district-level governmental stakeholders, including health, education, and agricultural officers. Ten public secondary schools were visited, and interviews with school administrators, teachers, students, and parents were conducted. RESULTS All stakeholders interviewed supported interventions to improve school-based nutrition, including school gardens, school feeding, and nutrition education. All 10 schools visited had some experience providing school meals, but parents' contributions were essential for the program's sustainability. Most schools visited had land available for a school garden program, but water availability could be challenging during certain times of the year. The teachers interviewed expressed that the curriculum on nutrition education was highly theoretical and did not allow students to practice the knowledge and skills they learned in the classroom.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected influenza surveillance in all participating study sites, therefore the study period was truncated on February 29, 2020. Age-stratified (6 m-17y, 18-64y, ≥65y), confounder-adjusted, site-specific adjusted IVE estimates were calculated and pooled through meta-analysis. Parsimonious confounder-adjustment was performed, adjusting the estimates for age, sex and calendar time. TND studies included 3531 cases (351 vaccinated) and 5546 controls (1415 vaccinated) of all ages. IVE estimates were available for 8/11 brands marketed in Europe in 2019. Most children and adults < 64y were captured in primary care setting and the most frequently observed vaccine brand was Vaxigrip Tetra. The estimate against any influenza for Vaxigrip Tetra in primary care setting was 61% (95%CI 38-77) in children and 32% (95%CI -13-59) in adults up to 64y. Most adults ≥ 65y were captured in hospital setting and the most frequently observed brand was Fluad, with an estimate of 52% (95%CI 27-68).

We diagnosed that her symptoms were caused by selective MMA angiography leading to high pressure stimulation towards the ophthalmic nerve innervation around the orbit as a TCR. We suggest that the operator should be prepared to manage TCR during treatment with expected selective MMA angiography, and gentle low pressure contrast injection should be attempted.","Tamura, Takamitsu; Rex, David E; Marosfoi, Miklos G; Puri, Ajit S; Gounis, Matthew J; Wakhloo, Ajay K",BMJ case reports,85,31

In this paper, we report the fabrication of depth controllable amorphous silicon (a-Si) layers under 80 keV Ar+ ion sputtering at off-normal ion incidences of 30°, 40° and 50° and crystallization of these amorphous Si(111) layers under thermal annealing. We find that the irradiated samples were not fully amorphized even for the lowest oblique incidence of 30°. Sputtering at off-normal incidences induces depth controllable surface amorphization in Si(111). Annealing at temperature of 1,073 K is characterized by formation of depth-varying buried amorphous layer due to defect recrystallization and damage recovery. Some remnant tensile stress has been observed for recrystallized samples even for lowest oblique incidence. The correlation of amorphization and stress due to sputtering induced by oblique incidence has been discussed systematically. The possible mechanism of recrystallization is discussed in terms of vacancies produced in sputtering dominated regime and their migration during annealing treatment. Our results reveal that with appropriate selection of oblique ion beam sputtering parameters, depth controllable surface amorphization and recrystallization may be fine-tuned to achieve co-existing amorphous and crystalline phases, playing a crucial role in fabrication of substrates for IC industry.","Gupta, Divya; Umapathy, G R; Singhal, Rahul; Ojha, Sunil; Aggarwal, Sanjeev",Scientific reports,85,33

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in corneal tissue would seem to have clinical relevance for corneal transplant. Objectives To investigate the presence of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA in corneal discs of deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 and assess viral genomic and subgenomic RNA load, possible infectivity, and histologic abnormalities. Design, Setting, and Participants A case series was conducted of 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 who underwent autopsy between March 20 and May 14, 2020. Eleven corneal discs (1 corneal disc per patient) were harvested for molecular detection of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the conjunctival and throat swab samples and aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and blood samples. Main Outcomes and Measures Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human corneas. Results This study comprised 11 patients (6 women [55%]; mean [SD] age, 68.5 [18.8] years). In 6 of 11 eyes (55%), SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was detected in the cornea; subgenomic RNA was present in 4 of these 6 eyes (67%). Infectivity or the presence of viral structural proteins could not be confirmed in any eye. However, patients whose corneal disc was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA also had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 4 of 6 conjunctival swab samples, 1 of 3 aqueous humor samples, 3 of 5 vitreous humor samples, and 4 of 5 blood samples. Overall, conjunctival swab samples had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 5 of 11 cases. Postmortem SARS-CoV-2 viremia was detected in 5 of 9 patients. Conclusions and Relevance Viral genomic and subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the cornea of patients with COVID-19 viremia. The risk of COVID-19 infection via corneal transplant is low even in donors with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, but further research is necessary to assess the rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via corneal transplant.","Casagrande, Maria; Fitzek, Antonia; Spitzer, Martin S; Püschel, Klaus; Glatzel, Markus; Krasemann, Susanne; Nörz, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Schultheiss, Maximilian",JAMA ophthalmology,85,11

This review provides an update on significant issues relevant to the inpatient management of T1D. Topics include trends in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia, and adapting ambulatory technologies for inpatient use. RECENT FINDINGS Rates of DKA in the United States are rising. Although socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and hemoglobin A1c are persistently associated with DKA in individuals with T1D, newer risk factors have also emerged. These include the off-label use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor medications, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes, and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Hypoglycemia is common among hospitalized patients with T1D. Use of validated hypoglycemia risk prediction models and multidisciplinary care initiatives can reduce the risk of inpatient hypoglycemia. Finally, continuous glucose monitoring is being adapted for use in the hospital setting and has shown promise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Several minerals appear to be important determinants of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the bioactivity of which regulates bone and mineral metabolism. Here we proposed that mineral status may alter the IGF system among individuals with osteoporosis. This study aims to evaluate the relationships between essential elements and IGF levels among postmenopausal Saudi women with osteoporosis. A total of 128 postmenopausal Saudi women aged ≥50 years old were recruited in this study. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was done by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to determine the bone minerals density (BMD). Serum calcium and phosphate were determined using routine chemical analyzer. Serum Co, Mn, Ni, Cd were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 were determined using Luminex xMAP. Using stepwise linear regression analysis, only Cd was identified to be significantly associated with IGF1 in osteoporosis, explaining 3% (confidence interval 0.01-0.05; P = 0001) of the variance perceived. Our results suggest that Cd exposure indirectly affects BMD which may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Further longitudinal study using a larger sample size is recommended to determine causality of Cd levels and IGF-1.","Yakout, Sobhy M; Alharbi, Fatimah; Abdi, Saba; Al-Daghri, Nasser M; Al-Amro, Abir; Khattak, Malak Nawaz Khan",Medicine,85,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2010 and September 2015, 16 patients (11 men and 5 women) underwent direct stenting of acute arterial occlusions. All patients had contraindication for surgical revascularization or catheter-directed thrombolysis. According to SVS/ISCVS Classification, six patients had IIa and ten patients IIb ALLI. The occlusions were located in CIA, EIA, SFA, or popliteal artery. Mean follow-up time with clinical examination and color Duplex ultrasonography was 37.6 months (range 1-72). We analyzed the technical and clinical outcomes of the procedures, as well the complications and patency rates. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all patients (16/16) and there was significant clinical improvement in 15 patients. There was neither distal embolization nor procedure-related complications. During the 6 years of follow-up, four patients died due to non-procedure-related causes and there were two minor and one major amputations. The primary patency rates and the amputation-free survival rates were 93.7 and 87% at 1 year, 75.2 and 71.2% at 3 years, and 75.2 and 62.3%, respectively, at 6 years.

However, older adults who run for exercise have a higher walking economy compared with older adults who walk for exercise. Yet, it remains unclear if other aerobic exercises yield similar improvements on walking economy. The purpose of this study was to determine if regular bicycling exercise affects walking economy in older adults. We measured metabolic rate while 33 older adult ""bicyclists"" or ""walkers"" and 16 young adults walked on a level treadmill at four speeds between (0.75-1.75 m/s). Across the range of speeds, older bicyclists had a 9-17% greater walking economy compared with older walkers (p = .009). In conclusion, bicycling exercise mitigates the age-related deterioration of walking economy, whereas walking for exercise has a minimal effect on improving walking economy.","Aslan, Daniel H; Collette, Joshua M; Ortega, Justus D",Journal of aging and physical activity,85,1

A major virulence factor during its infection is the enzyme phospholipase C encoded by the plc gene, known as Clostridium perfringens phospholipase C (CpPLC). The present study was designed to understand the role of CpPLC in inducing survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic changes in a human lymphocyte cell culture model. Following exposure to CpPLC, a significant generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species was observed, which coincided with the changes in the expression of vital components of MAP/ERK/RTK signaling cascade that regulates the downstream cellular functions. These disturbances further led to alterations in the mitochondrial genome and functioning. This was supported by the observed upregulation in the expression of mitochondrial fission genes Drp1, Fis1, and Mff, and mitochondrial fusion genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 following CpPLC exposure. CpPLC exposed cells showed upregulation of OMA1, DELE1, and HRI genes involved in the integrated stress response (ISR), which suggests that it may induce the ISR that provides a pro-survival mechanism to the host cell. CpPLC also initiated immune patho-physiologic mechanisms including mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications through a mitochondrial-ROS driven signaling pathway. Interestingly, epigenetic machinery not only play a pivotal role in lymphocyte homeostasis by contributing to cell-fate decisions but thought to be one of the mechanisms by which intracellular pathogens survive within the host cells. Importantly, the impairment of mtDNA repair among the CpPLC exposed cells, induced alterations within mtDNA methylation, and led to the deregulation of MT-CO1, MT-ND6, MT-ATPase 6, and MT-ATPase8 gene expression profiles that are important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and subsequent metabolic pathways. This was further confirmed by the changes in the activity of mitochondrial electron chain complexes (complex I, II, III, IV and V). The altered mtDNA methylation profile was also found to be closely associated with the varied expression of mitomiRs and their targets. CpPLC exposed cells showed up-regulation of miR24 expression and down-regulation of miR34a, miR150, and miR155, while the increased expression of mitomiR target genes i.e. of K-Ras, MYC, EGFR, and NF-kβ was also observed in these cells. Altogether, our findings provide novel insights into the derailment of redox signaling machinery in CpPLC treated lymphocytes and its role in the induction of survival mechanisms and mitochondrial-induced epigenetic modifications.","Bunkar, Neha; Sharma, Jahnavi; Chouksey, Anju; Kumari, Roshani; Gupta, Pushpendra Kumar; Tiwari, Rajnarayan; Lodhi, Lalit; Srivastava, Rupesh Kumar; Bhargava, Arpit; Mishra, Pradyumna Kumar",Cellular signalling,85,27

However, selecting the lower pathway can be challenging because passage of the tube through the nasal pathway is usually performed blindly. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether facing the bevel of the tracheal tube in the cephalad direction of the patient could help in advancing the tracheal tube through the lower pathway during nasotracheal intubation. DESIGN A randomised, blinded trial. SETTING SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea from January 2019 to March 2020. PATIENTS Sixty-eight adult patients undergoing oromaxillary surgeries were enrolled in this study. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated to undergo nasotracheal intubation with the bevel of the tube facing the cephalad direction (intervention group) or to the left (conventional group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The effects of bevel direction on the pathway of the tube in the nasal cavity, and the incidence of epistaxis were evaluated by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. RESULTS The success rate of the tracheal tube passing through the lower pathway was significantly higher in the intervention group than the conventional group (79.4 vs. 55.9%, relative risk 1.421, 95% CI 1.007 to 2.005, P = 0.038).

SLS clinical rating is a qualitative evaluation and it does not count objective outcomes as kinematics data and surface electromyography (sEMG) assessment. Based on the SLS rating, the aims of this study were (i) to determine the clinical rating agreement among six raters and (ii) to assess kinematic and sEMG predictors of good SLS performance in physically and non-physically active individuals. METHODS Seventy-two healthy adults, divided in physically active and non-physically active groups, performed three SLSs on their dominant leg. Clinical ratings, kinematic data and sEMG were acquired. By using a validated clinical scale, six expert clinicians rated each SLS watching a video at three different time points. Intra and inter-rater agreement of clinical ratings were undertaken and a binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine kinematic and sEMG as predictors of SLS performance. RESULTS The weighted kappa coefficient for intra-rater reliability within each rater ranged between moderate and almost perfect agreement (0.55-0.85) whereas the weighted kappa coefficient for inter-rater reliability among raters was fair (0.34, time point 0; 0.31, time point 1; 0.30, time point 2). SLS analyses of physically active compared to non-physically active group showed a statistically significant difference in knee flexion and hip flexion (p = 0.041 and p = 0.023 respectively) and no difference in clinical ratings (p = 0.081). Greater knee flexion can predict the good SLS performance taking into account the belonging group (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS Physically active individuals seemed to be at less risk to perform a non-good SLS and they had greater knee and hip flexions kinematics than non-physically active individuals. Knee flexion can predict the SLS performance quality therefore a greater knee flexion might also be considered a protective element from injuries.

It has attracted global attention. We believe that the COVID-19 is still evolving and it is too early to predict of an outbreak in Nepal. The government needs to increase funding for local health departments, begin planning for future epidemics and be prepared to bolster the economy by supporting consumer spending the midst of a serious outbreak. COVID-19 is a serious health challenge for Nepal, but so far the number of death has been lower than was foretell. It is, therefore essential to carry out more scientific evidence to explore results. Nepalese health services need to maintain up than today and follow lockdown, isolation, social distance and an advance screening test kit through the country.","Pathak, Krishna Prasad; Gaire, Tara; Ho, Mu-Hsing; Chang, Hui Chen Rita",Reviews on environmental health,85,24

With Landsat 5/7/8 images and Google Earth Engine (GEE), an improved threshold-based water extraction algorithm and a novel surface water gaps (SWGs) interpolation method based on historical water frequency were applied to build surface water area (SWA, namely SWE without ice) and water body area (WBA, namely SWE with ice) monthly (January 2001-December 2019) and annual (1986-2019) time series in the upper reaches of the Yellow River (UYR). The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyse SWE trends, and the ridge regression was performed to figure out the relative contributions of meteorological factors to SWE dynamics. The pixels with modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) higher than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were identified as SWE. The mean relative error (MRE) of the SWGs interpolation results was below 10%. At the annual scale, the average SWA and number of lakes over 1 ha showed significant upward trends of 4.4 km2 yr-1 and 7.53 yr-1, respectively. The monthly WBA increased in summer and autumn while decreased in spring and winter. The maximum freezing and thawing ratios were 53.74% in December and 37.32% in May, respectively. Attribution analysis showed that precipitation and wind speed were the foremost factors dominating the dynamics of annual SWA and monthly WBA, respectively. Our findings confirmed that climatic changes have altered the dynamics of water bodies in the UYR.","Zhou, Haowei; Liu, Suxia; Hu, Shi; Mo, Xingguo",The Science of the total environment,85,31

We investigated whether use of low-dose aspirin, through initiation of LGIB, may lead patients to undergo colonoscopy and polypectomy before manifest CRC. DESIGN We conducted a historical cohort study (2005-2013) of all Danish residents who initiated low-dose aspirin treatment (n=412 202) in a setting without screening for CRC. Each new aspirin user was matched with three non-users (n=1 236 560) by age, sex and region of residence on the date of their matched new user's first-time aspirin prescription (index date). We computed absolute risks (ARs), risk differences and relative risks (RRs) of LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC, comparing aspirin users with non-users. RESULTS The ARs were higher for new users than non-users for LGIB, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, colorectal polyps and CRC within 3 months after index. Comparing new users with non-users, the RRs were 2.79 (95% CI 2.40 to 3.24) for LGIB, 1.73 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.84) for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, 1.56 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.72) for colorectal polyps and 1.73 (95% CI 1.51 to 1.98) for CRC. The RRs remained elevated for more than 12 months after the index date, with the exception of CRC where the RRs were slightly decreased during the 3-5 years (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98) and more than 5 years (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00) following the index date. CONCLUSION These findings indicate that aspirin may contribute to reduce CRC risk by causing premalignant polyps to bleed, thereby expediting colonoscopy and polypectomy before CRC development.","Troelsen, Frederikke Schønfeldt; Farkas, Dóra Körmendiné; Erichsen, Rune; Sørensen, Henrik Toft",BMJ open gastroenterology,85,1

Many studies in AD suggested beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-associated tau protein as the key targets for drug development. On the other hand, it is proved that triggering of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK-3β) also cause AD, therefore, GSK-3β is a potential drug target to combat AD. We, in this study, investigated the ability of small molecules to inhibit GSK-3β through virtual screening, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME), induced-fit docking (IFD), molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation. Besides, molecular docking was performed to reveal the binding and interaction of the ligand at the active site of GSK-3β. We found two compounds such as 6961 and 6966, which exhibited steady-state interaction with GSK-3β for 30 ns in molecular dynamics simulation. The compounds (6961 and 6966) also achieved a docking score of -9.05 kcal/mol and -8.11 kcal/mol, respectively, which is relatively higher than the GSK-3β II inhibitor (-6.73 kcal/mol). The molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the compounds have a stable state during overall simulation time, and lesser root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values compared with co-crystal. In conclusion, we suggest the two compounds (6966 and 6961) as potential leads that could be utilized as effective inhibitors of GSK-3β to combat AD.","Elangovan, Nandha Devi; Dhanabalan, Anantha Krishnan; Gunasekaran, Krishnasamy; Kandimalla, Ramesh; Sankarganesh, Devaraj",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,85,24

It increases patients' adherence to treatment, improves the quality of care and eases the overall burden on the healthcare system. In recent years, technological solutions are being increasingly used in educating patients and achieving better health literacy. Augmented reality (AR) provides powerful, contextual and situated learning experiences and supplements the real world with virtual objects. AR could potentially be an effective learning methodology for the patients, thus, warranting a comprehensive overview of the current state of AR in patient education and health literacy. METHODS The proposed scoping review will be based on the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley, including the refinements suggested by Levac et al. A systematic search for references in the published literature will be conducted in nine research databases-Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Association for Information Systems eLibrary (AISeL). The unpublished studies from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Conference Proceedings Citation Index and grey literature references obtained from a web search will also be included. Databases will be searched from inception to 14 January 2020. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies from the search results in two successive stages of title/abstract screening followed by full-text screening. Data variables will be extracted from the selected studies to characterise study design, type of AR technology employed and the relational factors affecting patient education. Lastly, key stakeholders will be consulted to gather their insights about the study findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results will be disseminated through stakeholder meetings and conference presentations. The data used are from publicly available secondary sources, so this study does not require ethical review.","Adapa, Karthik; Jain, Saumya; Kanwar, Richa; Zaman, Tanzila; Taneja, Trusha; Walker, Jennifer; Mazur, Lukasz",BMJ open,85,17

Italy declared lockdown from 9th March to 3rd May 2020, and universities shifted to online classes. Home confinement could prevent students from achieving the physical activity and sleep levels recommended for their psychophysical health, and medicine students are already known to be at risk of inactivity and reduced sleep due to their time-consuming curricula. This study aimed at describing medicine students' behaviours during lockdown and comparing them with pre-lockdown data and current recommendations. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 6th year Italian medicine students (n=714; age=25±2y; female:62%; male:38%) in October-November 2019. The same survey was repeated in 6th year students during lockdown (n=394; age=25±2y; female:73%; male:27%), and extended to 1st-5th year (total 1st-6th year sample during lockdown: n=1471; age=23±2y; female:70%; male:30%). International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ) and selected questions from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were administered to evaluate physical activity, sitting and sleep time. Decreased physical activity, and increased sitting and sleep time were observed from pre- to during lockdown in 6th year students (p<0.01). 1st-6th year students featured 10 [8-12] hours sitting (median [Q1-Q3]) and an IPAQ score of 1170 [400-2348] MET-min/week. Even participants with higher physical activity featured high sitting time. Sleeping less than recommended (<7 hours/night) was associated with more sitting time and less energies to perform daily activities. Strategies fostering compliance to current guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep should be implemented, especially in case of repeated or intermittent lockdown.","Luciano, Francesco; Cenacchi, Valentina; Vegro, Valentina; Pavei, Gaspare",European journal of sport science,85,12

METHODS A systematic review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases and the World Health Organization Novel Coronavirus website to identify studies that reported mortality and characteristics of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The primary study outcome was mortality, defined as all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality within 30 days of initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled proportion of mortality was estimated using a random-effects model, and study-level moderators of heterogeneity were assessed through subgroup analysis and metaregression. RESULTS Among 2922 patients from 13 primarily inpatient studies of individuals with COVID-19 and cancer, the pooled 30-day mortality rate was 30% (95% CI, 25%-35%). The overall pooled 30-day mortality rate among 624 patients from 5 studies that included a mixture of inpatient and outpatient populations was 15% (95% CI, 9%-22%). Among the hospitalized studies, the heterogeneity (I2 statistic) of the meta-analysis remained high (I2 , 82%). Cancer subtype (hematologic vs solid), older age, male sex, and recent active cancer therapy each partially explained the heterogeneity of mortality reporting. In multivariable metaregression, male sex, along with an interaction between the median patient age and recent active cancer therapy, explained most of the between-study heterogeneity (R2 , 96%). CONCLUSIONS Pooled mortality estimates for hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 remain high at 30%, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Dedicated community-based studies are needed in the future to help assess overall COVID-19 mortality among the broader population of patients with cancer.","Desai, Aakash; Gupta, Rohit; Advani, Shailesh; Ouellette, Lara; Kuderer, Nicole M; Lyman, Gary H; Li, Ang",Cancer,85,31

Web and mobile-based applications are promising e-Health modalities that can facilitate timely access to symptom management interventions for this population. AIM To evaluate the efficacy of web and mobile-based symptom management interventions in alleviating physical symptom burden in people with advanced cancer. DESIGN A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. PROSPERO ID = CRD42020155295. DATA SOURCES We searched databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from 1991 until 2019. Inclusion criteria were: adults with advanced cancer, web or mobile-based interventions targeting symptom management, and report of physical symptom data. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I and RoB2. Using RevMan, standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. An assessment of interventions was conducted by evaluating the delivery mode, duration, and evaluation of application feature and theoretical elements. RESULTS A total of 19 studies are included in the systematic review and 18 in the meta-analysis. Majority of the studies were deemed to have high risk of bias. Most of the interventions used a web-application for delivering their education (n = 17). While the interventions varied regarding duration and content, they were mainly guided by a symptom management theory. Web and mobile-based interventions significantly improved the overall physical symptom burden (SMD = -0.18; 95% CI = -0.28 to -0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.0002).

All reported patients were of Asian descent, however, and several studies included only young patients with thromboangiitis obliterans. Whether the beneficial results can be extrapolated to older Caucasian patients with atherosclerosis obliterans and a heavy burden of cardiovascular risk factors remains unclear. METHODS We enrolled 16 patients (age 78 +/- 2 year) with critical limb ischemia and a high prevalence of hypertension, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and uremia. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow and injected in the gastrocnemius muscle of the affected limb. RESULTS Four patients died because of progressive gangrene (two) or unrelated causes (two). Three patients required an amputation and one patient a femorocrural bypass within 12 weeks. The remaining eight patients had a modest improvement of resting pain and/or trophic lesions. Transcutaneous oxygen pressure (ratio lesion/reference) improved from 0.51 +/- 0.11 before to 0.86 +/- 0.03 (P < 0.001) after 12 weeks, whereas ankle-brachial index did not change significantly (0.42 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.1; P = 0.23).

CONCLUSIONS Although ATBMMNC was associated with objective signs of neovascularization, symptomatic improvement was only modest and restricted to the least affected patients. The discrepancy with previous findings may be related to the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors which causes endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction.","De Vriese, A S; Billiet, J; Van Droogenbroeck, J; Ghekiere, J; De Letter, J A",Journal of internal medicine,85,13

DESIGN Prospective experimental ex vivo study. SETTING University teaching hospital. ANIMALS Thirty-six canine cadavers. INTERVENTIONS Each cadaver was randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups (SB-A, LB-A, SB-LV, LB-LV, SB-HV, LB-HV). In each cadaver bilateral thoracostomy tubes (either SB or LB) were placed and 20 mL/kg of air, LV fluid, or HV fluid was instilled via 1 thoracostomy tube. Both tubes were aspirated and the volume aspirated was recorded and analyzed as a percentage of instilled air or fluid volume. The procedure was repeated on the contralateral hemithorax. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There was no significant difference in air or fluid recovery when SB and LB groups were compared. Median (range) air recovery volumes in the SB-A and LB-A groups were 101.5% (94.4-115.8%) and 102.8% (94.1-107.8%), respectively (P = 0.898). Recovery of LV fluid was 93.5% (79.2-99.0%) for SB-LV and 85.8% (77.1-101.8%) for LB-LV cadavers (P = 0.305) and recovery percentages of HV fluid were 92.6% (86.1-96.2%) and 91.4% (74.2-96.4%) for SB-HV and LB-HV groups, respectively (P > 0.999).

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.","Sheahan, Timothy P; Sims, Amy C; Graham, Rachel L; Menachery, Vineet D; Gralinski, Lisa E; Case, James B; Leist, Sarah R; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Feng, Joy Y; Trantcheva, Iva; Bannister, Roy; Park, Yeojin; Babusis, Darius; Clarke, Michael O; Mackman, Richard L; Spahn, Jamie E; Palmiotti, Christopher A; Siegel, Dustin; Ray, Adrian S; Cihlar, Tomas; Jordan, Robert; Denison, Mark R; Baric, Ralph S",Science translational medicine,85,11

The underlying pathophysiology varies considerably and approximately 50% of the patients suffer from CHF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Mortality in the perioperative period is increased in patients with CHF and this holds true for both minor and major surgeries. This review will summarize recent literature in the field of CHF and perioperative outcome in patients undergoing surgery with a special emphasis on actual guidelines, preoperative assessment and appropriate perioperative therapy. RECENT FINDINGS In the past 18 months, new insights in the short and long-term effects of CHF in the perioperative period have been published. The role of left ventricular ejection fraction has been studied in noncardiac surgical patients and it has been demonstrated that an ejection fraction less than 30% is associated with a significant increase in mortality and myocardial infarctions. Moreover, in 25% of patients, acute exacerbation of heart failure takes place in the perioperative period. The European Society of Anesthesiology published new guidelines on the preoperative evaluation of patients with CHF. The role of adequate preoperative evaluation and preparation of patients with CHF is discussed widely. It becomes clear that parameters like brain natriuretic peptide play a crucial role in risk stratification and prediction of outcome. Also, the treatment of patients with low cardiac output was a topic, and it became clear that established therapies including the use of β-mimetics and PDE-III inhibitors should only be initiated in very selected patient groups. However, adequately powered studies in patients with CHF are still missing and the majority of knowledge is based on patient undergoing cardiac surgery. SUMMARY CHF is a source of considerable perioperative morbidity and mortality and in contrast to coronary artery disease, knowledge is very limited and additional research urgently needed.","Smit-Fun, Valérie; Buhre, Wolfgang F",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,85,19

However, accuracy of visual evaluation is impaired by inter- and intra-reader variability, artifacts in the posterior fossa and limited sensitivity for subtle density shifts. We propose a machine learning approach for detecting early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions (Posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) based on admission NCCTs. METHODS The retrospective study includes 552 pc-ASPECTS regions (144 with infarctions in follow-up NCCTs) extracted from pre-therapeutic early hyperacute scans of 69 patients with basilar artery occlusion that later underwent successful recanalization. We evaluated 1218 quantitative image features utilizing random forest algorithms with fivefold cross-validation for the ability to detect early ischemic changes in hyperacute images that lead to definitive infarctions in follow-up imaging. Classifier performance was compared to conventional readings of two neuroradiologists. RESULTS Receiver operating characteristic area under the curves for detection of early ischemic changes were 0.70 (95% CI [0.64; 0.75]) for cerebellum to 0.82 (95% CI [0.77; 0.86]) for thalamus. Predictive performance of the classifier was significantly higher compared to visual reading for thalamus, midbrain, and pons (P value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative features of early hyperacute NCCTs can be used to detect early ischemic changes in pc-ASPECTS regions.

OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the surgical outcomes of minilaparoendoscopic single-site dismembered pyeloplasty (MILESS-DP), a new technique overcoming the technical limitations of LESS and ML, and equally combining the advantages of both these surgical procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty consecutive patients underwent MILESS-DP for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. SURGICAL PROCEDURE The SILS port was inserted through a transumbilical incision and two 3-mm trocars were inserted in the ipsilateral midclavicular line. The sequence of steps of MILESS-DP is comparable to standard laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty. MEASUREMENTS The end points of this study were: (1) feasibility; (2) safety; (3) efficacy; and (4) cosmesis, evaluated using a body image questionnaire. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS All patients were symptomatic (100%) and three (15%) had concomitant kidney stones. (1) Feasibility: a conversion to either standard laparoscopic technique or open technique did not occur in any case. Median operative time was 147.3min (interquartile range [IQR]: 110-195min); (2) safety: no intraoperative complications were reported. Only in two patients (10%), a urinoma was postoperatively identified and conservatively treated with an ureteral stent. The median difference in post- and preoperative creatinine and haemoglobin was +0.55mg/dl and -0.76mg/dl (IQR: -0.20/-1.20mg/dl); (3) efficacy: the median postoperative hospital stay was 4.4 d (IQR: 4-9 d). The overall success rate was 95% at the follow-up; (4) cosmesis: all patients were enthusiastic with the appearance of the scars; the median body image score and the median cosmesis score were 19.95 (IQR 19-20) and 23.95 (IQR 23-24), respectively. The limitations of this study are the limited series and short follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our phase 2a studies demonstrate that MILESS-DP is a safe and reproducible procedure with excellent cosmetic outcomes and short-term clinical outcomes in the hands of a surgical team with experience in laparoscopy. PATIENT SUMMARY Minilaparoscopy using 3-mm instruments and laparoendoscopic single-site using a single abdominal incision, still present several technical drawbacks which limit their reproducibility in urology. In order to overcome these technical limitations and equally combining the advantages of both these surgical procedures, we ideated a hybrid technique which we defined minilaparoendoscopic single-site. This study aims to demonstrate that minilaparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty is a safe and reproducible procedure with excellent cosmetic outcomes and short-term clinical outcomes in the hands of a surgical team with experience in mini-invasive surgery.","Greco, Francesco; Pini, Giovannalberto; Alba, Stefano; Altieri, Vincenzo Maria; Verze, Paolo; Mirone, Vincenzo",European urology focus,85,27

Bispectral index (BIS) is an EEG-derived measure which can be sensitive to frontal electromyographic (EMG) artifacts. We compared BIS values before and after sugammadex or neostigmine neuromuscular block (NMB) reversal in patients with or without high EMG activity. METHODS During stable propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia and rocuronium-induced block, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive sugammadex 4 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 μg kg(-1)/glycopyrrolate 10 μg kg(-1), 10 min after the end of surgery. RESULTS Five minutes after sugammadex administration, mean BIS 50.1 (10.3) increased (P=0.018) to 61.7 (7.9) in 11 patients with high EMG activity. In contrast, BIS 49.3 (4.9) remained at 51.9 (5.4) in 13 patients who had no EMG activity. Fifteen minutes after neostigmine administration, mean BIS 51.9 (8.1) increased (P=0.007) to 63.9 (8.1) in 13 patients who had reappearance of muscle activity. However, in 11 patients who had no EMG activity, BIS 52.3 (7.4) remained at 53.3 (6.8). There was no significant difference between the sugammadex and neostigmine groups over time. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that reversal of NMB with sugammadex or neostigmine increased BIS values dependent on the presence of EMG activity. Thus, the effect of muscle activity reappearance during rocuronium NMB reversal spuriously increasing the BIS value should be taken into consideration when relying on BIS monitoring for evaluating propofol/remifentanil recovery.","Dahaba, A A; Bornemann, H; Hopfgartner, E; Ohran, M; Kocher, K; Liebmann, M; Wilfinger, G; Metzler, H",British journal of anaesthesia,85,1

Type II endoleaks are common and mostly benign, but they are related to more aneurysm sac expansion after EVAR. They may lead to rupture in <1% of cases. We present a case of a centenarian with a post-EVAR rupture, related to type II endoleak, and discuss the use of EVAR on the management of this type of endoleak in an extremely old patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 102-year-old man with a history of EVAR 12 years earlier, presented to the emergency department with a drop of consciousness. A computed tomography revealed a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Angiography showed a type II endoleak related to patent lumbar arteries deriving from collateral branches of the right internal iliac artery. Embolization was not successful and subsequently the ostium of the iliolumbar artery was overstented, obliterating the feeding branch. The postoperative course was complicated by a deterioration of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patient was discharged home on the seventh postprocedural day; nonetheless, he died on postoperative day sixteenth due to respiratory complications. CONCLUSION Complications following EVAR are a real threat and emphasize the need for follow-up. The current case report shows that age per se should not be a contraindication for EVAR nor for follow-up. Also, late ruptures due to type II endoleaks could be treated in the very elderly population although larger series are required for robust conclusions.","Gonzalez-Urquijo, Mauricio; Reijnen, Michel M P J; Lozano-Balderas, Gerardo; Fabiani, Mario Alejandro",Vascular and endovascular surgery,85,29

As the pharmacist's role evolves from traditional medication dispensing towards direct patient care, many anticoagulation management services are pharmacist-managed. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare providers were faced with re-evaluating anticoagulation management practices to minimize person-to-person exposure risk. Although being anticoagulated is not considered high risk for illness from the coronavirus, these patients are often of advanced age and frequently have multiple comorbidities, putting them at increased risk. Consequently, two hospital-based, pharmacist-managed outpatient anticoagulation management services developed drive-thru curbside clinics to continue providing care to warfarin patients. The services utilized universal COVID-19 precautions to conduct curbside appointments where pharmacists determined patient's warfarin therapy plan, scheduled timely follow-up, and provided dosing instructions. With the unexpected coronavirus outbreak, this immediate change to traditional anticoagulation management was essential for safe and effective anticoagulation therapy. Implementing a curbside clinic allowed for safe distancing while managing warfarin appropriately.","Truong, Lynn; Whitfield, Kevin; Nickerson-Troy, Julia; Francoforte, Karen",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,85,16

METHODS We conducted a MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL search for randomized trials evaluating β-blockers in myocardial infarction enrolling at least 100 patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was performed stratifying trials into reperfusion-era (> 50% undergoing reperfusion or receiving aspirin/statin) or pre-reperfusion-era trials. RESULTS Sixty trials with 102,003 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the acute myocardial infarction trials, a significant interaction (Pinteraction = .02) was noted such that β-blockers reduced mortality in the pre-reperfusion (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.94) but not in the reperfusion era (IRR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.05). In the pre-reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced cardiovascular mortality (IRR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98), myocardial infarction (IRR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.97), and angina (IRR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95), with no difference for other outcomes. In the reperfusion era, β-blockers reduced myocardial infarction (IRR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83) (number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB] = 209) and angina (IRR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98) (NNTB = 26) at the expense of increase in heart failure (IRR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16) (number needed to treat to harm [NNTH] = 79), cardiogenic shock (IRR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.41) (NNTH = 90), and drug discontinuation (IRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.55-1.73), with no benefit for other outcomes. Benefits for recurrent myocardial infarction and angina in the reperfusion era appeared to be short term (30 days). CONCLUSIONS In contemporary practice of treatment of myocardial infarction, β-blockers have no mortality benefit but reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and angina (short-term) at the expense of increase in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation. The guideline authors should reconsider the strength of recommendations for β-blockers post myocardial infarction.","Bangalore, Sripal; Makani, Harikrishna; Radford, Martha; Thakur, Kamia; Toklu, Bora; Katz, Stuart D; DiNicolantonio, James J; Devereaux, P J; Alexander, Karen P; Wetterslev, Jorn; Messerli, Franz H",The American journal of medicine,85,31

The utility of Sonazoid in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated in this study. METHODS We analyzed a total of 716 HCC nodules that were detected on dynamic computed tomography in 316 patients. Detectability of these nodules was compared between CEUS and conventional ultrasonography. The effectiveness in the treatment was assessed by comparing the mean numbers of treatment sessions of RFA in patients treated with CEUS and that in historical controls matched for tumor and background conditions. RESULTS Detectability of tumor nodule was 83.5% in conventional ultrasonography and 93.2% in CEUS (P=0.04). Sixty-nine nodules in 52 patients were additionally detected with CEUS. The number of additionally detected tumor nodules was positively correlated with serum albumin level (P=0.016). The number of RFA sessions was 1.33±0.45 with CEUS as compared to 1.49±0.76 in the historical controls (P=0.0019). CONCLUSIONS CEUS with Sonazoid is useful for HCC detection in patients with a well-conserved liver function reservoir.

SARS-CoV encodes a unique accessory gene called open reading frame (ORF) 3b that, like other unique accessory genes in SARS-CoV, likely contributes to viral pathogenicity. The ORF 3b protein is 154 amino acids and is predicted to express from the second ORF in subgenomic RNA3. In this report, we have characterized the molecular components that regulate intracellular localization of the ORF 3b protein. We demonstrate unique shuttling behavior of ORF 3b, whereby the protein initially accumulates in the nucleus and subsequently translocates to mitochondria. Following nuclear localization, ORF 3b traffics to the outer membrane of mitochondria via a predicted amphipathic alpha-helix. Additionally, ORF 3b contains a consensus nuclear export sequence, and we demonstrate that nuclear export and thus mitochondrial translocation are dependent on a leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export mechanism. We further show that ORF 3b inhibits induction of type I interferon induced by retinoic acid-induced gene 1 and the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Our observations provide insights into the cellular localization of ORF 3b that may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which ORF 3b contributes to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. The findings reported here reveal that for multilocalized proteins, consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution may be crucial for understanding viral protein behavior and function.","Freundt, Eric C; Yu, Li; Park, Elizabeth; Lenardo, Michael J; Xu, Xiao-Ning",Journal of virology,85,16

To meet these objectives, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population and apply novel classifiers to identify informative biomarkers from multidimensional data sets. Method: To identify biomarkers, we infected DO mice with aerosolized Mtb confirmed a human-like spectrum of phenotypes, examined gene expression, and inflammatory and immune mediators in the lungs. We measured 11 proteins in 453 Mtb-infected and 29 non-infected mice. We have searched all combinations of six classification algorithms and 239 biomarker subsets and independently validated the selected classifiers. Finally, we selected two mouse lung biomarkers to test as candidate biomarkers of active TB, measuring their diagnostic performance in human sera acquired from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics. Findings: DO mice discovered two translationally relevant biomarkers, CXCL1 and MMP8 that accurately diagnosed active TB in humans with > 90% sensitivity and specificity compared to controls. We identified them through the two classifiers that accurately diagnosed supersusceptible DO mice with early-onset TB: Logistic Regression using MMP8 as a single biomarker, and Gradient Tree Boosting using a panel of 4 biomarkers (CXCL1, CXCL2, TNF, IL-10). Interpretation: This work confirms that the DO population models human responses and can accelerate discovery of translationally relevant TB biomarkers.","Koyuncu, D.; Niazi, M. K.

The impact of this on athletic performance and especially on anaerobic physical activities is poorly known. The aim of the present research was to analyze the effect of surgical mask use on the anaerobic running performance of athletes. Modifications in running time, blood lactate, blood glucose, blood oxygen saturation, subjective perceived stress, rating of perceived exertion, and heart rate variability were measured in 50 m and 400 m maximal running tests with and without the use of surgical masks in 72 athletes. The use of a surgical mask increased blood lactate concentration, sympathetic autonomic modulation, perceived exertion, perceived stress, and decreased blood oxygen saturation in 50 and 400 m running tests. Thus, the higher levels of blood lactate and lower blood oxygen saturation require adaptation of the athlete's rest and recovery periods to the acute workload. The higher level of sympathetic activation makes the acute and chronic control of autonomic modulation essential for an efficient training periodization.

These patients were receiving significantly less MDT input during exacerbations than their counterparts who received regular inpatient (IP) care. We aimed to enhance our home IV service to reduce the discrepancy in care between home and IP IVs. Methods: In 2017, we established a MDT home IV service that included a consultant, 2 nurses, 2 physiotherapists and a pharmacist. Individual MDT members review patients throughout IVs, including home visits, if required. In March 2020, home spirometry was also incorporated into the service. A weekly virtual MDT ward round (VWR) occurs with patient involvement via video call, which reviews clinical outcomes, acute and long-term issues and institutes treatment changes or recommendations, where appropriate. In December 2020, a pilot survey was sent to 34 patients who had received the previous 50 courses of home IV therapy to evaluate patient experience of increased MDT input during home IVs and identify areas for further improvement. Results: Patient feedback is very positive, with 80% of respondents reporting the level of input from the new service was the right level for their needs. Comments from patients include “they no longer feel forgotten” when on home IVs. On review of the last 50 home IV courses, 34% of VWR individual patient reviews resulted in a treatment change to acute or chronic therapies and new information on adherence was gained in a quarter of cases. The majority of patients are now able to finish their IVs at home without an end of IV clinic appointment. This has beneficially reduced direct contact during the COVID-19 pandemic. An area identified for improvement by patients was the addition of dietetic and psychosocial support. Conclusion: VWR and enhanced MDT input to a home IV service promotes a bespoke, efficient and holistic approach to CF care.","Kendall, V.; Ryan, C.; Hildage, J.; Clegg, M.; Benson, E.; Iqbal, N.; Orr, A.; Jones, A.; Green, H.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,85,16

Single symptoms account for a substantial volume of testing and disruption to in-person learning and childcare, yet their predictive value is unclear, given the clinical overlap with other circulating respiratory viruses and non-infectious etiologies. We aimed to determine the relative frequency and predictive value of single symptoms for paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections from an Ottawa COVID-19 assessment centre from October 2020 through April 2021. Overall, 46.3% (n=10,688) of pediatric encounters were for single symptoms, and 2.7% of these tested positive. The most common presenting single symptoms were rhinorrhea (31.8%), cough (17.4%) and fever (14.0%). Among children with high-risk exposures children in each age group, the following single symptoms had a higher proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases compared to no symptoms; fever and fatigue (0-4 years); fever, cough, headache, and rhinorrhea (5-12 years); fever, loss of taste or smell, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough (13-17 years). There was no evidence that the single symptom of either rhinorrhea or cough predicted SARS-CoV-2 infections among 0-4 year olds, despite accounting for a large volume (61.1%) of single symptom presentations in the absence of high-risk exposures. Symptom-based screening needs to be responsive to changes in evidence and local factors, including the expected resurgence of other respiratory viruses following relaxation of social distancing/masking, to reduce infection-related risks in schools and daycare settings.","Webster, R.

Among these is the Endangered Visayan hornbill Penelopides panini, found on Panay and Negros islands. Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, its population size is thought to have declined from 1,800 individuals 20 years ago to less than 1,000. However, a recent study on Negros estimated 3,564 individuals across three core forest blocks. This study aims to quantify the Visayan hornbill population size in and around the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park (NWPPNP) on Panay, the largest contiguous low-elevation forest landscape remaining across its range, and its broad habitat associations across a gradient of environmental degradation. Methods Hornbills were surveyed using 10-minute Distance sampling point counts (n = 362) along transects (average length 1.1 km). Habitat variables were recorded, while habitat was classified into: primary forest, secondary forest, plantation or open habitat. Using Distance software, population densities were estimated for, and post-stratified by habitat, with the overall population estimate taken as a mean of habitat density estimates weighted by habitat area. Using logistic binary regression, hornbill occurrence was modelled against reduced habitat factors extracted from factor analysis of the habitat data. Results Surveys covered 204.4 km2 of the 374.8 km2 Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbills were not recorded in plantation or open habitats. The estimated density of hornbills was significantly higher in primary forest (17.7 individuals km−2 ± 29.7% CV) than in secondary forest (5.0 individuals km−2 ± 36.7 %CV; z = 9.538, P < 0.001). The overall population estimate is 2,231 individuals ± 24.4 %CV for the NWPPNP and environs, and 2,949 individuals ± 23.1 %CV for the entire Northwest Panay Peninsula. One habitat factor, described by increasing numbers of large trees, elevation and distance from the Park’s boundary, had a significant positive effect in explaining hornbill occurrence, with hornbills significantly more likely to occur in primary forest than the other habitat types. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the habitat preference of the Visayan hornbill, highlights the importance of the NWPPNP for the species’ conservation, and provides strong evidence for re-assessing the global population size.","Mynott, Holly Isabelle; Lee, David Charles; Santillan, Rhea Aranas; Jürgen Schwarz, Christian; Tacud, Benjamin; Fernandez, Arcel Dryden; Kerhoas, Daphne",bioRxiv,85,15

This resulted in a new challenge for learners and teachers: lessons moved from the classroom to the children’s homes. Therefore, teachers had to set rules, implement procedures and make didactical–methodical decisions regarding how to handle this new situation. In this paper, we focus on the roles of mathematics teachers in Germany and Spain. The article first describes how mathematics lessons were conducted using distance learning. Second, problems encountered throughout this process were examined. Third, teachers drew conclusions from their mathematics teaching experiences during distance learning. To address these research interests, a questionnaire was answered by N = 248 teachers (N1 = 171 German teachers;N2 = 77 Spanish teachers). Resulting from a mixed methods approach, differences between the countries can be observed, e.g., German teachers conducted more lessons asynchronously. In contrast, Spanish teachers used synchronous teaching more frequently, but still regard the lack of personal contact as a main challenge. Finally, for both countries, the digitization of mathematics lessons seems to have been normalized by the pandemic.","Barlovits, Simon Jablonski Simone Lázaro Claudia Ludwig Matthias Recio Tomas",Education Sciences,85,1

In order to respond to these healthcare measures, patients were offered to replace intravenous infusions (IV) of abatacept (ABT) and tocilizumab (TCZ) to subcutaneous injections (SC). Objectives: To assess the outcome of patients who switched from IV ABT or TCZ to SC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was conducted in December 2020 in partnership with the national AFP-RIC patient association to assess the outcome and satisfaction of patients who switched from ABT or TCZ IV to SC during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We also analysed the outcome of patients who switched from IV ABT or TCZ to SC in the rheumatology department of Cochin Hospital during the lockdown in April/may 2020. Articular activity parameters (swollen joint count, pain joint count, visual analogic pain scale, CRP, DAS-28 activity score) were assessed at medical visits before and 6 months after switching from IV to SC. The data collected from the AFP-RIC patient association and the rheumatology department of Cochin Hospital were then aggregated and analyzed by Chisquare and Wilcoxon tests. Results: 81 patients responded to the survey carried out by AFP-RIC patient association, including 29 treated with IV ABT (n=15, 52%) or TCZ (n=14, 48%). 17/29 (59%) were offered to switch from IV to SC, 14/17 patients (82%) accepted and 7 patients were still receiving ABT or TCZ SC injections in December 2020. In the rheumatology department of Cochin hospital, 71 patients were scheduled in April/May 2020 to receive IV ABT or TCZ, and 27 (38%) switched to SC. After 6 months, 19 patients (70%) had maintained SC injections, were satisfied with this injection route of administration and their articular activity parameters were unchanged (Table 1). The combined analysis of these two populations included 41 patients (33 rheumatoid arthritis, RA, 7 juvenile idiopathic arthritis, JIA and 1 polymyalgia rheumatica) who switched to SC ABT or TCZ. 26/41 (63.5%) patients maintained SC injections and IV was re-established in 15/41 (36.5%). Reasons for returning to IV were poor tolerance of SC injections (n=6, 40%), worsening symptoms (n=11, 73%), patient preference to see a rheumatologist in hospital (n=10, 67%) and the high number of SC injections (n=2, 13%). The proportion of patients returning to IV was higher in RA patients compared to patients with JIA (42% vs. 14%, p = 0.08). Age and disease duration were not significantly different between patients who maintained SC injections and those who returned to IV (respectively p=0.97 and p=0.63). Conclusion: Our study suggests that switching from IV ABT or TCZ to SC is an acceptable procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for patients with JIA.","Combier, A.; Wanono, S.; Poiroux, L.; Frantz, C.; Descamps, E.; Fogel, O.; Boisson, M.; Ayral, X.; Bottois, C.; Allanore, Y.; Avouac, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,85,16

During one of the focus group conversations, Abdul (not his real name) explained how his Somali-Christian identity presented a dilemma whilst he lived with fellow Muslim Somali nationals when he was displaced during the 2015 xenophobic violence in Johannesburg. Firstly, this contribution discusses a general overview of the situation of migration and then his situation is explored from the themes, which emerged from this study from the lens of bicultural and acculturation processes of identity formation. Although this was not a representative sample of male foreign migrant experiences, analysing Abdul’s situation within a post-colonial and bicultural acculturation paradigm revealed the ‘embedded’ trajectories at the interface between religion, identity and migration in social and economic processes of transformation. Sketching Abdul’s experiences through these lenses also generated contested processes on the interface of religion and identity that reflect the significance of the role played by religion in identity constructions which are open to change (and sometimes present a dilemma), as life circumstances fluctuate with complex interactions in search of survival strategies to ward off any potential threats to a flourishing life. Such survival strategies highlight how these encounters generate hybrid identities and discourses with new boundaries, which, although fluid, volatile and situational, are reminiscent with historical and odious notions of colonialism that present African migrants as undesired foreigners whilst portraying other western and Asian migrants in cosy terms such as expatriates and tourists. Contribution: Exploring the relevance of migrant expressions within the context of identity constructions and socio-economic framework demonstrates how contested processes of socio-economic and religious transformation reflect the significance of the role played by religion on identity constructions. These constructions are articulated through fluid and complex encounters, which fluctuate to generate hybrid identities and migrant survival discourses.","Mpofu, Buhle",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,85,16

In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC). Author summary Biological sequences, such as DNA, accumulate mutations over generations. By comparing such sequences in a phylogenetic framework, the evolutionary tree of lifeforms can be inferred. With the overwhelming availability of biological sequence data, and the increasing affordability of collecting new data, the development of fast and efficient phylogenetic algorithms is more important than ever. In this article we focus on the relaxed clock model, which is very popular in phylogenetics. We explored how a range of optimisations can improve the statistical inference of the relaxed clock. This work has produced a phylogenetic setup which can infer parameters related to the relaxed clock up to 65 times faster than previous setups, depending on the dataset. The methods introduced adapt to the dataset during computation and are highly efficient when processing long biological sequences.","Douglas, Jordan; Zhang, Rong; Bouckaert, Remco",bioRxiv,85,1

The goal was to compare the variability of the viral concentration among different WWTPs that serve different communities and to correlate the concentration of virus in wastewater with the community level COVID-19 epidemic. The results showed that there were significant differences in viral concentration detected in different plants. However, the variability of SARS-CoV-2 concentration cannot easily be explained by the COVID-19 case reports because a large number of sewer-shed characteristics have important influences on the quantifiable viral concentration in the sewage samples. The results from year-long tracking of SARS-CoV-2 concentration in two large WWTPs, however, matched fairly well with the county level COVID-19 case reports. This suggests continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in the same treatment plant can offer insights into community level trends of COVID-19 and can serve as an alert for a possible resurgence of the disease. Amplicon-based sequencing targeting two SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations was shown as a proof-of-concept for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater.

Typically, screening mammograms are reported after patients have left the facility. If imaging is abnormal, then an additional visit is needed for diagnostic imaging, introducing delays and potential disparities.Thus, we implemented an immediate-read screening mammography program and measured its impact on racial/ethnic disparities in time to diagnostic imaging after an abnormal screening mammogram. Methods: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented an immediate read screening program in late May 2020. Patients were provided imaging results before discharge and if the exam was abnormal, efforts were made to perform diagnostic imaging during that visit. We identified consecutive screening mammograms performed weekdays 8:00am-4:30pm and Saturdays 9:00am-4:00pm pre-implementation (6/1/19-10/31/19) and post-implementation (6/1/2020-10/31/2020). Exams left unread while awaiting comparison studies, due to technical factors, or for more than 10 days were excluded. Patient demographics and time from screening exam completion to report finalized were obtained from the electronic medical record. Cancer detection rate (CDR), abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to compare time from screening exam to report, same-day diagnostic imaging, and screening performance metrics pre- and postimplementation overall and by patient subgroups. Results: After 963 exams met exclusion criteria, a total of 8,222 pre- and 7,235 post-implementation exams were included. Median time to report finalization decreased from 61minutes (interquartile range [IQR]:24, 152) to 4 minutes (IQR:2, 7) for pre- and postimplementation periods (p < 0.001). During the pre-implementation period, non-white patients had lower odds of having same-day diagnostic imaging after an abnormal screening exam (age-adjusted odds ratio: 0.28;95% CI: 0.10, 0.78 p = 0.015). There was no evidence of this disparity post-implementation. AIR was higher in the pre- versus post-implementation period (6.3% versus 5.0%;p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a difference in CDR (5.8 versus 4.2 cancers/1,000 exams) and PPV (9.2% versus 8.4%) for pre- versus post-implementation periods.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many older adults changed their typical grocery shopping habits attempting to remain safe. To understand how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced older adults' grocery shopping habits. In this qualitative study, a total of 23 older adults aged 60 years or older participated in individual interviews via Zoom. Data were analyzed using directed content analysis. Attempting to be cautious, most participants reported altering grocery shopping habits by shopping less frequently, using online services such as grocery pickup or delivery, or having friends or family members do the shopping. However, some participants continued shopping in stores due to poor quality produce items picked out by shoppers and safe policies implemented by stores. Also, grocery shopping in stores became incentivized as some participants viewed it as a form of entertainment, social interaction, and even physical activity during the pandemic. Although many stores offered senior shopping hours, the majority of study participants reported not using these services due to inconvenient times. Purchasing larger quantities of items and selecting more shelf stable, canned, and frozen items were also reported. Providing older adults with training and education on using online grocery shopping services may help this population have safe and simple access to healthy food items. In addition, training grocery store workers to pick out good quality produce may encourage more older adults to use these online services. Modifications to grocery store-instated senior hours should consider more convenient times to best support older adults. Because the grocery store emerged as an enjoyable place, it is especially crucial that grocery stores continue to enforce the policies that allow older adults to feel safe purchasing their groceries.

This study applies the Crisis and Emergency Risk and Communication model (CERC) to understand the themes and evolution of misinformation on the Internet during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, when the epidemic developed rapidly with mysteries. Drawing on 470 misinformation rated as false by three leading Chinese fact-checking platforms between 1 January and 3 February 2020, the analysis demonstrated five major misinformation themes surrounding COVID-19: prevention and treatment, crisis situation updates, authority action and policy, disease information, and conspiracy. Further trend analyses found that misinformation emerged only after the nationwide recognition of the crisis, and appeared to evolve relating to crisis stages, government policies, and media reports. This study is the first to apply the CERC model to investigate the primary themes of misinformation and their evolution. It provides a standard typology for crisis-related misinformation and illuminates how misinformation of a particular topic emerges. This study has significant theoretical and practical implications for strategic misinformation management.","Lu, J. H.",Frontiers in Communication,85,24

In general, the toolkits focus on one design stage or another, e.g., ideation or programming. Few toolkits are created to guide children through an entire design process. This paper presents a toolkit for smart-thing design with children. It revolves around SNaP, a card-based board game for children. The toolkit serves to frame the entire design process and guide them through their exploration, ideation, programming and prototyping of their own smart things. By embracing action research, the toolkit was adopted in actions with children, namely, design workshops. Results of actions were reflected over by considering children's benefits, and they were used to make the toolkit evolve across cycles of action, reflection and development. The paper reports on the latest evolution cycles, ending with the 2020 cycle for continuing smart-thing design during COVID-19 times.

After effectively eliminating the virus, New Zealand experienced a second outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. During this August outbreak, New Zealand utilised genomic sequencing in a primary role to support its track and trace efforts for the first time, leading to a second successful elimination of the virus. MethodsWe generated the genomes of 80% of the laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 from New Zealands August 2020 outbreak and compared these genomes to the available global genomic data. FindingsGenomic sequencing was able to rapidly identify that the new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand belonged to a single cluster and hence resulted from a single introduction. However, successful identification of the origin of this outbreak was impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data. InterpretationAccess to a broader and more heterogenous sample of global genomic data would strengthen efforts to locate the source of any new outbreaks.

We collected and compared the data of clinic visits and hours of sick leave among vaccinated and non-vaccinated workers during January and April in 1998 and 1999. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore possible determinants. The incidence rate of ARI clinic visits dropped 37.9% in 1999, with 57.3% reduction in vaccinated and 14.1% in un-vaccinated workers. Multiple regression analysis showed that the reduction was significantly associated with vaccination status, a history of diabetes, and occurrence of ARI clinic visits in 1998. Influenza vaccination is effective in reducing ARI clinic visits and sickness absence. Workers with a previous history of ARI, diabetes, and possibly young workers living with children were more likely to get the benefit.

Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A; Andre, Nicole M; Millet, Jean K; Whittaker, Gary R",ArXiv,85,30

Many ventilators incorporate a function to control the time to reach the targeted airway pressure (inspiratory rise time). However, it has not been clarified how inspiratory rise time affects inspiratory work load under various ventilator settings. In a bench study we investigated the effect of inspiratory rise time on inspiratory work load during pressure-support ventilation (PSV). METHODS We studied 6 ICU ventilators. We measured flow and pressure at the airway opening (P(ao)) at PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O, pressure-support of 5 cm H(2)O and 10 cm H(2)O, 4 triggering sensitivities, and inspiratory drives 300 mL, 500 mL, and 700 mL. The inspiratory-rise-time setting was not consistent between the ventilators, and we chose 3 inspiratory-rise-time levels with each ventilator. The inspiratory delay time (DT) was defined as the time between the onset of inspiration and the return of P(ao) to baseline, and was divided into 2 parts at the point of the lowest P(ao): before the lowest P(ao) (DT(1)), and after the lowest P(ao) (DT(2)). As an indicator of inspiratory work load we calculated the pressure-time-product (PTP) of the P(ao) over the DT. PTP was also divided into PTP(1) and PTP(2), at the point of the lowest P(ao). RESULTS Short inspiratory rise time reduced DT(2), PTP(1), and PTP(2), regardless of the pressure-support level, triggering sensitivity, or inspiratory drive. However, the inspiratory-rise-time setting did not affect DT(1). The PTP(1), PTP(2), and DT(2) values differed significantly among the ventilators. A combination of short inspiratory rise time, high PSV, and sharp triggering sensitivity resulted in the smallest PTP and DT values. CONCLUSIONS Short inspiratory rise time decreased inspiratory work load, regardless of the pressure-support level, triggering sensitivity, or inspiratory drive. Inspiratory work load can be maximally lowered by a combination of a short inspiratory rise time, a sharp triggering sensitivity, and a high inspiratory pressure-support level for a given patient's inspiratory effort.","Murata, Shinya; Yokoyama, Kazuki; Sakamoto, Yushi; Yamashita, Ken; Oto, Jun; Imanaka, Hideaki; Nishimura, Masaji",Respiratory care,85,1

We previously showed an elevated response to multifilament polyester (PE) versus monofilament polypropylene (PP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) meshes, but it is unclear whether this discrepancy is due to the differences in chemical composition or filament structure. This study compares the influence of a newly available monofilament PE mesh to that of multifilament PE, monofilament PP, and monofilament PTFE on the expression of genes important in inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling in a rat model. Full thickness abdominal wall defects were corrected with onlay repair or suture repair with no mesh. Explants were harvested 7 or 90 days after repair and divided for histology and mRNA analyses using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays to profile expression at the tissue-mesh interface. Monofilament PE elicited a reduced foreign body reaction compared to multifilament PE, corresponding with reduced mRNA expression of important inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Unexpectedly, monofilament PE also resulted in markedly reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor and MMPs 3 and 9 compared to the widely-used monofilament PP mesh. Findings from this study revealed that both chemical composition and filament structure are important mesh characteristics that may affect a patient's wound healing response and clinical outcome, and should be considered by the surgeon when choosing a particular mesh. Although clinical studies are warranted, results in a rodent model suggest that monofilament PE may be more beneficial than the multifilament form for certain hernia repairs.","Nguyen, Phuoc T; Asarias, Jennifer R; Pierce, Lisa M",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,85,1

L-A, the major species, has been extensively characterized with in vitro systems established, but little is known about L-BC. Here we report in vitro template-dependent transcription, replication, and RNA recognition activities of L-BC. The L-BC replicase activity converts positive, single-stranded RNA to double-stranded RNA by synthesis of the complementary RNA strand. Although L-A and L-BC do not interact in vivo, in vitro L-BC virions can replicate the positive, single-stranded RNA of L-A and its satellite, M1, with the same 3' end sequence and stem-loop requirements shown by L-A virions for its own template. However, the L-BC virions do not recognize the internal replication enhancer of the L-A positive strand. In a direct comparison of L-A and L-BC virions, each preferentially recognizes its own RNA for binding, replication, and transcription. These results suggest a close evolutionary relation of these two viruses, consistent with their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence similarities.","Ribas, J C; Wickner, R B",Journal of virology,85,1

Physicians incorrectly view people of color as having high pain tolerance, leading to undertreatment. Women with disabilities are often undiagnosed because their symptoms are dismissed. Low-income patients have less access to appropriate treatment. These patterns, and others, reflect long-standing disparities that have become engrained in U.S. health systems. As the healthcare industry adopts artificial intelligence and algorithminformed (AI) tools, it is vital that regulators address healthcare discrimination. AI tools are increasingly used to make both clinical and administrative decisions by hospitals, physicians, and insurers--yet there is no framework that specifically places nondiscrimination obligations on AI users. The Food and Drug Administration has limited authority to regulate AI and has not sought to incorporate anti-discrimination principles in its guidance. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act has not been used to enforce nondiscrimination in healthcare AI and is under-utilized by the Office of Civil Rights. State level protections by medical licensing boards or malpractice liability are similarly untested and have not yet extended nondiscrimination obligations to AI. This Article discusses the role of each legal obligation on healthcare AI and the ways in which each system can improve to address discrimination. It highlights the ways in which industries can self-regulate to set nondiscrimination standards and concludes by recommending standards and creating a super-regulator to address disparate impact by AI. As the world moves towards automation, it is imperative that ongoing concerns about systemic discrimination are removed to prevent further marginalization in healthcare.","Takshi, Sahar",Journal of law and health,85,20

The importance of efficacy in choosing the right hand hygiene product is reflected in the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on hand hygiene (J. M. Boyce and D. Pittet, Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 51:1-45, 2002). The best antimicrobial efficacy can be achieved with ethanol (60 to 85%), isopropanol (60 to 80%), and n-propanol (60 to 80%). The activity is broad and immediate. Ethanol at high concentrations (e.g., 95%) is the most effective treatment against naked viruses, whereas n-propanol seems to be more effective against the resident bacterial flora. The combination of alcohols may have a synergistic effect. The antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine (2 to 4%) and triclosan (1 to 2%) is both lower and slower. Additionally, both agents have a risk of bacterial resistance, which is higher for chlorhexidine than triclosan. Their activity is often supported by the mechanical removal of pathogens during hand washing. Taking the antimicrobial efficacy and the mechanical removal together, they are still less effective than the alcohols. Plain soap and water has the lowest efficacy of all. In the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline, promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs containing various emollients instead of irritating soaps and detergents is one strategy to reduce skin damage, dryness, and irritation. Irritant contact dermatitis is highest with preparations containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, less frequent with nonantimicrobial soaps and preparations containing lower concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate, and lowest with well-formulated alcohol-based hand rubs containing emollients and other skin conditioners. Too few published data from comparative trials are available to reliably rank triclosan. Personnel should be reminded that it is neither necessary nor recommended to routinely wash hands after each application of an alcohol-based hand rub. Long-lasting improvement of compliance with hand hygiene protocols can be successful if an effective and accessible alcohol-based hand rub with a proven dermal tolerance and an excellent user acceptability is supplied, accompanied by education of health care workers and promotion of the use of the product.","Kampf, Günter; Kramer, Axel",Clinical microbiology reviews,85,0

The replicase is expressed in the form of two polyproteins (open reading frame 1a [ORF1a] and ORF1ab), which are processed into 12 nonstructural proteins by three viral proteases. In immunofluorescence assays, the majority of these cleavage products localized to the perinuclear region of the cell. A dense granular and vesicular staining was observed, which strongly suggested membrane association. By using confocal microscopy and double-label immunofluorescence, the distribution of the EAV replicase was shown to overlap with that of PDI, a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and intermediate compartment. An in situ labeling of nascent viral RNA with bromo-UTP demonstrated that the membrane-bound complex in which the replicase subunits accumulate is indeed the site of viral RNA synthesis. A number of ORF1a-encoded hydrophobic domains were postulated to be involved in the membrane association of the arterivirus replication complex. By using various biochemical methods (Triton X-114 extraction, membrane purification, and sodium carbonate treatment), replicase subunits containing these domains were shown to behave as integral membrane proteins and to be membrane associated in infected cells. Thus, contribution to the formation of a membrane-bound scaffold for the viral replication-transcription complex appears to be an important novel function for the arterivirus ORF1a replicase polyprotein.","van der Meer, Y; van Tol, H; Locker, J K; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,85,17

Studies monitoring individuals in households or schools have helped elucidate the determinants of transmission in small social structures due to advances in statistical modeling; but such an approach has so far largely failed to consider individuals in the wider context they live in. Here, we used an outbreak of chikungunya in a rural community in Bangladesh as a case study to obtain a more comprehensive characterization of risk factors in disease spread. We developed Bayesian data augmentation approaches to account for uncertainty in the source of infection, recall uncertainty, and unobserved infection dates. We found that the probability of chikungunya transmission was 12% [95% credible interval (CI): 8-17%] between household members but dropped to 0.3% for those living 50 m away (95% CI: 0.2-0.5%). Overall, the mean transmission distance was 95 m (95% CI: 77-113 m). Females were 1.5 times more likely to become infected than males (95% CI: 1.2-1.8), which was virtually identical to the relative risk of being at home estimated from an independent human movement study in the country. Reported daily use of antimosquito coils had no detectable impact on transmission. This study shows how the complex interplay between the characteristics of an individual and his or her close and wider environment contributes to the shaping of infectious disease epidemics.","Salje, Henrik; Lessler, Justin; Paul, Kishor Kumar; Azman, Andrew S; Rahman, M Waliur; Rahman, Mahmudur; Cummings, Derek; Gurley, Emily S; Cauchemez, Simon",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,85,11

Herein, we evaluated the contributions of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in promoting innate defense mechanisms following coronavirus infection of the CNS. Intracerebral infection of RAG1(-/-) mice with a recombinant CXCL10-expressing murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus) resulted in protection from disease and increased survival that correlated with a significant increase in recruitment and activation of natural killer (NK) cells within the CNS. Accumulation of NK cells resulted in a reduction in viral titers that was dependent on gamma interferon secretion.

Interventions undertaken can be split into three distinct categories: (1) matching capacity to demand, (2) waiting list segmentation and (3) redesigning operational systems. METHODS A capacity and demand time series during 2019 and 2020 was used as the basis for improving waiting list and operational systems. A combination of the Model for Improvement and Lean principles were used to embed operational improvements. Multiple small tests of change were implemented to various aspects of the MRI waiting list process. Staff engagement was central to the success of the quality improvement (QI) initiatives. The radiological information system (RIS) provided the bulk of the data, and this was supplemented with manual data collection. RESULTS The number of people waiting for an MRI scan decreased from 1,954 at the start of the project to 413 at its conclusion-an overall reduction of 75%. Moreover, the average waiting time reduced from 96.4 days to 23.1. Achieving the Ministry of Health's (MoH) Priority 2 (P2) target increased from 23% to 87.5%. CONCLUSION A partnership between Ko Awatea and the radiology department at CMDHB, examining capacity and demand for MRI and using multiple QI techniques, successfully and sustainably reduced the MRI waiting list over a two-year period. The innovative solutions to match capacity to demand may be instructive for other radiology departments, and other waiting list scenarios.","Bhullar, Heera; County, Bernadette; Barnard, Stuart; Anderson, Anne; Seddon, Mary E",The New Zealand medical journal,85,11

Both false positive and false negative cases are commonly encountered and this could have far-reaching detrimental effects on the patients, their family and the clinicians alike. Contact history is particularly important in diagnosing SARS in children as their presenting features are often non-specific. The difficulty in making a correct diagnosis is further compounded by the lack of a sensitive rapid diagnostic test. Serology is not particularly helpful in the initial triaging of patients as it takes at least 3 weeks to become positive. Co-infection and other treatable conditions should not be missed and conventional antibiotics should remain as part of the first-line treatment regimen. We report five cases to illustrate the difficulties and dilemmas faced by clinicians in diagnosing SARS in children.","Li, A M; Hon, K L E; Cheng, W T; Ng, P C; Chan, F Y; Li, C K; Leung, T F; Fok, T F",Journal of paediatrics and child health,85,9

Biochemical evidence suggests that zinc may be an effective treatment, and zinc gluconate glycine (ZGG) lozenges have been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms in adults. OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of ZGG treatment of colds in children and adolescents. DESIGN A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Two suburban school districts in Cleveland, Ohio. PATIENTS A total of 249 students in grades 1 through 12 were enrolled within the first 24 hours of experiencing at least 2 of 9 symptoms of the common cold. INTERVENTION Zinc lozenges, 10 mg, orally dissolved, 5 times a day (in grades 1-6) or 6 times a day (in grades 7-12). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Time to resolution of cold symptoms based on subjective daily symptom scores for cough, headache, hoarseness, muscle ache, nasal congestion, nasal drainage, scratchy throat, sore throat, and sneezing. RESULTS Time to resolution of all cold symptoms did not differ significantly between students receiving zinc (n = 124) and those receiving placebo (n = 125) (median, 9 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8-9 days; median, 9 days, 95% CI, 7-10 days, respectively; P=.71). There were no significant differences in the time to resolution of any of the 9 symptoms studied. Compared with controls, more students in the zinc group reported adverse effects (88.6% vs 79.8%; P=.06); bad taste (60.2% vs 37.9%; P=.001); nausea (29.3% vs 16.1%; P=.01); mouth, tongue, or throat discomfort (36.6% vs 24.2%; P=.03); and diarrhea (10.6% vs 4.0%; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS In this community-based, randomized controlled trial, ZGG lozenges were not effective in treating cold symptoms in children and adolescents. Further studies with virologic testing are needed to clarify what role, if any, zinc may play in treating cold symptoms.","Macknin, M L; Piedmonte, M; Calendine, C; Janosky, J; Wald, E",JAMA,85,19

Currently 140,000 children younger than 5 years of age, nearly 1% of the U.S. population, are under surveillance in 3 urban counties, which include Nashville, TN, Rochester, NY, and Cincinnati, OH. Prospective, active, population-based surveillance of children hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or fever began in 2000, and outpatient surveillance began in 2002 in selected winter months. RESULTS During the first year of surveillance, the admission rate for acute respiratory illness/fever in children younger than 5 years of age in the surveillance areas was 180 per 10,000 children. In 61% of these hospitalizations, a respiratory virus was identified. Respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza viruses and parainfluenza viruses were identified in 30%, and other respiratory viruses were identified in 36%. Approximately one-third of children hospitalized had identified high risk conditions, primarily asthma (24%). About one-half of the children hospitalized were younger than 6 months of age. Polymerase chain reaction doubled the diagnostic yield of culture for respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza and parainfluenza virus combined. Preliminary data on influenza admissions during the 4 years indicated considerable variation in admission rates by season and site. Annually the mean admission rates during the study period were 43 per 10,000 children younger than 6 months of age, 9 per 10,000 children 6-23 months of age and 4 per 10,000 children 24-59 months of age. CONCLUSION These data provide ongoing surveillance of hospitalizations and other medically attended visits for respiratory viral illness in children younger than 5 years of age. Evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness, the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in children and the impact of the pediatric influenza vaccination program are in progress.","Griffin, Marie R; Walker, Frances J; Iwane, Marika K; Weinberg, Geoffrey A; Staat, Mary Allen; Erdman, Dean D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,85,33

In order to facilitate armored RNA purification, a His6 tag was introduced into the loop region of the MS2 coat protein, which allows the exposure of multiple His tags on the surface during armored RNA assembly. The His-tagged armored RNA particles were purified to homogeneity and verified to be free of DNA contamination in a single run of affinity chromatography. A fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome targeted for SARS-CoV detection was chosen for an external positive control preparation. A plant-specific gene sequence was chosen for a universal noncompetitive internal positive control preparation. Both controls were purified by Co2+ affinity chromatography and were included in a real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for SARS-CoV. The noncompetitive internal positive control can be added to clinical samples before RNA extraction and enables the identification of potential inhibitive effects without interfering with target amplification.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 3-month prospective analytical interventional study sampled 85 undergraduate students from the Department of Preventive Dental Sciences. A WhatsApp group was created, information was sent to the male and female groups, and a written assignment was used as a performance benchmark of knowledge acquisition and application. Perceptions of e-learning through WhatsApp were assessed using a previously validated and published questionnaire. Collected data underwent descriptive and bivariate analyses (unpaired t-test). RESULTS The average assignment scores of the 85 hybrid learners were statistically significantly higher than those of traditional learners from the previous academic year (34 ± 1 vs 26 ± 3; p < 0.05, respectively). Meanwhile, 57 hybrid learners completed the survey, and 73% agreed/strongly agreed that introducing a new method of teaching via WhatsApp was useful, 70% reported that a professional and comfortable learning environment was created, and 70% felt that group distractions were handled appropriately. The top advantages of learning through WhatsApp were availability/immediacy (94.7%) and being simple to operate (91.2%). Males (40.4%) were significantly more likely to report a sense of belonging to the group than females (33.3%, p = 0.01). Respondents agreed that high expectations of teacher availability (71.9%) and some students making no effort (52.6%) were challenges. Message flooding (45.6%) and time-consuming nature of WhatsApp (36.8%) were identified as technical challenges. CONCLUSION The findings showed significant improvements in student performance using the hybrid learning tool, as reflected in assignment scores. Positive perceptions of hybrid learning and improved academic performance indicate that WhatsApp is a convenient new teaching tool. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The results of this study may be applicable to other clinical dental disciplines.","Alsharif, Alla T; Alsharif, Bashair; Alsharif, Lina; Althagafi, Nebras; Natto, Zuhair S; Kassim, Saba",The journal of contemporary dental practice,85,4

When killed 72 h after infection, intestinal villi were shorter and crypts deeper (P less than 0.025) in duodenum, upper jejunum, and mid-small intestine, but not ileum in infected piglets. Virus antigen was seen by fluorescence microscopy in occasional jejunal villus tip cells in only four infected piglets and no controls at 72 h. Net Na+ and Cl- fluxes did not differ from noninfected litter-mate controls under basal conditions, but response to glucose was blunted in infected piglets (P less than 0.001). Theophylline stimulated net Cl- secretion in both infected and control animals, and cyclic AMP concentration in isolated jejunal villus enterocytes did not differ significantly. In isolated jejunal villus enterocytes of infected piglets, thymidine kinase activity increased (P less than 0.001), and sucrase activity decreased (P less than 0.001). We conclude that in this invasive enteritis caused by a major human viral pathogen, glucose-coupled Na+ transport is impaired in the jejunum at a time when the villus epithelium shows enzyme characteristics of crypt epithelium, and when little or no virus is present. These findings are identical to those occurring in an invasive coronavirus enteritis of piglets but differ markedly from those seen with enterotoxigenic diarrhea.","Davidson, G P; Gall, D G; Petric, M; Butler, D G; Hamilton, J R",The Journal of clinical investigation,85,19

At 20 +/- 1 degree C, aerosolized HCV/229E was found to survive best at 50% RH with a half-life of 67.33 +/- 8.24 h while at 30% RH the virus half-life was 26.76 +/- 6.21 h. At 50% RH nearly 20% infectious virus was still detectable at 6 days. High RH at 20 +/- 1 degree C, on the other hand, was found to be the least favourable to the survival of aerosolized virus and under these conditions the virus half-life was only about 3 h; no virus could be detected after 24 h in aerosol. At 6 +/- 1 degree C, in either 50% or 30% RH conditions, the survival of HCV/229E was significantly enhanced, with the decay pattern essentially similar to that seen at 20 +/- 1 degree C. At low temperature and high RH (80%), however, the survival pattern was completely reversed, with the HCV/229E half-life increasing to 86.01 +/- 5.28 h, nearly 30 times that found at 20 +/- 1 degree C and high RH. Although optimal survival at 6 degree C still occurred at 50% RH, the pronounced stabilizing effect of low temperature on the survival of HCV/229E at high RH indicates that the role of the environment on the survival of viruses in air may be more complex and significant than previously thought.","Ijaz, M K; Brunner, A H; Sattar, S A; Nair, R C; Johnson-Lussenburg, C M",The Journal of general virology,85,19

However, the spectrum of abnormalities associated with CIC has been highly variable. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature (until 1 June 2020) to assess CIC and disease severity during the early COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were pooled mean differences in platelet count, D-dimer level, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen level between non-severe and severe patients, stratified by degree of hypoxaemia or those who died. The risk factors for CIC were analysed. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed using R version 3.6.1, and certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS Of the included 5,243 adult COVID-19 patients, patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly lower platelet count, and higher D-dimer level, prothrombin time and fibrinogen level than non-severe patients. Pooled mean differences in platelet count (-19.7×109/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -31.7 to -7.6), D-dimer level (0.8μg/mL, 95% CI 0.5-1.1), prothrombin time (0.4 second, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and fibrinogen level (0.6g/L, 95% CI 0.3-0.8) were significant between the groups. Platelet count and D-dimer level were significant predictors of disease severity on meta-regression analysis. Older men had higher risks of severe coagulopathic disease. CONCLUSION Significant variability in CIC exists between non-severe and severe patients, with platelet count and D-dimer level correlating with disease severity. Routine monitoring of all coagulation parameters may help to assess CIC and decide on the appropriate management.","Mitra, Saikat; Ling, Ryan Ruiyang; Yang, Isabelle Xiaorui; Poon, Wynne Hsing; Tan, Chuen Seng; Monagle, Paul; MacLaren, Graeme; Ramanathan, Kollengode","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",85,17

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of daily quantitative and radiographic data on the cohort in a regional teaching hospital. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION There was significant improvement in radiographic scores, when compared with day 1, on days 5, 6 and 7 (P < 0.05) after commencement of pentaglobin treatment. Similarly, there was significant improvement in oxygen requirement, when compared with day 1, on days 6 and 7 (P < 0.05) after commencement of pentaglobin treatment. There were no reported adverse events attributable to pentaglobin administration. Ten patients made an uneventful recovery after treatment. One elderly man died from cardiorespiratory arrest despite clinical and radiological improvement, and another patient is making good progress. Pentaglobin is safe and probably effective in the treatment of steroid-resistant SARS.

Furthermore, microparticle storm resulted from apoptotic blood cells are central contributors to the generation and propagation of thrombosis. We focus on microthrombi in the early stage and describe in detail combined antithrombotic with fibrinolytic therapies to suppress microthrombi evolving into clinical events of thrombosis. We further discuss pulmonary hypertension causing plasmin, fibrinogen and albumin, globulin extruding into alveolar lumens, which impedes gas exchange and induces severe hypoxia. Hypoxia in turn induces pulmonary hypertension, and amplifies ECs damage in this pathophysiologic process, which forms a positive feedback loop, aggravating disease progression.

The transcriptional patterns of the two viruses indicated that differences occurred in RNAs 1 and 2(S) and that RNA 3 was absent in the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) variant. The smaller RNA 2(S) of PRCV was due to a 681-nucleotide (nt) deletion after base 62 of the PRCV peplomer or spike (S) gene. The PRCV S gene still retained information for the 16-amino-acid signal peptide and the first 6 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the mature S protein, but the adjacent 227 residues were deleted. Two additional deletions (3 and 5 nt) were detected in the PRCV genome downstream of the S gene. The 3-nt deletion occurred in a noncoding region; however, the 5-nt deletion shortened the potential open reading frame A polypeptide from 72 to 53 amino acid residues. Significantly, a C-to-T substitution was detected in the last base position of the transcription recognition sequence upstream of open reading frame A, which rendered RNA 3 nondetectable in PRCV-infected cell cultures.","Wesley, R D; Woods, R D; Cheung, A K",Journal of virology,85,23

Major support comes from studies in which alterations in components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis have been documented in patients with primary depression. However, screening thyroid tests are often routine and add little to the diagnostic evaluation. Overt thyroid disease is rare among depressed inpatients. The finding that depression often co-exists with autoimmune subclinical thyroiditis suggests that depression may cause alterations in the immune system, or that in fact it could be an autoimmune disorder itself. The outcome of treatment and the course of depression may be related to thyroid status as well. Augmentation of antidepressant therapy with the co-administration of thyroid hormones (mainly T3) is a well-documented treatment option for refractory depressed patients. Review of the literature suggests that there are no conclusive data on the role of thyroid function in depression. It is clear that depression is not characterised by an overt thyroid dysfunction, but it is also clear that a subgroup of depressed patients may manifest subtle thyroid abnormalities, or an activation of an autoimmune process. There is a strong possibility that the presence of a subtle thyroid dysfunction is a negative prognostic factor for depression and may demand specific therapeutic intervention.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Kantartzis, Sotiris; Siamouli, Melina; Panagiotidis, Panagiotis; Kaprinis, Stergios; Iacovides, Apostolos; Kaprinis, George",The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry,85,28

HUS is responsible for most deaths associated with E. coli O157 infection. From March 2002 to February 2004, approximately 13,000 fecal pat samples from 481 farms with finishing/store cattle throughout Scotland were examined for the presence of E. coli O157. A total of 441 fecal pats from 91 farms tested positive for E. coli O157. From the positive samples, a point estimate for high-level shedders was identified using mixture distribution analysis on counts of E. coli O157. Models were developed based on the confidence interval surrounding this point estimate (high-level shedder, greater than 10(3) or greater than 10(4) CFU g(-1) feces). The mean prevalence on high-level-shedding farms was higher than that on low-level-shedding farms. The presence of a high-level shedder on a farm was found to be associated with a high proportion of low-level shedding, consistent with the possibility of a higher level of transmission. Analysis of risk factors associated with the presence of a high-level shedder on a farm suggested the importance of the pathogen and individual host rather than the farm environment. The proportion of high-level shedders of phage 21/28 was higher than expected by chance.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cell-derived type I IFNs are of prime importance for the initial control of highly cytopathic viruses such as the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The aim of this study was to determine the major target cell populations of this first wave of type I IFNs. Generation of bone marrow-chimeric mice expressing the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) on either hemopoietic or non-bone marrow-derived cells revealed that the early control of MHV depended mainly on IFNAR expression on hemopoietic cells. To establish which cell population responds most efficiently to type I IFNs, mice conditionally deficient for the IFNAR on different leukocyte subsets were infected with MHV. This genetic analysis revealed that IFNAR expression on LysM+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells was most important for the early containment of MHV within secondary lymphoid organs and to prevent lethal liver disease.

We aimed to investigate the blood coagulation function and its influences on clinical outcomes of patients with syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: A total of 71 severe patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were treated in Wuhan First Hospital from February 12 to March 20, 2020, were enrolled. The blood coagulation data in these patients and in 61 healthy controls were collected. The patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: the aggravated group and the nonaggravated group, respectively, basing on whether the patients' conditions turned to critically ill or not after admission. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significant performances with coagulation dysfunction, including dramatically elevated values of FIB, PT, APTT, INR, FDP, and D-Dimers but markedly reduced AT value (P < .05). Importantly, more noteworthy coagulation disorders similar to the differences between patients and controls were found in the aggravated patients with conditions deterioration after admission than those in the nonaggravated patients without conditions deterioration (P < .05). Moreover, the aggravated patients possessed a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality compared with the nonaggravated patients (P < .001). The coagulation parameters of COVID-19 patients were widely and closely related to the indexes of liver function and inflammation (P < .05), indicating the coagulation dysfunction of these patients may be caused by liver injury and inflammatory storm. CONCLUSION: Severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often possess coagulation dysfunction on admission. A certain correlation exists in coagulation disorder and adverse clinical outcome among severe COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Yanhong; He, Liwei; Chen, Huixin; Lu, Shuangyan; Xiong, Yongfen; Liu, Juan; Zheng, Yao; Wang, Shun; Liu, Lei",Int J Lab Hematol,85,1

Although most nonurgent ophthalmology visits at Boston Children's Hospital were canceled, premature infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) still required timely, in-person care during the initial 3-month period of the infection surge in Massachusetts. The purpose of the current study was to report our protocols for mitigating risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between infants and eye care providers and to compare examination rates and results with the same 3-month period in 2019. METHODS: During the infection surge, we added new infection control measures and strengthened existing ones. Additional personal protective equipment was used, and the number of ophthalmologists rotating in the three high-capacity NICUs we service was limited. RESULTS: More infants required ROP examinations during the study period in 2020 than in the same period in 2019, but fewer examinations were performed. There were no cases of missed progression to severe ROP during this time and no known transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between ROP patients and ophthalmology staff. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, effective ROP care was safely provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, and contact with this vulnerable population was minimized.","Mantagos, Iason S; Wu, Carolyn; Griffith, Joseph F; Jastrzembski, Benjamin G; Gonzalez, Efren; Goldstein, Samantha; Pearlo, Lori; Vanderveen, Deborah K",J AAPOS,85,16

We recommend that biomedical researchers, especially those in the field of nutrition, abandon the use of racial categories to explain biologic phenomena but instead rely on a more comprehensive framework of ethnicity; that authors consider not just race and ethnicity but many social determinants of health, including experienced racism; that race and ethnicity not be conflated; that dietary pattern descriptions inform ethnicity descriptions; and that depersonalizating language be avoided.","Duggan, Christopher P; Kurpad, Anura; Stanford, Fatima C; Sunguya, Bruno; Wells, Jonathan C",Am J Clin Nutr,85,19

Managing orthopaedic emergencies effectively, while at the same time protecting patients and staff, remains a challenge. We explore how the UK lockdown affected the rate, distribution, and type of orthopaedic emergency department (ED) presentations, using the same period in 2019 as reference. This article discusses considerations for the ED and trauma wards to help to maintain the safety of patients and healthcare providers with an emphasis on more remote geography. Methods: The study was conducted from 23 March 2020 to 5 May 2020 during the full lockdown period (2020 group) and compared to the same time frame in 2019 (2019 group). Included are all patients who attended the ED at Raigmore Hospital during this period from both the local area and tertiary referral from throughout the UK Highlands. Data was collected and analyzed through the ED Information System (EDIS) as well as ward and theatre records. Results: A total of 1,978 patients presented to the ED during the lockdown period, compared to 4,777 patients in the same timeframe in 2019; a reduction of 58.6%. Orthopaedic presentations in 2020 and 2019 were 736 (37.2%) and 1,729 (36.2%) respectively, representing a 57.4% reduction. During the lockdown, 43.6% of operations were major procedures (n = 48) and 56.4% were minor procedures (n = 62), representing a significant proportional shift. Conclusion: During the COVID- 19 lockdown period there was a significant reduction in ED attendances and orthopaedic presentations compared to 2019. We also observed that there was a proportional increase in fractures in elderly patients and in minor injuries requiring surgery. These represented the majority of the orthopaedic workload during the lockdown period of 2020. Given this shift towards smaller surgical procedures, we suggest that access to a minor operating theatre in or close to ED would be desirable in the event of a second wave or future crisis.","Elhalawany, Ahmed S; Beastall, James; Cousins, Gerard",Bone Jt Open,85,21

In this model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the epidemic layer depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the infection information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer depends upon its infection probability in the epidemic layer. The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of SIS (Susceptible Infected Susceptible) process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of UAU (Unaware Aware Unaware) process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes is studied in terms of a network topology depend parameter({\alpha}). Using a second order linear theory it has been shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for the suitable choice of parameter({\alpha}), the two process can either exhibit sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Further, for the case of endemic state it is shown that the inclusion of awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of epidemic. The endemic state infection probability of a given node corresponding to the damped dynamics is found to have dependence upon both the transmission rates as well as on both absolute intra-layer and relative inter-layer degree of the individual nodes.","Sagar, Vikram; Zhao, Yi; Sen, Abhijit",,85,1

By applying a socioecological framework with an equity lens, we aim to provide an overview of the health of children in immigrant families (CIF) in the United States, identify gaps in related research, and suggest future areas of focus to advance health equity. METHODS: The literature review consisted of identifying academic and gray literature using a MeSH Database, Clinical Queries, and relevant keywords in 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and BrowZine). Search terms were selected with goals of: 1) conceptualizing a model of key drivers of health for CIF; 2) describing and classifying key drivers of health for CIF; and 3) identifying knowledge gaps. RESULTS: The initial search produced 1120 results which were screened for relevance using a meta-narrative approach. Of these, 224 papers were selected, categorized by topic, and reviewed in collaboration with the authors. Key topic areas included patient and family outcomes, institutional and community environments, the impact of public policy, and opportunities for research. Key inequities were identified in health outcomes; access to quality health care, housing, education, employment opportunities; immigration policies; and inclusion in and funding for research. Important resiliency factors for CIF included strong family connections and social networks. CONCLUSIONS: Broad structural inequities contribute to poor health outcomes among immigrant families. While resiliency factors exist, research on the impact of certain important drivers of health, such as structural and cultural racism, is missing regarding this population. More work is needed to inform the development and optimization of programs and policies aimed at improving outcomes for CIF. However, research should incorporate expertise from within immigrant communities. Finally, interventions to improve outcomes for CIF should be considered in the context of the socioecological model which informs the upstream and downstream drivers of health outcomes.","Ayalew, Betlihem; Dawson-Hahn, Elizabeth; Cholera, Rushina; Falusi, Olanrewaju; Haro, Tamar Magarik; Montoya-Williams, Diana; Linton, Julie M",,85,20

AIM: The study aims to illustrate (I) to what extent home care services and semi-residential care facilities are affected by COVID-19, (II) human and material resources, (III) the care situation of those in need of care and (IV) the organizational handling of the situation and outline support requests to politicians. METHODS: More than 12,000 home-care nursing services and semi-residential care facilities were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements, 701 nursing services (response rate 7,3 %) and 96 semi-residential facilities (response rate 3,5 %) took part. RESULTS: Almost a third (30,1 %, 189 / 627) of the nursing services surveyed are affected by confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 among clients. About half of the services report a reduced use of SGB V (47,6 %, 288 / 605) or SGB XI services (59,7 %, 375 / 628).

METHODS: A total of 156 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia at the Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 29, 2020, to March 20, 2020, and 20 healthy individuals were enrolled in this single-centered retrospective study. The epidemiological parameters, clinical presentations, underlying diseases, laboratory test results, and disease outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of all enrolled patients was 66 years. At least one underlying disease was identified in 101 COVID-19 patients, with hypertension being the most common one, followed by cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The most common symptoms identified upon admission were fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Compared to survival cases, patients who died during hospitalization had higher plasma levels of D-dimer, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, lactate, and lower percentage of lymphocytes (LYM [%]), platelet count and albumin levels. Most enrolled patients received antibiotics and anti-viral treatment. In addition, 60 patients received corticosteroids, and 51 received intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. Forty-four patients received noninvasive ventilation and 19 received invasive ventilation. Respiratory failure was the most frequently observed complication (106 [67.9%]), followed by sepsis (103 [66.0%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (67 [42.9%]), and septic shock (50 [32.1%]). Multivariable regression suggested that advanced age (OR [odds ratio] = 1.098, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.006-1.199, P = 0.037), shorter duration from onset to admission (OR = 0.853, 95% CI: 0.750-0.969, P = 0.015) and elevated lactate level upon admission (OR = 2.689, 95% CI: 1.044-6.926, P = 0.040) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, increased LYM (%) at admission (OR = 0.787, 95% CI: 0.686-0.903, P = 0.001) indicated a better prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we discovered that age, duration from onset to admission, LYM (%), and lactate level upon admission were independent factors that affecting the in-hospital mortality rate.","Wang, Zhigang; Wang, Zhiqiang",BMC Infect Dis,85,16

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April to June 2020. The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. Results: Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3 ± 2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%). Furthermore, 353 (30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean = 30.0% ± 27.4/100). Also, 266 (22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113 (9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105 (9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n = 333, 28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n = 329, 27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n = 303, 25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n = 249, 21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n = 488, 41.3%) and patient (n = 453, 38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n = 414, 35.2%), and testing (n = 411, 35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption. Conclusion: Given the estimated number of CR programs globally, these results suggest approximately 4400 CR programs globally have ceased or temporarily stopped service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges. Highlights: - COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe.- In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries.- The pandemic has resulted in at least temporary cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.- There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.- Alternative CR model (e.g., home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.","Ghisi, Gabriela Lima de Melo; Xu, Zhiming; Liu, Xia; Mola, Ana; Gallagher, Robyn; Babu, Abraham Samuel; Yeung, Colin; Marzolini, Susan; Buckley, John; Oh, Paul; Contractor, Aashish; Grace, Sherry L",Glob Heart,85,30

ESKAPE bacteria which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae are considered the most important, because of their close relationship with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this work was to identify and characterize ESKAPE bacteria and to detect their possible clonal spread in medical devices, patients, and medical personnel of the ICU for COVID-19 patients of the Hospital Juarez de Mexico. METHODOLOGY: Genetic identification of ESKAPE bacteria was performed by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Assembly of AdeABCRS operon and inhibition assays of pumps efflux in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were performed. Associated gene involved in biofilm formation (icaA) was performed in isolates belonging to the Staphylococcus genus. Finally, typing by ERIC-PCR and characterization of mobile genetic element SCCmec were done. RESULTS: Heterogeneous distribution of ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE bacteria was detected in various medical devices, patients, and medical personnel. Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant ESKAPE members. The analysis of intergenic regions revealed an important clonal distribution of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+). Genotyping of SCCmec mobile genetic elements and the icaA gene showed that there is no clonal distribution of S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal spread of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+) highlights the importance of adopting good practices for equipment disinfection, surfaces and management of COVID-19 patients.","Durán-Manuel, Emilio Mariano; Cruz-Cruz, Clemente; Ibáñez-Cervantes, Gabriela; Bravata-Alcantará, Juan Carlos; Sosa-Hernández, Oscar; Delgado-Balbuena, Laura; León-García, Gregorio; Cortés-Ortíz, Iliana Alejandra; Cureño-Díaz, Monica Alethia; Castro-Escarpulli, Graciela; Vélez-Reséndiz, Juan Manuel; Bello-López, Juan Manuel",J Infect Dev Ctries,85,19

Developed market economies are struggling with trade policy in the modern era of globalization, and the resulting realignments are straining the post-war international economic order. National emissions pledges under the Paris Agreement appear at present to fall far short of achieving the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions cuts that science suggests are needed to remain in a < 2 °C world. Merging climate and trade policy could provide developed economies a strategy for limiting global emissions while protecting and promoting their economic competitiveness. Since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, border carbon adjustments (BCAs) that would help protect domestic energy-intensive industry and prevent leakage have been discussed as a mechanism to make unilateral climate mitigation more politically attractive. Especially if implemented non-cooperatively, BCAs open the backdoor to protectionism and retaliation and potentially allow nations to retreat behind static barriers. Developments in international trade policy make this alternative to traditional climate diplomacy more viable today than previously and also increase the chance of climate protectionism. We propose an alternative policy framework-a cooperative sectoral tariff reduction (CSTR)-that would help provide dynamic incentives to improve performance, reduce the chance of BCAs being coopted for protectionist purposes, and create the foundation of a carbon club.","Banks, George David; Fitzgerald, Timothy",Clim Change,85,1

The hypothesis was that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) may up-regulate ACE2 expression that is used as receptor for viral entry into cells. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss the existing evidence on the interaction between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and ACEIs or ARBs and to examine the main implications for clinical practice. In addition, novel therapeutic strategies for blocking ACE2-mediated COVID-19 infection will be displayed. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to identify data from clinical and experimental studies for the association between COVID-19 infection, ACE2 and RAS inhibition. RESULTS: The current clinical and experimental evidence for ACEIs or ARBs to facilitate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is insufficient to suggest discontinuing these drugs. Several observational studies arrive at the conclusion that the continued use of RAS inhibitors is unlike to be harmful in COVID-19-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Further randomized trials are needed to answer definitely the question of whether RAS inhibitors are harmful or beneficial to patients with COVID-19.","Katsi, Vasiliki; Pavlidis, George; Charalambous, George; Tousoulis, Dimitrios; Toutouzas, Konstantinos",Current hypertension reviews (Online),85,5

In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations three times for these complexes of Mpro (monomeric and dimeric) and nine potential drugs that have a certain effect on the treatment of COVID-19 to explore their binding mechanism. In addition, a total of 12 methods for calculating binding free energy were employed to determine the optimal drug. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine consistently showed an outstanding binding ability to monomeric Mpro under various methods. Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir presented the best performance when binding to a dimer, which was independent of the protonated state of Hie41 (protonated at NÎµ) and Hid41 (protonated at NÎ´), and these findings suggest that Chloroquine may not effectively inhibit the activity of dimeric Mpro in vivo. Furthermore, three common hot-spot residues of Met165, Hie41, and Gln189 of monomeric Mpro systems dominated the binding of Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine. In dimeric Mpro, Gln189, Met165, and Met49 contributed significantly to binding with Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Saquinavir; therefore, Gln189 and Met165 might serve as the focus in the discovery and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. In addition, the van der Waals interaction played a significant role in the binding process, and the benzene ring of the drugs showed an apparent inhibitory effect on the normal function of Mpro. The binding cavity had great flexibility to accommodate these different drugs. The results would be notably helpful for enabling a detailed understanding of the binding mechanisms for these important drug-Mpro interactions and provide valuable guidance for the design of potent inhibitors.","Luo, Song; Huang, Kaifang; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Cong, Yalong; Zhang, John Z H; Duan, Lili",Nanoscale (Online),85,1

As of June 2020, there is no FDA approved antiviral therapy to eradicate this dreadful virus. In this study, drug re-purposing and computational approaches were employed to identify high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (3CLpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro) and the receptor domain of Spike protein. Molecular docking on 40 derivatives of standard drugs (Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Theophylline) led to the identification of R10, R2 and L9 as potential inhibitors of 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein, respectively. The binding affinity of R10, R2 and L9 towards 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein were 4.03 × 106, 3.72 × 104 and 1.31 × 104 M -1, respectively. These inhibitors interact with the active site or catalytic amino acid residues of 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein. We also examined the stability and dynamic behavior of protein-inhibitor complex by employing molecular dynamics simulation. RMSDs, RMSFs and variation in secondary structure of target proteins alone or in complex with their respective inhibitors were used to ascertain the integrity of proteins' structure during simulation. Moreover, physicochemical and ADMET properties of R10, R2 and L9 along with Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Theophylline were determined. In vitro and In vivo studies are needed to further validate the potential of these derivatives before they can be developed into potential drug molecules. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of beta coronavirus family which upon exposure caused a highly infectious disease called novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a probably bat originated disease was declared by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since then, despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the disease has affected nearly 56,261,952 laboratory confirmed human population and caused deaths of over 1,349,506 lives worldwide. Virus passes in majority through respiratory droplets and then enters lung epithelial cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and there it undergoes replication and targeting host cells causing severe pathogenesis. Majority of human population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 having fully functional immune system undergo asymptomatic infection while 5-10% are symptomatic and only 1-2% are critically affected and requires ventilation support. Older people or people with co-morbidities are severely affected by COVID-19. These categories of patients also display cytokine storm due to dysfunctional immune response which brutally destroys the affected organs and may lead to death in some. Real time PCR is still considered as standard method of diagnosis along with other serology, radiological and biochemical investigations. Till date, no specific validated medication is available for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thus, this review provides detailed knowledge about the different landscapes of disease incidence, etiopathogenesis, involvement of various organs, diagnostic criteria's and treatment guidelines followed for management of COVID-19 infection since its inception. In conclusion, extensive research to recognize novel pathways and their cross talk to combat this virus in precarious settings is our future positive hope.","Rathi, Himani; Burman, Vishakha; Datta, Sudip Kumar; Rana, Satya Vati; Mirza, Anissa Atif; Saha, Sarama; Kumar, Raman; Naithani, Manisha",Indian J Clin Biochem,85,1

I-S1 was also taken up by the lung, spleen, kidney and liver. Intranasally administered I-S1 also entered the brain, although at levels roughly ten times lower than after intravenous administration. APOE genotype and sex did not affect whole-brain I-S1 uptake but had variable effects on uptake by the olfactory bulb, liver, spleen and kidney. I-S1 uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb was reduced by lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation.

Among the discussions around health disparities lies a discussion on the role of psychosocial stress during this pandemic, especially with broadly applied social distancing and isolation recommendations. In nonpandemic times, psychosocial stressors have a significant association with physiological responses and behavioral responses. Within the current pandemic, increased attention on health-promoting behaviors, such as cooking and physical activity, has occurred. However, based on disparities from structural racism and socioeconomic effects on neighborhood environments, we may see a limiting value to the possible mitigating role of health behaviors within some disparate communities. We present in this perspective that there may be a role for behavioral interventions to mitigate psychosocial stressors and promote health behaviors. It may also be important to consider the use of multilevel behavioral interventions designed in the context of environmental and perceptual barriers during the COIVD-19 pandemic.","Farmer, Nicole; Wallen, Gwenyth R.; Baumer, Yvonne; Powell-Wiley, Tiffany M.",Health Equity,85,24

Objective: To describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of recipients of HT with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series from a single large academic heart transplant program in New York, New York, incorporates data from between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020. All recipients of HT followed up by this center who were infected with COVID-19 were included. Interventions: Heart transplant and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up. Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19. Results: Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years. Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%). Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation. Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL).

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide updated prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, benefitting from the inclusion of studies published in Chinese. METHODS: Systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar and the Chinese databases SinoMed, WanfangMed, CNKI and CQVIP, for studies conducted between December 2019 and August 2020 on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies published in both English and Chinese were included. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD was pooled across 65 studies involving 97,333 health care workers across 21 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression was 21.7% (95% CI, 18.3%-25.2%), of anxiety 22.1% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.3%), and of PTSD 21.5% (95% CI, 10.5%-34.9%). Prevalence estimates are also provided for a mild classification of each disorder. Pooled prevalence estimates of depression and anxiety were highest in studies conducted in the Middle-East (34.6%; 28.9%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted across covariates, including sampling method and outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has identified a high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We conducted 9 online focus groups with 30 students from a large public university to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the food choices of those displaced from their typical residences due to the pandemic. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first qualitative research to examine the changes in food choice for US university students due to COVID-19 and offer insight into why these changes occurred. Students in this study reported significant, and often negative, changes in food choices during the pandemic compared to when on campus. Many students described changes in the foods they ate, the amount consumed, and increased snacking behaviors. We found food availability and household roles to be powerful factors influencing food choices. Most students had returned to family homes with many students taking a passive role in activities that shape food choices. Parents usually purchased groceries and prepared meals with students eating foods made available to them. Increased free time contributed to boredom and snacking for some students, while for a few students with increased skills and/or agency, additional free time was used to plan and prepare meals. About a third of the students attributed eating different foods at home to food availability issues related to the pandemic such as groceries being out of stock, purchasing non-perishable foods, or the inability to get to a store. This information may be helpful to researchers and health promotion professionals interested in the effects of COVID-19 on student nutrition and related food behaviors, including those interested in the relationship between context and food choice.","Powell, Patricia K; Lawler, Sheleigh; Durham, Jo; Cullerton, Katherine",Appetite,85,16

Through analysis of 1,033 surveys and 14 in-depth interviews, we find that e-health has played a crucial role in residents' healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain external factors influence the choice of digital health, including the high risk of infection outdoors, the shutting down of transport systems, and dysfunctional healthcare facilities that neglect non-COVID-19 patients' clinical demands. Against this backdrop, we argue digital health acts as a functional equivalent to traditional medical treatment and has largely satisfied patients and users in the crisis period. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has unintentionally sped up the diffusion of digital medicine over the long term as respondents expressed their willingness to continue use of e-health in the post-COVID-19 phase. However, we assert that despite the increasing use of e-health, it cannot fully substitute traditional offline treatment.

Objectives: To describe the characteristics, outcomes, and poential associations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel. Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 58 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Laniado Hospital, Israel, between 14 March 2020 and 14 May 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected and analyzed, and the association to subsequent respiratory failure was assessed. Results: Mean age of patients was 70.7 +/- 16.9 years (53% mates, 47% females.);74% had at least one co-morbidity. Most patients were of Jewish Ashkenazi descent. During hospitalization 15 patients (mean age 78.18 +/- 10.35 years);80% male, 73% Sephardi descent developed respiratory failure with a mortality rate of 60% occurring on average 10.6 days following intubation. Laboratory tests at admission displayed a significant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK) and a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in patients who eventually developed respiratory failure (163.97 mg/L, 340.87 IU/L, 0.886 Kiwi, vs. 50.01 mg/L, 123.56 lU/L, 1.28 respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed an integrated parameter of CRP, CK, and ALC highly correlated with respiratory failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the area under the curve of CK, ALC, and the integrated parameter to be 0.910, 0.784, 0.754, and 0.913, respectively. CRP was the strongest predictor to correlate with respiratory failure. Conclusions: CRP, CK, and ALC levels on admission could Possibly be used to detect high-risk patients prone to develop respiratory failure.","Elhadad, D.; Bronstein, Y.; Yana, M.; Baris, H.; Levinger, U.; Shapiro, M.; Sharon, N.",Israel Medical Association Journal,85,1

However, the mechanism by which the intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty (COVID-19 IU) affects negative emotions in adolescents remains unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanism from COVID-19 IU to negative emotions using a moderated mediation model in adolescents. In total, 3037 teenagers completed a cross-sectional survey including measures of COVID-19 IU, risk perception, social exclusion, perceived efficacy, and negative emotions. The results showed that COVID-19 IU positively predicted negative emotions and that risk perception and social exclusion mediated this relationship. In addition, both the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions and the mediating effect of risk perception on this relationship were moderated by perceived efficacy; in particular, COVID-19 IU had a greater impact on negative emotions among adolescents with lower levels of perceived efficacy. These findings suggest that COVID-19 IU is closely associated with negative emotions among adolescents and that effective measures should be taken to enable adolescents to improve their perceived efficacy and develop a reasonable perception of risk, help them eliminate the stigma of the disease, and strengthen their connections with society.","Li, Qi; Luo, Ronglei; Zhang, Xiaoya; Meng, Guangteng; Dai, Bibing; Liu, Xun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),85,30

Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing.","Cheng, Yafang; Ma, Nan; Witt, Christian; Rapp, Steffen; Wild, Philipp S; Andreae, Meinrat O; Pöschl, Ulrich; Su, Hang",Science (Wash.),85,1

Cardiac operations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have been imperative due to their emergency nature, critical condition of patients awaiting cardiac surgery, and accumulated number of cardiac surgical interventions throughout the last months. CASE SUMMARY: Here we describe three COVID-19 positive cases who underwent coronary surgery, on an urgent basis. We did not experience worsening of the patients' clinical condition due to COVID-19 and therefore a routine post-operative chest X-ray (CXR) was not required. None of the health care providers attending the patients endured cross infection. Further trials would be needed in order to confirm these results. CONCLUSION: While the pandemic has adversely hit the health systems worldwide, cardiac surgical patients who concomitantly contracted COVID-19 may undergo a smooth post-operative course as a routine post-operative CXR may not be required.","Omar, A.

ABSTRACT Background: Heart transplant recipients do not escape SARS-CoV-2 infection, their immunocompromised status puts them at high risk for infection. The clinical severity of presentation is uncertain, its mortality in heart transplant patients has not yet been determined. Material and Methods: observational, retrospective. From March 2020 to February 2021, heart transplant recipients with qRT-PCR positivity to SARS-CoV-2-2 were gathered. The following variables were assessed: age, sex, time of transplantation at the time of infection, mortality, hospitalization, extra oxygen requirement,comorbidities, and severity of infection. Results: Eight SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were gathered, aged 53.8 ± 7.6 years. One female patient (12.5%) and 7 males (87.5%), mean transplantation time 72.8 ± 38.0 months. Mortality was 12.5%, (one patient who was hospitalized).Seven patients were treated at home;3 (37.5%) required supplemental oxygen.Comorbidities were diabetes mellitus 87.5%, arterial hypertension 87.5%, obesity: 25%, the clinical presentation was severe in 1 patient (12.5%), moderate in 2 (25%) and mild in 5 patients (62.5%). Analysis: SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart transplant recipients presents a mild to moderate clinical picture, despite the comorbidities presented. It could be that the immunosuppressant taken prior to the surgery confers a protective effect.","Zetina-Tun, Hugo J.; Careaga-Reyna, Guillermo",Cirugía Cardiovascular,85,18

Executive coaches are in a unique, confidential and professionally intimate position to observe their clients' thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Design/methodology/approach Using an interpretivist approach, interviews conducted with 26 executive coaches from the USA, UK, Australia and South Africa during the initial stages of the pandemic (first three weeks of April 2020) were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Coaches observed how the Covid-19 pandemic caused managers to experience a tension between managing their staff, their own bosses and themselves. Ranging from logistical challenges to personal fear, uncertainty and loss of identity, managers confided in and relied on their coaches to help them to reflect, provide support, but also challenge them to take a forward-looking stance. Findings were interpreted through the lenses of crisis management and coaching efficacy theory. Crisis management theory is extended by suggesting that greater priority must be given to managers' personal well-being and by adding coaching as a new intervention to develop crisis management skills. Coaching theory is extended by showing that executive coaching can foster certain crisis management skills and that the benefits of coaching in non-crisis times are also relevant during a crisis. Practical implications Managers, their leaders, executive coaches and purchasers of coaching services, such as human resource practitioners, should take note of the challenges managers face during crises. They should consider executive coaching as a support intervention to foster requisite crisis management skills. Originality/value The findings provide novel, empirical evidence suggesting that executive coaching could foster crisis management skills. The unique Covid-19 context provides rare insights into managerial thinking, emotions and behaviour during extreme crisis situations, contributing to the design of appropriate support interventions.","Terblanche, N.

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in humans leads to increased mortality rates due to alterations of significant pathways, including some resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses linked to the ""cytokine storm"" and extensive lung pathology, as well as being linked to a number of comorbidities. Our current study compared five SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different geographical regions to those from SARS, MERS and two cold viruses, OC43 and 229E, to identify the presence of miR-like sequences. We identified seven key miRs, which highlight considerable differences between the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, compared with the other viruses. The level of conservation between the five SARS-CoV-2 sequences was identical but poor compared with the other sequences, with SARS showing the highest degree of conservation. This decrease in similarity could result in reduced levels of transcriptional control, as well as a change in the physiological effect of the virus and associated host-pathogen responses. MERS and the milder symptom viruses showed greater differences and even significant sequence gaps. This divergence away from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences broadly mirrors the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the whole-genome alignments. Therefore, patterns of mutation, occurring during sequence divergence from the longer established human viruses to the more recent ones, may have led to the emergence of sequence motifs that can be related directly to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we identified 7 key-microRNAs (miRs 8066, 5197, 3611, 3934-3p, 1307-3p, 3691-3p, 1468-5p) with significant links to KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses. According to Bioproject data (PRJNA615032), SARS-CoV-2 mediated transcriptomic alterations were similar to the target pathways of the selected 7 miRs identified in our study. This mechanism could have considerable significance in determining the symptom spectrum of future potential pandemics. KEGG pathway analysis revealed a number of critical pathways linked to the seven identified miRs that may provide insight into the interplay between the virus and comorbidities. Based on our reported findings, miRNAs may constitute potential and effective therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 and its pathological consequences.","Arisan, Elif Damla; Dart, Alwyn; Grant, Guy H; Arisan, Serdar; Cuhadaroglu, Songul; Lange, Sigrun; Uysal-Onganer, Pinar",Viruses,85,24

Very little is known about the effectiveness of stepped-down physical activity (PA) programs for military service veterans. OBJECTIVE: This study will test Active Choices, a stepped-down behavioral support program designed to help Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents who are clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, transition from treatment by an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to self-managed PA. METHODS: The study is a parallel-group, randomized trial, with city-based exercise physiology or physiotherapy practices that recruit eligible Department of Veterans' Affairs clients assigned to Active Choices or a comparison program. The study aims to recruit 52 participants (26 in each group). The Active Choices program will consist of 2 face-to-face (Weeks 1, 12) and 2 telephone (Weeks 4 and 8) consultations. During these sessions, the participant and Active Choices consultant will utilize an evidence-based resource booklet to review the key benefits of an active lifestyle, build an action plan for PA preferences, set and review goals, self-monitor progress relative to set goals, and discuss strategies to overcome PA barriers. Linking participants to local PA communities to overcome social isolation will be a program priority. The comparison program will consist of 2 consultations (Weeks 1 and 12) and use fewer behavioral support strategies (education, self-monitoring, and action planning only) than Active Choices. Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, end-intervention (12 weeks), and follow-up (24 weeks) to assess changes in moderate intensity self-managed PA, psychological well-being, and social connectedness. We will also measure health service utilization and costs as well as PA choices across the intervention period. End-intervention interviews will capture participant experiences. RESULTS: Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human research activities in Australia, participant recruitment will commence when it is safe and feasible to do so. CONCLUSIONS: Findings will provide valuable pilot data to support up-scaling of the program and larger effectiveness trials with regional and rural as well as city-based Australian Defence Force veterans and their dependents.

DESIGN: Real-world prospective observational study. SETTING: VH remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (postaccident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or postinpatient admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care during VH follow-up and for 2 weeks post-VH discharge. RESULTS: 900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 postinpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced clinical deterioration (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of clinical deterioration were increase in age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 (95% CI 1.41 to 5.82)), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.04)), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30=9.09 (95% CI 2.01 to 41.09)) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.60)). CONCLUSIONS: These predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services.

COVID-19 was confirmed by a presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the respiratory specimens detected by a qualitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The study focused on the clinical course and management of our cases. RESULTS: A family cluster of four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, one of those carried an underlying kidney transplant (KT) receiving immunosuppressants. Clinical presentation and severity of our case series are variable depending on each individual immune status. By far, a KT recipient seems to develop more severity despite antiviral therapy, cessation of immunosuppressant, and aggressive intensive care support. CONCLUSION: Our case series plausibly affirmed a person-to-person transmission and potentially severe disease in the transplant population. Clinicians who are encountering with transplant recipients should be aware of possible transmission among family members.","Sakulkonkij, Parichart; Bruminhent, Jackrapong; Pankongngam, Charan; Chalermphunchai, Nipon",Immun Inflamm Dis,85,16

The pandemic has resulted in a number of recent cyberattacks on hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and its partners, and others. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify key cybersecurity challenges, solutions adapted by the health sector, and areas of improvement needed to counteract the recent increases in cyberattacks (eg, phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks), which have been used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in technology and people introduced through changes to working practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted by searching two major scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) using the search formula ""(covid OR healthcare) AND cybersecurity."" Reports, news articles, and industry white papers were also included if they were related directly to previously published works, or if they were the only available sources at the time of writing. Only articles in English published in the last decade were included (ie, 2011-2020) in order to focus on current issues, challenges, and solutions. RESULTS: We identified 9 main challenges in cybersecurity, 11 key solutions that health care organizations adapted to address these challenges, and 4 key areas that need to be strengthened in terms of cybersecurity capacity in the health sector. We also found that the most prominent and significant methods of cyberattacks that occurred during the pandemic were related to phishing, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and malware. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified the most impactful methods of cyberattacks that targeted the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges in cybersecurity, solutions, and areas in need of improvement. We provided useful insights to the health sector on cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics that may materialize in the future.","He, Ying; Aliyu, Aliyu; Evans, Mark; Luo, Cunjin",J Med Internet Res,85,28

RECENT FINDINGS: The latest expert consensus statement added a new timing indication for catheter ablation after the first episode of monomorphic VT, in patients with ischemic heart disease and an ICD. Early referral for catheter ablation reduces the number of VT recurrences; however, an impact on mortality has not been demonstrated yet. Guidelines and real-world data alike show an increasing trend to refer patients after the first VT episode in ICD patients.

Data on young to middle age adults with COVID-19 are lacking. We report the characteristics, management and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with COVID-19 aging &#8804;50 years. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in all patients &#8804;50 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted to Emergency department (ED) of San Salvatore Hospital in Pesaro from February 28th to April 8th, 2020. Data were collected from electronical medical records. HRQoL was investigated after 1 month from hospital discharge using the SF-36 questionnaire. Outcomes were evaluated between hospitalized and not hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Among 673 patients admitted to the ED and diagnosed with COVID-19, 104 (15%) were &#8804; 50 years old: 74% were discharged at home within 48 h, 26% were hospitalized. Fever occurred in 90% of the cases followed by cough (56%) and dyspnoea (34%). The most frequent coexisting conditions were hypertension (11%), thyroid dysfunction (8%) and neurological and/or mental disorders [NMDs] (6%). Mean BMI was 27. Hypokalaemia and NMDs were significantly more common in patients who underwent mechanical ventilation. Regardless of hospitalization, there was an impairment in both the physical and mental functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and hypertension are frequent conditions in young to middle age adults with COVID-19. Hypokalaemia and NMDs are commonly associated with progressive disease. A significant impact on HRQoL in the early stage of post-discharge is common in this population.","Temperoni, Chiara; Grieco, Stefania; Pasquini, Zeno; Canovari, Benedetta; Polenta, Antonio; Gnudi, Umberto; Montalti, Roberto; Barchiesi, Francesco",BMC Infect Dis,85,16

The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention 14 days after implementation. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, segmented regression analysis. INTERVENTION: A series of outbreak measures classified into four categories: case/contact management, proactive case detection, rigorous infection control practices and resource prioritization/stewardship. METHODS: A mixed-effects segmented Poisson regression model was fitted to the incidence rate of COVID-19, calculated every two days, within each facility and case type (staff vs. residents). For each facility, the outbreak time period was segmented into an early outbreak period (within 14 days intervention) and post-intervention period (after 14 days from intervention). Model outputs quantified COVID-19 incidence trend and rate changes between these two periods. A secondary model was constructed to identify effect modification by case type. RESULTS: The significant upward trend in COVID-19 incidence rate during the early outbreak period (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11, p-value<0.001) reversed during the post-intervention period (RR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.67-0.80, p-value <0.001). The average trend did not differ by case type during early outbreak (p-value>0.05) or post-intervention (p-value>0.05) periods. However, staff had a 70% larger decrease in the average rate of COVID-19 during the post-intervention period compared to residents (RR=0.30, 95% CI: 0.10- 0.88, p-value<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in LTCF.

The etiologic agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent research has revealed that virus entry takes place upon the union of the virus S surface protein with the type I transmembrane metallo-carboxypeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) identified on epithelial cells of the host respiratory tract. Virus triggers the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-&#945; and also promotes downregulation of ACE-2, which promotes a concomitant increase in levels of angiotensin II (AT-II). Both TNF-&#945; and AT-II have been implicated in promoting overexpression of tissue factor (TF) in platelets and macrophages. Additionally, the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with COVID-19 may also promote an increase in TF. TF may be a critical mediator associated with the development of thrombotic phenomena in COVID-19, and should be a target for future study.","Bautista-Vargas, Mario; Bonilla-Abadía, Fabio; Cañas, Carlos A",J Thromb Thrombolysis,85,29

AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian paediatric IBD cohort. METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, cohort investigation including 21 different Italian IBD referral centres. An electronic data collection was performed among the participating centres including: clinical characteristics of IBD patients, number of COVID-19 cases and clinical outcomes, disease management during the lockdown and the previous 9 weeks. RESULTS: 2291 children affected by IBD were enrolled. We experienced a significant reduction of the hospital admissions [604/2291 (26.3%) vs 1281/2291 (55.9%); p < 0.001]. More specifically, we observed a reduction of hospitalizations for new diagnosis (from nâ¯=â¯44 to nâ¯=â¯27) and endoscopic re-evaluations (from nâ¯=â¯46 to nâ¯=â¯8). Hospitalization for relapses and surgical procedures remained substantially unchanged. Biologic infusions did not significantly vary [393/2291 (17.1%) vs 368/2291 (16%); pâ¯=â¯0.3]. Telemedicine services for children with IBD were activated in 52.3% of the centres. In 42/2291(1.8%) children immunosuppressive therapies were adapted due to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Due to the several limitations of the lockdown, cares for children with IBD have been kept to minimal standards, giving priorities to the urgencies and to biologics' infusions and implementing telemedicine services.","Arrigo, Serena; Alvisi, Patrizia; Banzato, Claudia; Bramuzzo, Matteo; Celano, Rosaria; Civitelli, Fortunata; D039,; Arcangelo, Giulia; Dilillo, Anna; Dipasquale, Valeria; Felici, Enrico; Fuoti, Maurizio; Gatti, Simona; Knafelz, Daniela; Lionetti, Paolo; Mario, Federica; Marseglia, Antonio; Martelossi, Stefano; Moretti, Chiara; Norsa, Lorenzo; Panceri, Roberto; Renzo, Sara; Romano, Claudio; Romeo, Erminia; Strisciuglio, Caterina; Martinelli, Massimo",Dig. liver dis,85,16

The papers represent a diverse array of populations under the umbrella of men's health and a range of strategies to improve men's health from tobacco cessation to microfinance. The collection features a range of alternative masculinities that emerge from original research by the contributors that are used in novel ways in the interventions.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), one of the causative agents of respiratory viral infections, is the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children and adults. METHODS: Respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal swab, throat swab, etc.), which were sent to the Department of laboratory medicine from January 2012 to December 2018 for detection of respiratory viruses via real time reverse transcription PCR (Real time RT-PCR) were used in this study. RSV detected by real-time RT-PCR were analyzed on the basis of co-infection, sex and age of the patients, and year and month of sample collection. RESULTS: During the study period, we observed that the RSV detection rate was 12.8% (n = 1150/9010); the detection rate of RSV-A (7.1%) was higher than that of RSV-B (5.8%). The detection rate of RSV was the highest at 36.5% in December, and RSV-A and RSV-B were in vogue every year. Co-infection rate of RSVs was the highest in the patients over 80 years of age; RSVs showed the highest Co-infection with Rhinoviruses. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, prevalence was different among the two subtypes of RSV, and the average age of RSV-B-positive patients was higher than that of RSV-A. Co-infection rate tended to increase every year. RSVs cause mild as well as severe infections. There are reports of serious clinical progress as RSVs cause overlapping infections with other viruses and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Thus, further research on RSV should be done.","Kim, Ga-Yeon; Rheem, Insoo; Joung, You Hyun; Kim, Jae Kyung",Respir Res,85,1

The socio-demographic, geo-functional and clinical characteristics of all patients were collected; a numeric verbal scale (NVS) (where 0=very dissatisfied to 10=fully satisfied) was applied to assess the degree of satisfaction of the doctor/patient with the RTC. RESULTS: 469 TC were included. Most patients seen by RTC were women, mean age: 60,83 years. Only 16% had university education. The mean distance travelled for face-to face consultation is 33 Km with a mean total time of 2hours. Most individuals were diagnosed with osteoarthritis/soft tissue rheumatic diseases and/or osteoporosis; 21% had rheumatoid arthritis. The mean length of the TC was 9.64minutes. We find more patient satisfaction with the TC when their level of education is higher (OR=4.12); doctor satisfaction was higher when the individual was better able to manage the Internet (OR=3.01). CONCLUSION: It is possible to transfer rheumatological care activity to TC with a considerable degree of satisfaction for both the patient and the doctor.","Tornero-Molina, Jesús; Sánchez-Alonso, Fernando; Fernández-Prada, Manuel; Bris-Ochaita, María-Luisa; Sifuentes-Giraldo, Alberto; Vidal-Fuentes, Javier",Reumatol. clin.

METHODS: Clinical data on COVID-19 inpatients in Zengdu Hospital from January 27 to March 11, 2020 were collected; this is a community hospital in an area surrounding Wuhan and supported by volunteer doctors. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The epidemiological findings, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiologic manifestations, and clinical outcomes of these patients were analyzed. The patients were followed up for clinical outcomes until March 22, 2020. Severe COVID-19 cases include severe and critical cases diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China's COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. Severe and critical COVID-19 cases were diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China's COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. RESULTS: All hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 276 (median age: 51.0 years), were enrolled, including 262 non-severe and 14 severe patients. The proportion of patients aged over 60 years was higher in the severe group (78.6%) than in the non-severe group (18.7%, p < 0.01). Approximately a quarter of the patients (24.6%) had at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes, or cancer, and the proportion of patients with comorbidities was higher in the severe group (85.7%) than in the non-severe group (21.4%, p < 0.01). Common symptoms included fever (82.2% [227/276]) and cough (78.0% [218/276]). 38.4% (106/276) of the patients had a fever at the time of admission. Most patients (94.9% [204/276]) were cured and discharged; 3.6% (10/276) deteriorated to a critical condition and were transferred to another hospital. The median COVID-19 treatment duration and hospital stay were 14.0 and 18.0 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the COVID-19 patients in Zengdu had mild disease. Older patients with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of progression to severe disease. The length of hospital-stay and antiviral treatment duration for COVID-19 were slightly longer than those in Wuhan. This work will contribute toward an understanding of COVID-19 characteristics in the areas around the core COVID-19 outbreak region and serve as a reference for decision-making for epidemic prevention and control in similar areas.","Wei, Yiping; Zeng, Weibiao; Huang, Xiangyun; Li, Junyu; Qiu, Xingting; Li, Huadong; Liu, Dinghua; He, Zhaofeng; Yao, Wenzhong; Huang, Ping; Li, Chao; Zhu, Min; Zhong, Chunlan; Zhu, Xingen; Liu, Jiansheng",BMC Infect Dis,85,10

Our study was designed to determine the effect of metformin on the cell autophagy and autophagic flux via the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: MHCC97H and HepG2 cell lines were cultured and treated without and with metformin at various concentrations (2, 5, 10 and 20 mM) for 48 h. Then, 10 mM was determined as the optimal concentration and the HCC cells were treated with metformin for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. MTT assay was used to assess the cell viability and Western blotting was used to determine the expression of proteins (LC3-II, p62, phospho-AMPK&#945;, phospho-mTOR, mTOR, phospho-p70 S6 Kinase, p70 S6 Kinase, PARP1, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3). Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, EGFP-LC3 and mCherry-GFP-LC3B plasmid transfection were used for further study. Results: Metformin inhibited significantly the viability of MHCC97H and HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. For the apoptotic properties, activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage were not observed after treatment with metformin. MHCC97H cells were transfected with a EGFP-LC3 plasmid and treatment with metformin could lead to the increased level of LC3-II and decreased level of p62. In metformin-induced autophagy, AMPK expression was activated, and the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70 S6 Kinase were inhibited. Metformin treatment and mCherry-GFP-LC3B plasmid transfection showed that metformin could induce the autophagic flux. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) partly abolished this effect. Conclusion: Metformin could induce the autophagy, autophagic flux, and activate the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway in human HCC cells.","Gao, Chun; Fang, Long; Zhang, Hui; Zhang, Wei-Shuo; Li, Xiao-Ou; Du, Shi-Yu",Cancer Manag Res,85,5

The participants of the 2020 survey had significantly less sleepiness during classes and longer internet use times compared with those of the previous surveys. In the 2020 survey, the rate of problematic internet use (Young’s Diagnostic Questionnaire score, ≥5) was not significantly different from the results of previous surveys. The COVID-19 pandemic might have strongly influenced the sleepiness experienced by students in classes and increased the time spent using the internet since the summer of 2020.

These changes may be related to the number of new COVID-19 cases per day since they are visual indicators of the changes in the epidemic and are of interest to the public. This descriptive research took the spine surgery department as an example in a Grade-A tertiary hospital in Anhui province, China. The number and distribution of patients from January 24 to April 2, 2020 was collected and compared with the past 5 years. A psychological scale was constructed to assess the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day in Anhui, China was collected each day from January 24 to April 2, 2020. Also, this research compared these variables with the emergency response or the number of new COVID-19 cases per day. All distributions dropped dramatically during first-level emergency response and then back to normal. The psychological distress of patients was relatively higher at the beginning of the outbreak and then gradually returned to normal. The trends between the psychological distress of patients and the number of new COVID-19 cases per day were similar. The number of new COVID-19 cases per day could be used to predict psychological distress, changes in patient numbers and distributions, which was beneficial for the department of spine surgery to adjust its treatment strategy during the epidemic.","Zheng, Yongshun; Zhang, Xingfang; Fang, Shiyuan; Zhang, Fan",Sci Prog,85,20

As there is a lack of targeted therapeutics, there is certain opportunity for the scientific community to develop new drugs or vaccines against COVID-19 and so many synthetic bioactive compounds are undergoing clinical trials. In most of the countries, due to the broad therapeutic spectrum and minimal side effects, medicinal plants have been used widely throughout history as traditional healing remedy. Because of the unavailability of synthetic bioactive antiviral drugs, hence all possible efforts have been focused on the search for new drugs and alternative medicines from different herbal formulations. In recent times, it has been assured that the Mpro, also called 3CLpro, is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease enzyme responsible for viral reproduction and thereby impeding the host's immune response. As such, Mpro represents a highly specified target for drugs capable of inhibitory action against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As there continue to be no clear options for the treatment of COVID-19, the identification of potential candidates has become a necessity. The present investigation focuses on the in silico pharmacological activity of Calotropis gigantea, a large shrub, as a potential option for COVID-19 Mpro inhibition and includes an ADME/T profile analysis of that ligand. For this study, with the help of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of C. gigantea methanolic leaf extract, a total of 30 bioactive compounds were selected.

Maintaining people's functional capacity as they grow older is essential to provide quality of life for the years they have gained, acting on factors that are modifiable and therefore subject to intervention, such as frailty. This is why it was one of the prioritised interventions in the Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy of the Spanish NHS, which began in 2013. In the collective effort to meet the challenge of addressing frailty, the Autonomous Communities and Cities (AACC) have played a key role in implementing actions on the prevention of frailty and falls in the elderly. The 2019 evaluation of the 3 Consensus document on frailty and falls prevention among the elderly showed very positive data, with high or very high implementation in the AACC. The COVID-19 pandemic has also conditioned the approach to frailty. Frailty has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of illness and death, while COVID-19 has been shown to be a frailty generator. To facilitate the care of the elderly and the approach to frailty, the Ministry of Health, within the EPSP Frailty and Falls Working Group, developed the document of Recommendations for the approach to frailty in the health crisis situation generated by the COVID-19. The future of the approach to frailty in the EPSP is set out in the Roadmap for Addressing Frailty, developed in the framework of the EPSP and the ADVANTAGE Joint Action, which aims to contribute to making frailty a public health priority and to promote its approach at population and individual level, including prevention, early population detection and surveillance/monitoring, from an integrated and coordinated model of care, without forgetting the strengthening of training and research. In the current situation of tension in the socio-health system, which has manifested itself since the COVID-19 crisis, it is necessary to articulate how to continue to provide quality care, not only for the acute situation, but also for other situations such as frailty, care for chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes and physical, mental and social needs. A disability-free life expectancy must be based on the promotion of active and healthy ageing to ensure that older people maintain maximum functional capacity. To this end, it is essential to assess and prevent or reverse frailty, avoiding progression to disability and further overburdening of the system, individuals, families and society as a whole.","Pola Ferrández, E.; Justo Gil, S.; Zuza Santacilia, I.; Gil Tarragato, S.; Campos Esteban, P.",Rev Esp Salud Publica,85,17

In this commentary, we first describe company proposals, based on available public information, for the (frozen) storage of mRNA vaccine drug products across the vaccine supply chain. We then review the literature on the pharmaceutical stability of mRNA vaccine candidates, including attempts to improve their stability, analytical techniques to monitor their stability, and regulatory guidelines covering product characterization and storage stability. We conclude that systematic approaches to identify the key physicochemical degradation mechanism(s) of formulated mRNA vaccine candidates are currently lacking. Rational design of optimally stabilized mRNA vaccine formulations during storage, transport, and administration at refrigerated or ambient temperatures should thus have top priority in the pharmaceutical development community. In addition to evidence of human immunogenicity against multiple viral pathogens, including compelling efficacy results against COVID-19, another key strength of the mRNA vaccine approach is that it is readily adaptable to rapidly address future outbreaks of new emerging infectious diseases. Consequently, we should not wait for the next pandemic to address and solve the challenges associated with the stability and storage of formulated mRNA vaccines.","Crommelin, Daan J A; Anchordoquy, Thomas J; Volkin, David B; Jiskoot, Wim; Mastrobattista, Enrico",J. pharm. sci,85,24

This type of sampling is uncomfortable for the patient, dangerous for health workers, and its high demand has led to a global shortage of swabs. One of the alternative specimens is saliva. However, the optimal conditions for the test have not been established. Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the viral genome in saliva samples kept at room temperature, in the fridge or frozen for 2 days. In addition, the influence of brushing teeth and feeding on the detection of the virus in saliva was addressed. Finally, the efficiency of saliva in revealing the presence of the virus during the hospitalization period was determined in children. Results: The viral genome was consistently detected regardless of the storage conditions of saliva samples. Brushing teeth and feeding did not influence the sensitivity of the test. In hospitalized children, positive results were obtained only during the early days. Conclusions: These results support the idea of the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The viral genome is stable and endures perturbations in the oral cavity. However, clearance of the virus from the mouth during the infection may limit the use of the test only to the early stages of the disease.","López-Martínez, Briceida; Guzmán-Ortiz, Ana L; Nevárez-Ramírez, Abraham J; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Olivar-López, Víctor B; Ángeles-Floriano, Tania; Vilchis-Ordoñez, Armando; Quezada, Héctor",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,85,20

Teaching surgical skills has historically been a hands-on activity, with instructors and learners in close physical proximity. This paradigm was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring innovative solutions to surmount the challenges of teaching surgical skills remotely. In this work, we describe our institution's path and early results of developing an interactive remote surgical skills course for medical students in the surgical clerkship. Methods. 31 third-year medical students were distributed a set of surgical equipment and 3D printed phone dock. Each participant completed a baseline questionnaire and underwent 3 structured interactive remote sessions on surgical instruments, knot tying, and suturing techniques. Students were instructed on sharing their first-person viewpoint and received real-time feedback on their knot tying and suturing techniques from the course instructor. Pre- and post-session surveys were conducted and analyzed. Results. All students were able to complete the remote surgical skills course successfully, as defined by visually demonstrating successful two-handed knot and simple suture techniques. Students' aggregate confidence score in their knot tying ability (pretest mean 7.9, SD 0.7 vs posttest mean 9.7, SD 0.9, t-statistic -2.3, P = .03) and suturing ability (pretest mean 8.0, SD 1.3 vs posttest mean 13.8, SD 0.9 t-statistic -5.5, P < .001) significantly improved after the intervention. Qualitative feedback from the students underscored the utility of the first-person perspective for teaching surgical technique. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that remote teaching of knot tying and simple suturing to medical students can be effectively implemented using a remote learning curriculum that was well received by the learners.","Quaranto, Brian R; Lamb, Michael; Traversone, John; Hu, Jinwei; Lukan, James; Cooper, Clairice; Schwaitzberg, Steven",Surg Innov,85,16

The medical workforce has dealt with this outbreak with varying strategies and adaptations, which are relevant to its field and to the region. As one of the 'hotspots' in the UK , the surgical branch of trauma and orthopaedics need strategies to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of COVID-19. Methods: Adapting to the crisis locally involved five operational elements: 1) triaging and workflow of orthopaedic patients; 2) operation theatre feasibility and functioning; 3) conservation of human resources and management of workforce in the department; 4) speciality training and progression; and 5) developing an exit strategy to resume elective work. Two hospitals under our trust were redesignated based on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Registrar/consultant led telehealth reviews were carried out for early postoperative patients. Workflows for the management of outpatient care and inpatient care were created. We looked into the development of a dedicated operating space to perform the emergency orthopaedic surgeries without symptoms of COVID-19. Between March 23 and April 23, 2020, we have surgically treated 133 patients across both our hospitals in our trust. This mainly included hip fractures and fractures/infection affecting the hand. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is not the first disease outbreak affecting the UK, nor will it be the last. The current crisis has necessitated rapid development of new hospital guidelines and early adaptive strategies in our services. Protocols and directives need to be formalized keeping in mind that COVID-19 will have a long and protracted course until a definitive cure is discovered.","Mathai, Naveen J; Venkatesan, Aakaash Sethuraman; Key, Thomas; Wilson, Christopher; Mohanty, Khitish",Bone Jt Open,85,16

Transactional planners heavily negotiate the provisions that govern the behavior of the parties during this window, not only to allocate risk between the buyer and seller, but also to manage moral hazard, opportunistic behavior, and other distortions in incentives. Prior literature, both academic and practitioner, has focused virtually exclusively on the material adverse effect (MAE) clause. COVID-19, however, has exposed an important connection between the MAE clause and the obligation for the seller to act “in the ordinary course of business” between signing and closing. This Article is the first to examine the interaction between the MAE clause and the ordinary course covenant in M&A deals. We construct a new database of 1,300 M&A transactions along with their MAE and ordinary course covenants—by far the most comprehensive, accurate, and detailed database of such deal terms that currently exists. We document how these deal terms currently appear in M&A transactions, including the sharp rise in “pandemic” carveouts from the MAE clause since the COVID-19 pandemic began. We then provide implications for corporate boards, the Delaware courts, and transactional planners.

In a theory of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, pangolins are considered as a potential intermediate host. To assemble the genome of suspicious coronavirus (CoV) found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 was used as a reference in most of the previous studies, implicitly assuming the pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the closest neighbors in evolution. However, this assumption may not be true. We investigated how the choice of reference genome affected the resulting CoV genome assembly. We explored various representative CoVs as the reference genome, and found significant differences in the resulting assemblies. The assembly obtained using RaTG13 as a reference showed better statistics in total length, N50, and pairwise distance reconstruction (PDR) scores than the assembly guided by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that RaTG13 may be a better reference. Therefore, RaTG13 should also be considered as a reference for assembling suspicious CoV found in pangolins and other potential intermediate hosts.","Liu, Yuan; Yan, Changhui",J Bioinform Comput Biol,85,6

Since his first expedition to the West Indies in 1957, Richard's vast field experience (including three trips to Peru between 1968 and 1974), impressive collecting skills, and remarkable ability to detect phenotypic variation among natural populations have resulted in the description of more than 70 species of snakes (24 typhlopids, 4 leptotyphlopids), lizards, and frogs in 16 genera and 11 taxonomic families. Richard joined the faculty of the Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, in 1976 and ever since his efforts significantly advanced organismal biology research at the institution. Although primarily a systematist, his desire to understand multiple aspects of an organism's biology and contagious passion for becoming intimately familiar with animals in their natural environments provided his students the opportunity to conduct research in fields such as behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Richard's mentoring fostered the scientific interests of his graduate students, who were exposed first-hand to every aspect of research, an invaluable experience that served as a springboard for the development of their professional careers inside and outside academia.

The main challenge is to identify the patient's motor intention based on large training datasets with noise contamination in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. NEW METHOD: To address this problem, this paper proposed a self-adaptively denoised Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)-based motor intention recognition algorithm (DeERD) in order to enable BMI training with a small sample of calibration data. This study recruited 8 stroke patients. Each patient was required to execute paralyzed upper-limb motor attempt for 20 trials and remain in resting state for 20 trials randomly. ERD-based motor intention recognition algorithm, Common spatial filter algorithm (CSP) and Directed Transfer Function analysis (DTF) were used to extract features for classification respectively and compared with the proposed DeERD analysis. RESULTS: DeERD can filter the noise and extract the average lines as the principal trends. With denoising processing, Accuracy (ACC) was up to 70% for all 8 patients and they could be included in this BMI system effectively. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed DeERD model generated statistically significant increase in True Positive Rate (TPR) and in ACC than the DTF model. TPR and ACC standard deviation of DeERD was smaller than that of CSP. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DeERD model can eliminate the principal noise and extract the principal trend of the time-frequency analysis. It provides a practical method to recruit more stroke patients into BMI training with fewer calibration trainings.","Jia, Tianyu; Liu, Ke; Qian, Chao; Li, Chong; Ji, Linhong",J Neurosci Methods,85,27

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020 is testing economic resilience and surge capacity of healthcare providers worldwide. At the time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: (1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes. (2) Rapid time to result of <24 h is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures.Hypothesis. Extraction-free sample processing would impact commercially available SARS-CoV-2 genome detection methods.Aim. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS).Methodology. We tested several detection methods and tested whether detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits.Results. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to the Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript one-step Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) mix and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-accredited N1 and N2 primer/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259).Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat-inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply-chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","Thompson, Jamie L; Downie Ruiz Velasco, Angela; Cardall, Alice; Tarbox, Rebecca; Richardson, Jaineeta; Clarke, Gemma; Lister, Michelle; Howson-Wells, Hannah C; Fleming, Vicki M; Khakh, Manjinder; Sloan, Tim; Duckworth, Nichola; Walsh, Sarah; Denning, Chris; McClure, C Patrick; Benest, Andrew V; Seedhouse, Claire H",J. medical microbiol,85,24

DESIGN: This is a modelling study combining estimates of real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from tiers. SETTING: The UK at lower tier local authority (LTLA) level. 310 LTLAs were included in the analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt . RESULTS: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) 2 weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3, respectively, reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 288 LTLAs (93%) would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 90 (29%) did so in reality. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.","Laydon, Daniel J; Mishra, Swapnil; Hinsley, Wes R; Samartsidis, Pantelis; Flaxman, Seth; Gandy, Axel; Ferguson, Neil M; Bhatt, Samir",BMJ Open,85,26

Progression to cardiogenic shock has been rarely described, especially in healthy young patients. The underlying mechanisms are to date controversial. A previously healthy 18-year-old female teenager affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) developed fulminant cardiogenic shock requiring a prompt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Cardiac involvement was predominant compared with the pulmonary one. Myocardial biopsies were performed; and in order to clarify the pathophysiology of the acute heart failure, optical and transmission electron microscopy study was realized. Two additional immunohistology techniques were developed in order to (i) detect a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant fusion nucleoprotein by using a specific antibody and (ii) study fractalkine expression induced by activated endothelium because this molecule is well known to be elevated in patients with severe cytokine release syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 genome was not detected in the myocardium. Even if the clinical presentation, laboratory markers, and cardiac imaging techniques strongly suggested fulminant myocarditis, histology and immunohistology were not fully consistent with this diagnosis according to the Dallas criteria. Although rare suspected coronavirus particles were found by transmission electron microscopy in the cardiac endothelium, neither significant immunoreactivity for the viral nucleocapsid protein nor image suggestive of endotheliitis was detected. Intense endothelial immunoreactivity pattern for fractalkine expression was observed. From a clinical point of view, the left ventricular systolic function gradually improved, and the patient survived after a long stay in the intensive care unit. Our observations suggest that a massive cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection was the main cause of the cardiogenic shock, making a direct viral injury pathway very unlikely.","Garau, Giovanni; Joachim, Sabrina; Duliere, Guy-Loup; Melissopoulou, Maria; Boccar, Sandrine; Fraipont, Vincent; Dugauquier, Christophe; Troisfontaines, Pierre; Hougrand, Olivier; Delvenne, Philippe; Hoffer, Etienne",ESC Heart Fail,85,24

This visual essay takes up Lyman Chaffee’s notion that graffiti can constitute an alternative media system that offers a glimpse into emerging and evolving political discourses. Using ‘walking-as-method’ in a north London neighbourhood, it surveys the array of political graffiti produced in the context of the UK’s first wave of Covid-19 and accompanying period of lockdown. In so doing, it presents a visual chronology of shifting popular opinion on the British state’s handling of the pandemic and illuminates the ways that the politics of pandemic management has intersected with other national and local concerns, from the resourcing of public services to the Black Lives Matter campaign.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their association with study-relevant problems, and the moderating effect of parent-child relationship among Chinese adolescents during the school closures. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data collected in middle and high schools in Taizhou, China. Students completed an online survey between April 16 and May 14, 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory. Three types of study problems were recorded, including having difficulty in studying at home, dislike of remote learning, and excessive screen entertainment time. Parental relationships were categorized into good or normal relationship and poor relationship. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between study-relevant problems and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Using data from 6435 adolescents, we found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 17.7%. All the study problem measures were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. There was a moderating effect of the parental relationship on the associations between study problems and depressive symptoms. The association between number of study problems and depressive symptoms was stronger in adolescents with a poor parent-child relationship (regression coefficient 4.34 [95% CI 2.97, 5.72]) than those with a good or normal relationship (2.55 [2.35, 2.75]), p for interaction 0.002, on multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Study problems due to school closures were particularly problematic for adolescents who had poor parent-child relationships. Public health initiatives could help students to adjust study habits and improve parent-child relationships, thereby protecting against the development of depression.","Wang, Jingyi; Wang, Hao; Lin, Haijiang; Richards, Marcus; Yang, Shuyue; Liang, Hongbiao; Chen, Xiaoxiao; Fu, Chaowei",Global Health,85,20

Amongst various plausible factors, impairment in immune functions is emerging as a critical regulator of known age-associated accumulation of SC. Immune cells dysfunctions with age are multi-faceted and are uniquely attributed to the independent processes of immunosenescence and cellular senescence which may collectively impair immune system mediated clearance of SC. Moreover, being functionally and phenotypically heterogenic, immune cells are also liable to be affected by senescence microenvironment in other tissues. Therefore, strategies aimed at improving immunosenescence and cellular senescence in immune cells can have pleiotropic effects on ageing physiology including the accumulation of SC. In this regard, nutraceutical's immunomodulatory attributes are well documented which may have implications in developing nutrition-oriented immunotherapeutic approaches against SC. In particular, the three diverse sources of bioactive ingredients, viz., phytochemicals, probiotic bacteria and omega-3-fatty acids have shown promising anti-immunosenescence and anti-cellular senescence potential in immune cells influencing aging and immunity in ways beyond modest stimulation of immune responses. The present narrative review describes the preventive and therapeutic attributes of phytochemicals such as polyphenols, probiotic microbes and omega-3-fatty acids in influencing the emerging nexus of immunosenescence, cellular senescence and SC during aging. Outstanding questions and nutraceuticals-based pro-longevity and niche research areas have been deliberated. Further research using integrative approaches is recommended for developing nutrition-based holistic immunotherapeutic strategies for 'healthy ageing'.","Sharma, Rohit; Padwad, Yogendra",Ageing Res Rev,85,26

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who had undergone elective thoracic surgery from 12 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 and were symptomatic or tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection within 14 days after surgery, with a focus on their complications and potential deaths. RESULTS: Out of 101 surgical procedures, including 57 primary oncological resections, 6 lung transplants and 18 emergency procedures, only 5 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were identified, 3 in the immediate postoperative period and 2 as outpatients. All 5 patients had cancer; the median age was 64 years. The main virus-related symptom was fever (80%), and the median onset of coronavirus disease 2019 was 3 days. Although 80% of the patients who had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 required in-hospital care, none of them were considered severe or critical and none died.

However, its impact on stress and subsequent professional pathways is not well understood. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental well-being, training, and career choices of Canadian medical clerks within the first three months of the pandemic. It also aims to assess their use of university support systems and their appreciation of potential solutions to common academic stressors. METHODS: An electronic survey composed of four sections: demographics, stressors experienced during the pandemic, World Health Organization (WHO) well-being index, and stress management and resources was distributed to Canadian clerks. RESULTS: Clerks from 10 of the 17 Canadian medical faculties participated in this study (n = 627). Forty-five percent of clerks reported higher levels of stress than usual; 22% reconsidered their residency choice; and 19% reconsidered medicine as a career. The factors that were most stressful among clerks were: the means of return to rotations; decreased opportunities to be productive in view of residency match; and taking the national licensing exam after the beginning of residency. The mean WHO well-being index was 14.8/25 ± 4.5, indicating a poor level of well-being among a considerable proportion of students. Clerks who reconsidered their residency choice or medicine as a career had lower mean WHO well-being indices. Most clerks agreed with the following suggested solutions: training sessions on the clinical management of COVID-19 cases; being allowed to submit fewer reference letters when applying to residency; and having protected time to study for their licensing exam during residency. Overall, clerks were less concerned with being infected during their rotations than with the impact of the pandemic on their future career and residency match. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a considerable impact on the medical curriculum and well-being of clerks. A number of student-identified solutions were proposed to reduce stress. The implementation of these solutions throughout the Canadian medical training system should be considered.","Abbas, Myriam; Dhane, Malek; Beniey, Michèle; Meloche-Dumas, Léamarie; Eissa, Mohamed; Guérard-Poirier, Natasha; El-Raheb, Myriam; Lebel-Guay, Florence; Dubrowski, Adam; Patocskai, Erica",BMC Med Educ,85,1

The increase in the number of confirmed and suspected cases, followed by an increase in workload, a limitation of personal protection equipment, a lack of effective treatment, and inadequate emotional support may contribute to the work intention during a pandemic. Purpose: This study aimed to describe nurses' intention to work and provide care when people may be at risk of the COVID-19 and examine its relating factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional and survey-based study that collected the respondents' characteristics and the intention to work measurements from 238 nurses in 36 hospitals in West Sumatera, Indonesia. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, T-tests, and ANOVA. Results: The mean and standard deviation scores of nurses' intention to work during the COVID-19 outbreak were 42.49±5.92. The isolation experience, the presence of authorized beds for COVID-19, and sufficient protection equipment supply, were correlated to the intention to work (p=0.016, p=0.035, p=0.000). Nurse respondents expected that hospital managers should provide more attention to nurses who agreed to attend to work during the COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusion: Nurses showed preserved intention to work during the COVID-19 outbreak. The factors correlated with intention to work were isolation experience, the presence of authorized beds for COVID-19, and protection equipment supply. The government and hospital management should ensure strategies and regulations to provide adequate hospital protective equipment supplies. They should also support compensations to nurses who actively care for patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021, NMJN.","Mailani, F.; Huriani, E.; Muthia, R.; Sarfika, R.",Nurse Media Journal of Nursing,85,24

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as a key cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested to be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial infection stage. Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 expression is highly enriched in nasal epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of respiratory tract as the primary target site of SARS-CoV-2. The expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells is tightly regulated by inflammatory milieu and environmental and internal stimuli. Very recently, ACE2 has been reported to have different expression levels in airways under distinct chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergic asthma, which may associate with the COVID-19 risk and affect the management of primary airway diseases. In this review, we focus on the cutting-edge progress in distribution, expression, and regulation of ACE2 in respiratory system in physiological and pathological conditions, and their implication for the development of COVID-19. We also discuss the management of airway diseases, including asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis in the era of COVID-19.","Yao, Yin; Wang, Hai; Liu, Zheng",Clin. exp. allergy,85,20

The purpose of this study is to gauge the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on head and neck oncology and reconstructive surgery (HNORS) practice and evaluate their practice patterns especially ones that might be impacted by COVID-19 and compare them to the current literature. METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS: We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an intensive care unit postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had a small impact on the surgical treatment of patients with head and neck oncology. Most HNORS surgeons are practicing in accordance with recently published literature.","Zaid, Waleed; Schlieve, Thomas",J. oral maxillofac. surg,85,25

This work reports the short-term effects on air quality of such unprecedented paralysis of industry and transport in different continental cities in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the virus and with the hardest confinement measures. The study takes into account sites with different sizes and diverse emission sources, such as traffic, residential or industrial emissions. This work reports new field measurement data for the studied pandemic period and assesses the air quality parameters within the historic trend of each pollutant and site. Thus, 2013-2020 data series from ground-air quality monitoring networks have been analysed to find out statistically significant changes in atmospheric pollutants during March-June 2020 due to this sudden paralysis of activity. The results show substantial concentration drops of primary pollutants, including NOx, CO, BTX, NMHC and NH3. Particulate matter changes were smaller due to the existence of other natural sources. During the lockdown the ozone patterns were different for each studied location, depending on the VOCs-NOx ratios, with concentration changes close to those expected from the historical series in each site and not statistically attributable to the health crisis effects. Finally, the gradual de-escalation and progressive increase of traffic density within cities reflects a slow recovery of primary pollutants. The results and conclusions for these cities, with different sizes and population, and specific emission sources, may serve as a behavioural model for other continental sites and help understand future crises.","Viteri, G; Díaz de Mera, Y; Rodríguez, A; Rodríguez, D; Tajuelo, M; Escalona, A; Aranda, A",Chemosphere,85,1

While numbers of new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls are rising at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and the measures taken to counteract it could cause an increase in distress among the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence on the calls made to Samaritans Ireland, a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41,648, callers=3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the government of the Republic of Ireland (calls=46,043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences between the duration of calls in the two periods at a global level and at an hourly level. We performed k-means clustering to determine the types of callers who used the helpline based on their helpline call usage behavior and to assess the impact of the pandemic on the caller type usage patterns. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Turkington, Robin; Mulvenna, Maurice; Bond, Raymond; Ennis, Edel; Potts, Courtney; Moore, Ciaran; Hamra, Louise; Morrissey, Jacqui; Isaksen, Mette; Scowcroft, Elizabeth; O039,; Neill, Siobhan",JMIR Ment Health,85,8

Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected. The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years. They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections; looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales; and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a red flag that shows the need to upgrade mental health programmes in universities and to validate virtual instruments.","García-Espinosa, Patricio; Ortiz-Jiménez, Xóchitl; Botello-Hernández, Edgar; Aguayo-Samaniego, Rebeca; Leija-Herrera, Jorge; Góngora-Rivera, Fernando",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,85,16

The staggering mortality rates among African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed how recalcitrant structural inequities can exacerbate disparities and render not just individuals but whole communities acutely vulnerable. While medical curricula that educate students about disparities are vital in rousing awareness, it is experience that is most likely to instill passion for change. The authors first consider the roots of health care disparities in relation to the current pandemic. Then they examine the importance of salient learning experiences that may inspire a commitment to championing social justice. Experiences in diverse communities can imbue medical students with a desire for lifelong learning and advocacy. The authors introduce a three-pillar framework that consists of trust building, structural competency, and cultural humility. They discuss how these pillars should underpin educational efforts to improve social determinants of health. Effecting systemic change requires passion and resolve; therefore, perseverance in such efforts is predicated on learners caring about the structural inequities in housing, education, economic stability, and neighborhoods-all of which influence the health of individuals and communities.","Prince, Andrew D P; Green, Alexander R; Brown, David J; Thompson, Dana M; Neblett, Enrique W; Nathan, Cherie-Ann; Carethers, John M; Gee, Rebekah E; Gruppen, Larry D; Mangrulkar, Rajesh S; Brenner, Michael J",Acad. med,85,13

There are several efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Among those efforts, cleaning and disinfecting public areas have become important tasks. In order to contribute in this direction, this paper proposes a coverage path planning algorithm for a spraying drone, a micro aerial vehicle that has mounted a sprayer/sprinkler system, to disinfect areas. In contrast with planners in the state-of-the-art, this proposal presents i) a new sprayer/sprinkler model that fits a more realistic coverage volume to the drop dispersion and ii) a planning algorithm that efficiently restricts the flight to the region of interest avoiding potential collisions in bounded scenes. The drone with the algorithm has been tested in several simulation scenes, showing that the algorithm is effective and covers more areas with respect to other approaches in the literature. Note that the proposal is not limited to disinfection applications, but can be applied to other ones, such as painting or precision agriculture.","Vazquez-Carmona, E. Viridiana; Vasquez-Gomez, J.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the 8-week lockdown on endurance capacity of elite male handball players. METHODS: Ten male athletes (192±8 cm and 96±6 kg) from the first German handball league participated in the study. The effects of training on shuttle run tests between period 1 (P1: preseason to mid-season) and period 2 (P2: mid-season to time after lockdown) were compared. The maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was assessed using an incremental exercise test (IET) (July 2019 and May 2020). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, the athletes completed an instructed home-based strength and endurance program (52/48). The training effects were found to be reduced after the 8-weeks of COVID-19 lockdown (period 2) as compared to period 1 (mean difference 249±248 m, p=0.005). There was no significant difference in the running distance (2358±430 m vs. 2400±362 m, respectively, p=0.70) after the lockdown as compared to the pre-seasonal performance. VO2max (46.6±5.1 vs. 49.4±7.0 ml/kg/min, respectively, p=0.12) and the power output (3.13±0.36 vs. 3.13±0.43 W/kg, respectively, p=1.0) also did not differ between preseason and after COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown led to a reduction in endurance capacity of elite handball players without team training, despite a home-based strength and endurance program. Supervision of individual home-based training is highly recommended to avoid inadequate implementation of the training.","Fikenzer, Sven; Fikenzer, Kati; Laufs, Ulrich; Falz, Roberto; Pietrek, Hagen; Hepp, Pierre",J. sports med. phys. fit,85,20

We estimate count data specifications of observed COVID-19 infections at the state level as a function of control demographic variables, and a measure of social distance that captures the amount of time individuals across the states spend in activities that potentially expose them to crowds. Parameter estimates reveal that the number of state-level novel coronavirus infections decrease with respect to our measure of individual social distance. From a practical perspective, our parameter estimates suggest that if the typical individual in a U.S. state were to spend eight hours away from crowds completely, this would translate into approximately 240,000 fewer COVID-19 infections across the states. Our results suggest that, at least in the United States, social distancing policies are effective in slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus.","Price, Gregory; van Holm, Eric",Social science quarterly,85,1

Among the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the disease that results from SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, a prominent feature is a pro-thrombotic derangement of the hemostatic system, possibly representing a peculiar clinicopathologic manifestation of viral sepsis. The severity of the derangement of coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients has been associated with a poor prognosis, and the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at doses registered for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization and by Several Scientific societies. However, some relevant issues on the relationships between COVID-19, coagulopathy and VTE have yet to be fully elucidated. This review is particularly focused on four clinical questions: What is the incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients? How do we frame the COVID-19 associated coagulopathy? Which role, if any, do antiphospolipid antibodies have? How do we tackle COVID-19 coagulopathy? In the complex scenario of an overwhelming pandemic, most everyday clinical decisions have to be taken without delay, although not yet supported by a sound scientific evidence. This review discusses the most recent findings of basic and clinical research about the COVID-associated coagulopathy, to foster a more thorough knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this compelling disease.","Marietta, Marco; Coluccio, Valeria; Luppi, Mario",Intern Emerg Med,85,1

This retrospective study reports the first Italian experience on CP donors' selection and donations. METHODS: Patients aged 18-68 years who had recovered from COVID-19 at least two weeks previously were recruited from March 18, to June 30, 2020 in a study protocol at the Italian hospitals of Pavia and Mantova. RESULTS: During the study period, 494/512 donors recruited were judged eligible and underwent 504 plasmapheresis procedures. Eighty-five percent (437/512) of the CP donors were males. The average time between symptom recovery and CP donation was 36.6 (±20.0) days. Four hundred and eighty-eight plasmapheresis procedures (96.8%) were concluded and each unit was divided into two subunits (total 976) with an average volume of 316.2 (±22.7) mL. Ninety-three percent (460/494) of CP donors at the time of plasma donation had a neutralizing IgG titer &#8805;1:80. Plasmapheresis-related adverse reactions occurred in 2.6% (13/504) of cases; all the reactions were mild and none required therapeutic intervention. Donors' age and COVID-19 severity were positively associated with greater antibody responses. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of a pilot CP program conducted in Italy. The identification of factors (i.e., age and severity of COVID-19) positively associated with higher neutralizing antibody titers at the time of donation may help to optimize the selection of CP donors.","Del Fante, Claudia; Franchini, Massimo; Baldanti, Fausto; Percivalle, Elena; Glingani, Claudia; Marano, Giuseppe; Mengoli, Carlo; Mortellaro, Cristina; Viarengo, Gianluca; Perotti, Cesare; Liumbruno, Giancarlo Maria",Transfusion,85,22

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at three hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan from January 2020 to February 2020. Real-time polymerasechain–reaction assays were used to detect COVID-19. A total of 529 patients diagnosed with NCP were recruited from three hospitals and classified by four severity types during hospitalization following the standards of the Chinese Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus Infection (eighth version). Patients were excluded if admitted by ICU on admission (n=92, on a general ward while meeting the condition of severe or critical type on admission (n=25), or there was insufficient clinical information (n=64). In sum, 348 patients with mNCP were finally included, and 68 developed severe pneumonia.

With the recent advent of innovative treatments for rare diseases that have uncertainties in the clinical evidence base, but which could meet a high unmet need, there has been renewed interest in the potential of OBMEAs. The objective of this research was to review the implementation of OBMEAs for two case studies across countries in the European Union, Australia and Canada, to identify good practices that could inform development of tools to support implementation of OBMEAs. METHODS: To investigate how OBMEAs are being implemented with rare disease treatments, we collected information from health technology assessment/payer experts in countries that had implemented OBMEAs for either nusinersen in spinal muscular atrophy or tisagenlecleucel in two cancer indications. Operational characteristics of the OBMEAs that were publicly available were documented. Then, the experts discussed issues in implementing these OBMEAs and specific approaches taken to overcome challenges. RESULTS: The OBMEAs identified were based on individual outcomes to ensure appropriate use, manage continuation of treatment and in two cases linked to payment schedules, or they were population based, coverage with evidence development. For nusinersen, population-based OBMEAs are documented in Belgium, England and the Netherlands and individual-based schemes in Bulgaria, Ireland, Italy and Lithuania. For tisagenlecleucel, there were population-based schemes in Australia, Belgium, England and France and individual-based schemes in Italy and Spain. Comparison of the OBMEA constructs showed some clear published frameworks and clarity of the uncertainties to be addressed that were similar across countries. Agreements were generally made between the marketing authorisation holder and the payer with involvement of expert physicians. Only England and the Netherlands involved patients. Italy used its long-established, national, web-based, treatment-specific data collection system linked to reimbursement and Spain has just developed such a national treatment registry system. Other countries relied on a variety of data collection systems (including clinical registries) and administrative data. Durations of agreements varied for these treatments as did processes for interim reporting. The processes to ensure data quality, completeness and sufficiency for re-analysis after coverage with evidence development were not always clear, neither were analysis plans. CONCLUSIONS: These case studies have shown that important information about the constructs of OBMEAs for rare disease treatments are publicly available, and for some jurisdictions, interim reports of progress. Outcomes-based managed entry agreements can play an important role not only in reimbursement, but also in treatment optimisation. However, they are complex to implement and should be the exception and not the rule. More recent OBMEAs have developed document covenants among stakeholders or electronic systems to provide assurances about data sufficiency. For coverage with evidence development, there is an opportunity for greater collaboration among jurisdictions to share processes, develop common data collection agreements, and share interim and final reports. The establishment of an international public portal to host such reports would be particularly valuable for rare disease treatments.

CDTI is often hampered by coendemicity with loiasis (another filariasis caused by Loa loa) in some areas. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests that O. volvulus infection increases the risk for onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) among Cameroonian children. This highlights the urgent need to strengthen onchocerciasis elimination programmes in mesoendemic/hyperendemic areas. Novel alternative strategies, such as the ‘slash and clear’ (S&C) vector control method, may be required to complement ongoing CDTI to accelerate elimination of transmission. The short-term impact of S&C on the biting rates of the blackfly vectors has been demonstrated in other settings. However, its long-term effectiveness and impact on parasitological and serological markers of onchocerciasis transmission as well as on OAE are still unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to assess the effectiveness of annual S&C interventions combined with CDTI in reducing onchocerciasis transmission and epilepsy incidence. Eight onchocerciasis-endemic villages located <5 km from the Mbam or Sanaga rivers will be randomised to two arms: four villages will receive yearly CDTI only for two consecutive years (Arm 1), while the other four villages will receive CDTI plus annual S&C for 2 years (Arm 2). Study outcomes (blackfly biting rates, infectivity rates and seroprevalence of onchocerciasis antibodies (Ov16 antibodies) in children, prevalence of microfilaridermia and epilepsy incidence) will be monitored prospectively and compared across study arms. We expect that S&C will have an added benefit over CDTI alone. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has received ethical approval from the institutional review board of the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board (reference number: IRB2021-03) and has been registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry. Findings will be disseminated at national and international levels via meetings and peer-reviewed publications.

We performed dense serial blood sampling in hospitalised and non-hospitalised ESKD patients with COVID-19 (n=256 samples from 55 patients) and used Olink immunoassays to measure 436 circulating proteins. Comparison to 51 non-infected ESKD patients revealed 221 proteins differentially expressed in COVID-19, of which 69.7% replicated in an independent cohort of 46 COVID-19 patients. 203 proteins were associated with clinical severity scores, including IL6, markers of monocyte recruitment (e.g. CCL2, CCL7), neutrophil activation (e.g proteinase-3) and epithelial injury (e.g. KRT19). Random Forests machine learning identified predictors of current or future severity such as KRT19, PARP1, PADI2, CCL7, and IL1RL1 (ST2). Survival analysis with joint models revealed 69 predictors of death including IL22RA1, CCL28, and the neutrophil-derived chemotaxin AZU1 (Azurocidin). Finally, longitudinal modelling with linear mixed models uncovered 32 proteins that display different temporal profiles in severe versus non-severe disease, including integrins and adhesion molecules.

Measures of flexibility enhancement are regarded as solutions to guarantee reliable and flexible electricity supply in such an emergency. This study aims at investigating the impact of flexibility enhancement measures (electricity storage and flexible demand) in different situations of the preliminary COVID-19 pandemic. Case studies in different regions (Denmark, the Netherlands, and the Sichuan province of China) are conducted and assessed using the hourly simulation tool EnergyPLAN. These regions own different electricity supply mix and level of renewable electricity. It is found that the flexible demand measure within one day or one week can hardly eliminate the electricity imbalance caused by either the pandemic or the increasing renewable electricity. The monthly flexible demand is effective for balancing, but its potential in these regions is not enough. However, electricity storage measure enhances the electricity balance even during the most extreme situation of the pandemic. From the economic perspective, electricity storage measure leads to an increase of up to 15% in total system costs, while flexible demand measure has a negligible effect on costs. This study serves as the first step to understand the performance of flexibility enhancement measures in the power sector under the shock of a pandemic.","Luo, Shihua; Hu, Weihao; Liu, Wen; Liu, Zhou; Huang, Qi; Chen, Zhe",Energy (Oxf),85,30

METHODS: The system screens infected patients based on vital signs, i.e., respiration rate measured by a radar, heart rate by a finger-tip photo-reflector, and facial temperature by a thermography. The system segregates subjects into higher-risk influenza (HR-I) group, lower-risk influenza (LR-I) group, and non-influenza (Non-I) group using a neural network and fuzzy clustering method (FCM). We conducted influenza screening for 35 seasonal influenza patients and 48 normal control subjects at the Japan Self-Defense Force Central Hospital. Pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) was measured as a reference. RESULTS: The system classified 17 subjects into HR-I group, 26 into LR-I group, and 40 into Non-I group. Ten out of the 17 HR-I subjects indicated SpO(2) <96%, whereas only two out of the 26 LR-I subjects showed SpO(2) <96%. The chi-squared test revealed a significant difference in the ratio of subjects showed SpO(2) <96% between HR-I and LR-I group (p < 0.001). There were zero and nine normal control subjects in HR-I and LR-I groups, respectively, and there was one influenza patient in Non-I group.

Guided by hermeneutic phenomenology, our research aimed to amplify the voices of youth living with anxiety. Fifty-eight youth living with anxiety took part in in-depth, open-ended interviews and participatory arts-based methods (photovoice and ecomaps). Analysis was informed by van Manen’s method of data analysis with attention to lived space, lived body, lived time, and lived relationships, as well as the meanings of living with anxiety. Youth relied on the following metaphors to describe their experiences: A shrinking world; The heavy, heavy backpack; Play, pause, rewind, forward; and A fine balance. Overall, youth described their anxiety as a monster, contributing to feelings of fear, loss, and pain, but also hope.

602962,602962,602962,Laparoscopic surgery reduces the incidence of surgical site infections compared to the open approach for colorectal procedures: a meta-analysis,12.049632,4.8726892,2020-07-09,"1.Malaria is the tropical disease most commonly imported into the UK, with 1300–1800 cases reported each year, and 2–11 deaths. 2. Approximately three quarters of reported malaria cases in the UK are caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is capable of invading a high proportion of red blood cells and rapidly leading to severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. 3. Most non-falciparum malaria cases are caused by Plasmodium vivax; a few cases are caused by the other species of plasmodium: Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae or Plasmodium knowlesi. 4. Mixed infections with more than one species of parasite can occur; they commonly involve P. falciparum with the attendant risks of severe malaria. 5. There are no typical clinical features of malaria; even fever is not invariably present. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat or lower respiratory complaints. 6. A diagnosis of malaria must always be sought in a feverish or sick child or adult who has visited malaria-endemic areas. Specific country information on malaria can be found at http://travelhealthpro.org.uk/. P. falciparum infection rarely presents more than six months after exposure but presentation of other species can occur more than a year after exposure. 7. Management of malaria depends on awareness of the diagnosis and on performing the correct diagnostic tests: the diagnosis cannot be excluded until more than one blood specimen has been examined. Other travel related infections, especially viral haemorrhagic fevers, should also be considered. 8. The optimum diagnostic procedure is examination of thick and thin blood films by an expert to detect and speciate the malarial parasites. P. falciparum and P. vivax (depending upon the product) malaria can be diagnosed almost as accurately using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) which detect plasmodial antigens. RDTs for other Plasmodium species are not as reliable. 9. Most patients treated for P. falciparum malaria should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h as patients can deteriorate suddenly, especially early in the course of treatment. In specialised units seeing large numbers of patients, outpatient treatment may be considered if specific protocols for patient selection and follow up are in place. 10. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should be treated with an artemisinin combination therapy (Grade 1A). Artemether–lumefantrine (Riamet(®)) is the drug of choice (Grade 2C) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim(®)) is an alternative. Quinine or atovaquone–proguanil (Malarone(®)) can be used if an ACT is not available. Quinine is highly effective but poorly-tolerated in prolonged treatment and should be used in combination with an additional drug, usually oral doxycycline. 11. Severe falciparum malaria, or infections complicated by a relatively high parasite count (more than 2% of red blood cells parasitized) should be treated with intravenous therapy until the patient is well enough to continue with oral treatment. Severe malaria is a rare complication of P. vivax or P. knowlesi infection and also requires parenteral therapy. 12. The treatment of choice for severe or complicated malaria in adults and children is intravenous artesunate (Grade 1A). Intravenous artesunate is unlicensed in the EU but is available in many centres. The alternative is intravenous quinine, which should be started immediately if artesunate is not available (Grade 1A). Patients treated with intravenous quinine require careful monitoring for hypoglycemia. 13. Patients with severe or complicated malaria should be managed in a high-dependency or intensive care environment. They may require haemodynamic support and management of: acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute kidney injury, seizures, and severe intercurrent infections including Gram-negative bacteraemia/septicaemia. 14. Children with severe malaria should also be treated with empirical broad spectrum antibiotics until bacterial infection can be excluded (Grade 1B). 15. Haemolysis occurs in approximately 10–15% patients following intravenous artesunate treatment. Haemoglobin concentrations should be checked approximately 14 days following treatment in those treated with IV artemisinins (Grade 2C). 16. Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be complicated: the placenta contains high levels of parasites, stillbirth or early delivery may occur and diagnosis can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood. 17. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the second and third trimester of pregnancy should be treated with artemether–lumefantrine (Grade 2B). Uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy should usually be treated with quinine and clindamycin but specialist advice should be sought. Severe malaria in any trimester of pregnancy should be treated as for any other patient with artesunate preferred over quinine (Grade 1C). 18. Children with uncomplicated malaria should be treated with an ACT (artemether–lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) as first line treatment (Grade 1A). Quinine with doxycycline or clindamycin, or atovaquone–proguanil at appropriate doses for weight can also be used. Doxycycline should not be given to children under 12 years. 19. Either an oral ACT or chloroquine can be used for the treatment of non-falciparum malaria. An oral ACT is preferred for a mixed infection, if there is uncertainty about the infecting species, or for P. vivax infection from areas where chloroquine resistance is common (Grade 1B). 20. Dormant parasites (hypnozoites) persist in the liver after treatment of P. vivax or P. ovale infection: the only currently effective drug for eradication of hypnozoites is primaquine (1A). Primaquine is more effective at preventing relapse if taken at the same time as chloroquine (Grade 1C). 21. Primaquine should be avoided or given with caution under expert supervision in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in whom it may cause severe haemolysis. 22. Primaquine (for eradication of P. vivax or P. ovale hypnozoites) is contraindicated in pregnancy and when breastfeeding (until the G6PD status of child is known); after initial treatment for these infections a pregnant woman should take weekly chloroquine prophylaxis until after delivery or cessation of breastfeeding when hypnozoite eradication can be considered. 23. An acute attack of malaria does not confer protection from future attacks: individuals who have had malaria should take effective anti-mosquito precautions and chemoprophylaxis during future visits to endemic areas.","Lalloo, David G.; Shingadia, Delane; Bell, David J.; Beeching, Nicholas J.; Whitty, Christopher J.M.; Chiodini, Peter L.",J Infect,85,16

The K18-hACE2 mice develop mild to lethal infection commensurate with SARS-CoV-2 challenge doses and was proposed as a model for efficacy testing of antiviral agents. We treated lethally infected mice with a deuterated derivative of GC376. Treatment of K18-hACE2 mice at 24 hr post infection with a derivative (compound 2) resulted in increased survival of mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Lung virus titers were decreased, and histopathological changes were ameliorated in compound 2-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice.

Needed to resolve the issue is its cultivation in readily available cell lines. Objectives: To grow HEC in cell lines. To describe its characteristics and to differentiate it from other human and animal coronaviruses. Study design: Originally grown in human fetal intestinal organ culture, HEC was passed in J774 cells (a mouse macrophage cell line) and C6/36 cells (a mosquito cell line). Its cytopathic effect (CPE) and pattern of immunofluorescence were described. Its appearance was ascertained by negative staining and transmission EM. Its structural proteins were delineated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting (WB). The antigenic character of the virus was determined by immunofluorescence and WB. Agglutination with mouse erythrocytes was performed. Results: In J774 cells, HEC induced the formation of giant cells and small syncytia. Immunofluorescence in both J774 and C6/36 cells was limited to the cytoplasm. Studies with transmission EM revealed the virus to have the typical appearance of other coronaviruses, to be 80–120 nm in diameter, and to bud into cysternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. By PAGE and WB, its major protein has an average molecular weight (MW) of 41 kilodaltons (kDa). Two other proteins had MWs of 190 and 24 kDa. By immunofluorescence and WB, HEC is antigenically distinct from human coronaviruses 0C43 and 229E and mouse hepatitis virus (A59 strain). Preparations of HEC did not agglutinate mouse erythrocytes. Conclusion: We conclude that HEC is a human coronavirus that is antigenically unrelated to 0C43 and 229E viruses. Growth of HEC in readily available cell lines should aid in elucidating its role as a pathogen in human diarrheal illnesses.","Luby, J.ames P.; Clinton, R.ebecca; Kurtz, S.tanley",J Clin Virol,85,20

Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have RNA proofreading enzymes in their genomes, resulting in fewer gene mutations than other RNA viruses. Nevertheless, variants of SARS-CoV-2 exist and may induce different symptoms; however, the factors and the impacts of these mutations are not well understood. We found that there is a bias to the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 variants, with disproportionate mutation to uracil (U). These point mutations to U are mainly derived from cytosine (C), which is consistent with the substrate specificity of host RNA editing enzymes, APOBECs. We also found the point mutations which are consistent with other RNA editing enzymes, ADARs. For the C-to-U mutations, the context of the upstream uracil and downstream guanine from mutated position was found to be most prevalent. Further, the degree of increase of U in SARS-CoV-2 variants correlates with enhanced production of cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, in cell lines when compared with stimulation by the ssRNA sequence of the isolated virus in Wuhan. Therefore, RNA editing is a factor for mutation bias in SARS-CoV-2 variants, which affects host inflammatory cytokines production.","Kosuge, Masato; Furusawa-Nishii, Emi; Ito, Koyu; Saito, Yoshiro; Ogasawara, Kouetsu",Sci Rep,85,26

The present work involves an in silico reverse vaccinology approach for identifying the immunogens as vaccine candidates that can be effective against reinfections and should be capable of inducing long-term protective immunity against Chlamydial infections. This study identifies the putative vaccine candidates that are membrane bound with high antigenicity properties; antigenicity induces the immunogenicity which involves identification of T-cell and B-cell epitopes that induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The epitopes ‘LSWEMELAY’, ‘LSNTEGYRY’, ‘TSDLGQMEY’, ‘FIDLLQAIY’ and ‘FSNNFSDIY’ were predicted as core sequences for class I MHC molecules. The identified epitopes showed promising ability to interact with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA). These epitopes showed maximum population coverage with epitope conservancy above 80%. Molecular docking was performed to test the binding affinities of the identified epitopes with the HLA molecule to study the binding cleft interactions.

Its rapid spread globally and devasting effects have resulted into a major public health emergency prompting the need for methodological interventions to understand and control its spread. In particular, The ability to effectively retrace its transmission pathways in outbreaks remains a major challenge. This is further exacerbated by our limited understanding of its underlying evolutionary mechanism. Using NGS whole-genome data, we determined whether inter- and intra-host diversity coupled with bottleneck analysis can retrace the pathway of viral transmission in two epidemiologically well characterised nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare settings supported by phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressure and diversity of the identified variants. Our findings showed evidence of intrahost variant transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after infection These observations were consistent with the results from the bottleneck analysis suggesting that certain intrahost variants in this study could have been transmitted to recipients. In both outbreaks, we observed iSNVs and SNVs shared by putative source-recipients pairs. Majority of the observed iSNVs were positioned in the S and ORF1ab region. AG, CT and TC nucleotide changes were enriched across SARS-COV-2 genome. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 genome had limited diversity in some loci while being highly conserved in others. Overall, Our findings show that the synergistic effect of combining withinhost diversity and bottleneck estimations greatly enhances resolution of transmission events in Sars-Cov-2 outbreaks. They also provide insight into the genome diversity suggesting purifying selection may be involved in the transmission.

There are many sets of parameters that are observationally equivalent in the short run but lead to markedly different long run forecasts. Second, I show that the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] can be identified from the data, conditional on epidemiologic parameters, and propose several nonlinear SUR approaches to estimate [Formula: see text]. I study the performance of these methods using Monte Carlo studies and demonstrate that they yield fairly accurate estimates of [Formula: see text]. Next, I apply these methods to estimate [Formula: see text] for the US, California, and Japan, and document heterogeneity in the value of [Formula: see text] across regions. My estimation approach accounts for possible underreporting of the number of cases. I demonstrate that if one fails to take underreporting into account and estimates [Formula: see text] from the reported cases data, the resulting estimate of [Formula: see text] may be biased downward and the resulting forecasts may exaggerate the long run number of deaths. Finally, I discuss how auxiliary information from random tests can be used to calibrate the initial parameters of the model and narrow down the range of possible forecasts of the future number of deaths.","Korolev, Ivan",J Econom,85,20

This trial evaluates whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing followed by 3 Tesla prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted biopsy can reduce overdiagnosis, while maintaining the detection of clinically significant cancer, compared to PSA-screening and systematic biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random sample of men 50–60 years in the Göteborg area, Sweden, identified from the Total Population Register, were randomised to either a screening or control group (CG). Participants in the screening group (SG) were further randomised into one of three arms: (1) PSA-test; if PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL, then MRI and systematic biopsy, plus targeted biopsy to suspicious lesions as per Prostate Imaging – Reporting and Data System, version 2 (PI-RADSv2) 3–5; (2) PSA-test; if PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL, then MRI, and targeted biopsy only if PI-RADSv2 3–5; (3) identical to Arm 2, except lower PSA-cut-off ≥1.8 ng/mL. The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically insignificant PC (defined as Gleason Score 3 + 3 [Grade Group 1]) comparing all men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL in Arm 1 vs. Arm 2 + 3. RESULTS: Randomisation and enrolment started in September 2015. Accrual has hitherto resulted in 38,770 men randomised to the SG. The participation rate is 50%. Invitation to the first screening round was completed in June 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The Göteborg-2 trial will provide new knowledge about the performance of prostate MRI in a screening setting.","Kohestani, Kimia; Månsson, Marianne; Godtman, Rebecka Arnsrud; Stranne, Johan; Wallström, Jonas; Carlsson, Sigrid; Hellström, Mikael; Hugosson, Jonas",Scand J Urol,85,13

To curb COVID-19 transmission, mitigation measures such as travel restrictions, border closures, curfews, lockdowns, and social distancing have been implemented. However, these measures may directly and indirectly affect the delivery and utilization of essential health services, including malaria services. The suspension of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution, shortages of malaria commodities, and reduced demand for health services have hindered the continued delivery of malaria services. The overall goal of this analysis was to describe the trends in malaria incidence and mortality in Zimbabwe prior to and during the pandemic to understand the consequences of COVID-19-related changes in the delivery and utilization of malaria services. METHODS: Monthly data on the number of malaria cases and deaths by district for the period January 2017 to June 2020 were obtained from the national health management information system (HMIS). District-level population data were obtained from the 2012 Census. Malaria incidence per 1000 population and malaria deaths per 100,000 population were calculated for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 and mapped to describe the spatial and temporal variation of malaria at the district level. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2017, 2018 and 2019, there was an excess of over 30,000 malaria cases from January to June 2020. The number of malaria deaths recorded in January to June 2020 exceeded the annual totals for 2018 and 2019. District level maps indicated that areas outside high malaria burden provinces experienced higher than expected malaria incidence and mortality, suggesting potential outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The observed surge in malaria cases and deaths in January to June 2020 coincided with the onset of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. While further research is needed to explore possible explanations for the observed trends, prioritizing the continuity of essential malaria services amid the COVID-19 pandemic remains crucial.

With this study we aimed to assess glucose, glycemic gap (GlyG) and insulin secretion/sensitivity measures in patients with Covid-19. Materials and Methods: We studied, upon admission, 157 patients with Covid-19 (84: in wards and 73: in intensive care units; ICU); 135 had no history of diabetes. We measured blood glucose upon admission as well as glycated hemoglobin (A1c), plasma insulin and C-peptide. We calculated the GlyG and the Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) estimates of steady state beta cell function (HOMA2%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S). Statistical assessment was done with analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Compared to patients in the wards without diabetes, patients with diabetes in the wards, as well as patients in the ICU (without or with diabetes) had higher admission glycemia. The GlyG was significantly higher in patients without diabetes in the ICU compared to patients without diabetes in the wards, while HOMA2%B based on glucose and insulin was significantly higher in the ICU patients compared to patients in the wards. Of all the parameters, HOMA2%S based on C-peptide/glucose was higher in survivors (n = 133). Conclusions: In our series of patients with Covid-19, a substantial number of patients with and without diabetes had admission hyperglycemia and those who were critically ill may have had compromised insulin secretion and lowered sensitivity to insulin. These findings lend credence to reports of association between Covid-19 and hyperglycemia/secondary diabetes.","Ilias, Ioannis; Diamantopoulos, Aristidis; Pratikaki, Maria; Botoula, Efthymia; Jahaj, Edison; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Zacharis, Alexandros; Vassiliou, Alice G.; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",Medicina (Kaunas),85,28

The study focuses on the modelling and the forecasting of COVID-19 spread in the most affected African continent, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and South Africa and for the sake of comparison two of the most affected European country are also considered, namely: France and Italy. To this end, an epidemiological SEIQRDP model is presented, which is an adaptation of the classic SIR model widely used in mathematical epidemiology. In order to better coincide with the preventive measures taken by the governments to deal with the spread of COVID-19, this model considers the quarantine. For the identification of the models parameters, official data of the pandemic up to August 1st, 2020 are considered. The results show that the number of infections due to the use of quarantine is expected to be very low provided the isolation is effective. However, it is increasing in some countries with the early lifting of containment. Finally, the information provided by the SEIQRDP model could help to establish a realistic assessment of the short-term pandemic situation. Moreover, this will help maintain the most appropriate and necessary public health measures after the lockdown lifting.","ARIES, N.; OUNIS, H.",,85,22

To contain spending, the government capped public health expenditure and introduced increased cost-sharing. The Greek case is important for studying the impact of recessions on health systems. This study analysed changes in household health expenditure in Greece over the economic crisis and explored whether the impact differed across socioeconomic groups. PARTICIPANTS: We used data from the Greek Household Budget Survey for the years 2004 and 2008–2017. The dataset comprised 51 654 households, with a total of 128 111 members. DESIGN: We compared pre-crisis and post-crisis trends in Greek household out-of-pocket payments for healthcare from 2004 to 2017 using an interrupted time series analysis. This study explored spending in euros and as a share of total household purchases. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the population level trend in household health spending was reversed after the crisis began (pre-crisis trend: €0.040 decrease per quarter (95% CI: −0.785 to −0.022), post-crisis trend: €0.315 increase per quarter (95% CI: −0.004 to 0.635)). We also found that spending on inpatient services and pharmaceuticals has been increasing since the start of the crisis, whereas outpatient services expenditure has been decreasing. Across all households, out-of-pocket payments incurred a greater financial burden after the crisis relative to pre-existing trends, but the poorest households incurred a disproportionately higher burden. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to use an interrupted time series analysis to assess the impact of the economic crisis on household health expenditure in Greece. Our findings suggest that there was an erosion of financial protection for Greek households as a consequence of the economic crisis. This effect was particularly pronounced among poorer households, which is indicative of a regressive financing system.","Crookes, Catriona; Palladino, Raffaele; Seferidi, Paraskevi; Hirve, Raeena; Siskou, Olga; Filippidis, Filippos T",BMJ Open,85,24

METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted across 2 electronic databases (Medline and Cochrane Central) from inception through March 2021. RCTs assessing the impact of iron supplementation on clinical outcomes in iron deficient HF patients were considered for inclusion. Primary end-points included all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization. Evaluations were reported as odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and analysis was performed using a random effects model. I(2) index was used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: From the 2599 articles retrieved from initial search, 10 potentially relevant studies (n = 2187 patients) were included in the final analysis. Both oral (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.08–11.30; p = 0.951) and intravenous (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.73–1.29; p = 0.840) iron supplementation did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality. However, intravenous iron supplementation significantly decreased the rates of overall (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.33–0.81; p = 0.004) and HF (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.22–0.80; p = 0.009) hospitalizations. In addition, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose therapy significantly reduced the time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.50–1.00; p = 0.048), but had no effect on time to first cardiovascular death (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.70–1.25; p = 0.655).

A total number of 28 eleven-day-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with the field isolate of the PEDV strain CV-777. Diarrhea was observed in 32% of the pigs and virus shedding was demonstrated in 100% between postinoculation day (PID) 1 and 8. Serum IgG and IgA antibodies to PEDV were detected by isotype ELISA from PID 12 and 15, respectively, reaching maximum values at PID 32 (IgG) and 21 (IgA). PEDV specific IgM ASC occurred in all the tissues between PID 4 and 7, with the strongest response in the intestinal lamina propria.

The Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS) is an instrument that was designed to assess caregivers’ perceptions of OHRQoL in preschool children. Although it has been translated into many languages, it has yet to be validated in Arabic. Therefore, this study aimed to translate this questionnaire to Arabic (A-ECOHIS) and test its psychometric properties. METHODS: Questionnaire responses from three samples of caregivers of preschool children ≤ 6 years of age were collected: (i) community-based (n = 422), from preschools selected as a stratified random sample; (ii) clinic-based, from those seeking pediatric dental care at a university clinic (n = 246); and (iii) a test-retest sample (n = 68), a clinic-based group of caregivers who completed questionnaires twice about siblings who were not receiving dental care. Children received a dental examination to assess their decayed, missed, filled teeth (dmft) scores. Convergent validity was evaluated by assessing the A-ECOHIS scores in relation to the response to a global question. Discriminant validity was evaluated by comparing the scores of children with varying levels of oral disease. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha, and the test-retest reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: The A-ECOHIS scores of the questionnaire sections and the global oral health rating were significantly correlated; Spearman correlation coefficients were, r = 0.55, P ≤ 0.01 (overall score), r = 0.54, P ≤ 0.01 (child section), and r = 0.51, P ≤ 0.01 (family section). The mean A-ECOHIS scores were also statistically significantly higher in children with higher dmft scores compared with lower dmft, and in the clinic-based sample compared with the community sample. The Cronbach’s alpha value of the the child, family sections and overall questionnaire were, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of A-ECOHIS was 0.86. CONCLUSION: The A-ECOHIS performed well on all psychometric tests to which it was applied. Thus, it is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in Arabic-speaking caregivers of preschoolers aged 2 to 6 years.","Farsi, Nada J.; El-Housseiny, Azza A.; Farsi, Deema J.; Farsi, Najat M.",BMC Oral Health,85,18

Commercial particle counters were used to measure mask performance. RESULTS: The ACM has 2 ports on either side for instruments and endoscopes, a port for a filter, and a port that can evacuate aerosols contained within the mask via a standard suction pump. The mask contained aerosols on a mannequin with and without facial hair when the suction was set to 18.5 L/min. Other types of masks demonstrated substantial aerosol leakage under similar conditions. In a subsequent experiment, the ACM contained aerosols generated by a nebulizer up to the saturation of the particle detector without measurable leakage with or without suction.

Despite the lack of scientific validation, support for the use of these compounds continues from various influencers. At the cellular level, the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine accumulates in acidic organelles where it acts as an alkalizing agent with possible downstream effects on several cellular pathways. In this perspective, we discuss a possible modulatory role of these drugs in two shared features of neurodegenerative diseases, the cellular accumulation of aberrantly folded proteins and the contribution of neuroinflammation in this pathogenic process. Certainly, the decision on the use of chloroquine must be determined by its efficacy in the specific clinical situation. However, at an unprecedented time of a potential widespread use of chloroquine, we seek to raise awareness of its potential impact in ongoing clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in neurodegeneration.","Pedrioli, Giona; Patani, Rickie; Paganetti, Paolo",Front Neurol,85,32

FMDV naturally infects swine, cattle, and other cloven-hoofed animals. FMD is not adequately controlled by vaccination. An alternative strategy is to develop swine that are genetically resistant to infection. Here, we generated FMDV-specific shRNA transgenic cells targeting either nonstructural protein 2B or polymerase 3D of FMDV. The shRNA-positive transgenic cells displayed significantly lower viral production than that of the control cells after infection with FMDV (P < 0.05). Twenty-three transgenic cloned swine (TGCS) and nine non-transgenic cloned swine (Non-TGCS) were produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In the FMDV challenge study, one TGCS was completely protected, no clinical signs, no viremia and no viral RNA in the tissues, no non-structural antibody response, another one TGCS swine recovered after showing clinical signs for two days, whereas all of the normal control swine (NS) and Non-TGCS developed typical clinical signs, viremia and viral RNA was determined in the tissues, the non-structural antibody was determined, and one Non-TGCS swine died. The viral RNA load in the blood and tissues of the TGCS was reduced in both challenge doses. These results indicated that the TGCS displayed resistance to the FMDV infection. Immune cells, including CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD21(+), and CD172(+) cells, and the production of IFN-γ were analyzed, there were no significant differences observed between the TGCS and NS or Non-TGCS, suggesting that the FMDV resistance may be mainly derived from the RNAi-based antiviral pathway.

CHL-P, COVID-19-related knowledge, worries, risk perception, and adherence to protective measures were measured in an online questionnaire with self-constructed items. We conducted a cluster analysis of the five CHL-P items and performed logistic regression analyses. Results: Two CHL-P clusters were identified: high vs. moderate CHL-P. Belonging to the high-CHL-P cluster (31.2% of students) was significantly associated with older age, female/other gender, advanced education, higher levels of parental education, and moderate importance placed on education. In addition, higher levels of knowledge, risk perception and worries, and adherence to protective measures were associated with high CHL-P cluster membership. Conclusion: Students would benefit from educational measures that promote CHL-P at German universities.","Heinrichs, Katherina; Abel, Thomas; Matos Fialho, Paula M.; Pischke, Claudia R.; Busse, Heide; Wendt, Claus; Stock, Christiane",Int J Public Health,85,15

Issuance of an EUA without a proven randomized control trial (RCT) sets a dangerous precedent since the premature action drives health care providers and patients away from RCTs that are essential for determining the efficacy and safety of CP. More caution should have been taken based on what was learned from the recently rescinded EUA of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine debacle which was approved initially based on an anecdotal report. The FDA approval process for determining efficacy and safety must be based solely on data from RCTs to sustain public and professional trust for future treatment or vaccine efforts to be successful.","Guharoy, Roy; Krenzelok, Edward P",Clin Infect Dis,85,1

Of the serial pharmacokinetic investigations we designed to facilitate identifying LianhuaQingwen compounds that are likely to be therapeutically important, the current investigation focused on the component Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots (Gancao). Besides its function in COVID-19 treatment, Gancao is able to induce pseudoaldosteronism by inhibiting renal 11β-HSD2. Systemic and colon-luminal exposure to Gancao compounds were characterized in volunteers receiving LianhuaQingwen and by in vitro metabolism studies. Access of Gancao compounds to 11β-HSD2 was characterized using human/rat, in vitro transport, and plasma protein binding studies, while 11β-HSD2 inhibition was assessed using human kidney microsomes. LianhuaQingwen contained a total of 41 Gancao constituents (0.01–8.56 μmol/day). Although glycyrrhizin (1), licorice saponin G2 (2), and liquiritin/liquiritin apioside (21/22) were the major Gancao constituents in LianhuaQingwen, their poor intestinal absorption and access to colonic microbiota resulted in significant levels of their respective deglycosylated metabolites glycyrrhetic acid (8), 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid (M2(D); a new Gancao metabolite), and liquiritigenin (27) in human plasma and feces after dosing. These circulating metabolites were glucuronized/sulfated in the liver and then excreted into bile. Hepatic oxidation of 8 also yielded M2(D). Circulating 8 and M2(D), having good membrane permeability, could access (via passive tubular reabsorption) and inhibit renal 11β-HSD2. Collectively, 1 and 2 were metabolically activated to the pseudoaldosterogenic compounds 8 and M2(D). This investigation, together with such investigations of other components, has implications for precisely defining therapeutic benefit of LianhuaQingwen and conditions for its safe use.","Lan, Xiao-fang; Olaleye, Olajide E.; Lu, Jun-lan; Yang, Wei; Du, Fei-fei; Yang, Jun-ling; Cheng, Chen; Shi, Yan-hong; Wang, Feng-qing; Zeng, Xue-shan; Tian, Nan-nan; Liao, Pei-wei; Yu, Xuan; Xu, Fang; Li, Ying-fei; Wang, Hong-tao; Zhang, Nai-xia; Jia, Wei-wei; Li, Chuan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,85,24

The aim of the present study was to evaluate clinical characteristics and prognostic impact of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). METHODS: We selected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients included in the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19, a retrospective multicenter European registry including 6609 STEMI patients treated with PPCI from March 1 until April 30, 2019 and 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled 5 SARS-Cov-2 negative patients per each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient, individually matched for age, sex, and hospital/geographic area. Study endpoints were in-hospital mortality, definite stent thrombosis, heart failure. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 62 positive SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who were compared with a matched population of 310 STEMI patients. No significant difference was observed in baseline characteristics or modality of access to the PCI center. In the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, the culprit lesion was more often located in the RCA (p < 0.001). Despite similar pre and postprocedural TIMI flow, we observed a trend in higher use of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors and significantly higher use of thrombectomy in the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with a remarkably higher in hospital mortality (29 % vs 5.5 %, p < 0.001), definite in-stent thrombosis (8.1 % vs 1.6 %, p = 0.004) and heart failure (22.6 % vs 10.6 %, p = 0.001) that was confirmed after adjustment for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that among STEMI patients, SARS-CoV-2 positivity is associated with larger thrombus burden, a remarkably higher mortality but also higher rates of in-stent thrombosis and heart failure.","De Luca, Giuseppe; Debel, Niels; Cercek, Miha; Jensen, Lisette Okkels; Vavlukis, Marija; Calmac, Lucian; Johnson, Tom; Ferrer, Gerard Rourai; Ganyukov, Vladimir; Wojakowski, Wojtek; Kinnaird, Tim; von Birgelen, Clemens; Cottin, Yves; IJsselmuiden, Alexander; Tuccillo, Bernardo; Versaci, Francesco; Royaards, Kees-Jan; Berg, Jurrien ten; Laine, Mika; Dirksen, Maurits; Siviglia, Massimo; Casella, Gianni; Kala, Petr; Díez Gil, José Luis; Banning, Adrian; Becerra, Victor; De Simone, Ciro; Santucci, Andrea; Carrillo, Xavier; Scoccia, Alessandra; Amoroso, Giovanni; van't Hof, Arnoud WJ.; Kovarnik, Tomas; Tsigkas, Grigorios; Mehilli, Julinda; Gabrielli, Gabriele; Rios, Xacobe Flores; Bakraceski, Nikola; Levesque, Sébastien; Cirrincione, Giuseppe; Guiducci, Vincenzo; Kidawa, Michał; Spedicato, Leonardo; Marinucci, Lucia; Ludman, Peter; Zilio, Filippo; Galasso, Gennaro; Fabris, Enrico; Menichelli, Maurizio; Garcia-Touchard, Arturo; Manzo, Stephane; Caiazzo, Gianluca; Moreu, Jose; Forés, Juan Sanchis; Donazzan, Luca; Vignali, Luigi; Teles, Rui; Benit, Edouard; Agostoni, Pierfrancesco; Ojeda, Francisco Bosa; Lehtola, Heidi; Camacho-Freiere, Santiago; Kraaijeveld, Adriaan; Antti, Ylitalo; Boccalatte, Marco; Deharo, Pierre; Martínez-Luengas, Iñigo Lozano; Scheller, Bruno; Varytimiadi, Efthymia; Moreno, Raul; Uccello, Giuseppe; Faurie, Benjamin; Gutierrez Barrios, Alejandro; Milewski, Marek; Bruwiere, Ewout; Smits, Pieter; Wilbert, Bor; Di Uccio, Fortunato Scotto; Parodi, Guido; Kedhi, Elvin; Verdoia, Monica",Atherosclerosis,85,16

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus which causes a broad spectrum of ophthalmological manifestations in humans. Currently there is no certified therapy or vaccine to treat it, thus it has become a major global health threat. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is highly permissive and susceptible to ZIKV. This work explored the protective effects of RES on ZIKV-infected human RPE cells. RES treatment resulted in a significant reduction of infectious viral particles in infected male ARPE-19 and female hTERT-RPE1 cells. This protection was positively influenced by the action of RES on mitochondrial dynamics. Also, docking studies predicted that RES has a high affinity for two enzymes of the rate-limiting steps of pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis and viral polymerase. This evidence suggests that RES might be a potential antiviral agent to treat ZIKV-induced ocular abnormalities.

All students at Duke University, a private research university in Durham, North Carolina, signed the Duke Compact (3), agreeing to observe mandatory masking, social distancing, and participation in entry and surveillance testing. The university implemented a five-to-one pooled testing program for SARS-CoV-2 using a quantitative, in-house, laboratory-developed, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (4,5). Pooling of specimens to enable large-scale testing while minimizing use of reagents was pioneered during the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic (6). A similar methodology was adapted for Duke University's asymptomatic testing program. The baseline SARS-CoV-2 testing plan was to distribute tests geospatially and temporally across on- and off-campus student populations. By September 20, 2020, asymptomatic testing was scaled up to testing targets, which include testing for residential undergraduates twice weekly, off-campus undergraduates one to two times per week, and graduate students approximately once weekly. In addition, in response to newly identified positive test results, testing was focused in locations or within cohorts where data suggested an increased risk for transmission. Scale-up over 4 weeks entailed redeploying staff members to prepare 15 campus testing sites for specimen collection, developing information management tools, and repurposing laboratory automation to establish an asymptomatic surveillance system. During August 2-October 11, 68,913 specimens from 10,265 graduate and undergraduate students were tested. Eighty-four specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 51% were among persons with no symptoms. Testing as a result of contact tracing identified 27.4% of infections. A combination of risk-reduction strategies and frequent surveillance testing likely contributed to a prolonged period of low transmission on campus. These findings highlight the importance of combined testing and contact tracing strategies beyond symptomatic testing, in association with other preventive measures. Pooled testing balances resource availability with supply-chain disruptions, high throughput with high sensitivity, and rapid turnaround with an acceptable workload.","Denny, Thomas N.; Andrews, Laura; Bonsignori, Mattia; Cavanaugh, Kyle; Datto, Michael B.; Deckard, Anastasia; DeMarco, C.

In fact, as COVID-19 prevalence decreases, this remains the main preventive measure to avoid rebound. However, inconsistent results due to biological sample variability in collection timing post infection and sampling procedures, misleads our application in clinic. METHODS: We applied Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Logistic regression on the RT-PCR results from 258 confirmed patients with COVID-19 to evaluate the factors associated with negative conversion. We also estimated the negative percentages among patients who had tested twice or more and compared the proportions by oropharyngeal swab, sputum and combined double testing, respectively. MAIN RESULTS: The proportion of negative conversion was 6.7% at the 4(th) day, 16.4% at the 7(th) day, 41.0% at two weeks and 61.0% at three-weeks post-admission. We also found 34.1% and 60.3% with at least one negative RT-PCR result at the 7(th) days and 14(th) days after symptom onset, respectively. The negative proportion in sputum was higher than that in oropharyngeal swab in the early stage but lowered after symptoms. CONCLUSION: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, efficient testing strategies are critical to control COVID-19 epidemic. According to this study, early, consecutive and combined double testing will be the key to identify infected patients, particularly for asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases, and minimize misdiagnosis and ineffective isolation of infected patients.","Song, Yangzi; Chen, Chen; Wang, Yu; Zhang, Ju; Chen, Meiling; Gao, Guiju; Wang, Sa; Yang, Di; Song, Rui; Wang, Linghang; Xie, Wen; Yu, Fengting; Yan, Liting; Wang, Yajie; Zeng, Hui; Zhang, Fujie",Int J Infect Dis,85,1

In the patients with confirmed SARS, an early neopterin elevation was detected already at the day of onset of symptoms and rose to a maximum level of 45.0 nmol/L 3 days after the onset. All SARS patients had elevated neopterin concentrations (>10 nmol/L) within 9 days after the onset. The mean neopterin concentrations were 34.2 nmol/L in acute sera of SARS patients, 5.1 nmol/L in convalescent sera, and 6.7 nmol/L in healthy controls. In contrast, the mean CRP concentrations in both acute and convalescent sera of SARS patients were in the normal range (<10 mg/L). Serum neopterin level in SARS patients was associated with fever period and thus the clinical progression of the disease, while there was no significant correlation between the CRP level and the fever period. Serum neopterin may allow early assessment of the severity of SARS. The decrease of neopterin level was found after steroid treatment, which indicates that blood samples should be collected before steroid treatment for the neopterin measurement.","Zheng, Bojian; Cao, Kai-Yuan; Chan, Cangel P.Y.; Choi, Junet W.Y.; Leung, Wingman; Leung, Manfai; Duan, Zhao-Hui; Gao, Yang; Wang, Ming; Di, Biao; Hollidt, Jörg M.; Bergmann, Andreas; Lehmann, Matthias; Renneberg, Ilka; Tam, John S.L.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Cautherley, George W.H.; Fuchs, Dietmar; Renneberg, Reinhard",Clin Immunol,85,26

The past 15 years has seen a more uniform, world-wide approach to the management of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock with improved survival. Recognizing the early symptoms and signs of sepsis are key: the confused, hypoxic, hypotensive patient with pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis. Examination must include search for a source of infection and early drainage or debridement. Next to take appropriate cultures, give fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. If the picture does not improve over the next 6 hours step-up the treatment to include urine output monitoring, blood gases for base excess, lactate, haemoglobin and glucose. These will guide the management of vasopressors, insulin, fluids, transfusion and bicarbonate. If the hypotension persists (septic shock) the patient should be moved to intensive care. The most recent recommendations include the withdrawal of starch based colloids, dobutamine in place of dopamine and a higher threshold for the use of steroids.

This study aimed to primarily examine the effect of PPE use on intubation time and success rate among prehospital healthcare professionals; additionally, we compared intubation times among prehospital health care professionals using PPE with direct laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy assistance. METHODS: In this prospective simulation study, we compared the intubation times and success rates among prehospital healthcare professionals who were or were not using PPE. Furthermore, demographic data, previous intubation experience, and previous intubation experience with PPE were recorded. RESULTS: Overall time to intubation with PPE use was 51.28 ± 3.89 s, which was significantly higher than that without PPE use (33.03 ± 2.65 s; p < 0.001). In addition, the overall success rate with PPE use was 74.4%, which was significantly lower than that without PPE use (93%;p < 0.001). PPE use increased the average intubation time by 19.73 ± 2.59 s with direct laryngoscopy and by 16.81 ± 2.86 s with video laryngoscopy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PPE use is associated with increased intubation time and decreased success rate. Video laryngoscopy assistance in cases where PPE use is required facilitates faster endotracheal intubation than does direct laryngoscopy assistance.","Çağlar, Ahmet; Kaçer, İlker; Hacımustafaoğlu, Muhammet; Öztürk, Berkant; Öztürk, Sema",Australas Emerg Care,85,21

Ectopic expression of ACE2 (AGS-ACE2) results in RBD traffic via both CG and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endosomal acidification inhibitors like BafilomycinA1 and NH(4)Cl, which inhibit the CG pathway, reduce the uptake of RBD and impede Spike-pseudoviral infection in both AGS and AGS-ACE2 cells. The inhibition by BafilomycinA1 was found to be distinct from Chloroquine which neither affects RBD uptake nor alters endosomal pH, yet attenuates Spike-pseudovirus entry. By screening a subset of FDA-approved inhibitors for functionality similar to BafilomycinA1, we identified Niclosamide as a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Further validation using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in AGS-ACE2 and Vero cells confirmed its antiviral effect. We propose that Niclosamide, and other drugs which neutralize endosomal pH as well as inhibit the endocytic uptake, could provide broader applicability in subverting infection of viruses entering host cells via a pH-dependent endocytic pathway.","Prabhakara, Chaitra; Godbole, Rashmi; Sil, Parijat; Jahnavi, Sowmya; Gulzar, Shah-e-Jahan; van Zanten, Thomas S.; Sheth, Dhruv; Subhash, Neeraja; Chandra, Anchal; Shivaraj, Akshatha; Panikulam, Patricia; U, Ibrahim; Nuthakki, Vijay Kumar; Puthiyapurayil, Theja Parassini; Ahmed, Riyaz; Najar, Ashaq Hussain; Lingamallu, Sai Manoz; Das, Snigdhadev; Mahajan, Bhagyashri; Vemula, Praveen; Bharate, Sandip B.; Singh, Parvinder Pal; Vishwakarma, Ram; Guha, Arjun; Sundaramurthy, Varadharajan; Mayor, Satyajit",PLoS Pathog,85,22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has caused a pandemic and has taken lives of approximately two million people to date. Even though various vaccines are currently under development, virus, and especially its spike glycoprotein can mutate, which highlights a need for a broad‐spectrum inhibitor. In this work, inhibition of SARS‐CoV‐2 by graphene platforms with precise dual sulfate/alkyl functionalities is investigated. A series of graphene derivatives with different lengths of aliphatic chains is synthesized and is investigated for their ability to inhibit SARS‐CoV‐2 and feline coronavirus. Graphene derivatives with long alkyl chains (>C9) inhibit coronavirus replication by virtue of disrupting viral envelope. The ability of these graphene platforms to rupture viruses is visualized by atomic force microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy. A large concentration window (10 to 100‐fold) where graphene platforms display strongly antiviral activity against native SARS‐CoV‐2 without significant toxicity against human cells is found. In this concentration range, the synthesized graphene platforms inhibit the infection of enveloped viruses efficiently, opening new therapeutic and metaphylactic avenues against SARS‐CoV‐2.","Donskyi, Ievgen S.; Nie, Chuanxiong; Ludwig, Kai; Trimpert, Jakob; Ahmed, Rameez; Quaas, Elisa; Achazi, Katharina; Radnik, Jörg; Adeli, Mohsen; Haag, Rainer; Osterrieder, Klaus",Small,85,12

The presence of haematological malignancies are expected to increase the risk of adverse outcomes from this viral infection due to the immunosuppression brought about by the underlying cancer and the effects of therapy. We present a 55-year-old woman diagnosed with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) who had been heavily pretreated with multiagent chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHCT), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) and was complicated with EBV associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). The patient was recently treated with brentuximab and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) for relapse after alloHCT. She suffered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia and eventually succumbed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure.

The presence of secondary metabolites, namely polyphenols, carotenoids and terpenes, in certain food matrices seems to contribute to their functional properties, expressed through an increased prevention in the development of certain chronic diseases, namely coronary heart diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and diabetes. However, some foods’ volatile secondary metabolites also present important bioactive properties, although this is a poorly scientifically explored field. In this context, and in order to explore the potential bioactivity of volatile metabolites in different vegetables and fruits from regular consumption, the volatile composition was established using a green extraction technique, solid phase microextraction in headspace mode (HS-SPME), combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 320 volatile metabolites, comprising 51 terpenic compounds, 45 organosulfur compounds, 31 aldehydes, 37 esters, 29 ketones, 28 alcohols, 23 furanic compounds, 22 hydrocarbons, 19 benzene compounds, 13 nitrogenous compounds, 9 carboxylic acids, 7 ethers, 4 halogenated compounds and 3 naphthalene derivatives, were positively identified. Each investigated fruit and vegetable showed a specific volatile metabolomic profile. The obtained results revealed that terpenic compounds, to which are associated antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities, are the most predominant chemical family in beetroot (61%), orange carrot (58%) and white carrot (61%), while organosulfur compounds (antiviral activity) are dominant in onion, garlic and watercress. Broccoli and spinach are essentially constituted by alcohols and aldehydes (enzyme-inhibition and antimicrobial properties), while fruits from the Solanaceae family are characterized by esters in tamarillo and aldehydes in tomato.","Aguiar, Joselin; Gonçalves, João L.; Alves, Vera L.; Câmara, José S.",Molecules,85,23

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence, time of onset, and duration of anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection and the association of anosmia with other symptoms and eosinophil count. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic were assessed for olfaction with a nonirritant odor. The presence of anosmia was recorded, and a questionnaire integrating the anosmia reporting tool was filled. Patients with anosmia/hyposmia were followed telephonically at 7 and 14 days for resolution of anosmia and other symptoms. The presence of anosmia was correlated with eosinophil count. RESULTS: Of the 200 COVID-19 patients, 87% were symptomatic. More than half of the patients had fever (56%). Anosmia was observed in 30% of the patients and hyposmia in 4% of patients. In 41% of the patients, olfactory loss was reported before diagnosis. The mean duration of anosmia was 7.8 (± 5) days; 97% of patients recovered with a resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks. Ageusia was the most commonly and significantly associated symptom with anosmia (66%, n = 45) followed by sore throat (41%), and rhinorrhea (28%). The symptoms in both the sexes were comparable. Absolute eosinophil count of <40/μL was observed in 59 patients (29.5%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 0 in 17 patients (8.5%). Among the 68 anosmic patients, 36 (47%) patients had eosinopenia, which was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Anosmia is an early and sometimes the only symptom in approximately one-third of the patients with COVID-19 infection. Eosinophil count should be checked in anosomic patient with suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Objective tools for olfactory and gustatory assessment should be brought into practice for early and prompt diagnosis to control the spread of the disease.","Kumar, Vinod; Singla, Sapna; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Bharati, Sachidanand Jee; Garg, Rakesh; Pandit, Anuja; Vig, Saurabh; Mishra, Seema; Bhatnagar, Sushma",J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol,85,20

However, the mechanisms driving cardiac injury and failure in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We performed plasma proteomics on 80 COVID-19 patients and controls, grouped according to disease severity and cardiac involvement. Findings were validated in 305 independent COVID-19 patients and investigated in an animal model. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory proteins, markers of biological aging, strongly associate with disease severity and cardiac involvement even in age-matched cohorts. FSTL3, an indicator of Activin/TGFβ signaling, was the most significantly upregulated protein associated with the heart failure biomarker, NTproBNP (β = 0.4;p(adj)=4.6x10(−7)), while ADAMTS13, a vWF-cleaving protease whose loss-of-function causes microvascular thrombosis, was the most downregulated protein associated with myocardial injury (β=−0.4;p(adj)=8x10(−7)). Mendelian randomization supported a causal role for ADAMTS13 in myocardial injury.

We emphasize that automated sequence data processing, management, and visualization should be an indispensable component of modern WGS and WES data analysis for sequence assembly, variant detection (SNPs, SVs), imputation, and resolution of haplotypes. In this manuscript, we present a newly developed findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) bioinformatics‐genomics pipeline Java based Whole Genome/Exome Sequence Data Processing Pipeline (JWES) for efficient variant discovery and interpretation, and big data modeling and visualization. JWES is a cross‐platform, user‐friendly, product line application, that entails three modules: (a) data processing, (b) storage, and (c) visualization. The data processing module performs a series of different tasks for variant calling, the data storage module efficiently manages high‐volume gene‐variant data, and the data visualization module supports variant data interpretation with Circos graphs. The performance of JWES was tested and validated in‐house with different experiments, using Microsoft Windows, macOS Big Sur, and UNIX operating systems. JWES is an open‐source and freely available pipeline, allowing scientists to take full advantage of all the computing resources available, without requiring much computer science knowledge. We have successfully applied JWES for processing, management, and gene‐variant discovery, annotation, prediction, and genotyping of WGS and WES data to analyze variable complex disorders. In summary, we report the performance of JWES with some reproducible case studies, using open access and in‐house generated, high‐quality datasets.","Ahmed, Zeeshan; Renart, Eduard Gibert; Mishra, Deepshikha; Zeeshan, Saman",FEBS Open Bio,85,16
