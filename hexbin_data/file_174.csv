403,On computational approaches for size-and-shape distributions from sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation,2009-10-06,"Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation has become a very popular technique to study size distributions and interactions of macromolecules. Recently, a method termed two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) for the determination of size-and-shape distributions was described by Demeler and colleagues (Eur Biophys J 2009). It is based on novel ideas conceived for fitting the integral equations of the size-and-shape distribution to experimental data, illustrated with an example but provided without proof of the principle of the algorithm. In the present work, we examine the 2DSA algorithm by comparison with the mathematical reference frame and simple well-known numerical concepts for solving Fredholm integral equations, and test the key assumptions underlying the 2DSA method in an example application. While the 2DSA appears computationally excessively wasteful, key elements also appear to be in conflict with mathematical results. This raises doubts about the correctness of the results from 2DSA analysis.","Schuck, Peter",Eur Biophys J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892069/,174
746,Viral Proteins Acquired from a Host Converge to Simplified Domain Architectures,2012-02-02,"The infection cycle of viruses creates many opportunities for the exchange of genetic material with the host. Many viruses integrate their sequences into the genome of their host for replication. These processes may lead to the virus acquisition of host sequences. Such sequences are prone to accumulation of mutations and deletions. However, in rare instances, sequences acquired from a host become beneficial for the virus. We searched for unexpected sequence similarity among the 900,000 viral proteins and all proteins from cellular organisms. Here, we focus on viruses that infect metazoa. The high-conservation analysis yielded 187 instances of highly similar viral-host sequences. Only a small number of them represent viruses that hijacked host sequences. The low-conservation sequence analysis utilizes the Pfam family collection. About 5% of the 12,000 statistical models archived in Pfam are composed of viral-metazoan proteins. In about half of Pfam families, we provide indirect support for the directionality from the host to the virus. The other families are either wrongly annotated or reflect an extensive sequence exchange between the viruses and their hosts. In about 75% of cross-taxa Pfam families, the viral proteins are significantly shorter than their metazoan counterparts. The tendency for shorter viral proteins relative to their related host proteins accounts for the acquisition of only a fragment of the host gene, the elimination of an internal domain and shortening of the linkers between domains. We conclude that, along viral evolution, the host-originated sequences accommodate simplified domain compositions. We postulate that the trimmed proteins act by interfering with the fundamental function of the host including intracellular signaling, post-translational modification, protein-protein interaction networks and cellular trafficking. We compiled a collection of hijacked protein sequences. These sequences are attractive targets for manipulation of viral infection.","Rappoport, Nadav; Linial, Michal",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271019/,174
753,Protein sequence analysis based on hydropathy profile of amino acids,2012-01-27,"Biology sequence comparison is a fundamental task in computational biology. According to the hydropathy profile of amino acids, a protein sequence is taken as a string with three letters. Three curves of the new protein sequence were defined to describe the protein sequence. A new method to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequence was proposed based on the conditional probability of the protein sequence. Finally, the protein sequences of ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6) protein of eight species were taken as an example to illustrate the new approach. The results demonstrated that the method is convenient and efficient.","Xie, Xiao-li; Zheng, Li-fei; Yu, Ying; Liang, Li-ping; Guo, Man-cai; Song, John; Yuan, Zhi-fa",Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3274743?pdf=render,174
1000,Predicting pseudoknotted structures across two RNA sequences,2012-12-01,"Motivation: Laboratory RNA structure determination is demanding and costly and thus, computational structure prediction is an important task. Single sequence methods for RNA secondary structure prediction are limited by the accuracy of the underlying folding model, if a structure is supported by a family of evolutionarily related sequences, one can be more confident that the prediction is accurate. RNA pseudoknots are functional elements, which have highly conserved structures. However, few comparative structure prediction methods can handle pseudoknots due to the computational complexity. Results: A comparative pseudoknot prediction method called DotKnot-PW is introduced based on structural comparison of secondary structure elements and H-type pseudoknot candidates. DotKnot-PW outperforms other methods from the literature on a hand-curated test set of RNA structures with experimental support. Availability: DotKnot-PW and the RNA structure test set are available at the web site http://dotknot.csse.uwa.edu.au/pw.

1346,ESCRT regulates surface expression of the Kir2.1 potassium channel,2014-01-15,"Protein quality control (PQC) is required to ensure cellular health. PQC is recognized for targeting the destruction of defective polypeptides, whereas regulated protein degradation mechanisms modulate the concentration of specific proteins in concert with physiological demands. For example, ion channel levels are physiologically regulated within tight limits, but a system-wide approach to define which degradative systems are involved is lacking. We focus on the Kir2.1 potassium channel because altered Kir2.1 levels lead to human disease and Kir2.1 restores growth on low-potassium medium in yeast mutated for endogenous potassium channels. Using this system, first we find that Kir2.1 is targeted for endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). Next a synthetic gene array identifies nonessential genes that negatively regulate Kir2.1. The most prominent gene family that emerges from this effort encodes members of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). ERAD and ESCRT also mediate Kir2.1 degradation in human cells, with ESCRT playing a more prominent role. Thus multiple proteolytic pathways control Kir2.1 levels at the plasma membrane.","Kolb, Alexander R.; Needham, Patrick G.; Rothenberg, Cari; Guerriero, Christopher J.; Welling, Paul A.; Brodsky, Jeffrey L.",Mol Biol Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890348/,174
1514,A fast and robust iterative algorithm for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structures,2014-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Improving accuracy and efficiency of computational methods that predict pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures is an ongoing challenge. Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information. RESULTS: We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster.

1730,"Detection of rickettsial DNA in ticks and wild boars in Kyoto City, Japan",2014-10-08,"The tick is a well-known vector for arthropod-borne pathogens, such as tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, Japanese spotted fever and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. It is therefore important to know the tick population and distribution in our environment and wild animals in order to prevent tick-borne diseases. Here, we report the results of tick surveillance from May to September 2011 at 14 geographical points and in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City, Kyoto prefecture, Japan. We collected 3,198 ticks comprising 5 tick species, Haemaphysalis (H.) longicornis, H. flava, H. kitaokai, Amblyomma testudinarium and Dermacentor taiwanensis. Interestingly, the proportion of tick species varied according to geographical region within the city. The ticks collected in the city were reported as potential vectors of pathogens, such as rickettsiosis. We detected rickettsial DNA by PCR in 71.1% of 201 ticks investigated. The ticks that carried rickettsiae were distributed across the whole the city. The sequences of PCR-amplified DNA fragments were determined and showed similarities to spotted fever group rickettsiae. Although their pathogenicity for animals including humans is still unclear, it is important to stay alert and pay attention to tick-borne diseases in order to ensure the safety of the citizens of the city as well as that of visitors.","SOMEYA, Azusa; ITO, Ryuki; MAEDA, Akihiko; IKENAGA, Mitsuhiro",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4347921/,174

2535,Role of Eukaryotic Initiation Factors during Cellular Stress and Cancer Progression,2016-12-19,"Protein synthesis can be segmented into distinct phases comprising mRNA translation initiation, elongation, and termination. Translation initiation is a highly regulated and rate-limiting step of protein synthesis that requires more than 12 eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Extensive evidence shows that the transcriptome and corresponding proteome do not invariably correlate with each other in a variety of contexts. In particular, translation of mRNAs specific to angiogenesis, tumor development, and apoptosis is altered during physiological and pathophysiological stress conditions. In cancer cells, the expression and functions of eIFs are hampered, resulting in the inhibition of global translation and enhancement of translation of subsets of mRNAs by alternative mechanisms. A precise understanding of mechanisms involving eukaryotic initiation factors leading to differential protein expression can help us to design better strategies to diagnose and treat cancer. The high spatial and temporal resolution of translation control can have an immediate effect on the microenvironment of the cell in comparison with changes in transcription. The dysregulation of mRNA translation mechanisms is increasingly being exploited as a target to treat cancer. In this review, we will focus on this context by describing both canonical and noncanonical roles of eIFs, which alter mRNA translation.","Sharma, Divya Khandige; Bressler, Kamiko; Patel, Harshil; Balasingam, Nirujah; Thakor, Nehal",J Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204094/,174
2921,Seasonal recurrence of cowpox virus outbreaks in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus),2017-11-09,"Cowpox virus infections in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with high morbidity and mortality have already been reported in the UK and Russia in the 1970s. However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds.","Stagegaard, Julia; Kurth, Andreas; Stern, Daniel; Dabrowski, Piotr Wojciech; Pocknell, Ann; Nitsche, Andreas; Schrick, Livia",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679633/,174
3558,Predicting wildlife reservoirs and global vulnerability to zoonotic Flaviviruses,2018-12-21,Flaviviruses continue to cause globally relevant epidemics and have emerged or re-emerged in regions that were previously unaffected. Factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood. Here we identify potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks. We evaluate variability in wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct clusters with similar hosts. Models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host characteristics. The combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease surveillance in animals and humans.,"Pandit, Pranav S.; Doyle, Megan M.; Smart, Katrina M.; Young, Cristin C.

3567,Degeneracy and genetic assimilation in RNA evolution,2018-12-27,"BACKGROUND: The neutral theory of Motoo Kimura stipulates that evolution is mostly driven by neutral mutations. However adaptive pressure eventually leads to changes in phenotype that involve non-neutral mutations. The relation between neutrality and adaptation has been studied in the context of RNA before and here we further study transitional mutations in the context of degenerate (plastic) RNA sequences and genetic assimilation. We propose quasineutral mutations, i.e. mutations which preserve an element of the phenotype set, as minimal mutations and study their properties. We also propose a general probabilistic interpretation of genetic assimilation and specialize it to the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA sequences. RESULTS: We show that degenerate sequences i.e. sequences with more than one structure at the MFE level have the highest evolvability among all sequences and are central to evolutionary innovation. Degenerate sequences also tend to cluster together in the sequence space. The selective pressure in an evolutionary simulation causes the population to move towards regions with more degenerate sequences, i.e. regions at the intersection of different neutral networks, and this causes the number of such sequences to increase well beyond the average percentage of degenerate sequences in the sequence space. We also observe that evolution by quasineutral mutations tends to conserve the number of base pairs in structures and thereby maintains structural integrity even in the presence of pressure to the contrary. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that degenerate RNA sequences play a major role in evolutionary adaptation.","Rezazadegan, Reza; Reidys, Christian",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307299/,174
3761,"A Systematic Review of Phytochemistry, Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics on Astragali Radix: Implications for Astragali Radix as a Personalized Medicine",2019-03-22,"Astragali radix (AR) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Modern pharmacological studies and clinical practices indicate that AR possesses various biological functions, including potent immunomodulation, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and antitumor activities. To date, more than 200 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from AR. Among them, isoflavonoids, saponins and polysaccharides are the three main types of beneficial compounds responsible for its pharmacological activities and therapeutic efficacy. After ingestion of AR, the metabolism and biotransformation of the bioactive compounds were extensive in vivo. The isoflavonoids and saponins and their metabolites are the major type of constituents absorbed in plasma. The bioavailability barrier (BB), which is mainly composed of efflux transporters and conjugating enzymes, is expected to have a significant impact on the bioavailability of AR. This review summarizes studies on the phytochemistry, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics on AR. Additionally, the use of AR as a personalized medicine based on the BB is also discussed, which may provide beneficial information to achieve a better and more accurate therapeutic response of AR in clinical practice.","Guo, Zhenzhen; Lou, Yanmei; Kong, Muyan; Luo, Qing; Liu, Zhongqiu; Wu, Jinjun",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470777/,174

AMP can be inhibited by linear pentapeptides isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA08 (MG7XX). Porcine AMP inhibition—a model for human AMP—activity was spectrophotometrically measured by the formation of p-nitroanilide from L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate by AMP. AMP inhibition by MG770 exhibited comparable inhibition levels to amastatin (IC(50) values: 1.20 ± 0.1 μM and 0.98 ± 0.1 μM, respectively), while MG756 was slightly less potent (with IC(50) values of 3.26 ± 0.5 μM).

4389,"Identification of ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 as TonB-dependent receptors in the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strain DE205B",2020-01-23,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a pathotype of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, causes one of the most serious infectious diseases of poultry and shares some common virulence genes with neonatal meningitis-associated E. coli. TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are ubiquitous outer membrane β-barrel proteins; they play an important role in the recognition of siderophores during iron uptake. Here, in the APEC strain DE205B, we investigated the role of four putative TBDRs—ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235—in iron uptake. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes directly interact with TonB. Moreover, the expression levels of all four genes were significantly upregulated under iron-depleted conditions compared with iron-rich conditions. The expression levels of several iron uptake-related genes were significantly increased in the ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 deletion strains, with the upregulation being the most prominent in the ireA deletion mutant. Furthermore, iron uptake by the ireA deletion strain was significantly increased compared to that by the wild-type strain. Moreover, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to study the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs. We found that regardless of the presence of tonB, the expression levels of the genes encoding the four TBDRs were regulated by fur. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 indeed encode TBDRs, with ireA having the most important role in iron uptake. These results should help future studies explore the mechanisms underlying the TonB-dependent iron uptake pathway.","Zhang, Zhonghua; Jiang, Shan; Liu, Yun; Sun, Yu; Yu, Peixin; Gong, Qianwen; Zeng, Hang; Li, Yihao; Xue, Feng; Zhuge, Xiangkai; Ren, Jianluan; Dai, Jianjun; Tang, Fang",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979363/,174

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients.

This pathogen affects mostly young grapevines, but is also implicated in esca disease of older grapevines. Little is known about the disease cycle of this fungus. Infected propagation material was identified as a major means of dissemination of the pathogen. Recently, the pathogen was also detected from soil in South Africa and airborne conidia have been found in vineyards. The aim of this study was to use a molecular detection technique to test different samples collected from nurseries in South Africa at different nursery stages for the presence of P. chlamydospora. A one-tube nested-PCR technique was optimised for detecting P. chlamydospora in DNA extracted from soil, water, callusing medium and grapevine wood. The one-tube nested-PCR was sensitive enough to detect as little as 1 fg of P. chlamydospora genomic DNA from water and 10 fg from wood, callusing medium and soil. PCR analyses of the different nursery samples revealed the presence of several putative 360 bp P. chlamydospora specific bands. Subsequent sequence analyses and/or restriction enzyme digestions of all 360 bp PCR bands confirmed that all bands were P. chlamydospora specific, except for five bands obtained from callusing media and one from water. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora was positively detected in 25% of rootstock cane sections collected from mother blocks, 42% of rootstock cuttings and 16% of scion cuttings collected during grafting, 40% of water samples collected after pre-storage hydration, 67% of water samples collected during grafting, 8% of callusing medium samples and 17% of soil samples collected from mother blocks. These media can therefore be considered as possible inoculum sources of the pathogen during the nursery stages.","Retief, E.; McLeod, A.; Fourie, P.

However, the interpretation of nanoindentation experiments is often difficult, requiring the support of theoretical and simulation analysis. Here we present a ‘Virtual AFM’ (VAFM), a Brownian Dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained model of virus aimed to mimic the standard setup of atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments. Despite the heavy level of coarse-graining, these simulations provide valuable information which is not accessible in experiments. Rather than focusing on a specific virus, the VAFM will be used to analyze how the mechanical response and breaking of viruses depend on different parameters controlling the effective interactions between capsid’s structural units. In particular, we will discuss the influence of adsorption, the tip radius, and the rigidity and shape of the shell on its mechanical response.","Aznar, María; Roca-Bonet, Sergi; Reguera, David",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104910/,174
7152,D-xylose absorption as a measurement of malabsorption in poult enteritis and mortality syndrome,2000-05-01,"Coccidiosis is an economically significant disease of poultry caused by species of Eimeria, a parasitic protozoan. Disease can result in poor feed conversion, reduced weight gain, and can lead to the development of necrotic enteritis. For prevention of coccidiosis, poultry are commonly vaccinated with a live, sporulated oocysts mass applied with a vaccination cabinet in the hatchery. Traditionally, coccidia vaccines have been applied by coarse spray in a water based diluent, however, new technology using gel diluents has entered the US market. Gel diluents can have variable viscosities and are “dropped” onto chicks with an applicator bar. It is thought that gel droplets remain intact on the birds for longer than water based droplets, allowing more time for preening and ingestion of oocysts. In this experiment, the efficacy of a commercial coccidia vaccine applied with a water based diluent, a more viscous gel diluent, and a less viscous gel diluent was compared. Fecal samples were collected at multiple time points post-vaccination to quantify vaccine oocyst shedding. Shedding in the first cycle (days 5 to 8 post-vaccination) was related to the number of oocysts received from each application method, where the groups receiving higher doses shed more oocysts. However, a decrease in shedding was seen for the more viscous gel group in the second cycle (days 12 to 15 post-vaccination). Chickens were challenged with Eimeria maxima oocysts and 7 days post-challenge body weight gains and gross and microscopic lesions were recorded to evaluate protection levels for the different vaccine applications. All vaccinated groups appeared to be protected based on body weight gain and lesion scoring. The results of this project indicate that all vaccine applications are effective at protecting against Eimeria maxima challenge when using a proper dose of vaccine that allows for repeated oocyst cycling in the litter post-vaccination.","Albanese, Grace A; Tensa, Laura R; Aston, Emily J; Hilt, Deborah A; Jordan, Brian J",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107172/,174

Forty-nine infants received vaccine; 55 received placebo. Rotavirus disease during this season was predominantly caused by a serotype 1 strain. In placebo recipients there were 14 cases of rotavirus diarrhea (attack rate, 25%); 11 were moderate to severe (attack rate, 20%). Vaccinees experienced only three cases of rotavirus disease (attack rate, 6.1%), all mild. When all cases (whether associated with rotavirus or not) of clinically significant diarrhea (CSD) were evaluated, WC3 vaccine provided statistically significant (P < .01) protection against the total number of episodes of CSD and reduced the number of days of CSD-associated diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or illness. Seventy-one percent of theWC3vaccinated infants had serum antibody responses to the vaccine. The 14 placebo recipients who experienced natural disease predominantly had antibody responses to serotype 1. Sera taken after the rotavirus season revealed a nearly identical rate (40%) of natural rotavirus infection in the vaccinated and placebo groups.","Clark, H Fred; Horian, Frances E.; Bell, Louis M.; Modesto, Karen; Gouvea, Vera; Plotkin, Stanley A.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110070/,174

Aminopeptidase N and neutral endopeptidase are detected on the endometrial stromal cells and decidual cells, while dipeptidyl peptidase IV is detected on the endometrial glandular cells and surface epithelium. As these cell surface peptidases can degrade a variety of biologically-active peptides including cytokines and growth factors, they are considered to be involved in the local metabolism of these molecules. In addition, recent studies have indicated that they are involved in local immune responses, cell attachment, and cellular maturation/differentiation of endometrial cells, and suggest an important role of these endometrial cell surface peptidases in implantation processes.","Imai, Kimitoshi; Kanzaki, Hideharu; Mori, Takahide",Mol Hum Reprod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117266/,174

Rotavirus was detected in 78% (106136) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in 1.5% of the samples (2136) obtained from sick calves. In comparison rotavirus was identified in only 1.6% (163) of the samples from clinically healthy calves. The rotavirus strain responsible for the outbreak was characterized as serotype 6 belonging to group A. In the following three years the protective capacity of a combined rotavirus—E. coli inactivated vaccines administered to the dams during the last third of the gestation period was evaluated on this farm by comparison of morbidity due to diarrhea in calves from vaccinated vs. placebo cows within the same year. The morbidity due to diarrhea among calves from dams in the vaccinated and placebo groups was 34% and 77%, respectively in 1986; 23% and 47% in 1987, and 15% and 34%, in 1988. In 1987 morbidity of diarrhea in calves born from vaccinated heifers was 54% and 74% in calves from placebo heifers. In 1988 morbidity from diarrhea was 41% and 54%, respectively among calves in these two groups. In all experiments, calves from heifers showed significantly greater morbidity than calves from cows. Differences in diarrhea morbidity between the vaccinated and placebo groups were statistically significant (P<0.05).

7676,Interaction of rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in conventionally-reared dairy calves,2002-11-12,"Malaria is a major infectious disease. In the last 10 years it has killed more than 20 million people, mainly small children in Africa. The highly efficacious artemisinine combination therapy is being launched globally, constituting the main hope for fighting the disease. Amodiaquine is a main partner in these combinations. Amodiaquine is almost entirely metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 2C8 to the pharmacologically active desethylamodiaquine. The question remains whether the efficacy of amodiaquine is affected by the gene polymorphism. Genotype-inferred low metabolizers are found in 1–4% of African populations, which corresponds to millions of expected exposures to the drug. In vivo pharmacokinetic data on amodiaquine is limited. By combining it with published in vitro pharmacodynamic and drug metabolism information, we review and predict the possible relevance, or lack of, of CYP2C8 polymorphisms in the present and future efficacy of amodiaquine.

E. coli isolates were examined for virulence genes (f5, f41, f17, sta, stb, lt, eae, vt) using PCR and the prevalence of E. coli virulence profiles was spatially described in terms of spatial distribution. A total of 30.1 % isolates were found to be positive for at least one of the virulence genes. Depending on the different gene combinations present, 11 virulence profiles were found. Most of the isolates analyzed had a single gene, and no combination of fimbrial and enterotoxin gene was predominant. There was no association between the frequency and distribution of E. coli virulence genes and calf health status. Most of the virulence profiles were compatible with ETEC strains and showed a homogeneous distribution over the sampled area. A clustering pattern for E. coli virulence profiles could not be recognized.

Clinical symptoms, prospects for zoonotic infection, and control methods other than the use of antimicrobials are considered. Recommendations to avoid disease transmission include taking steps to ensure the provision of clean, unstressful environments to reduce disease susceptibility and the careful handling and spreading of manure from animals at high risk for infection, especially young calves. Composting and drying of manure decrease the number of viable pathogens. Environmental controls, such as filter strips, also reduce the risk of water contamination.","Pell, Alice N.",J Dairy Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130904/,174

However, that role is not clear for grasslands where most precipitation falls during the growing season when the demand for water is high. Our question was: Does litter affect forage production in such an environment? Location: Typical steppe, Inner Mongolia. Methods: We examined the role of plant litter in two experiments where litter was either removed or added in a protected or heavily grazed site, respectively, in autumn and in spring in a split plot design. The treatments (control, moderate and heavy litter application) were applied once in five replications but repeated at new locations in each of 3 years. This was done to examine only the direct effect of litter on annual net primary production and selected plant characteristics and not potential secondary effects. We also measured soil moisture and soil temperature. Results: Removing litter caused a reduction in the amount of grass (Leymus chinensis) that was produced, but litter addition caused an inconsistent effect among years, with moderate applications producing the most positive effects. Litter removal resulted in shorter and less dense plants of L. chinensis and Carex duriuscula, while heavy litter addition in autumn reduced plant height of both Cleistogenes squarrosa and C. duriuscula. Conclusions: Litter was effective for enhancing soil moisture status and reducing soil heat units in the typical steppe of Inner Mongolia.

10393,Viral proteases as targets for chemotherapeutic intervention,2004-08-26,"Ste24, an integral membrane protein zinc metalloprotease, is found in every kingdom of eukaryotes. It was discovered approximately 20 years ago by yeast genetic screens identifying it as a factor responsible for processing the yeast mating a-factor pheromone. In animals, Ste24 processes prelamin A, a component of the nuclear lamina; mutations in the human ortholog of Ste24 diminish its activity, giving rise to genetic diseases of accelerated aging (progerias). Additionally, lipodystrophy, acquired from the standard highly active antiretroviral therapy used to treat AIDS patients, likely results from off-target interactions of HIV (aspartyl) protease inhibitor drugs with Ste24. Ste24 possesses a novel “α-barrel” structure, consisting of a ring of seven transmembrane α-helices enclosing a large (> 12,000 Å(3)) interior volume that contains the active-site and substrate-binding region; this “membrane-interior reaction chamber” is unprecedented in integral membrane protein structures. Additionally, the surface of the membrane-interior reaction chamber possesses a strikingly large negative electrostatic surface potential, adding additional “functional mystery.” Recent publications implicate Ste24 as a key factor in several endoplasmic reticulum processes, including the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum, and removal of misfolded proteins from the translocon. Ste24, with its provocative structure, enigmatic mechanism, and recently emergent new biological roles including “translocon unclogger” and (non-enyzmatic) broad-spectrum viral restriction factor, presents far differently than before 2016, when it was viewed as a “CAAX protease” responsible for cleavage of prenylated (farnesylated or geranylgeranylated) substrates.

10419,Master author index,2001-11-12,"Background: Respiratory infections result from invasion of the respiratory tract, mainly by viruses, and are the leading cause of acute morbidity in individuals of all ages worldwide. During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness. Objective: This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection. Methods: Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly, otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Conclusions: Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.","Monto, Arnold S.; Fendrick, A.Mark; Sarnes, Matthew W.",Clin Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172950/,174

The aim of this study was to identify differences between incidence rates, risk factors, clinical presentations, and outcomes of candidemia in SOT recipients and non‐SOT patients. Data from the multicenter prospective Australian Candidaemia Study were examined. From August 2001 to July 2004, 24 episodes (2.2%; 24/1068) of candidemia were identified in SOT recipients. During this period, the numbers of transplanted organs included liver (n=455), kidney (n=1605), single lung (n=57), bilateral lung (n=183), heart and lung (n=18), heart (n=157), and pancreas (n=62). The overall annual estimated incidence of candidemia in SOT recipients was higher (3 per 1000 transplant admissions) than in non‐SOT patients (incidence 0.21 per 1000 admissions; P<0.001). The incidence and timing of candidemia post transplant was influenced by the transplanted organ type, with the majority of episodes (n=14, 54%) occurring >6 months after renal transplantation. Risk factors for candidemia in the month preceding diagnosis were similar to non‐SOT recipients except for corticosteroid therapy (P<0.001). Antifungal prophylaxis did not select for more resistant or non‐albicans Candida species in the SOT group. The 30‐day all‐cause mortality was similar to non‐SOT patients with candidemia and remains high at 21%. All deaths in SOT recipients occurred early (within 5 days of diagnosis), underlining a need for better diagnostic tests, targeted prevention, and early treatment strategies.","Van Hal, S.J.; Marriott, D.J.E.; Chen, S.C.A.; Nguyen, Q.; Sorrell, T.C.; Ellis, D.H.; Slavin, M.A.",Transpl Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190180/,174

10816,Strain-specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of heat-labile toxin expression by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,2020-02-03,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a serious clinical problem with the main treatment being supportive in the form of mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation can be a double-edged sword: if set improperly, it can exacerbate the tissue damage caused by ARDS; this is known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). To minimize VILI, we must understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tissue damage at the alveolar level. In this Physiology in Medicine paper, the dynamic physiology of alveolar inflation and deflation during mechanical ventilation will be reviewed. In addition, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of VILI will be reviewed, and this knowledge will be used to suggest an optimal mechanical breath profile (MB(P): all airway pressures, volumes, flows, rates, and the duration that they are applied at both inspiration and expiration) necessary to minimize VILI. Our review suggests that the current protective ventilation strategy, known as the “open lung strategy,” would be the optimal lung-protective approach. However, the viscoelastic behavior of dynamic alveolar inflation and deflation has not yet been incorporated into protective mechanical ventilation strategies. Using our knowledge of dynamic alveolar mechanics (i.e., the dynamic change in alveolar and alveolar duct size and shape during tidal ventilation) to modify the MB(P) so as to minimize VILI will reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with ARDS.","Nieman, Gary F.; Satalin, Josh; Kollisch-Singule, Michaela; Andrews, Penny; Aiash, Hani; Habashi, Nader M.; Gatto, Louis A.",J Appl Physiol (1985),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203565/,174
11287,A seven-gene-deleted African swine fever virus is safe and effective as a live attenuated vaccine in pigs,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) to treat obesity and associated comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, is well established. As diabetes may add risk to the perioperative period, we sought to characterize perioperative outcomes of these surgical procedures in diabetic patients. METHODS: Using the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database, we identified patients who underwent LSG and LRYGB between 2015 and 2017, grouping by non-diabetics (NDM), non-insulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM), and insulin-dependent diabetics (IDDM). Primary outcomes included serious adverse events, 30-day readmission, 30-day reoperation, and 30-day mortality. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the outcome in each diabetic cohort. RESULTS: Multivariable analysis of patients who underwent LSG (with NDM patients as reference) showed higher 30-day mortality (NIDDM AOR = 1.52, p = 0.043; IDDM AOR = 1.91, p = 0.007) and risk of serious adverse events (NIDDM AOR = 1.15, p < 0.001; IDDM AOR = 1.58, p < 0.001) in the diabetic versus NDM groups. Multivariable analysis of patients who underwent LRYGB (with NDM patients as reference) showed higher risk of serious adverse events (NIDDM AOR = 1.09, p = 0.014; IDDM AOR = 1.43, p < 0.001) in the diabetic versus NDM groups. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetics who underwent LSG and LRYGB had higher rates of several perioperative complications compared with non-diabetics. IDDM had a stronger association with several perioperative complications compared with NIDDM. This increase in morbidity and mortality is modest and should be weighed against the real benefits of bariatric surgery in patient with obesity and diabetes mellitus.","Leonard-Murali, Shravan; Nasser, Hassan; Ivanics, Tommy; Shakaroun, Dania; Genaw, Jeffrey",Obes Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223599/,174

Advances in the sequencing and functional characterization of both pathogen and host genomes have provided a wealth of knowledge to clinicians, epidemiologists and public health responders during outbreaks of high-consequence viral disease. Here, we describe how genomics has been historically used to investigate Ebola virus disease outbreaks and how new technologies allow for rapid, large-scale data generation at the point of care. We highlight how genomics extends beyond consensus-level sequencing of the virus to include intra-host viral transcriptomics and the characterization of host responses in acute and persistently infected patients. Similar genomics techniques can also be applied to the characterization of non-human primate animal models and to known natural reservoirs of filoviruses, and metagenomic sequencing can be the key to the discovery of novel filoviruses. Finally, we outline the importance of reverse genetics systems that can swiftly characterize filoviruses as soon as their genome sequences are available.","Di Paola, Nicholas; Sanchez-Lockhart, Mariano; Zeng, Xiankun; Kuhn, Jens H.; Palacios, Gustavo",Nat Rev Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223634/,174

METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of neonates <29 weeks gestational age (GA) born at Parkland Hospital from 08/2009 to 08/2012. Infants were stratified as follows: Group 1: no significant placental pathology; Group 2: single significant placental lesion; and Group 3: ≥2 placental lesions (multiple lesions). Primary outcome was death and/or BPD. Two-year neurodevelopmental follow-up was compared. RESULTS: In all, 42% (100/241) of infants had one placental lesion, and 34% (82/241) ≥2 lesions. As the number of the pathologic lesions increased (no lesions vs. 1 vs. ≥2), the occurrence of death or BPD increased (25%, 37%, and 52%, respectively; P = 0.004). Moreover, infants with multiple pathologic lesions were more likely to have NDI (29%, 29%, and 46%, respectively; P = 0.03). After logistic regression, infants with multiple pathologic lesions were more likely to develop moderate-to-severe BPD [P < 0.01; OR 3.9 (1.5–10.1)] but not NDI. CONCLUSION(S): Neonates <29 weeks GA with multiple placental pathologic lesions have an increased risk for developing BPD, suggesting an interaction between placental inflammation and vascular pathology and the pathogenesis of BPD; however, the risk of NDI is not increased.","Mir, Imran N.; Chalak, Lina F.; Brown, L.

11444,Progress in research and application development of surface display technology using Bacillus subtilis spores,2020-01-27,"PURPOSE: The present case–control study was conducted to evaluate whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) can reduce the need for perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion (ABT) and affect the incidence of perioperative complications in free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational study included the perioperative data of 123 patients who underwent free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck following oncological surgery. Patients were divided into the following two groups according to whether they received ANH: ANH group and non-ANH group. We investigated whether ANH can reduce the need for perioperative ABT using propensity score-adjusted logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients, 113 patients were assessed; 57 patients were in the ANH group and 56 patients were in the non-ANH group. The rate [ANH group vs. non-ANH group, n (%): 2 (3.5%) vs. 23 (41.1%), p < 0.0001] and amount [median (IQR): 0 mL (0, 0) vs. 0 mL (0, 280), p < 0.0001] of ABT were significantly lower in the ANH group than in the non-ANH group. Propensity score-adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ANH use [odds ratio (OR): 0.040; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.005, 0.320; p = 0.0024)] was one of the independent predictors of perioperative ABT. There were no significant differences in the incidences of post-operative complications between the two groups. CONCLUSION: ANH use can reduce the need for perioperative ABT in patients undergoing free-flap reconstruction of the head and neck without increasing the incidence of post-operative complications.","Takekawa, Daiki; Saito, Junichi; Kinoshita, Hirotaka; Hashiba, Eij i; Hirai, Naoki; Yamazaki, Yuma; Kushikata, Tetsuya; Hirota, Kazuyoshi",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223952/,174

These natural products usually exist in plants as glycosides, and their glycosylation has a remarkable influence on their pharmacokinetic properties. The glycosyltransferases UGT71G1 and UGT73C8 from Medicago truncatula are excellent reagents for the regioselective glycosylation of (iso)flavonoids in Escherichia coli grown in Terrific broth. Ten to 20 mg/L of either genistein or biochanin A 7-O-glucoside was produced after feeding genistein or biochanin A to E. coli expressing UGT71G1, and similar levels of luteolin 4’-O- and 7-O-glucosides were produced after feeding luteolin to cultures expressing UGT73C8. For the production of kaempferol 3-O-glucoside or quercetin 3-O-glucoside, the Phe148Val or Tyr202Ala mutants of UGT71G1 were employed. Ten to 16 mg/L of either kaempferol 3-O- or quercetin 3-O-glucosides were produced on feeding kaempferol or quercetin to E. coli expressing these enzymes. More than 90% of the glucoside products were released to the medium, facilitating their isolation.

12212,Improved p-hydroxybenzoate production by engineered Pseudomonas putida S12 by using a mixed-substrate feeding strategy,2011-02-02,"We investigated the use of bacterial cells isolated from paddy crab for the extraction of oil from Jatropha seed kernels in aqueous media while simultaneously preserving the protein structures of this protein-rich endosperm. A bacterial strain—which was marked as MB4 and identified by means of 16S rDNA sequencing and physiological characterization as either Bacillus pumilus or Bacillus altitudinis—enhanced the extraction yield of Jatropha oil. The incubation of an MB4 starter culture with preheated kernel slurry in aqueous media with the initial pH of 5.5 at 37 °C for 6 h liberated 73% w/w of the Jatropha oil. Since MB4 produces xylanases, it is suggested that strain MB4 facilitates oil liberation via degradation of hemicelluloses which form the oil-containing cell wall structure of the kernel. After MB4 assisted oil extraction, SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the majority of Jatropha proteins were preserved in the solid phase of the extraction residues. The advantages offered by this process are: protein in the residue can be further processed for other applications, no purified enzyme preparation is needed, and the resulting oil can be used for biodiesel production.","Marasabessy, Ahmad; Moeis, Maelita R.; Sanders, Johan P.

12218,"Best practices in heterotrophic high-cell-density microalgal processes: achievements, potential and possible limitations",2011-05-13,"In this study, dideoxy sequencing and 454 high-throughput sequencing were used to analyze diversities of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes and the 16S rRNA genes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in six municipal wastewater treatment plants. The results showed that AOB amoA genes were quite diverse in different wastewater treatment plants while the 16S rRNA genes were relatively conserved. Based on the observed complexity of amoA and 16S rRNA genes, most of the AOB can be assigned to the Nitrosomonas genus, with Nitrosomonas ureae, Nitrosomonas oligotropha, Nitrosomonas marina, and Nitrosomonas aestuarii being the four most dominant species. From the sequences of the AOA amoA genes, most AOA observed in this study belong to the CGI.1b group, i.e., the soil lineage. The AOB amoA and 16S rRNA genes were quantified by quantitative PCR and 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing, respectively. Although the results from the two approaches show some disconcordance, they both indicated that the abundance of AOB in activated sludge was very low.

12288,Erratum: Lateral forces on circularly polarizable particles near a surface,2015-12-14,"BACKGROUND: Autopsy of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young shows a structurally and histologically normal heart in about one third of cases. Sudden death in these cases is believed to be attributed in a high percentage to inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of performing post-mortem genetic analysis for autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death (SUD) in 1 to 35 year olds. METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 2009 to December 2011, samples from 15 cases suffering SUD were referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics, Umeå University Hospital, Sweden, for molecular genetic evaluation. PCR and bidirectional Sanger sequencing of genes important for long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome type 1 (BrS1), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, and RYR2) was performed. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to detect large deletions or duplications in the LQTS genes. Six pathogenic sequence variants (four LQTS and two CPVT) were discovered in 15 SUD cases (40 %). Ten first-degree family members were found to be mutation carriers (seven LQTS and three CPVT). CONCLUSION: Cardiac ion channel genetic testing in autopsy-negative sudden death victims has a high diagnostic yield, with identification of the disease in 40 % of families. First-degree family members should be offered predictive testing, clinical evaluation, and treatment with the ultimate goal to prevent sudden death.","Stattin, Eva-Lena; Westin, Ida Maria; Cederquist, Kristina; Jonasson, Jenni; Jonsson, Björn-Anders; Mörner, Stellan; Norberg, Anna; Krantz, Peter; Wisten, Aase",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712238/,174

Some results seem to indicate no correlation between CVT and the biological profile of the individual, whereas other results suggest that CVT measurements might be useful for identification purposes. This study assesses the correlation between CVT and body weight, stature, age, sex, and ancestry by reviewing data of 1097 forensic autopsies performed at the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). In subadults (younger than 19 years of age at the time of death), all frontal, temporal, and occipital CVT measurements correlated moderately to strongly with indicators of growth (body weight, stature, and age). Neither sex nor ancestry correlated significantly with cranial thickness. In adults, body weight correlated with all CVT measurements. No meaningful correlation was found between CVT and stature or age. Females showed to have thicker frontal bones, and the occipital region was thicker in the Negroid subsample. All correlation in the adult group was weak, with the distribution of cranial thickness overlapping for a great deal between the groups. Based on these results, it was concluded that CVT generally cannot be used as an indicator for any part of the biological profile.","De Boer, H. H. (Hans); Van der Merwe, A. E.

Inter-observer variability of both protocols was determined. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Institutional review board approval was obtained; informed consent was waived. MR arthrograms, including oblique axial fat suppressed T1-weighted images in ABER position and conventional imaging directions of 250 patients (170 men, 80 women; mean age, 36 years), were retrospectively and independently evaluated by three reviewers. Reviewers were blinded to clinical information and arthroscopic results. Labroligamentous lesions were registered in both ABER and MRa. The lesions were sub-classified (Bankart, Perthes, anterior labrum periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) or lesions not otherwise specified). Inter-observer agreement was assessed by Kappa statistics for all 250 patients. Ninety-two of 250 patients underwent arthroscopy. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ABER versus conventional MR arthrography were calculated and compared using paired McNemar test. RESULTS: Kappa values of the ABER and conventional MR arthrography ranged from 0.44 to 0.56 and 0.44 to 0.62, respectively. According to arthroscopy, 45 of 92 patients had an intact anteroinferior labrum, and in 44 patients, a labroligamentous lesion (eight Bankart, seven Perthes, 29 ALPSA and three lesions not otherwise specified) was diagnosed. There were no statistically significant differences between ABER and conventional MR arthrography regarding sensitivity (85–89%, 89–96%), specificity (82–91%, 84–89%) and overall accuracy (50–62%, 53–63%). CONCLUSION: The results of a single MR arthrography series in ABER position are comparable with those of conventional MR arthrography for detecting anteroinferior labroligamentous lesions.","Schreinemachers, Saskia A.; van der Hulst, Victor P.

15222,"Green Synthesis of Selenium and Tellurium Nanoparticles: Current Trends, Biological Properties and Biomedical Applications",2021-01-20,"Single-Sample Face Recognition (SSFR) is a computer vision challenge. In this scenario, there is only one example from each individual on which to train the system, making it difficult to identify persons in unconstrained environments, mainly when dealing with changes in facial expression, posture, lighting, and occlusion. This paper discusses the relevance of an original method for SSFR, called Multi-Block Color-Binarized Statistical Image Features (MB-C-BSIF), which exploits several kinds of features, namely, local, regional, global, and textured-color characteristics. First, the MB-C-BSIF method decomposes a facial image into three channels (e.g., red, green, and blue), then it divides each channel into equal non-overlapping blocks to select the local facial characteristics that are consequently employed in the classification phase. Finally, the identity is determined by calculating the similarities among the characteristic vectors adopting a distance measurement of the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) classifier. Extensive experiments on several subsets of the unconstrained Alex and Robert (AR) and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases show that the MB-C-BSIF achieves superior and competitive results in unconstrained situations when compared to current state-of-the-art methods, especially when dealing with changes in facial expression, lighting, and occlusion. The average classification accuracies are 96.17% and 99% for the AR database with two specific protocols (i.e., Protocols I and II, respectively), and 38.01% for the challenging LFW database. These performances are clearly superior to those obtained by state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method uses algorithms based only on simple and elementary image processing operations that do not imply higher computational costs as in holistic, sparse or deep learning methods, making it ideal for real-time identification.","Adjabi, Insaf; Ouahabi, Abdeldjalil; Benzaoui, Amir; Jacques, Sébastien",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865363/,174

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT images were reviewed by two radiologists who reached decisions by consensus. We included only patients who presented with abnormalities on CT and in whom the diagnosis had been confirmed by pathological examination of the surgical specimen (if the lesion was resected). The CT scans were assessed in order to identify the main findings and to map the distribution of the lesions (i.e., to determine whether the pulmonary involvement was unilateral or bilateral). RESULTS: The main CT finding was the combination of bronchocele and hyperinflation of the distal lung. That combination was observed in all of the patients. The lesions were unilateral in all 23 cases, being seen predominantly in the left upper lobe, followed by the right lower lobe, right upper lobe, middle lobe, and left lower lobe. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of bronchial atresia can be reliably made on the basis of a finding of bronchocele accompanied by hyperinflation of the adjacent lung parenchyma.","Puglia, Elazir Barbosa Mota Di; Rodrigues, Rosana Souza; Daltro, Pedro Augusto; Souza Jr., Arthur Soares; Paschoal, Marilene Monteiro; Labrunie, Ester Moraes; Irion, Klaus Loureiro; Hochhegger, Bruno; Zanetti, Gláucia; Marchiori, Edson",Radiol Bras,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7863713/,174

Radiation therapy is an important treatment for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The survival rate of patients with HNSCC remained low (50%) in decades because of radiation therapy failure caused by the radioresistance of HNSCC cells. This study aimed to identify PI3K inhibitors that can enhance radiosensitivity. Results showed that pan-Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) inhibitor BKM120 and class I α-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719 dose-dependently reduced the growth of OSCC cells but not that of radioresistant OML1-R cells. The combination treatment of BKM120 or BYL719 with radiation showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on OSCC cells and radioresistant OML1-R cells. Furthermore, the enhanced inhibitory effect of the combination treatment was confirmed in patient-derived OSCC cells. The triple combination treatment of mTOR inhibitor AZD2014 and BKM120 or AZD2014 and BYL719 with radiation showed a significantly enhanced inhibitory effect on radioresistant OML1-R cells. These results suggest that the PI3K inhibitors are potential therapeutic agents with radiosensitivity for patients with OSCC.","Chuang, Fu-Cheng; Wang, Chih-Chun; Chen, Jian-Han; Hwang, Tzer-Zen; Yeh, Shyh-An; Su, Yu-Chieh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817006/,174

We further leverage our large subject population to study the effect of large (N = 100) versus small (N = 10) group sizes on behavior in three of the scalable games that we study. While our results are largely consistent with existing findings for small groups, increases in group size are shown to matter for the robustness of those findings.","Li, Zhi; Lin, Po-Hsuan; Kong, Si-Yuan; Wang, Dongwu; Duffy, John",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084158/,174
17238,Comparison of N-linked glycosylation on hemagglutinins derived from chicken embryos and MDCK cells: a case of the production of a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Centralisation of paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) has the increased the need for specialist paediatric critical care transport teams (PCCT) to transport critically ill children to PICU. We investigated the impact of care provided by PCCTs for children on mortality and other clinically important outcomes. METHODS: We analysed linked national data from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) from children admitted to PICUs in England and Wales (2014–2016) to assess the impact of who led the child’s transport, whether prolonged stabilisation by the PCCT was detrimental and the impact of critical incidents during transport on patient outcome. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted odds and probability of mortality within 30 days of admission to PICU (primary outcome) and negative binomial models to investigate length of stay (LOS) and length of invasive ventilation (LOV). RESULTS: The study included 9112 children transported to PICU. The most common diagnosis was respiratory problems; junior doctors led the PCCT in just over half of all transports; and the 30-day mortality was 7.1%. Transports led by Advanced Nurse Practitioners and Junior Doctors had similar outcomes (adjusted mortality ANP: 0.035 versus Junior Doctor: 0.038). Prolonged stabilisation by the PCCT was possibly associated with increased mortality (0.059, 95% CI: 0.040 to 0.079 versus short stabilisation 0.044, 95% CI: 0.039 to 0.048). Critical incidents involving the child increased the adjusted odds of mortality within 30 days (odds ratio: 3.07). CONCLUSIONS: Variations in team composition between PCCTs appear to have little effect on patient outcomes. We believe differences in stabilisation approaches are due to residual confounding. Our finding that critical incidents were associated with worse outcomes indicates that safety during critical care transport is an important area for future quality improvement work.

Metabolic bone disease was defined as hypophosphatemia (phosphorus levels <4 mg/dl), ALP levels >450 U/L, or radiologic findings of MBD at four weeks of age. RESULTS: The study included 254 infants (gestational age: 29 (27–30) weeks, birth weight: 1130 g (960–1300)). Metabolic bone disease was diagnosed in 96 patients (37%); 48 infants had only radiologic evidence of MBD, 24 infants had only biochemical diagnosis of MBD, and 24 infants had both radiologic evidence of MBD and biochemical diagnosis of MBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that radiologic evidence of MBD existed in some infants with normal biochemical results.

A G2-S16 polyanionic carbosilane dendrimer was identified as a possible RSV inhibitor. We speculated that the G2-S16 dendrimer adheres to the host cell-surface HSPG, acts through binding to HS receptors, and prevents further RSV infection. The G2-S16 dendrimer was non-toxic when applied intranasally to Balb/c mice, and interestingly enough, this G2-S16 dendrimer inhibits 85% RSV. Therefore, our G2-S16 dendrimer could be a candidate for developing a new possible therapy against RSV infection.","Rodriguez-Izquierdo, Ignacio; Ceña-Diez, Rafael; Serramia, Maria Jesús; Rodriguez-Fernández, Rosa; Martínez, Isidoro; Muñoz-Fernández, Mariángeles",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271643/,174

19283,Targeting viral liquid–liquid phase separation,2021-07-16,"Recent advances in inhaled drugs and a clearer definition of the disease have made the task of managing COPD more complex. Different proposals have been put forward which combine all the available treatments and the different clinical presentations in an effort to select the best therapeutic options for each clinical context. As COPD is a chronic progressive disease, the escalation of therapy has traditionally been considered the most natural way to tackle it. However, the notion of COPD as a constantly progressing disease has recently been challenged and, in specific areas, this points to the possibility of a de-escalation in treatment. In this context, the clinician requires simple, specific recommendations to guide these changes in treatment in their daily clinical practice. To accomplish this, the first step must be a correct evaluation and an accurate initial preliminary diagnosis of the patient’s condition. Thereafter, the first escalation in therapy must be introduced with caution as the disease progresses, since clinical trials are not designed with clinical decision-making in mind. During this escalation, three possibilities are open to change the current treatment for a different one within the same family, to increase non-pharmacological interventions or to increase the pharmacological therapies. Beyond that point, a patient with persistent symptoms represents a complex clinical scenario which requires a specialized approach, including the evaluation of different respiratory and non-respiratory comorbidities. Unfortunately, there are few de-escalation studies available, and these are mainly observational in nature. The debate on de-escalation in pharmacological treatment, therefore, involves two main discussion points: the withdrawal of bronchodilators and the withdrawal of inhaled steroids. Altogether, the scheme for modifying treatment must be more personalized than just adding molecules, and the therapeutic response and its conditioning factors should be evaluated at each step before proceeding further.","López-Campos, Jose Luis; Carrasco Hernández, Laura; Ruiz-Duque, Borja; Reinoso-Arija, Rocio; Caballero-Eraso, Candelaria",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8285922/,174

This study evaluated the reproductive protective effect of ellagic acid (EA) against testicular damage and abnormalities in sperm parameters in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (T1DM) and examined some possible mechanisms of protection. Adult male rats were segregated into 5 groups (n = 12 rat/each) as control, control + EA (50 mg/kg/day), T1DM, T1DM + EA, and T1DM + EA + brusatol (an Nrf-2 inhibitor) (2 mg/twice/week). All treatments were conducted for 12 weeks, daily. EA preserved the structure of the seminiferous tubules, prevented the reduction in sperm count, motility, and viability, reduced sperm abnormalities, and downregulated testicular levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in diabetic rats. In the control and diabetic rats, EA significantly increased the circulatory levels of testosterone, reduced serum levels of FSH and LH, and upregulated Bcl-2 and all steroidogenic genes (StAr, 3β-HSD1, and 11β-HSD1). Besides, it reduced levels of ROS and MDA but increased levels of GSH and MnSOD and the transactivation of Nrf2. All these biochemical alterations induced by EA were associated with increased activity and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. However, all these effects afforded by EA were weakened in the presence of brusatol. In conclusion, EA could be an effective therapy to alleviated DM-induced reproductive toxicity and dysfunction in rats by a potent antioxidant potential mediated by the upregulation of Nrf2.","ALTamimi, Jozaa Z.; AlFaris, Nora A.; Aljabryn, Dalal H.; Alagal, Reham I.; Alshammari, Ghedeir M.; Aldera, Hussain; Alqahtani, Sultan; Yahya, Mohammed Abdo",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324935/,174

However, the entire tumorigenesis process is not fully understood, and it is evident that cells spreading from the primary tumor play a key role in initiating the metastatic process. Tumor proliferation and invasion also elevate the concentration of regular and irregular metabolites in the serum, which may alter the normal function of the entire human homeostasis and possibly causes cancer metabolism syndrome, also referred to as cachexia. Methods: We report on the modification of commercially available hemodialysis membranes to selectively capture circulating tumor cells from the blood stream by means of immobilized human anti-EpCAM antibodies on the inner surface of the fibers. All critical steps are described that required in situ addition of the immuno-affinity feature to hemodialyzer cartridges in order to capture EpCAM positive circulating tumor cells, which represents ~80% of cancer cell types. Results: The cell capture efficiency of the suggested technology was demonstrated by spiking HCT116 cancer cells both into buffer solution and whole blood and run through on the modified cartridge. Flow cytometry was used to quantitatively evaluate the cell clearance performance of the approach. Conclusions: The suggested modification has no significant effect on the porous structure of the hemodialysis membranes; it keeps its cytokine removal capability, addressing cachexia simultaneously with CTC removal.","Jarvas, Gabor; Szerenyi, Dora; Tovari, Jozsef; Takacs, Laszlo; Guttman, Andras",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398911/,174
20732,Production of bioactive plant secondary metabolites through in vitro technologies—status and outlook,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-6 (IL6) produced in the context of exercise acts in the hypothalamus reducing obesity-associated inflammation and restoring the control of food intake and energy expenditure. In the hippocampus, some of the beneficial actions of IL6 are attributed to its neurogenesis-inducing properties. However, in the hypothalamus, the putative neurogenic actions of IL6 have never been explored, and its potential to balance energy intake can be an approach to prevent or attenuate obesity. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and IL6 knockout (KO) mice were employed to study the capacity of IL6 to induce neurogenesis. We used cell labeling with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR to determine the expression of markers of neurogenesis and neurotransmitters. We prepared hypothalamic neuroprogenitor cells from KO that were treated with IL6 in order to provide an ex vivo model to further characterizing the neurogenic actions of IL6 through differentiation assays. In addition, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data and determined the expression of IL6 and IL6 receptor in specific cell types of the murine hypothalamus. RESULTS: IL6 expression in the hypothalamus is low and restricted to microglia and tanycytes, whereas IL6 receptor is expressed in microglia, ependymocytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes. Exogenous IL6 reduces diet-induced obesity. In outbred mice, obesity-resistance is accompanied by increased expression of IL6 in the hypothalamus. IL6 induces neurogenesis-related gene expression in the hypothalamus and in neuroprogenitor cells, both from WT as well as from KO mice. CONCLUSION: IL6 induces neurogenesis-related gene expression in the hypothalamus of WT mice. In KO mice, the neurogenic actions of IL6 are preserved; however, the appearance of new fully differentiated proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons is either delayed or disturbed.

Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences in MDD may be driven, in part, by sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms. Chronic stress is a significant risk factor in MDD, and preclinical rodent models show differential patterns of stress-induced neural remodeling and cognitive-behavioral dysfunction in males and females. For instance, chronic stress leads to synapse loss in the medial prefrontal cortex in male rodents yet has either no effect on- or increases-synapse number in females. Recent reports have implicated microglia, the immune cells of the brain, in MDD, and findings demonstrate sex-specific microglial signatures in both preclinical stress models and MDD patients. Given that microglia can remodel neural architecture, modulate synaptic transmission, and affect subsequent changes in behavior, it is plausible that microglial pathways contribute to differential stress effects on neuroplasticity and function in males and females. As such, this review examines the evidence for sex-specific microglia-neuron interactions in preclinical stress models and in patients with MDD. Discoveries highlighted herein demonstrate divergent microglial contributions in males and females and suggest that future studies investigating stress-linked disorders should be guided by sex-dependent neurobiological and behavioral findings. Examining these pathways represents a clear avenue toward both a richer understanding of brain, behavior, and immunity, and innovative psychoneuroimmunology-based applications in personalized medicine.","Bollinger, J.L.",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8474553/,174

Data on risk factors (RF) for LRI and mortality is lacking for HCoV infections after HCT. We aimed to validate our ISI in HCoV infections. METHODS: All adult HCT recipients with HCoV infection from 2015 to 2017 were evaluated. An ISI based on RF was used to classify patients as low (0–2), moderate (3–6), or high (7 or higher) risk for progression to LRI or death. We defined LRI as HCoV detected in nasal wash and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and new lung infiltrates on diagnostic imaging. Clinical parameters were collected and ISI were calculated for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 144 adult HCT recipients with 166 episodes of HCoV infections were analyzed. The most common HCoV serotype for LRI and URI was 229E (42.4%) and OC43 (37.6%), respectively, and most patients were infected between November and March each year (Figures 1 and 2). When compared with URI, patients with LRI were more likely in the pre-engraftment period, had multiple respiratory viruses infections, had nosocomially acquired HCoV, required hospitalization, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation (all, P < 0.05). Overall mortality rate was 4% at Day 30 from diagnosis and all patients who died had LRI with an 18% mortality. Among those who died, 33% had nosocomial infection, 67% were co-infected with another respiratory virus and 67% required mechanical ventilation. Using an ISI cut off of <4, the negative predictive value (NPV) for progression to LRI was 86% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: HCT recipients with HCoV LRI were more likely to have a fatal outcome. The NPV of the ISI for progression to LRI was high and could be used as a prognostic tool for future studies and for therapeutic clinical trials.

The bill introduces some restrictions with regard to the use of stored frozen embryos, which are not destined to be implanted. The bill states that only frozen embryos created before April 2002 can be used for research purposes, provided that the individuals whom these embryos relate to give their consent. The alternative to this restriction would have been no research at all, and this would have happened if the law had been stopped. The Australian scientists regarded the new law as a compromise that would undoubtedly slow down research, but not entirely stop it.","Betta, Michela","The Moral, Social, and Commercial Imperatives of Genetic Testing and Screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120980/,174

In urban areas with high population densities and heavy reliance on power-driven devices for day-to-day survival, CEs can precipitate a rapid deterioration of basic services that threatens nutritionally and medically vulnerable older adults. The major underlying threats to nutritional status for older adults during CEs are food insecurity, inadequate social support, and lack of access to health services. The most effective strategy for coping with CEs is to have detailed, individualized pre-event preparations. When a CE occurs, the immediate relief efforts focus on establishing access to food, safe water, and essential medical services.","Bales, Connie Watkins; Tumosa, Nina",Handbook of Clinical Nutrition and Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121257/,174

In 1969, the Swann Report in the United Kingdom noted a dramatic increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food animals receiving low levels of antibiotics in their feed. While the Food and Drug Administration of the United States sought to control antibiotics in animal feed as far back as 1977, only in 2016 were such regulations fully implemented. The farm-level costs of such controls are estimated by the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service to be minimal, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s estimates of the public health costs of antibiotic resistance without implementing controls are $7 billion annually. The complex interactions which exist between economic interests, regulatory policy, and human and animal health are explored in this chapter.","Armbruster, Walter J.; Roberts, Tanya",Food Safety Economics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123476/,174

26767,Biomolecular Structure and Modeling: Historical Perspective,2010-06-07,"As a consequence of the threat of smallpox being potentially used as a means of bioterrorism, many countries have developed preparedness plans for smallpox in the past few years. This chapter summarizes some of the most important issues for the management of smallpox. Usually, the strategy for the management of clinical cases of poxviruses includes the early detection of cases, rapid laboratory diagnosis, an assessment of the risk of further spread and containment measures. For the early detection, different systems are being tested to identify suspected cases before a diagnosis is confirmed (e.g., syndromic surveillance). Also it is necessary to provide special training on the disease pattern, including differential diagnosis, to clinicians and practitioners. If a suspected case has been identified, rapid diagnostic tests are required. In addition to the national and international notifications based on given case definitions, certain measures are necessary to allow an initial risk assessment of the epidemic development. For a rapid risk assessment, the investigations should follow the algorithms of epidemiological outbreak investigation such as the tracing and identification of exposed contacts and the sources of infection. Further decisions have to be taken on the basis of a continuous risk assessment. Countermeasures can be divided into medical and non-medical ones. The choice of an adequate vaccination strategy as a medical countermeasure for the case of a re-emergence of smallpox very much depends on the epidemic scenario, and the general availability and quality of a vaccine. Logistic aspects of the vaccination strategies have to be considered in preparedness planning (e.g., resources necessary for the implementation of mass vaccinations), and also the prioritization of groups to be vaccinated. In addition non-medical measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as the isolation of cases and quarantining of exposed persons (e.g., contact persons of confirmed cases) have to be foreseen. The effectiveness of other measures like prohibition of mass gatherings or closure of institutions is often assessed in the light of historical events. However, they have to be considered within today’s ethical and societal context, taking into account, in particular, the increased number of people who are immunocompromised. Since our knowledge of how the virus would behave today is limited to extrapolations from historical data and is therefore imperfect, these measures are still under discussion. All relevant groups should be involved in exercises to assure the effective operation of the plan mainly regarding communication and cooperation.","Ammon, Andrea; Sasse, Julia; Riedmann, Klaus",Poxviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123762/,174
26915,Volume TOC,2006-09-24,"Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is the inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane and can be separated into acute viral and acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. It is frequently observed after viral rhinitis or common cold. Viral, post-viral, and acute bacterial ARS (ABRS) display significantly similar clinical presentation and inflammatory mechanism. Viral infection of the sinus cavity can cause numerous changes such as post-viral inflammation and epithelial damage, which enhance the susceptibility to bacterial infection. The most common virus families that cause ARS are coronavirus and rhinovirus. Approximately 50% of common colds are caused by the human rhinovirus. Other viral offenders include parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and enterovirus. The most widely recognized bacteria in ABRS are S. pneumonia, H. influenza, and M. catarrhalis and S. aureus, while other species and anaerobic bacteria may also contribute to the infection (Payne and Benninger, Clin Infect Dis 45(10):e121–7, 2007; Anonymous, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 130(1 SUPPL):1–45, 2004; Brook, Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 128(5):583–5, 2002). Interestingly, Payne and colleagues performed a meta-analytic study on reports about the microbiology of ABRS, which evaluated the most common bacterial occurrence within the sinus. S. aureus is commonly associated with the pathogenesis of sphenoid sinusitis. The 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine was presented in the United States in 2000 and aided in the reduction of the recovery rate for S. pneumoniae and the increase in the rate of H. influenza. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) vary in comparison to ARS. Bacteria that have been recorded in many samples acquired by endoscopy or sinus puncture in CRS patients are Staphylococcus aureus (both MSSA and MRSA), Staphylococci (coagulase-negative) (SCN), H. influenza, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumonia, S. intermedius, P. aeruginosa, N. species, and other anaerobic bacteria. In this chapter, microbiology of rhinosinusitis and antimicrobial resistance are discussed.","Erdoğmuş Küçükcan, Nagehan; Bafaqeeh, Sameer Ali; Sallavaci, Suela",All Around the Nose,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123954/,174

As such, the South African government has shown its commitment towards citizenry and the provision of effective service delivery. Social Media Analytics (SMA) has emerged as a potential new solution to support decision-making for service delivery in CzRM. It is believed that the demand for SMA adoption will increasingly rise. However, the reality of social media Big Data comes with the challenges of analysing it in a way that brings Big Value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the challenges of social media Big Data Analytics (BDA) and to incorporate these in a conceptual model that can be used by governments to support the e-participation of citizens. The model was developed through a systematic literature review (SLR). The findings revealed that data challenges relate to designing an optimal architecture for analysing data that caters for both historic data and real-time data at the same time. The paper highlight that process challenges relate to all the activities in the data lifecycle such as data acquisition and warehousing; data mining and cleaning; data aggregation and integration; analysis and modelling; and data interpretation. The paper also identifies six types of data management challenges: privacy, security, data governance, data and information sharing, cost/operational expenditures, and data ownership.","Yakobi, Khulekani; Scholtz, Brenda; vom Berg, Benjamin","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134231/,174

Data was conveniently collected from University students of four of the public higher institutions in Ghana. Out of the 201 questionnaires distributed, 179 were eligible for analysis. A Quantitative methodological approach was adopted which relied on the Partial Least Square approach to Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) for the statistical analysis. Seemingly, FOFL and FORD constructs were not seen to be a significant direct predictor of online purchase intention. However, the mediating effect of OSPCON for both FOFL and FORD towards online purchase intention in the Ghanaian context was found to be significant, hence the mediated-hypotheses were supported. Nonetheless, we have highlighted the need for additional and further research taking a cue from the study’s limitations. The study contributes to our knowledge of how online identity theft practices lead to the unwillingness of online customers to embark on online transactions in an emerging economy, given the rampant outburst of online transactions in the developed world.

Banking institutions are continuously seeking innovative digital solutions to stay ahead of competitors and be the first preference to consumers. Scholars have also shown some interest in investigating mobile commerce and banking implementation and adoption. However, research studies focusing on the elderly and mobile banking are scant. This paper seeks to understand the current state of knowledge regarding the enablers and barriers of mobile banking and commerce among the elderly by providing a systematic review of the existing literature on the phenomenon. The literature review showed that there is minimal research to date that has been conducted on this topic of interest. Consequently, issues of investigating enablers and barriers of mobile banking among the elderly have been fairly neglected. The main barriers noted in the literature include: security concerns, trust and privacy, a lack of personalization and limited technical knowledge of the elderly. Significant enablers that may be considered are: perceived ease of use of mobile banking applications, perceived value, convenience and consumer attitudes. Future directions for research and practice on mobile banking for the elderly are suggested.","Msweli, Nkosikhona Theoren; Mawela, Tendani","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134387/,174

The host cells of these pathogens largely belie the systemic clinical manifestations, because Rickettsia and Orientia infect endothelial cells, and Ehrlichia and Anaplasma infect circulating leukocytes (monocytes and neutrophils, respectively). Thus, the predominant manifestations (fever, headache, myalgia, with or without rash) do not usually focus attention on the respiratory system; however, the underlying pathogenesis of these infections involves degrees of vascular compromise either by direct injury and inflammation or by the action of vasoactive proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins. Given that the lung possesses the largest vascular bed in the human body, it is not surprising that pulmonary involvement is periodically identified and, when severely affected, is considered a potentially life-threatening complication.1,2","Dumler, J.

We investigate the role of transfer learning (TL) strategies between four corpora to reduce the number of examples that have to be manually annotated. Evaluation results demonstrate that multi-BERT shows the best transfer capabilities in the zero-shot setting when training and test sets are either in the same language or in the same domain. TL reduces the amount of labeled data needed to achieve high performance on three out of four corpora: pretrained models reach 98–99% of the full dataset performance on both types of entities after training on 10–25% of sentences.

Over the years we have achieved relative success with the majority of these species. The maintenance and breeding of duikers has proved to be difficult at best. The major problems that we have experienced concern diet, stress‐related medical conditions, neonatal mortality, and postanesthetic pneumonia. As concentrate selectors, duikers have a diet relatively low in fiber, a well‐developed ability to forage selectively, a rumen bypass that is functionally important, a rapid passage and high fermentation rate for starch, and frequently encountered toxins. From an examination of the captive diet of duikers it is evident that the domestic fruits fed to duikers in captivity are not well suited for them. Duikers are highly susceptible to the slightest amount of stress. The group size in which duikers are managed has proved to be critical in the successful management of these species. In our earlier years of duiker management we often kept five or more animals together in a single exhibit. This would at times result in stress‐related jaw abscesses. Our group size has since been reduced to no more than three animals in any one exhibit. Since 1977, the Los Angeles Zoo has had 92 duiker births. The survival rate past 6 months of age has been 61%. Of the 36 neonatal deaths, 42% were stillborn or died within a few hours of birth. Hypothermia and maternal neglect have been linked to infant mortality. Duikers are also easily prone to capture myopathy and regurgitation during anesthesia or capture, which can often lead to aspiration pneumonia. If at all possible, the capture and restraint of a duiker should be avoided. However, there are times when the capture or restraint (chemically or manually) of a duiker is required.

Methods Fifty‐one infected and 426 uninfected staff members were asked about risk behaviours and protective measures when attending to SARS patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the major risk and protective factors. Results Multivariate analysis confirmed the strong role of performing chest compression (or intubation, which is highly correlated), contact with respiratory secretion, and emergency care experience as risk factors to acquire SARS infection. For the studied protective measures, wearing 16‐layer cotton surgical mask, wearing 12‐layer cotton surgical mask, wearing multiple layers of mask, taking prophylactic medicine, taking training and nose washing turned out to be protective against infection. Conclusions This study highlighted activities associated with increased and decreased risk for SARS infection during close contact with SARS patients.

33665,A SUGGESTED CHECK LIST FOR EFFECTIVE PREVENTION OF INFECTION IN RODENT COLONIES,2012-12-02,"Relational databases play a central role in many information systems. Their schemas contain structural and behavioral entity descriptions. Databases must continuously be adapted to new requirements of a world in constant change while: (1) relational database management systems (RDBMS) do not allow inconsistencies in the schema; (2) stored procedure bodies are not meta-described in RDBMS such as PostgreSQL that consider their bodies as plain text. As a consequence, evaluating the impact of an evolution of the database schema is cumbersome, being essentially manual. We present a semi-automatic approach based on recommendations that can be compiled into a SQL patch fulfilling RDBMS constraints. To support recommendations, we designed a meta-model for relational databases easing computation of change impact. We performed an experiment to validate the approach by reproducing a real evolution on a database. The results of our experiment show that our approach can set the database in the same state as the one produced by the manual evolution in 75% less time.","Delplanque, Julien; Etien, Anne; Anquetil, Nicolas; Ducasse, Stéphane",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266448/,174
33979,Therapeutic potential of a designed CSαβ peptide ID13 in Staphylococcus aureus-induced endometritis of mice,2020-06-06,"Neural networks are frequently applied to medical data. We describe how complex and imbalanced data can be modelled with simple but accurate neural networks that are transparent to the user. In the case of a data set on cervical cancer with 753 observations excluding, missing values, and 32 covariates, with a prevalence of 73 cases (9.69%), we explain how model selection can be applied to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) by deriving a representation using a General Additive Neural Network. The model achieves an AUROC of 0.621 CI [0.519,0.721] for predicting positive diagnosis with Schiller’s test. This is comparable with the performance obtained by a deep learning network with an AUROC of 0.667 [1]. Instead of using all covariates, the Partial Response Network (PRN) involves just 2 variables, namely the number of years on Hormonal Contraceptives and the number of years using IUD, in a fully explained model. This is consistent with an additive non-linear statistical approach, the Sparse Additive Model [2] which estimates non-linear components in a logistic regression classifier using the backfitting algorithm applied to an ANOVA functional expansion. This paper shows how the PRN, applied to a challenging classification task, can provide insights into the influential variables, in this case correlated with incidence of cervical cancer, so reducing the number of unnecessary variables to be collected for screening. It does so by exploiting the efficiency of sparse statistical models to select features from an ANOVA decomposition of the MLP, in the process deriving a fully interpretable model.","Lisboa, Paulo J.

43775,Stimulated Low-Frequency Raman Scattering in Brome Mosaic Virus,2021-01-04,"Flaviviruses bear class II fusion proteins as their envelope (E) proteins. Here, we describe the development of an in vitro quantitative mosquito-cell-based membrane-fusion assay for the E protein using dual split proteins (DSPs). The assay does not involve the use of live viruses and allows the analysis of a membrane-fusion step independent of other events in the viral lifecycle, such as endocytosis. The progress of membrane fusion can be monitored continuously by measuring the activities of Renilla luciferase derived from the reassociation of DSPs during cell fusion. We optimized the assay to screen an FDA-approved drug library for a potential membrane fusion inhibitor using the E protein of Zika virus. Screening results identified atovaquone, which was previously described as an antimalarial agent. Atovaquone potently blocked the in vitro Zika virus infection of mammalian cells with an IC(90) of 2.1 µM. Furthermore, four distinct serotypes of dengue virus were also inhibited by atovaquone with IC(90) values of 1.6–2.5 µM, which is a range below the average blood concentration of atovaquone after its oral administration in humans. These findings make atovaquone a likely candidate drug to treat illnesses caused by Zika as well as dengue viruses. Additionally, the DSP assay is useful to study the mechanism of membrane fusion in Flaviviruses.","Yamamoto, Mizuki; Ichinohe, Takeshi; Watanabe, Aya; Kobayashi, Ayako; Zhang, Rui; Song, Jiping; Kawaguchi, Yasushi; Matsuda, Zene; Inoue, Jun-ichiro",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767512/,174

Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is potentially an alternative treatment strategy to enhance respiratory muscle strength and endurance. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the effects of IMT on those with bronchiectasis. Eighteen participants (10 bronchiectasis) took part in an eight-week, three times a week IMT programme at 80% sustained maximal inspiratory pressure (SMIP). Lung function, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, exercise capacity, physical activity and self-determination theory measures were taken. Participants also took part in a semi-structured interview to assess their perceptions and experience of an IMT intervention. After eight weeks of IMT, bronchiectasis and healthy participants exhibited significant increases in MIP (27% vs. 32%, respectively), SMIP (16% vs. 17%, respectively) and inspiratory duration (36% vs. 30%, respectively). Healthy participants exhibited further improvements in peak expiratory flow and maximal oxygen consumption. Bronchiectasis participants reported high levels of perceived competence and motivation, reporting higher adherence and improved physical ability. Eight weeks of IMT increased inspiratory muscle strength and endurance in those with bronchiectasis. IMT also had a positive effect on perceived competency and autonomy, with bronchiectasis participants reporting improved physical ability and motivation, and high adherence.","McCreery, Jessica L.; Mackintosh, Kelly A.; Mills-Bennett, Rebekah; McNarry, Melitta A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001489/,174

In the field of language teacher education, this line of research has been evolving, with the recent trend being streamlined into “teacher cognition” as a generic or umbrella term. Despite increasing amounts of research output so far, research into foreign language teachers’ cognitions about their own teaching and decision-making is still insufficient, particularly with regard to university-level English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in China. Drawing on Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory, this qualitative research focused on EFL teachers’ cognitions about form-focused instruction in Chinese university settings. It intended to discover how teachers’ cognitions changed when they were expected to teach in actual classrooms and what factors contributed to these changes. Data collected from four teacher-participants through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and follow-up stimulated recall interviews showed participants’ support for focus-on-form instruction, which means they not only paid attention to the grammatical form of the language but also to the meaning it is intended to convey. However, data also showed that the teacher-participants shifted from focus-on-form to focus-on-formS instruction in actual teaching, which suggests that they might have realized the challenges of carrying out teaching activities surrounding focus-on-form and would like to take an easier approach by only teaching the grammar of the language by focusing on formS. Such incongruences are interpreted with reference to a plethora of sociocultural factors including traditional Chinese thinking and institutional expectations. The implications of the findings for stakeholders in universities, including faculty members, students, and curriculum developers in similar contexts, are also discussed.","Sun, Qiang; Zhang, Lawrence Jun",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044539/,174

The directions for creating a methodology for measuring resilience are proposed, based on a study of theoretical and methodological approaches and existing attempts to measure the resilience of cities and regions. The article describes existing Russian examples of measuring the resilience of regions a posteriori (by analyzing the behavior of indicators of socioeconomic development during and after economic and budgetary crises) and a priori (based on the characteristics of industry structure or risk resistance of the economic, social, and governance subsystems of a region). A paradox is noted: in Russia, subsidization of a region and a backward structure of the economy are factors that increase resilience. Ways are shown to embed mechanisms for increasing resilience in the strategic governance system of urban and regional development. It is proposed to introduce resilience auditing into management practice and create a regional (municipal) risk-management system and the position of a risk manager.","Zhikharevich, B.

Whether such a policy instrument is effective for business development is a highly relevant question in the aftermath of the COVID-19. We evaluate the causal effects of small business development matching grants using a quasi-experimental approach. The grants were exclusively targeted to women entrepreneurs and provided during the recession after the financial crisis. Our findings demonstrate an increase in bank loans and a positive impact on turnover, value-added, capital, employment, and overall factor productivity for more experienced women entrepreneurs. As the grants are too small to have direct economic effects or indirect effects via the certification effect, they alleviate time and information constraints of women entrepreneurs. The cost-benefit analysis shows an increase in value-added that outweighs the scheme-related costs. Plain English Summary This study evaluates the effect of small public grants for women entrepreneurs. Grants were used for childcare and business consultancy costs to alleviate time and information constraints of women entrepreneurs. Benefiting from these grants resulted in higher bank loans. The women entrepreneurs on average invested more money in capital and had better performance measures like turnover and value-added. The effect was particularly evident among more experienced women entrepreneurs. The cost-benefit analysis shows grant-induced increase in value-added outweighs the scheme-related costs. The study implies small public grants for women entrepreneurs increase small firms’ growth, and these grants are in addition a cost-effective policy tool.","Srhoj, Stjepan; Škrinjarić, Bruno; Radas, Sonja; Walde, Janette",Small Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325887/,174
57198,Graphical abstract TOC,2021-08-27,"OBJECTIVES: A large literature exists investigating the extent to which physical characteristics (e.g., strength, weight, and height) can be accurately assessed from face images. While most of these studies have employed two-dimensional (2D) face images as stimuli, some recent studies have used three-dimensional (3D) face images because they may contain cues not visible in 2D face images. As equipment required for 3D face images is considerably more expensive than that required for 2D face images, we here investigated how perceptual ratings of physical characteristics from 2D and 3D face images compare. METHODS: We tested whether 3D face images capture cues of strength, weight, and height better than 2D face images do by directly comparing the accuracy of strength, weight, and height ratings of 182 2D and 3D face images taken simultaneously. Strength, height and weight were rated by 66, 59 and 52 raters respectively, who viewed both 2D and 3D images. RESULTS: In line with previous studies, we found that weight and height can be judged somewhat accurately from faces; contrary to previous research, we found that people were relatively inaccurate at assessing strength. We found no evidence that physical characteristics could be judged more accurately from 3D than 2D images. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest physical characteristics are perceived with similar accuracy from 2D and 3D face images. They also suggest that the substantial costs associated with collecting 3D face scans may not be justified for research on the accuracy of facial judgments of physical characteristics.","Holzleitner, Iris J; Jones, Alex L; O’Shea, Kieran J; Cassar, Rachel; Fasolt, Vanessa; Shiramizu, Victor; Jones, Benedict C; DeBruine, Lisa M",Adapt Human Behav Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387548/,174

PE is characterized by nontraditional work arrangements, precluding workplace-based interventions. Policy, systems, and environmental initiatives that engage cross-sectoral stakeholders may be an applicable health promotion approach to address PE. The University of of Illinois at Chicago Center for Healthy Work's Healthy Communities through Healthy Work (HCHW) is an outreach project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-funded Center of Excellence for Total Worker Health that conducted a multiphased qualitative action research (AR) study. AR designs may be a novel approach to develop initiatives to address problems like PE. This article reports on HCHW's first AR phase to answer four research questions: (1) What are participants' perceptions of PE? (2) What are participants' perceptions of their roles in addressing PE? (3) What initiatives are under way that address PE? and (4) How can the findings be used to facilitate opportunities for healthy work? Key informant interviews with health (public health and health care; N = 23) and labor sector organizations (worker centers, worker advocacy organizations, and unions; N = 21) were conducted. Data were thematically analyzed alongside a chart-based content analysis, and shared in 11 key stakeholder meetings. Findings revealed an opportunity for the labor sector to improve health sector readiness to address PE in the context of health, and were used to develop the Healthy Work Collaborative, a cross-sectoral health promotion capacity building policy, systems, and environmenta change initiative to address PE.","Welter, Christina; Jarpe-Ratner, Elizabeth; Bonney, Tessa; C Pinsker, Eve; Fisher, Elizabeth; Yankelev, Anna; Kapadia, Devangna; Love, Marsha; Zanoni, Joseph",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920953116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875915/,174

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, controlled experimental study. ANIMALS Adult dogs (n = 10). METHODS Two 2 × 2-cm open wounds and two 3-cm-long full-thickness dermal incisions were created on the dorsum of each dog. Dogs in the hyperbaric oxygen treatment group (HBO) received HBOT once daily (1.7 atmospheres absolute [ATA], 30 minutes on day 1; 2.0 ATA, 40 minutes on days 2-7) for 7 consecutive days, and dogs in the control group (CON) received standardized wound care. Dogs were monitored during HBOT for adverse side effects. Total wound area, percentage epithelialization, and percentage contraction were compared for the open wounds. Subjective wound scores were compared for the open and incisional wounds. Biopsies of both wound types were taken and used to determine histopathology scores. Bacterial cultures were completed on open wounds. RESULTS No difference was detected between HBO and CON uncomplicated open and incisional wounds at any time for contraction, epithelialization, subjective wound scores, histopathology scores, or bacterial loads. All HBO dogs tolerated hyperbaric oxygen treatments with no adverse effects. CONCLUSION The HBOT protocol tested here was safe but did not enhance the healing of uncomplicated acute wounds and incisions of dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE These results do not provide evidence to support the use of HBOT to manage uncomplicated wounds in dogs.","Latimer, Christian R; Lux, Cassie N; Roberts, Sarah; Drum, Marti G; Braswell, Cheryl; Sula, Mee Ja M",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30051475/,174
61781,Global genetic variation at OAS1 provides evidence of archaic admixture in Melanesian populations.,2012,"Heart impairment is classical in dystrophinopathies and its management relies on medical drugs. Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure, but can affect cardiac function. We aimed to investigate the natural history of cardiac function in patients with Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophies on home mechanical ventilation (HMV).We reviewed the chart of DMD and BMD patients, followed in our institution, to obtain ventilation setting at HMV initiation and echocardiographic data at baseline and end follow up, as well as onset cardiac events and thoracic mechanical complication. We analyzed cumulative incidence of cardiac events as well as echocardiographic parameters evolution and its association with ventilation settings.We included 111 patients (101 DMD and 10 BMD). Median age was 21 years [18-26], median pulmonary vital capacity (VC) 15% of predicted [10-24]. All patients were on HMV and 46% ventilated using tracheostomy. After a median follow up of 6.3 years, we found a slight decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (45% at end follow up vs 50% at baseline P = .019) and a stabilization of the LV end diastolic diameter indexed (LVEDD indexed 29.4 mm/m vs 30.7 mm/m at end follow up, P = .17). Tidal volume (VT) level was inversely associated with the annual rate of the LVEF decline (r = -0.29, P = .025). Left atrium (LA) diameter decreased with mechanical ventilation (24 mm vs 20 mm, P = .039) and we found a reduction of systolic pulmonary pressure (35 mm Hg vs 25 mm Hg, P = .011). The cumulative incidence of cardiac events was 12.6%. Pneumothorax occurred in 4% of patients. Hypoxic arrest secondary to the presence of tracheal plugin occurred in 4% of patients with invasive ventilation.HMV is not harmful, decreases pulmonary pressure and may protect heart in dystrophinopathies, in addition with cardioprotective drugs. In patients with DMD and BMD on HMV, cumulative incidence of cardiac events remains moderate and incidence of pneumothorax is rare.","Fayssoil, Abdallah; Ogna, Adam; Chaffaut, Cendrine; Lamothe, Laure; Ambrosi, Xavier; Nardi, Olivier; Prigent, Helene; Clair, Bernard; Lofaso, Frederic; Chevret, Sylvie; Orlikowski, David; Annane, Djillali",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000011381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29979426/,174

62846,Capillary Electrophoresis-based Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange for Conformational Characterization of Proteins with Top-down Mass Spectrometry.,2021-06-08,"PURPOSE Chronic post-operative inguinal pain (CPIP) is defined as pain lasting more than 3 months and the incidence is less than 4% after laparoscopic hernia repair. CPIP can have several causes. In this study, we aimed to show that 3D-iron loaded mesh preparations are useful in radiological evaluation of post-operative complications, especially patients with chronic pain and the mesh status of operated inguinal hernia cases. METHODS A total of 450 cases who had been operated for inguinal hernia with 3D-iron loaded mesh and who had ongoing pain at the post-operative period were included in this study. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) was performed at the post-operative 90th day of the seven symptomatic (groin pain, limitation of movement) cases which were operated using a 3D-iron loaded mesh, 10 × 15 cm in size, (DynaMeshEndolap visible with 25% MRI-visible filaments, FEG TextiltechnikmbH, Aachen, Germany) for inguinal hernia repair to evaluate mesh status, localization, and local complications. Gradient echo sequences in the sagittal, axial, and coronal sections on MRI were discussed by two radiologists. Mesh localizations, their relationship with surrounding structures and their complications related with mesh were evaluated by two radiologists (D.Y, D.E.T.Ş). RESULTS No significant radiological findings related to defined anatomical structures were found in the MRI images of the study group. The dimensions measured on the sagittal, axial and coronal images were correlated with original mesh sizes and no significant shrinkage was detected. CONCLUSION Mesh position and deformation as shrinkage can be the mesh-related cause of pain. The incidence of CPIP in our patients is less than 2%. 3D-iron loaded meshes were monitored with MRI in CPIP patients and there was no mesh-related changes found in our study. The use of MRI-visible meshes will most likely help us to monitor mesh preparations and show potential time-dependent changes in mesh characteristics and consequent complications. In case of doubtful clinical postoperative hernia recurrence or chronic groin pain, mesh position can be identified by MRI and unnecessary surgical intervention can be avoided.","Özveri, E; Şanlı, D E T; Yıldırım, D; Gök, H; Ertem, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02168-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166710/,174
63068,A Newly Isolated Bacillus subtilis Strain Named WS-1 Inhibited Diarrhea and Death Caused by Pathogenic Escherichia coli in Newborn Piglets.,2019,"BACKGROUND Relative to their counterparts in the general population, young people who leave, or transition out of, out-of-home (OOHC) arrangements commonly experience poorer outcomes across a range of indicators, including higher rates of homelessness, unemployment, reliance on public assistance, physical and mental health problems and contact with the criminal justice system. The age at which young people transition from OOHC varies between and within some countries, but for most, formal support ceases between the ages of 18 and 21. Programs designed to support transitions are generally available to young people toward the end of their OOHC placement, although some can extend beyond. They often encourage the development of skills required for continued engagement in education, obtaining employment, maintaining housing and general life skills. Little is known about the effectiveness of these programs or of extended care policies that raise the age at which support remains available to young people after leaving OOHC. This systematic review will seek to identify programs and/or interventions that improve outcomes for youth transitioning from the OOHC system into adult living arrangements. METHODS This review will identify programs, interventions and policies that seek to improve health and wellbeing of this population that have been tested using robust controlled methods. Primary outcomes of interest are homelessness, health, education, employment, exposure to violence and risky behaviour. Secondary outcomes are relationships and life skills. We will search, from January 1990 onwards, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, SocINDEX, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and Health Technology Assessment. Grey literature will be identified through searching websites and databases, e.g. clearing houses, government agencies and organisations known to be undertaking or consolidating research on this topic area. Two reviewers will independently screen all title and abstracts and full text articles with conflicts to be resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be undertaken by pairs of review authors, with one reviewer checking the results of the other. If more than one study with suitable data can be identified, we plan to undertake both fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses and intend to present the random-effects result if there is no indication of funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias will be assessed using tools appropriate to the study methodology. Quality of evidence across studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. DISCUSSION Previous reviews were unable to identify any programs or interventions, backed by methodologically rigorous research, that improve outcomes for this population. This review seeks to update this previous work, taking into account changes in the provision of extended care, which is now available in some jurisdictions.

63217,Traditional Methods of Analysis for Listeria monocytogenes.,2021,"The use of probiotic, postbiotic, and anti-aflatoxigenic capabilities of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from stressful niches is a major strategy to prepare functional cultures and bio-preservatives for food industries. In the present study, abundant LAB strains isolated from natural honey were screened based on their tolerance to continuous pH and bile salt treatments. Then, the pro-functional properties of the selected LAB were investigated. In accordance with the screening data, a bacilli isolate was selected for further characterization. Sequencing results led to the identification of Lactobacillus kunkeei as the selected LAB isolate. In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the LAB and in situ antifungal activity of the isolate cell-free supernatant (CFS) were verified against food-borne indicators. Accordingly, in vitro antibacterial and antifungal effects of Lact. kunkeei ENH01 on respective Escherichia coli and Aspergillus niger were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the other indicators. Furthermore, in situ inhibitory effect of Lact. kunkeei CFS on Candida albicans (as the highest in situ effect) was equal to 76.36%. The presence of three antibacterial peptides was also verified in the Lact. kunkeei CFS according to the results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assay. Antibiotic susceptibility profile and auto-aggregation ability of the isolate were noticeable. Anti-mycotoxigenic capabilities of Lact. kunkeei ENH01 as viable and heat-killed cells were also revealed against total aflatoxins according to the HPLC-based analysis. In vivo safety of the isolate was also attested through the evaluation of blood biochemistry and hematological parameters in the Lact. kunkeei ENH01 fed-mice compared with the control. Based on the findings, probiotic properties of Lact. kunkeei ENH01 and postbiotic capabilities of the isolate CFS and its heat-killed cells were approved.","Ebrahimi, Maryam; Sadeghi, Alireza; Rahimi, Delasa; Purabdolah, Hosein; Shahryari, Sara",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12602-020-09697-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803518/,174

This study evaluated the internal structure of the EPA-SF trait scales, and examined the EPA-SF scales against two other psychopathy measures, the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) and the Expanded Leveson Self-Report Psychopathy Scales (E-LSRP), as well as a general FFM measure, in a sample of 924 university students. Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling generally supported internal structure for EPA-SF scales, in that the 18 EPA-SF traits generally loaded onto their four respective domain scales: Antagonism, Emotional Stability, Inhibition and Narcissism. Tucker's congruence coefficients (.95-.99) indicated excellent replicability of the original structure. The EPA-SF total and domain scale scores also showed moderate to large correlations with TriPM, E-LSRP and FFM domain scales in a manner mostly consistent with conceptual expectations. Finally, EPA-SF trait scales were also mostly associated with their corresponding FFM trait scale counterparts. Overall, the EPA-SF scale scores showed evidence for good convergent and discriminant validity.","Lee, Ka Yan; Sellbom, Martin",Journal of personality assessment,https://doi.org/10.1080/00223891.2020.1779734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633556/,174
63527,Diagnostic Exercise: Circling and Behavioral Changes in a Cat.,2015,"OBJECTIVE COVID-19 has affected surgical practice globally. Treating neurosurgical patients with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic is challenging in institutions with shared patient areas. The present study was performed to assess the changing patterns of neurosurgical cases, the efficacy of repeated testing before surgery, and the prevalence of COVID-19 in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients. METHODS Cases of non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients treated at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed. During the pandemic, all patients underwent a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test to detect COVID-19 at admission. Patients who needed immediate intervention were surgically treated following a single COVID-19 test, while stable patients who initially tested negative for COVID-19 were subjected to repeated testing at least 5 days after the first test and within 48 hours prior to the planned surgery. The COVID-19 positivity rate was compared with the local period prevalence. The number of patients who tested positive at the second test, following a negative first test, was used to determine the probable number of people who could have become infected during the surgical procedure without second testing. RESULTS Of the total 1769 non-trauma-related neurosurgical patients included in this study, a mean of 337.2 patients underwent surgery per month before COVID-19, while a mean of 184.2 patients (54.6% of pre-COVID-19 capacity) underwent surgery per month during the pandemic period, when COVID-19 cases were on the rise in India. There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery for a ruptured aneurysm, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar tumors, while the number of patients seeking surgery for chronic benign diseases declined. At the first COVID-19 test, 4 patients (0.48%) tested were found to have the disease, a proportion 3.7 times greater than that found in the local community. An additional 5 patients tested positive at the time of the second COVID-19 test, resulting in an overall inpatient period prevalence of 1%, in contrast to a 0.2% national cumulative caseload. It is possible that COVID-19 was prevented in approximately 67.4 people every month by using double testing. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has changed the pattern of neurosurgical procedures, with acute cases dominating the practice. Despite the fact that the pandemic has not yet reached its peak in India, COVID-19 has been detected 3.7 times more often in asymptomatic neurosurgical inpatients than in the local community, even with single testing. Double testing displays an incremental value by disclosing COVID-19 overall in 1 in 100 inpatients and thus averting its spread through neurosurgical services.","Sahoo, Sushanta K; Dhandapani, Sivashanmugam; Singh, Apinderpreet; Gendle, Chandrashekhar; Karthigeyan, Madhivanan; Salunke, Pravin; Aggarwal, Ashish; Singla, Navneet; Singla, Raghav; Tripathi, Manjul; Chhabra, Rajesh; Mohindra, Sandeep; Tewari, Manoj Kumar; Mohanty, Manju; Bhagat, Hemant; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Gupta, Sunil Kumar",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260131/,174

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, adapting these programs to telehealth modalities is necessary to ensure continued services to children and families. This study evaluates the use of telehealth versus in-person modality to deliver the Helping Our Toddlers, Developing Our Children's Skills (HOT DOCS) BPT. The study design was quasi-experimental with two nonequivalent groups: in-person HOT DOCS (n = 152) and internet-HOT DOCS (n = 46). Participants were caregivers of children ages 2-5 exhibiting disruptive behaviors. Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures were collected for child disruptive behavior and parenting stress and post-test only for consumer satisfaction. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models were performed to assess the effect of class modality on the outcomes. Child disruptive behavior and parenting stress post-test scores for in-person and telehealth groups were not significantly different, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Consumer satisfaction scores were significantly more positive for the in-person group. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence for the i-HOT DOCS modality as being as effective as the in-person program. Study findings may be beneficial to practitioners utilizing telehealth interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and onward.","Agazzi, Heather; Hayford, Holland; Thomas, Nicholas; Ortiz, Cristina; Salinas-Miranda, Abraham",Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211027559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156883/,174

The synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles (NPs) by green method for pharmacological uses has attained considerable attention recently. In current study three different NPs (AgO2, CeO2, CuO2) were synthesized by using Trianthima portulacastrum and Chinopodium quinoa leaf extracts. These biogenic NPs were analyzed by High-tech. approaches including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscope, SEM-EDS spot analysis, elemental mapping and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The anticancer potential of these nanoparticles was estimated using MTT assay, against hepatic cancer cell line (HepG2). SEM secondary electron images presented the nano size of prepared particles in agglomerated form with few porous forms. Average size of Ag-, Ce-, and CuNPs was observed 19-24 nm, 8-12 nm, 13-15 nm respectively. Elemental mapping and EDS-spot analysis ratifies the formation of AgNPs, CeNPs, and CuNPs. These NPs have shown good anticancer activity at different concentrations against HepG2 cell line. Further studies are however needed to identify the molecular mechanisms of these anticancer activities.","Younas, Madiha; Rizwan, Muhammad; Zubair, Muhammad; Inam, Aqil; Ali, Shafaqat",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352575/,174

We analysed the proteolytic processing of the HCoV-229E spike protein by trypsin-like serine proteases leading to activation of the fusion process. Unlike in other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E fusion activation appears to be a one-step process. Indeed, cleavage of the S1/S2 interface does not seem to be a prerequisite, and the fusion activation is highly reliant on the S2' region, with arginine residue 683 acting as the recognition site.","Bonnin, Ariane; Danneels, Adeline; Dubuisson, Jean; Goffard, Anne; Belouzard, Sandrine",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29786498/,174

65640,An Efficient Method for Adenovirus Production.,2021-06-10,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate a cranial base repair method using the dural suturing technique in combination with a mucosal flap in the endoscopic endonasal approach. METHODS We analyzed 190 patients (mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 3-86 years) who underwent 194 endoscopic endonasal approaches. The degree of intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was graded based on previously published criteria: grade 0, absent; grade 1, small; grade 2, moderate; and grade 3, large. Cranial base repair using the dural suturing technique was performed according to the grade of CSF leakage: grades 1 and 2, autologous fat graft anchored by dural suturing covered with a sphenoid sinus mucosal flap, and grade 3, multilayered, inlay sutured and onlay nonsutured fascial grafts covered with a nasoseptal flap. RESULTS Intraoperative CSF leakage was observed in 125 of 194 cases (64.4%). The degree of CSF leakage was grade 0 in 69 cases, grade 1 in 51 cases, grade 2 in 30 cases, and grade 3 in 44 cases. A postoperative CSF leak was encountered in 2 of 125 repaired cases (1.6%). Both cases with CSF leak involved grade 3 CSF leak (4.5%), and both were successfully treated with lumbar drainage.

Forty Holstein heifers [mean age 84.2 ± 1.2 d; body weight (BW) 99.8 ± 10.8 kg (mean ± SD)] were housed in a freestall barn, blocked by birth date, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were (1) 100 g of soybean meal carrier (control; CON); (2) 0.75 g of SB/kg of BW + carrier (SB); (3) 1 mg of MON/kg of BW + carrier (MON); (4) 1 mg of MON/kg of BW + 0.75 g of SB/kg of BW (MSB). Data were analyzed using single degree of freedom contrasts evaluating CON versus additives (ADD), SB versus MON, and SB and MON versus MSB. Treatments were hand-mixed daily. Feed and orts were measured daily and frozen at -20°C. Orts samples were subsampled for dry matter (DM) determination, and total mixed ration samples were taken weekly and composited monthly for DM and nutrient analysis. Initial BW, heart and paunch girths, body length, blood samples, and fecal coccidia counts were measured before the start and weekly during the 12-wk trial. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), and ketone concentrations. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility was determined from d 21 to 27 and from d 63 to 69 using acid detergent insoluble ash as a marker. Daily dry matter intake (DMI) and metabolizable energy intake were increased in ADD compared with CON, and average BW, final BW, and heart girth tended to increase. Whereas MSB tended to be greater than SB and MON for heart girth, feed efficiency was greater with MON compared with SB. Compared with CON, ADD decreased coccidia counts. No effect of treatment on PUN was detected. Monensin and SB tended to have greater plasma glucose than MSB did. Average blood ketone concentrations were greater with ADD versus CON, in SB versus MON, and in MSB versus SB and MON. During the wk-3 digestibility phase, DMI tended to be greater in heifers fed SB versus MON, as well as in heifers fed MSB versus SB and MON. Digestibility of nutrients were similar, except that starch digestibility was increased in heifers fed MSB versus SB and MON. During the wk-9 digestibility phase, DMI and digestibility of nutrients were similar, except NDF, which tended to be greater in CON than in ADD. Overall, ADD resulted in positive growth and reduced coccidia compared with CON.","Stahl, T C; Hatungimana, E; Klanderman, K D; Moreland, S C; Erickson, P S",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-18584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952029/,174
66350,Utilizing Time-Resolved Protein-Induced Fluorescence Enhancement to Identify Stable Local Conformations One α-Synuclein Monomer at a Time.,2021-05-30,"Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation is an effective approach to degrade refractory organic pollutants in water. However, ozonation catalysts with combined merits of high activity, good reusability and low cost for practical industrial applications are still rare. This study aims to develop an efficient, stable and economic ozonation catalyst for the degradation of Ibuprofen, a pharmaceutical compound frequently detected as a refractory pollutant in treated wastewaters. The novel three-dimensional network-structured catalyst, comprising of δ-MnO2 nanosheets grown on woven carbon microfibers (MnO2 nanosheets/carbon microfiber), was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. Catalytic ozonation performance of Ibuprofen removal in water using the new catalyst proves a significant enhancement, where Ibuprofen removal efficiency of close to 90% was achieved with a catalyst loading of 1% (w/v). In contrast, conventional ozonation was only able to achieve 65% removal efficiency under the same operating condition. The enhanced performance with the new catalyst could be attributed to its significantly increased available surface active sites and improved mass transfer of reaction media, as a result of the special surface and structure properties of this new three-dimensional network-structured catalyst. Moreover, the new catalyst displays excellent stability and reusability for ibuprofen degradation over successive reaction cycles. The facile synthesis method and low-cost materials render the new catalyst high potential for industrial scaling up. With the combined advantages of high efficiency, high stability, and low cost, this study sheds new light for industrial applications of ozonation catalysts.","Ponnusamy, Guhankumar; Farzaneh, Hajar; Tong, Yongfeng; Lawler, Jenny; Liu, Zhaoyang; Saththasivam, Jayaprakash",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85651-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737579/,174
66480,A Systematic Review of 571 Pregnancies Affected by COVID-19.,2021,"BACKGROUND The cause of emergence agitation (EA) in children is unknown. Rapid emergence from inhaled anesthesia has been implicated because EA is more common with sevoflurane than with halothane. A dose-dependent effect of sevoflurane, which increases seizure-like electroencephalogram activity, has also been proposed. METHODS To determine whether depth of anesthesia as measured by bispectral index (BIS) affects EA, 40 ASA physical status I to II children aged 2 to 8 years undergoing ophthalmic surgery were enrolled in a blinded randomized controlled trial of low-normal (40-45, deep) versus high-normal (55-60, light) anesthesia. To distinguish transient irritability from severe EA, the primary outcome was first-stage postanesthesia care unit (PACU I) peak Pediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, with secondary outcomes of PAED and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores at emergence, postoperative fentanyl dose, emergence time, and discharge time. Subjects received a standard anesthesia protocol with oral midazolam followed by mask induction with sevoflurane 8%, fentanyl 1 to 1.5 μg/kg IV (then as needed), neuromuscular blockade, and endotracheal intubation. Providers titrated expired sevoflurane (in N2O 67%) from 0.5% to 3% to maintain BIS range. PAED, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scores were measured at emergence, at PACU I arrival, and during PACU I stay. RESULTS There was little difference between the groups in the primary outcome, peak PACU I PAED score (light: 7.7 ± 4.6; deep: 8.6 ± 5.3; mean difference, 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.1 to -2.3; effect size, 0.18).

67507,Characterization of intestinal Escherichia coli isolated from calves with diarrhea due to rotavirus and coronavirus.,2019,"Fast-track surgery is claimed to reduce medical morbidity, eliminate the hospitalization needs, and shorten the convalescence period. Intraoperative bleeding as the main complication is also the primary cause of conversion from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. Intraoperative blood salvage can reduce transfusion requirements, decrease the conversion rate to open, and promote fast-tracking in laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). From November 2007 through December 2016 we collected medical data of 115 LS patients. There were three groups: 54 patients receiving routine care (we marks them as Group RT), 33 patients with fast-track care (Group FT), and 28 receiving fast-track care receiving intraoperative splenic blood salvage and autotransfusion (Group FT + ISBS). These medical data are comprised of included three phases (pre-, intra-, and postoperative). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between RT, FT, and FT + ISBS groups. The hemoglobin level in Group FT + ISBS was significantly higher than in Group RT and Group FT. Comparing the duration of hospital stay of 3 groups, Group RT stayed for a significantly longer time than Group FT and Group FT + ISBS, Group FT + ISBSmuch shorter than Group FT. Comparing the hospitalization expense, GroupFT + ISBS significantly expended less than Group RT and Group FT. Our study shows that laparoscopic splenectomy with fast-track care is feasible, effective, and safe for patients who require splenectomy. Fast-tracking with intraoperative blood salvage improved the fast-track laparoscopic splenectomy procedure.","Chen, Yan; Wang, Jianwei; Ye, Qinghuang; Wang, Zhijiang; Weng, Weihong; Zhu, Jinhui",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45865-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289303/,174

Although this virus disproportionately affects adults, initial SARS-CoV-2 infection can present a significant disease burden for the pediatric population. A review of the literature yields descriptive studies in pediatric patients; however, no evidence-based or evidence-informed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the hospitalized pediatric patient have been published in peer-reviewed journals. The authors, working at a quaternary care children's hospital in the national epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, found an urgent need to create a unified, multidisciplinary, evidence-informed set of guidelines for the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. In this article, the authors describe our institutional practices for the hospitalized pediatric patient with confirmed or suspected initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors anticipate that developing evidence-informed and institution-specific guidelines will lead to improvements in care quality, efficiency, and consistency; minimization of staff risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; and increased provider comfort in caring for pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Diamond, Rebekah; Fischer, Avital; Hooe, Benjamin; Sewell, Taylor B; Schweickert, Adam; Ahn, Danielle; Jamal, Nazreen; Zachariah, Philip; Cheng, Jennifer; Abreu, Wanda; Giordano, Mirna",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-0170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847961/,174

Whether low cardiac output is associated with low tissue oxygen supply in these patients is unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between cardiac output, assessed by echocardiography, and tissue oxygenation, measured with multisite near-infrared spectroscopy, in a cohort of preterm infants with clinical sepsis. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING Level III neonatal ICU. PATIENTS Twenty-four preterm infants (gestational age < 32 wk) with clinical sepsis. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical and echocardiographic assessment of hemodynamics was performed within 48 hours of sepsis workup and repeated at least 24 hours later. We measured cerebral, renal, and intestinal tissue oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy during an hour of stable measurements directly preceding or following echocardiography and calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction in each tissue. We determined Spearman correlation coefficients between fractional tissue oxygen extraction and right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale flow, left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow, and superior vena cava flow. Right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale and left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow both correlated significantly with intestinal fractional tissue oxygen extraction (ρ, -0.700; p = 0.036 and ρ, -0.604; p = 0.029, respectively). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between cardiac output measurements and cerebral and renal fractional tissue oxygen extraction, respectively. Changes in cardiac output measurements were not associated with observed changes in fractional tissue oxygen extraction values. CONCLUSIONS Right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale and left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow, indicators of systemic blood flow in preterm infants with shunts, were negatively associated with intestinal fractional tissue oxygen extraction, but not with renal and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction. These findings suggest that during low output states due to clinical sepsis intestinal perfusion is most at risk.","van der Laan, Michelle E; Roofthooft, Marcus T R; Fries, Marian W A; Schat, Trijntje E; Bos, Arend F; Berger, Rolf M F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27500612/,174

METHODS Through a 2-cm vertical transumbilical incision, three 5-mm ports were placed using the Veress technique. One extracorporeal suture was utilized to provide cephalad retraction of the fundus, and a roticulating instrument grasping the infundibulum provided lateral retraction. The hilum was dissected, and the cystic duct and artery were clipped and divided. One 5-mm port was upgraded to a 10-mm port to allow the introduction of a retrieval bag, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. RESULTS Of 56 patients, 54 successfully underwent a single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two patients required conversion to either a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy. The average age was 41 years (18-77) and the average BMI, 30.2 kg/m(2) (18.5-44.6). Mean operative time was 80 min (41-186). Length of stay was 0.3 days (0-2). The complication rate was 3/56 (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective alternative to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy that provides surgeons with an alternative minimally invasive surgical option and the ability to hide the surgical incision within the umbilicus.","Roberts, Kurt E; Solomon, Daniel; Duffy, Andrew J; Bell, Robert L",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-009-1116-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19967564/,174

These factors have been greatly changed as people are required to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, it is necessary to verify whether these factors effect well-being during the pandemic. We recruited 70 adults (females: 46; age range: 31-60) during a high incidence of COVID-19 in China (17-27 February 2020). Both subjective measurements based on self-report scales and objective measurements collected using wrist actigraphy were employed to investigate the effects of night-time sleep and daytime activity on subjective well-being. The actigraphy data show that participants' total sleep time (>8 hr) is sufficient. Self-reported sleep quality was significantly worse than pre-pandemic, and self-reported daytime activity levels significantly decreased during the pandemic. Physical activity was positively related to well-being, both for self-reported daytime activity (r = .346, p = .003) and for objective measurements (r = .234, p = .051). Our study found that sleep and daytime activity levels were negatively affected by the pandemic. However, increased daytime physical activity could potentially reduce these negative effects.","Wang, Haien; He, Ling; Gao, Yuan; Gao, Xiao; Lei, Xu",Applied psychology.

Although autogenous fistulas are superior to catheters and synthetic grafts, they are not without their own complications. One complication is venous aneurysms that can lead to skin erosion, bleeding, and site loss. Although traditionally repaired with ligation, interposition grafts, or stent placement, in this article, we discuss our experience with aneurysmorrhaphy utilizing a thoracoabdominal (TA) stapler. Thirteen aneurysms were treated with the TA stapler at a single, nonuniversity hospital for all patients from 2012 to 2014. The average aneurysm diameter was 3.6 cm, and the average fistula age was 57.9 months. There were no bleeding complications or recurrences. The primary patency was 80% at 6 months, with a primary assisted patency of 90% during the same time frame. Aneurysmorrhaphy with the TA stapler appears to be a safe and viable option for the treatment of venous aneurysms associated with AVFs.","Piccolo, C; Madden, N; Famularo, M; Domer, G; Mannella, W",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574415600532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26316207/,174

METHODS Lung US examinations were performed in 63 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a university hospital. Lung involvement was evaluated on a 4-point scale with a 12-area pulmonary division, obtaining a lung score (LS). Ultrasound findings and clinical characteristics were recorded. RESULTS All patients showed US involvement in at least 1 area (mean ± SD, 8 ± 3.5). The total LS was 15.3 ± 8.1, without differences between left and right lungs. Most affected regions were the lower region (95.2%) and the posterior region (73.8%). The total LS showed a strong correlation (r = -0.765) with the oxygen pressure-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; by lung region, those with a higher correlation were the LS of the anterior region (r = -0.823) and the LS of the upper region (r = -0.731). In total, 22.2% of patients required noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS). A multivariate analysis showed that the anterior region LS, adjusted for age and sex, was significant (odds ratio, 2.159; 95% confidence interval, 1.309-3.561) for the risk of requiring NIRS. An anterior region LS of 4 or higher and a total LS of 19 or higher had similar characteristics to predict the need for NIRS. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia is bilateral and heterogeneous. Most affected regions are the posterior and the lower regions. The anterior region has prognostic value because its involvement strongly correlates with the risk of requiring NIRS, and an anterior region LS of 4 or higher has high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the need for NIRS.","Castelao, Jorge; Graziani, Desirée; Soriano, Joan B; Izquierdo, José Luis",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.15508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936491/,174

73984,Guanine quadruplexes and their roles in molecular processes.,2021-06-23,"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in telehealth becoming commonplace in many health care fields. Telehealth benefits include improving access, decreasing costs, and elevating patient's experience. A review of cost minimization (CM) analyses was performed in order to explore scientific studies associated with integrating tele-otolaryngology in clinical practice. Our primary objective was to evaluate published literature for cost related to the implementation of telemedicine across otolaryngology, and to determine CM when compared to in-person visits. STUDY DESIGN Systematic Literature Review. METHODS We performed a systematic review using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane in May 2020, to identify studies with a cost analysis of tele-otolaryngology care. Inclusion criteria focused on articles citing CM data from telehealth services. Literature quality was assessed using the MINORS scoring system. RESULTS From 380 original articles screened only nine evaluated cost in otolaryngology. CM in the US ranged from $68 to $900 per visit. Cost was evaluated in general otolaryngology, sleep medicine, otology, and head and neck cancer surgery, the latter had the most benefit. The most common types of telehealth visits were routine follow-up and screening. Data were insufficient for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine has been trialed across various otolaryngology subspecialties; its incorporation is projected to have a meaningful impact on access to specialty care. This research suggests that the delivery of virtual care reduces cost with the potential of increasing net revenue across multiple otolaryngology subspecialties. Further studies are needed to better discern the entirety of cost savings and the best settings for integration.

The purpose of this study was to monitor URTI symptoms and severity in a heterogeneous group of community adults and contrast across tertiles of physical activity and fitness levels while adjusting for potential confounders. DESIGN A group of 1002 adults (ages 18-85 years, 60% female, 40% male) were followed for 12 weeks during the winter and fall seasons while monitoring URTI symptoms and severity using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey. Subjects reported frequency of aerobic activity, and rated their physical fitness level using a 10-point Likert scale. A general linear model, with adjustment for seven confounders, was used to examine the effect of exercise frequency and fitness level on the number of days with URTI and severity of symptoms. RESULTS The number of days with URTI during the 12-week period was significantly reduced, 43% in subjects reporting ≥ 5 days/week aerobic exercise compared to those who were largely sedentary (≤ 1 day/week) and 46% when comparing subjects in the high versus low fitness tertile. URTI severity and symptomatology were also reduced 32% to 41% between high and low aerobic activity and physical fitness tertiles. CONCLUSIONS Perceived physical fitness and frequency of aerobic exercise are important correlates of reduced days with URTI and severity of symptoms during the winter and fall common cold seasons.","Nieman, David C; Henson, Dru A; Austin, Melanie D; Sha, Wei",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2010.077875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21041243/,174

METHODS Ninety patients with symptoms suggestive of IHR to RCM were evaluated. ST with a panel of RCM was performed, and if negative, DPT was carried out with the culprit RCM. If ST or DPT were positive, tolerance was assessed with an alternative RCM and BAT was carried out with the same panel used for ST. RESULTS Eight (8.9%) cases were confirmed as having IHR, 5 (62.5%) by ST and 3 (37.5%) by DPT. Five from those confirmed as IHR (62.5%) had a positive BAT. CONCLUSIONS Hypersensitivity to RCM was confirmed in 9%, by ST or DPT.

We determined the reliability and reproducibility of multiple CA indices and the effect of intensive data-processing in a large population with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke. APPROACH Consecutive, consenting patients in the population-based OXVASC (Oxford Vascular Study) Phenotyped cohort underwent up to 10-min supine continuous blood pressure monitoring (Finometer) with bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) transcranial ultrasound (DWL-Dopplerbox). Un-processed waveforms (Un-A) were median-filtered, systematically reviewed, artefacts corrected and their quality blindly graded (optimal (A) to worst (E)). CA metrics were derived in time-domain (autoregulatory index (ARI), Pearson's Mx, Sx, Dx) and in very-low (VLF) and low-frequency (LF) domains (WPS-SI: wavelet phase synchronisation, transfer function analysis), stratified by recording quality. Reliability and reproducibility (Cronbach's Alpha) were determined comparing MCA sides and the first vs. second 5-min of monitoring. MAIN RESULTS In 453 patients, following manual data-cleaning, there was good reliability of indices when comparing MCA sides (Mx: 0.77; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.85; WPS-SI-LF 0.84), or repeated five minute epochs (Mx: 0.57; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.69; WPS-SI-LF 0.90), with persistently good reliability between sides even in lower quality Groups (Group D: Mx: 0.79; WPS-SI-VLF: 0.92; WPS-SI-LF: 0.91). Reliability was greatest for Pearson's Mx and wavelet synchronisation index, with reasonable reliability of transfer function analyses, but ARI was prone to occasional, potentially defective, extreme estimates (Left vs right MCA: 0.68). SIGNIFICANCE Resting-state measures of CA were valid, reproducible and robust to moderate noise, but require careful data-processing. Mx and wavelet synchronisation index were the most reliable indices for determining the prognostic value of CA in large epidemiological cohorts and its potential as a treatment target.","Lee, Yun-Kai; Rothwell, Peter M; Payne, Stephen John; Webb, Alastair J S",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abad49; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764198/,174

They can involve difficulty falling asleep (prolonged sleep onset latency), difficulty staying asleep (disturbance of sleep maintenance), sleep of poor quality (unrefreshing), or combinations of these and can lead to poor health and quality of life problems. A subtype of sleep-maintenance insomnia is middle-of-the-night wakefulness, a relatively common occurrence. Zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist, allosterically modulates an ion channel and increases the influx of Cl(-), thereby dampening the effect of excitatory (sleep disrupting) input. Recently, product label changes to some zolpidem containing products have been implemented by the FDA in order to reduce the risk associated with their morning after residual side effects. A new formulation of zolpidem tartrate (Intermezzo) sublingual tablet, an approved product indicated exclusively for the treatment of middle-of-the-night wakefulness and difficulty returning to sleep, did not have its label changed.

This initiative was intended to test reliability of ventilator devices stored long term in the CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and also used by the Department of Defense. These ventilators are intended to be used by trained operators to provide ventilatory support to adult and pediatric populations under diverse environmental conditions. The authors evaluated device performance and possible effects of long-term storage. METHODS Three SNS ventilator models: Impact Uni-Vent 754 Eagle™, Covidien (Puritan Bennett) LP10, and CareFusion LTV 1200 were used in this study. A total of 36 ventilators, 12 per model, were evaluated for performance in simulated adult populations using a test lung. The parameters evaluated included battery charge status and capability, battery longevity, positive end expiratory pressure consistency, device performance on AC and DC (battery) power, and device durability testing. RESULTS The out-of-the-box run time was equal to or higher than the manufacturer's specifications for fully charged batteries for all ventilators except 58 percent of the Impact 754 ventilators. No significant ventilator performance issues were observed in terms of tidal volume consistency, proximal pressure, oxygen consumption, and a 2000-hour run test in LP10 models. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide information about the long-term storage of ventilators that have regular maintenance, and their ability to perform reliably during a public health emergency.","Mehrabi, Ali; Dillon, Patricia; Kelly, Kyle; Hitchins, Kristina; Malatino, Eileen; Gorman, Susan; Nambiar, Madhusoodana; Scharen, Hilda",Journal of emergency management,https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.2018.0381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30387852/,174

Before 2003, there were only 10 coronaviruses with complete genomes available. After the SARS epidemic, up to December 2008, there was an addition of 16 coronaviruses with complete genomes sequenced. These include two human coronaviruses (human coronavirus NL63 and human coronavirus HKU1), 10 other mammalian coronaviruses [bat SARS coronavirus, bat coronavirus (bat-CoV) HKU2, bat-CoV HKU4, bat-CoV HKU5, bat-CoV HKU8, bat-CoV HKU9, bat-CoV 512/2005, bat-CoV 1A, equine coronavirus, and beluga whale coronavirus] and four avian coronaviruses (turkey coronavirus, bulbul coronavirus HKU11, thrush coronavirus HKU12, and munia coronavirus HKU13). Two novel subgroups in group 2 coronavirus (groups 2c and 2d) and two novel subgroups in group 3 coronavirus (groups 3b and 3c) have been proposed. The diversity of coronaviruses is a result of the infidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, high frequency of homologous RNA recombination, and the large genomes of coronaviruses. Among all hosts, the diversity of coronaviruses is most evidenced in bats and birds, which may be a result of their species diversity, ability to fly, environmental pressures, and habits of roosting and flocking. The present evidence supports that bat coronaviruses are the gene pools of group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, whereas bird coronaviruses are the gene pools of group 3 coronaviruses. With the increasing number of coronaviruses, more and more closely related coronaviruses from distantly related animals have been observed, which were results of recent interspecies jumping and may be the cause of disastrous outbreaks of zoonotic diseases.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Huang, Yi; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.3181/0903-mr-94; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19546349/,174

A literature search was conducted that included Medline®-cited peer-reviewed articles published in the past 10 years in order to identify impact data and post-implementation of a multidisciplinary VAT that support the benefits to patient safety and satisfaction and to hospital efficiencies reported in the interview program.Results: While VATs vary in structure and function, clarity of purpose and supportive training and education are key. Barriers to the implementation of VATs show commonality across countries, such as lack of investment, insufficient training and lack of awareness. Proven markers of VAT success include rapid referrals, improved patient outcomes and improved organizational efficiency. Standardization of outcomes data capture, processing and reporting are key to monitoring performance against baseline. Awareness of the cost of complications arising from inappropriate choice and placement, and poor care and maintenance, of the vascular access device must be raised.Conclusions: The implementation of VATs can positively impact patient safety and satisfaction, improve organizational efficiencies and cost effectiveness, and could create new opportunities for in- and outpatient services, beneficial to both patients and institutions.","Mussa, Baudolino; Lepelletier, Didier; Johannes van Loon, Fredericus Henricus; Caguioa, Jennifer; Pinelli, Fulvio; Munoz Mozas, Gema; Cortés Rey, Noemí; Teichgräber, Ulf",Hospital practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2021.1909897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781151/,174

Identification of novel host cellular responses that play a role in the pathogenesis of RSV infection is needed for therapeutic development. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is an evolutionarily conserved cellular signaling cascade that has been implicated in multiple biological phenomena, including the pathogenesis of some viral infections. In this study, we investigate the role of the ER stress response in RSV infection using an in vitro A549 cell culture model. We found that RSV infection induces a non-canonical ER stress response with preferential activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways with no concomitant significant activation of the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway. Furthermore, we discovered that IRE1 has an inhibitory effect on RSV replication. Our data characterize, for the first time, the nature of the ER stress response in the setting of RSV infection and identify the IRE1 stress pathway as a novel cellular anti-RSV defense mechanism.","Hassan, Ihab; Gaines, Kayla S; Hottel, Wesley J; Wishy, Ryan M; Miller, Sara E; Powers, Linda S; Rutkowski, D Thomas; Monick, Martha M",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m113.510594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497642/,174

Although not entirely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic has certainly contributed significantly to raising mental health issues across the world. What the pandemic demonstrated is the world needs to face global mental health challenges appropriately, which in turn reinforces global health. Key organisations and individuals such as the United Nations (UN) and UN Secretary General for mental health, played a major role in responding to the mental health challenges specifically resulting from Covid-19. This is demonstrated by the production of the UN Policy Briefing in May (UN 2020a) and with it an accompanying statement (UN 2020b). The statement essentially emphasized that all Governments must place mental health services central in any response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It also stressed ""when the pandemic is brought under control, grief, anxiety and depression will continue to affect people and communities"".

The CWS causes significant distress and disability. While the relationship between CUD and psychosis has been extensively studied, the potential connection between CWS and psychosis has not received as much attention. CASE PRESENTATION The CARE guideline's methodology is followed in the presentation of this case report. During the national lockdown decreed by the Spanish government for the containment of the CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a 29-year-old man suffers a CWS and a subsequent psychotic episode. He is admitted to a psychiatric unit, obtaining a rapid and complete response to treatment. DISCUSSION Clinical and pathophysiological data that support the hypothesis of CWS-induced psychosis are discussed. Due to the increasing use of cannabis worldwide, we believe that more research is needed on the mental disturbances associated with CUD, including CWS and psychosis. On the other hand, the confinement and social distancing measures adopted in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic could have restricted the availability and consumption of certain drugs, precipitating the emergence of withdrawal syndromes such as CWS.","Marín, Julen; Pérez de Mendiola, Xabier; Fernández, Sergio; Chart, Juan Pablo",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2021.1910473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884940/,174

Aim is to report our surgical management protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian non-referral center. METHODS Data retrieved during the outbreak for the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 8 to May 4, 2020 (study period) were analyzed and compared to data obtained during the same period in 2019 (control period). RESULTS During the study period 41 surgical procedures (24 electives, 17 emergency surgical procedures) underwent surgery in comparison to 99 procedures in the control period. Stratified procedures in elective and emergency surgery, and based on the indication for surgery, the only statistically significant difference was observed in the elective surgery regarding the abdominal wall surgery (0 vs. 13 procedures, p=0.0339). Statistically significant differences were not observed regarding the colorectal and the breast oncologic surgery. All stuff members were COVID-19 free. CONCLUSIONS The present protocol proved to be safe and useful to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection before and after surgery for both patients and stuff. The pandemic was responsible for the reduction in number of procedures performed, anyway for the oncologic surgery a statistically significant volume reduction in comparison to 2019 was not observed.","Balla, Andrea; De Carlo, Antonio; Aguzzi, Daniele; Petrocca, Sergio; Guida, Anna; Saraceno, Federica; Scaramuzzo, Rosa; Fanello, Gianfranco; Borrello, Alessandro; Ferranti, Fabrizio; Lepiane, Pasquale",Minerva chirurgica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4733.20.08632-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33179469/,174

RECENT FINDINGS In 2020, several ophthalmological societies have held or are planning to hold virtual conferences in lieu of their previously scheduled in-person ophthalmology conference because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The strategic meeting components attempted to be retained in these transitions include educational information disseminating, academic discussion with colleagues, sponsorships, and networking. Live-streamed components of a virtual conference may be entirely real time or may include a combination of both prerecorded and live-streamed components. A virtual meeting may offer either a single live-streamed program or several concurrent live-streamed programs from which attendees can choose. The availability of on-demand content, mechanisms for audience participation, avenues for industry interaction and contribution, registration costs, and continuing medical education credit availability vary between virtual meeting formats. SUMMARY Transition of an in-person ophthalmology conference to a virtual format with retention of the inherent value associated with the meeting is possible and the experiences of societies executing this adaptation can be helpful for others entering this space. There are numerous considerations regarding meeting format and logistics to contemplate in light of each meeting's specific audience and objectives.","Gupta, Mrinali P; Sridhar, Jayanth; Wykoff, Charles C; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740066/,174

OBJECTIVE We studied the possibility of transient-expression of an HBsAg-fused polytopic construct (HCVpc) [containing H-2d and HLA-A2-restricted CD8+CTL-epitopic peptides of C (Core; aa 132-142), E6 (Envelope2; aa 614-622), N (NS3; aa 1406-1415), and E4 (Envelope2; aa 405-414) in tandem of CE6NE4] in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves for the development of a plant-based HCV vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS A codon-optimized gene encoding the Kozak sequence, hexahistidine (6×His)-tag peptide, and HCVpc in tandem was designed, chemically synthesized, fused to HBsAg gene, and inserted into Potato virus X (PVX-GW) vector under the control of duplicated PVX coat protein promoter (CPP). The resulted recombinant plasmids (after confirmation by restriction and sequencing analyses) were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and vacuum infiltrated into tobacco leaves. The effect of gene-silencing suppressor, p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus, on the expression yield of HCVpc-HBsAg was also evaluated by co-infiltration of a p19 expression vector. RESULTS Codon-optimized gene increased adaptation index (CAI) value (from 0.61 to 0.92) in tobacco. The expression of the HCVpc-HBsAg was confirmed by western blot and HBsAg-based detection ELISA on total extractable proteins of tobacco leaves. The expression level of the fusion protein was significantly higher in p19 co-agroinfiltrated plants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The results indicated the possibility of expression of HCVpc-HBsAg constructs with proper protein conformations in tobacco for final application as a plant-derived HCV vaccine.","Mohammadzadeh, Sara; Roohvand, Farzin; Memarnejadian, Arash; Jafari, Anis; Ajdary, Soheila; Salmanian, Ali-Hatef; Ehsani, Parastoo",Pharmaceutical biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2015.1048371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25990925/,174

Verity of viral infections can infect the nervous system; these viral infections can present a wide range of manifestation. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the COVID-19 associated central nervous system manifestations, mental and neurological symptoms. For that we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of four online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Embase. All relevant articles that reported psychiatric/psychological symptoms or disorders in COVID-19 without considering time and language restrictions were assessed. All the study procedures were performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Due to the screening, 14 studies were included. The current study result indicated that, the pooled prevalence of CNS or mental associated disorders with 95% CI was 50.68% (6.68-93.88). The most prevalence symptoms were hyposmia/anosmia/olfactory dysfunction (number of study: 10) with 36.20% (14.99-60.51). Only one study reported numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia. Pooled prevalence of numbness/paresthesia and dysphonia was 5.83% (2.17-12.25) and 2.39% (10.75-14.22). The pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 3.52% (2.62-4.54) and 13.92% (9.44-19.08). Our findings demonstrate that COVID-19 has a certain relation with neurological symptoms. The hypsomia, anosmia or olfactory dysfunction was most frequent symptom. Other symptoms were headache or dizziness, dysgeusia or ageusia, dysphonia and fatigue. Depression, anxiety, and confusion were less frequent symptoms.","Soltani, Saber; Tabibzadeh, Alireza; Zakeri, Armin; Zakeri, Amir Mohammad; Latifi, Tayebeh; Shabani, Mahdi; Pouremamali, Amir; Erfani, Yousef; Pakzad, Iraj; Malekifar, Pooneh; Valizadeh, Reza; Zandi, Milad; Pakzad, Reza",Reviews in the neurosciences,https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2020-0108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618441/,174

83359,Protocols for Developing Novel Chikungunya Virus DNA Vaccines.,2016,"Background: Although access to advance care planning (ACP), palliative care, and hospice has increased, public attitudes may still be barriers to their optimal use. Purpose: To synthesize empirical research from disparate sources that describes public perceptions of ACP, palliative care, and hospice in ways that could inform public messaging. Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and other databases were made from January 2011 to January 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting survey or interview data with the public that asked specifically about awareness and attitudes toward ACP, palliative care, or hospice were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened citations, read full texts, and performed data abstraction. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria and included >9800 participants. For ACP, 80% to 90% of participants reported awareness, and a similar proportion considered it important, but only 10% to 41% reported having named a proxy or completed a written document. For palliative care, 66% to 71% of participants reported no awareness of palliative care, and those who reported awareness often conflated it with end-of-life care. However, after being prompted with a tested definition, 95% rated palliative care favorably. For hospice, 86% of participants reported awareness and 70% to 91% rated it favorably, although 37% held significant misconceptions. Limitations: A limited number of studies met inclusion criteria, and some were published in nonpeer reviewed sources. The studies reflect public perceptions pre-COVID-19. Conclusion: Consumer perceptions of ACP, palliative care, and hospice each have a distinct profile of awareness, perceptions of importance, and reports of action taking, and these profiles represent three different challenges for public messaging.","Grant, Marian S; Back, Anthony L; Dettmar, Nicole S",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32614634/,174

The first case was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has rapidly progressed to the form of a pandemic. The presentation is mild in about 80 percent of the cases, but the disease can also progress to a severe form of respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes multi-organ failure, especially in people with other co-morbidities. Pregnant women also appear to be at a greater risk of acquiring a severe infection due to physiological changes during pregnancy. Many drugs with in vitro activity against the virus or an immunomodulatory effect have been considered for repurposing or have been tried as off-label drugs. The safety data regarding the use of newly approved or off-label or investigational drugs in pregnant women is limited and this poses a great challenge for clinicians. It is thus important to know the utility and safety of the medications to avoid untoward adverse effects on pregnant women and fetuses.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the assistive effects of tDCS on the action observer network in both novice and expert gamers during an occlusion task, as well as the related electroencephalographic spectral power response. Twenty-three novice and 23 expert video gamers received either sham or active tDCS with a right parietal anode and left frontal cathode. Only experts demonstrated a significant improvement in predicting ball direction for the overall and early occlusions after tDCS. Spectral power results revealed significant changes in theta, high-gamma, and delta frequencies. The findings indicate that tDCS was able to modulate anticipatory behavior and cortical activity in experts compared with novice participants, suggesting a facilitatory role for tDCS to improve anticipatory effects and assist as a neurocognitive training technique.","Gold, Joshua; Ciorciari, Joseph",Journal of sport & exercise psychology,https://doi.org/10.1123/jsep.2020-0109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140423/,174
85239,Resveratrol inhibits inflammation after spinal cord injury via SIRT-1/NF-κB signaling pathway.,2021-08-02,"PURPOSE To determine the microsurgical features of the spinal cord and ventral and dorsal rootlets in fetal period. METHODS Twelve formalin-fixed fetuses (six females and six males) with a mean gestational age of 27.0 ± 2.04 weeks (range between 25 and 32 weeks) were dissected to evaluate morphological properties of the spinal cord and rootlets. RESULTS Length and width of each spinal cord segment, number of dorsal and ventral rootlets, length of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones of each spinal nerve, spinal cord termination level, and the whole spinal cord length were determined in all fetuses. Contrary to previous reports, the number of ventral rootlets was always more than that of dorsal rootlets in all segments. No statistically significant gender difference was found for all parameters. Rootlet number and segment width in cervical region were larger than those of thoracic, while the lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones in thoracic region were longer than those of cervical. In lumbar region, dorsal and ventral rootlet numbers were increasing again, while lengths of dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones were decreasing. Number of dorsal and ventral rootlets of C5 and C6 segments was statistically higher than other cervical segments. The mean spinal cord length was found as 105.55 ± 11.30 mm and there was a positive significant relationship with gestational age. Conus medullaris level was detected between L1 and L3 segments. CONCLUSION Detailed microsurgical data about the fetal spinal cord and the dorsal and ventral rootlets presented in this study provide significant information which may be essential during surgical interventions in early postnatal period and childhood targeting the spinal cord and spinal nerve roots.","Elvan, Özlem; Aktekin, Mustafa; Kayan, Gülden",Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00276-020-02498-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418124/,174

86183,IFN Regulatory Factors and Antiviral Innate Immunity: How Viruses Can Get Better.,2016,"OBJECTIVE We aimed to compare the clinical outcome of titanium-coated mesh and polypropylene mesh in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A total of 102 patients who received laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in January-June 2016 in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, receiving either titanium-coated mesh (n = 50) or standard polypropylene mesh (n = 52). Multiple clinical parameters were collected and analyzed, including clinical manifestations, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, hospital cost, recovery time, and postoperative complications. RESULTS All procedures were completed. A statistical difference between two groups was not identified in regards to operative time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and recovery time (P > 0.05). Three cases with seroma and 15 with foreign body sensation were reported in the titanium-coated mesh group; 9 cases with seroma and 17 with foreign body sensation were reported in the standard polypropylene mesh group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of seroma and/or foreign body sensation. A lower hospital cost but longer recovery period was documented in the standard polypropylene mesh group (P < 0.05). No recurrence, infection or chronic pain was observed during 1-year follow-up in both groups. CONCLUSION Titanium-coated mesh possesses comparable clinical qualities as the standard polypropylene mesh but with a shorter recovery period. Therefore, this mesh is promising for clinical practice though the cost is higher than the standard polypropylene mesh.","Yang, S; Shen, Y-M; Wang, M-G; Zou, Z-Y; Jin, C-H; Chen, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-018-1823-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259252/,174
86476,In Vitro Model of Physiological and Pathological Blood Flow with Application to Investigations of Vascular Cell Remodeling.,2015,"BACKGROUND The safety and efficacy of treatment with self-expandable braided stents (LEO and LVIS) required further investigation. PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after treatment with braided stents. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2006 to 2017. STUDY SELECTION According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting patients treated with LEO or LVIS stents. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, and neurologic outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS Thirty-five studies evaluating 1426 patients treated with braided stents were included in this meta-analysis. Successful stent delivery and complete aneurysm occlusion were 97% (1041/1095; 95% CI, 95%-98%) (I2 = 44%) and 88.3% (1097/1256; 95% CI, 85%-91%) (I2 = 72%), respectively. Overall, treatment-related complications were 7.4% (107/1317; 95% CI, 5%-9%) (I2 = 44%). Ischemic/thromboembolic events (48/1324 = 2.4%; 95% CI, 1.5%-3.4%) (I2 = 27%) and in-stent thrombosis (35/1324 = 1.5%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.7%) (I2 = 0%) were the most common complications. Treatment-related morbidity was 1.5% (30/1324; 95% CI, 0.9%-2%) and was comparable between the LEO and LVIS groups. Complication rates between the anterior (29/322 = 8.8%; 95% CI, 3.4%-12%) (I2 = 41%) versus posterior circulation (10/84 = 10.5%; 95% CI, 4%-16%) (I2 = 0%) and distal (30/303 = 8%; 95% CI, 4.5%-12%) (I2 = 48%) versus proximal aneurysms (14/153 = 9%; 95% CI, 3%-13%) (I2 = 46%) were comparable (P > .05). LIMITATIONS Limitations were selection and publication biases. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, treatment with the LEO and LVIS stents was relatively safe and effective. The most common complications were periprocedural thromboembolisms and in-stent thrombosis. The rate of complications was comparable among anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms, as well as for proximal and distally located lesions.","Cagnazzo, F; Cappucci, M; Lefevre, P-H; Dargazanli, C; Gascou, G; Morganti, R; Mazzotti, V; di Carlo, D; Perrini, P; Mantilla, D; Riquelme, C; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Four consecutive patients diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were counselled for RARC with PLND and ileal conduit urinary diversion performed using the da Vinci SP surgical system. A 3-cm midline incision was made 5-cm above the umbilicus. Dissection was performed to access the abdominal cavity. Insertion of the GelPOINT® advanced access platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) with the SP Cannula was performed through the incision made. A 12-mm AirSeal® (SurgiQuest Inc., Milfort, CT, USA) port for the assistant was placed on the pre-marked stoma site, where an ileal conduit urinary diversion was desired. Demographics and perioperative outcomes were collected under Institutional Review Board approval (IRB 13-780). The surgeries were performed by reproducing the steps of the institutional approach for RARC performed with the multi-arm robotic platform. RESULTS The surgeries were successfully completed. There was neither conversion to standard multi-arm robotic or open approaches nor the need for additional port placement. The mean (range) operative time was 454 (420-496) min. Blood loss averaged 312 mL. No transfusions were required and no intraoperative complications occurred. All patients had negative surgical margins. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 5. CONCLUSION From our preliminary experience, RARC with PLND and ileal conduit urinary diversion is feasible and safe using the da Vinci SP surgical system. Further comparative studies with open and multi-arm robotic approaches are warranted.","Kaouk, Jihad; Garisto, Juan; Eltemamy, Mohamed; Bertolo, Riccardo",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.14744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868722/,174

Inherent to this is the promise that advancement and transitions in training would be defined by readiness to practice rather than by time. Of the logistical problems facing competency-based, time-variable (CBTV) training, enacting time variability may be the largest hurdle to clear. Although it is true that an 'all or nothing' approach to CBTV training would require massive overhauls of both medical education and health care systems, the authors propose that training institutions should gradually evolve within their current environments to incrementally move toward the best version of CBTV training for learners, supervisors, and patients. In support of this evolution, the authors seek to demonstrate the feasibility of advancing toward the goal of realistic CBTV training by detailing examples of successful CBTV training and describing key features of initial steps toward CBTV training implementation.","Schumacher, Daniel J; Caretta-Weyer, Holly; Busari, Jamiu; Carraccio, Carol; Damodaran, Arvin; Gruppen, Larry D; Hall, Andrew K; Kinnear, Benjamin; Warm, Eric; Ten Cate, Olle",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1925098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038645/,174
87071,Towards better understanding of the heparin role in NETosis: feasibility of using native mass spectrometry to monitor interactions of neutrophil elastase with heparin oligomers.,2021-05-01,"OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review was to use RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) to assess the extent to which weight gain prevention studies targeting young adults reported on elements of external validity. DESIGN Systematic review. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Articles of interest included a lifestyle/behavioral intervention targeting weight gain prevention. Eligibility criteria included the following: study design of randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized control trials, or natural experiments; average participant age between 18 and 35 years; study duration of at least 12 months; and published in English between January 2008 and May 2018. Studies had to report weight or body mass index as a measured outcome and were excluded if they were paired with smoking cessation programs, were conducted in specific groups (ie, pregnant women, breast cancer survivors), or were follow-ups to weight loss studies. STUDY SELECTION After removing duplicates, the search yielded 11 426 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened by 1 reviewer; 144 articles were assessed in a full-text review by 2 reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Nine studies (13 articles) were included in the review. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S) Reported elements of the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS A total of 9 studies met the selection criteria. All studies lacked full reporting on external validity elements. Of the total of 60 RE-AIM reporting criteria, 8 were reported by all 9 studies, 26 criteria were reported by fewer than 4 studies, and 22 criteria were not reported by any of the studies. DISCUSSION There remains inadequate reporting of elements of external validity and generalizability in weight gain prevention studies. This is a significant scientific constraint that limits the information required to disseminate and implement prevention of weight gain interventions for population impact. Standardized reporting may be needed to ensure results that demonstrate not only internal validity but also external validity and generalizability are needed to promote public health impact.","Haire-Joshu, Debra; Morshed, Alexandra B; Phad, Allison; Johnston, Shelly; Tabak, Rachel G",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32332487/,174

Exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. Here, we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood and lung of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and non-classical monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, this study increases the knowledge on specific myeloid subsets involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sánchez-Cerrillo, Ildefonso; Landete, Pedro; Aldave, Beatriz; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Sánchez-Azofra, Ana; Marcos-Jiménez, Ana; Ávalos, Elena; Alcaraz-Serna, Ana; de Los Santos, Ignacio; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Esparcia, Laura; López-Sanz, Celia; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Gabrie, Ligia; Del Campo Guerola, Luciana; de la Fuente, Hortensia; Calzada, María J; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; Soriano, Joan B; Ancochea, Julio; Martín-Gayo, Enrique",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci140335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784290/,174

88432,"Protein Elongation, Co-translational Folding and Targeting.",2016,"BACKGROUND By the end of 2019 the sudden outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat. It is called COVID-19 because it was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in 2019. A total of 1.9 M deaths and 87.9 M cases have been reported all over the world where 49M cases have recovered so far. Scientists are working hard to find chemotherapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in a combination of several hazardous stresses, making them more resistant and beneficial. So to break down the viral system, the disease targets are examined. OBJECTIVE In today's review, a comprehensive study of spike protein explains the main purpose of the novel coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the disease virus, cross-transmission from infected to a healthy person. METHOD Covid-19 has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to global death and wide illness. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. However, the intermediate host of the novel coronavirus is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of disease, one of the viral targets, such as the spike protein that binds to human cells and causes the disease and its genetic structure, is considered with potential inhibitors. RESULTS It has been shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS- CoV-2 spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor interact and further replication of coronavirus spike protein causes its invasion in the host cell. The human Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Locus E (LY6E) inhibits the entry of CoV into host cells by interfering with the human gene, spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Some natural formulations have also been shown to prevent spike protein from binding to the host cell. CONCLUSION With the development of the LY6E gene activator that can inhibit spike protein-ACE2-mediated membrane fusion, new opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 treatment may emerge. Existing antiviral fusion inhibitors and natural compounds targeting spike resistance can serve as a template for further SARS-CoV-2 drug formulation.","Nandi, Sisir; Roy, Harekrishna; Gummadi, Asha; Saxena, Anil",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450122666210309105820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687893/,174

Equitable, person-centered contraceptive access is also important to ensure reproductive autonomy (3). Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data collected during 2017-2019 were used to estimate the proportion of women aged 18-49 years who were at risk for unintended pregnancy* and had ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services.† During 2017-2019, in the 45 jurisdictions§ from which data were collected, 76.2% of women aged 18-49 years were considered to be at risk for unintended pregnancy, ranging from 67.0% (Alaska) to 84.6% (Georgia); 60.7% of women had ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services, ranging from 45.3% (Puerto Rico) to 73.7% (New York). For all jurisdictions combined, the proportion of women who were at risk for unintended pregnancy and had ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services varied significantly by age group, race/ethnicity, and urban-rural status. Among women with ongoing or potential need for contraceptive services, 15.2% used a long-acting reversible method (intrauterine device or contraceptive implant), 25.0% used a short-acting reversible method (injectable, pill, transdermal patch, or vaginal ring), and 29.5% used a barrier or other reversible method (diaphragm, condom, withdrawal, cervical cap, sponge, spermicide, fertility-awareness-based method, or emergency contraception). In addition, 30.3% of women with ongoing or potential need were not using any method of contraception. Data in this report can be used to help guide jurisdictional planning to deliver contraceptive services, reduce unintended pregnancies, ensure that the contraceptive needs of women and their partners are met, and evaluate efforts to increase access to contraception.","Zapata, Lauren B; Pazol, Karen; Curtis, Kathryn M; Kane, Debra J; Jatlaoui, Tara C; Folger, Suzanne G; Okoroh, Ekwutosi M; Cox, Shanna; Whiteman, Maura K",MMWR.

A randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial in infants less than a year of age undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB was undertaken. Nitric oxide at a dose of 20 ppm was added to the sweep gas in the treatment group. Blood was collected at baseline and prior to separation from CPB to measure platelet count and function as determined by responsiveness to specific agonists. Clinical outcomes were observed through hospital discharge. Methemoglobin levels were measured pre-operatively, at the conclusion of CPB, and upon admission to the ICU. Forty patients consented and were randomized in the trial. Eighteen patients were randomized to the treatment group and twenty-two were included in the placebo group. The groups were similar in terms of age, weight, gender, and surgical complexity. No significant differences were found in measures of platelet count, platelet response to agonist, or clinical outcomes. Patients in the treatment group had higher methemoglobin levels after receiving nitric oxide, but no levels approached toxicity (maximum 2.4%). Nitric oxide added to the sweep gas of the oxygenator during CPB in infants did not have an appreciable effect on preservation of platelet count, platelet responsiveness to agonist, or clinical outcomes.

89060,Transabdominal ultrasound for pregnancy diagnosis in Reeves' muntjac deer.,2014,"Relevance Ivermectin, as an old anti-parasite drug, can suppress almost completely the growth of various human cancers, including ovarian cancer (OC). However, its anticancer mechanism remained to be further studied at the molecular levels. Ivermectin-related molecule-panel changes will serve a useful tool for its personalized drug therapy and prognostic assessment in OCs. Purpose To explore the functional significance of ivermectin-mediated lncRNA-EIF4A3-mRNA axes in OCs and ivermectin-related molecule-panel for its personalized drug therapy monitoring. Methods Based on our previous study, a total of 16 lncRNA expression patterns were analyzed using qRT-PCR before and after ivermectin-treated different OC cell lines (TOV-21G and A2780). Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics was used to analyze the protein expressions of EIF4A3 and EIF4A3-binding mRNAs in ovarian cancer cells treated with and without ivermectin. A total of 411 OC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database with the selected lncRNA expressions and the corresponding clinical data were included. Lasso regression was constructed to examine the relationship between lncRNA signature and OC survival risk. The overall survival analysis between high-risk and low-risk groups used the Kaplan-Meier method. Heatmap showed the correlation between risk groups and clinical characteristics. The univariate and multivariate models were established with Cox regression. Results SILAC-based quantitative proteomics found the protein expression levels of EIF4A3 and 116 EIF4A3-binding mRNAs were inhibited by ivermectin in OC cells. Among the analyzed 16 lncRNAs (HCG15, KIF9-AS1, PDCD4-AS1, ZNF674-AS1, ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, LINC00565, SNHG3, PLCH1-AS1, WWTR1-AS1, LINC00517, AL109767.1, STARD13-IT1, LBX2-AS1, LEMD1-AS1, and HOXC-AS3), only 7 lncRNAs (HCG15, KIF9-AS1, PDCD4-AS1, ZNF674-AS1, ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, and LINC00565) were obtained for further lasso regression when combined with the results of drug testing and overall survival analysis. Lasso regression identified the prognostic model of ivermectin-related three-lncRNA signature (ZNRF3-AS1, SOS1-IT1, and LINC00565). The high-risk and low-risk groups based on the prognostic model were significantly related to overall survival and clinicopathologic characteristics (survival status, lymphatic invasion, cancer status, and clinical stage) in OC patients and remained independent risk factors according to multivariate COX analysis (p < 0.05). Conclusion Those findings provided the potential targeted lncRNA-EIF4A3-mRNA pathways of ivermectin in OC, and constructed the effective prognostic model, which benefits discovery of novel mechanism of ivermectin to suppress ovarian cancer cells, and the ivermectin-related molecule-panel changes benefit for its personalized drug therapy and prognostic assessment towards its predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) in OCs.","Li, Na; Zhan, Xianquan",The EPMA journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00209-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32549918/,174

Skin neglected tropical diseases (sNTDs) are a subset of NTDs that present with cutaneous manifestations and are well known for their ability to generate stigma and promote poverty. Teledermatology (TD) represents a potential method to control sNTDs. Objective We sought to analyze the potential for TD to ease the burden of sNTDs. Methods We performed a systematic literature search using the Texas Medical Center Library One Search, which scans 167 databases, including Embase, PubMed, and Scopus. We included all original investigations published after 2011 that assessed the impact of TD intervention in the control of one or more sNTDs. We excluded studies not written in English and studies that did not perform any outcome analyses. Results Twenty studies met our search criteria, and 18 expressed positive attitudes towards TD. Overall, we found that TD may be a sustainable, cost-effective strategy for expanding access to care for individuals afflicted with sNTDs. However, poor image quality, lack of access to further diagnostic tests, and ethical, legal, and cultural issues pose as barriers to TD utilization. Conclusion TD may be helpful in achieving control of sNTDs but has its limitations. An integrated approach, which employs TD in conjunction with other strategies, represents a realistic path for alleviating sNTDs.","Joshi, Tejas P; Ren, Vicky",Dermatology practical & conceptual,https://doi.org/10.5826/dpc.1104a130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631272/,174

The treatment of affective bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have now added increased difficulties. Some psychotropic drugs interfere with the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus infection and they could interact with the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19. Some patients will need pharmacological interventions due to the presence of delirium. Smoking cessation changes the serum levels of some psychotropic drugs and may influence their use. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in clinical practice. Psychiatric patients are a vulnerable population and often a careful clinical, laboratorial and electrocardiographic evaluation may be needed, particularly in those diagnosed with COVID-19. The regular treatment of mentally ill patients with COVID-19 presents increased complexity.","Andrade, Gabriela; Simões do Couto, Frederico; Câmara-Pestana, Luis",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.13976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32705981/,174
89955,"Synthesis, Characterization, and Biological Evaluation of Some Novel Quinoxaline Derivatives as Antiviral Agents.",2017,"Muscular metastatic neoplasia has been reported to be rare in domestic animals, however previous studies were based primarily on necropsy findings. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe whole body computed tomography (CT) characteristics of confirmed muscular metastases in a cohort of dogs and cats presented for oncology evaluation. Medical records of 1201 oncology patients were reviewed. Included animals underwent pre and postcontrast whole body CT, and CT-guided tru-cut biopsy or fine needle aspiration of one or more metastatic lesions. Twenty-one dogs and six cats met inclusion criteria, representing 2.08% of all canine oncology patients and 3.1% of all feline oncology patients. Mean age was 9.6 years. Postcontrast CT characteristics included well-demarcated, oval-to-round lesions with varying enhancement patterns: ring enhancing (n = 16), heterogeneously enhancing (n = 8), or homogeneously enhancing (n = 5). Five animals showed concurrent and varying nodular patterns. In seven cases (five dogs and two cats), one single muscular nodule was observed. In 20 cases, two or more lesions were observed. In two cases, cardiac hypodense nodules were observed in the postcontrast CT, while appearing isodense in the precontrast study. Necropsy confirmed neoplasia in both of them. Locations of muscular metastases included epaxial/paraspinal muscles of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine (n = 18), superficial muscles of the thoracic wall (n = 13), scapular/shoulder region (n = 3), hind limb (n = 3), and abdominal wall muscles (n = 1). Findings supported the use of pre and postcontrast whole body CT for oncologic staging in dogs and cats, especially for primary tumors characterized by a high metastatic rate.","Vignoli, Massimo; Terragni, Rossella; Rossi, Federica; Frühauf, Lukas; Bacci, Barbara; Ressel, Lorenzo; Capitani, Ombretta; Marconato, Laura",Veterinary radiology & ultrasound : the official journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/vru.12015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23441584/,174
90199,Feline Neovascular Vitreoretinopathy and Anterior Segment Dysgenesis With Concurrent Glaucoma in Domestic Cats.,2019,"BACKGROUND The objective of the present study was to validate the qCON index of hypnotic effect and the qNOX index of nociception. Both indices are derived from the frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) and implemented in the qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain). METHODS The study was approved by the local ethics committee, including data from 60 patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery undergoing general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, using TCI. The Bis (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) was recorded simultaneously with the qCON. Loss of eyelash reflex [loss of consciousness (LOC)] was recorded, and prediction probability for Bis and qCON was calculated. Movement as a response to noxious stimulation [laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation] was registered. The correlation coefficient between qCON and Bis was calculated. The patients were divided into movers/non-movers as a response to noxious stimulation. A paired t-test was used to assess significant difference for qCON and qNOX for movers/non-movers. RESULTS The prediction probability (Pk) and the standard error (SE) for qCON and Bis for detecting LOC was 0.92 (0.02) and 0.94 (0.02) respectively (t-test, no significant difference). The R between qCON and Bis was 0.85. During the general anaesthesia (Ce propofol > 2 μg/ml, Ce remifentanil > 2 ng/ml), the mean value and standard deviation (SD) for qCON was 45 (8), while for qNOX it was 40 (6). The qNOX pre-stimuli values were significantly different (P < 0.05) for movers/non-movers as a response to LMA insertion [62.5 (24.0) vs. 45.5 (24.1)], tracheal intubation [58.7 (21.8) vs. 41.4 (20.9)], laryngoscopy [54.1 (21.4) vs. 41.0 (20.8)]. There were no significant differences in remifentanil or propofol effect-site concentrations for movers vs. non-movers. CONCLUSION The qCON was able to reliably detect LOC during general anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. The qNOX showed significant overlap between movers and non-movers, but it was able to predict whether or not the patient would move as a response to noxious stimulation, although the anaesthetic concentrations were similar.","Jensen, E W; Valencia, J F; López, A; Anglada, T; Agustí, M; Ramos, Y; Serra, R; Jospin, M; Pineda, P; Gambus, P",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24995461/,174

METHODS This study was a post-hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic response of two ART regimens. The participants were ART-naïve women living with HIV initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 clinical sites in six countries. Participants were randomized to receive raltegravir 400 mg BID or efavirenz 600 mg QD in addition to lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg BID. VVL and PVL tests were performed at every study visit. The primary outcomes measures were HIV-1 PVL and VVL at maternal study week 4 and rates of perinatal HIV transmission. RESULTS A total of 408 were enrolled, of whom 323 had VVL samples 4 weeks after enrollment and were included in this analysis. Among women with undetectable/non-quantifiable PVL during ART, the overall rate of quantifiable VVL at Week 4 was 2.54% (7/275). Of the 275 with non-quantifiable PVL, 99.1% (115/116) and 96.2% (153/159) had non-quantifiable VVL in the EFV and RAL arms, respectively. None of the seven women with quantifiable VVL at the week 4 study visit transmitted HIV to their infants. CONCLUSIONS Detectable VVL in pregnant women with undetectable/non-quantifiable PVL while receiving ART was rare and not associated with perinatal HIV transmission.","Frenkel, Lisa M; Leavitt Morrison, R; Fuller, Trevon L; Isabel Gouvêa, Maria; de Lourdes Benamor Teixeira, Maria; Coombs, Robert W; Shapiro, David E; Mirochnick, Mark; Hennessey, Roslyn; Whitson, Kyle; Chakhtoura, Nahida; João, Esaú C",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369908/,174

Prolonged isolation, contact restriction and economic shutdown impose a deeply change to the psychosocial environment. These indicate a tendency to threaten the mental health of adolescents' significantly. Detecting adolescents' psychosocial risk during Pandemic COVID-19, particularly when they stay at home, may be helpful to better understand their mental health well- being. AIMS The current study aimed to explore psychosocial risk factors associated with mental health of adolescents' in the midst of the outbreak. METHOD This research uses a qualitative approach which focuses on focus group discussions interviews. This research took 6 weeks via online communication platform involving (n = 15) adolescents from the Low Income Household. RESULT The participants adolescents' psychosocial risk experience during amidst of Outbreak Covid-19 Pandemic are composed of (1) self- conflict (develop negative thought at home, unplanned of daily activities, changing sleep pattern and irregular wake up time and massively use internet) (2) Family Members (Conflict between parent and miscommunication between siblings) (3) School (Piling up on homework, Inadequate guidance for homework and Inability to comprehend online learning). These psychosocial risk factors have caused disruption to daily life adolescents' during outbreaks and almost inevitably trigger a spike in mental health issues.

92168,Technique to Target Microinjection to the Developing Xenopus Kidney.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Parastomal hernia is described as the most common complication in patients with ostomy. It is reported that its incidence varies from 3% to 39% for colostomies and 0 to 6% for ileostomies. Surgical repair remains the treatment of choice. There are three types of surgical treatment - fascial repair, stoma relocation and repair using prosthetic mesh via a laparoscopic or open approach. Recently there have been several meta-analyses and systematic reviews aiming to compare the results of surgical treatment, and the authors agreed that the quality of evidence precludes firm conclusions. AIM To describe the novel concept of parastomal hernia repair - HyPER/SPHR technique (hybrid parastomal endoscopic re-do/Szczepkowski parastomal hernia repair) and its early results in 12 consecutive cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve consecutive patients were operated on due to parastomal hernia using the new HyPER hybrid technique between June 2013 and May 2014. The patients' condition was evaluated during the perioperative period, 6 weeks and then every 3 months after surgery. RESULTS After 6 weeks of follow-up we have not observed any mesh-related complications. All 12 patients were examined 3 months and 6 months after repair surgery for evaluation. No recurrence, stoma site infection or stoma-related problems were found. None of the patients complained of pain and none of them needed to be hospitalized again. Reported quality of life on a 0-10 scale after 6 weeks of follow-up was 8 (range: 7-10). CONCLUSIONS The HyPER procedure for treatment of parastomal hernias proposed by the authors is a safe and feasible surgical technique with a high patient satisfaction rate and a low number of complications. The hybrid procedure seems to be a promising method for parastomal hernia repair.","Szczepkowski, Marek; Skoneczny, Paweł; Przywózka, Alicja; Czyżewski, Piotr; Bury, Kamil",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2015.50052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960785/,174

94504,Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform Based Discriminant Analysis for Whole Genome Sequences.,2019,"The use of rubber granulate in the composition of asphalt mixtures, as well as the use of poroelastic layers, is indicated by many research centers as a factor with a positive effect on tire/road noise reduction. Attention is however paid to their lower structural durability compared to asphalt concrete (AC) or stone mastic asphalt (SMA). Stone mastic asphalt reducing tire/road noise (SMA LA) layers have also been recently used as low-noise road surfaces. The article presents the test results of viscoelastic properties of asphalt mixtures SMA8 LA, SMA8 LA containing 10%, 20%, and 30% of rubber granulate, with bitumen 50/70, bitumen 50/70 modified with styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) copolymer, crumb rubber, and mixtures with bitumen modified simultaneously with crumb rubber and SBS copolymer. The reference asphalt mixture was the porous asphalt (PA8). The presented results of water damage resistance, degradation resistance in the Cantabro abrasion loss test, stiffness modulus as a function of temperature and hysteresis loop proved that the amount of rubber granulate and the type of binder significantly affect the values of these parameters. Attention was paid to the possibility of using the results of uniaxial cyclic compression tests when determining the proportion of rubber granulate in SMA8 LA mixtures. Tests of hysteresis loops and stiffness modulus confirm much higher elasticity of SMA8 LA mixtures with rubber granulate as compared to mixtures without the addition of granulate.","Gardziejczyk, Wladyslaw; Plewa, Andrzej; Pakholak, Raman",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13163446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764290/,174

CASE SUMMARY A 3-year-old male, neutered Brittany spaniel presented with a 10-day history of decreased activity and partial anorexia. Serial thoracic radiographs identified a migrating pericardial metallic projectile foreign body and an echocardiogram diagnosed pericardial effusion and abdominal ultrasound identified the presence of ascites. Concern for a possible effusive-constrictive pericarditis prompted a subphrenic pericardectomy performed via thoracoscopy. The foreign body was not recovered. Six months postsurgery, the dog remained asymptomatic. NEW OR UNIQUE INFORMATION PROVIDED Considering the high rate of complications that develop in human patients where the foreign bodies are not removed, veterinarians should be aware of risks associated with long standing pericardial foreign bodies even when no clinical signs are present.

This study evaluated the early experience with the posttrial application of TAVR, with specific focus on non-transfemoral (TF) access. METHODS All patients who underwent posttrial TAVR at Emory University from November 2011 to April 2012 were reviewed. During this time, 44 posttrial TAVRs were performed: TF in 18, transapical in 11, transaortic in 12, and transcarotid in 3. RESULTS A total of 40.9% of all patients were candidates for TF implantation. Mean age was 78.2 ± 11.3 years, and 34.1% were women. Mean ejection fraction was 0.463 ± 0.164, and 90.2% had New York Heart Association class III to IV heart failure. Fifty percent were diabetic, 27.3% had moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 20.5% had a prior stroke. The mean creatinine was 1.63 ± 1.74 mg/dL, 9.1% required preoperative dialysis, and 61.4% had undergone prior cardiac operations. No patients had postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, or required new dialysis. Intraoperative vascular complications occurred in 11.4%. No patient had more than mild perivalvular leak by transthoracic echocardiography at discharge. Mean postoperative ventilator time was 17.8 ± 40.1 hours. Intensive care unit length of stay was 58.0 ± 67.0 hours. Postoperative hospital length of stay was 6.1 ± 4.7 days. The 30-day mortality was 6.8% (3 of 44) for all patients, despite a mean The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score of 12.6. CONCLUSIONS Less than half of patients deemed appropriate for posttrial TAVR were candidates for TF implantation.

95132,A Pulmonary Trunk Banding Model of Pressure Overload Induced Right Ventricular Hypertrophy and Failure.,2018,"To review flight regulations and gestational complications associated with air travel in pregnant passengers, flight attendants, and aviators. A literature search was undertaken on the relationship of air travel and spontaneous pregnancy losses, intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), birth weight<10th percentile, preterm delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. The literature search identified 128 abstracts, of which 9 evaluated air travel and pregnancy outcomes. The risk of a pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortion or IUFD) was greater in flight attendants than controls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29, 2.04). The risk of preterm birth<37 weeks was greater in passengers than controls (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.93). However, the risk of preeclampsia (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.27), neonatal intensive care unit admissions (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.82), or birth weight<10th percentile (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.48) was not increased.

The risks of spontaneous abortions and other adverse pregnancy outcomes have been poorly studied in a limited number of investigations. An analysis of the available information suggests a greater risk of spontaneous abortions or IUFD in flight attendants, and a greater risk of preterm birth<37 weeks in air passengers. However, the literature on which these findings are based is generally not of high methodologic quality.","Magann, Everett F; Chauhan, Suneet P; Dahlke, Joshua D; McKelvey, Samantha S; Watson, Erin M; Morrison, John C",Obstetrical & gynecological survey,https://doi.org/10.1097/ogx.0b013e3181e572ae; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20633306/,174

Availability of surgery may be reduced during COVID-19 and cinacalcet can be used as bridging therapy. In this single centre retrospective analysis, we investigated the efficacy and safety of cinacalcet in patients with pHPT receiving cinacalcet between March 2019 and July 2020, including pre-parathyroidectomy bridging. We reviewed and summarised the published literature. 86 patients were identified, with most achieving target calcium (79.1%) with a mean dose of 39.4 mg/day for a median duration of 35 weeks. Calcium normalised in a median time of 5 weeks. The majority of patients commenced cinacalcet 30 mg/day (78; 90.7%) with the remainder at 60 mg/day (8; 9.3%). 57.8% of patients commenced on lower dose cinacalcet (30 mg/day) achieved a target Ca without requiring 60 mg/day. Baseline PTH was significantly higher in patients requiring higher doses of cinacalcet (p=0.014). 18.6% of patients reported adverse reactions and 4.7% discontinued cinacalcet. Patients treated with cinacalcet pre-parathyroidectomy required a higher dose and fewer achieved target calcium compared to those treated medically with cinacalcet alone. Post-operative calcium was similar to patients not given pre-parathyroidectomy cinacalcet.

100229,Stable mammalian producer cell lines for structural biology.,2015,"PURPOSE Laparoscopy-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy has been increasingly reported as a treatment for early gastric cancer located in the middle third of the stomach because of its low invasiveness and preservation of pyloric function. Advantages of a totally laparoscopic approach to distal gastrectomy, including small wound size, minimal invasiveness, and safe anastomosis, have been recently reported. Here, we introduce a new procedure for intracorporeal gastro-gastrostomy combined with totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (TLPPG). METHODS The stomach is transected after sufficient lymphadenectomy with preservation of infrapyloric vessels and vagal nerves. The proximal stomach is first transected near the Demel line, and the distal side is transected 4 to 5 cm from the pyloric ring. To create end-to-end gastro-gastrostomy, the posterior wall of the anastomosis is stapled with a linear stapler and the anterior wall is made by manual suturing intracorporeally. We retrospectively assessed the postoperative surgical outcomes via medical records. The primary endpoint in the present study is safety. RESULTS Sixteen patients underwent TLPPG with intracorporeal reconstruction. All procedures were successfully performed without any intraoperative complications. The mean operative time was 275 min, with mean blood loss of 21 g. With the exception of one patient who had gastric stasis, 15 patients were discharged uneventfully between postoperative days 8 and 11. CONCLUSIONS Our novel hybrid technique for totally intracorporeal end-to-end anastomosis was performed safely without mini-laparotomy. This technique requires prospective validation.","Koeda, Keisuke; Chiba, Takehiro; Noda, Hironobu; Nishinari, Yutaka; Segawa, Takenori; Akiyama, Yuji; Iwaya, Takeshi; Nishizuka, Satoshi; Nitta, Hiroyuki; Otsuka, Koki; Sasaki, Akira",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-016-1378-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883539/,174

Mean concentrations were 0.20 ± 0.01, 0.05 ± 0.01, and 0.10 ± 0.01 mg/kg in fish flesh for Hg, Cd, and Pb, respectively. The mean concentrations of these elements were below regulatory thresholds; however, we also detected some specimens with higher levels. The mercury level showed a significant difference between fish categories, region, and year of sampling (p < 0.05). Samples from the center sites had the highest levels of Pb (0.17 ± 0.03 mg/kg; range 0.10; 0.22 mg/kg). Temporal analysis of Pb showed a significant difference between sampling year (p < 0.05). In addition, distribution among fish categories was statistically significant (p = 0.046). The rates of samples exceeding limits of Hg, Cd, and Pb were 5.3, 2.6, and 0.4%, respectively.

100819,The Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis Genotoxin Sensitivity Assay.,2021,"PURPOSE In the Union for International Cancer Control classification, extrinsic muscle involvement in oropharyngeal cancers is systematically defined as a T4a tumor, although the term extrinsic may incorrectly imply that these muscles are outside the tongue. Our aim was to describe the topography of extrinsic tongue muscles and show that their involvement in oropharyngeal cancers does not always correspond to T4a staging. METHODS This cadaveric study was based on dissections of the tongues of ten healthy subjects. Dissections were carried out using sections, and careful macroscopic examination with a 3.5-diopter magnifying glass allowed the identification of muscles from their origin to their termination. Imagery and histology were excluded to stay as close as possible to the clinical evaluation. RESULTS The sample comprised seven men and three women, with a mean age 82 years. In all the ten cases, the extrinsic muscles were located at the periphery of the tongue. The genioglossus was the only deep extrinsic muscle, extending to the periphery and under the mucous membrane of the tongue. As a result, a T1 tumor can invade the mucous membrane and affect the extrinsic muscles without transforming into a T4a tumor. CONCLUSION As extrinsic tongue muscles are peripheral and submucosal, the use of the term ""deep"" is erroneous, as is the systematic usage of extrinsic muscles to define T4a oropharyngeal cancers. This study attempts to explain this error, which is recurrent in the different editions of the Union for International Cancer Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer.","Touré, Gaoussou; Vlavonou, Sandrine; Andrianantoandro, Iavosoa; Ndiaye, Makhtar Mouhamadou",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2020.07.222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890474/,174
100971,Shotgun Lipidomic Analysis of Leishmania Cells.,2021,"Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) is the type species of the genus Megalocytivirus from the family Iridoviridae. Megalocytiviruses have been implicated in more than 50 fish species infections and currently threaten the aquaculture industry, causing great economic losses in China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. However, the cellular entry mechanisms of megalocytiviruses remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, the main internalization mechanism of ISKNV was investigated by using mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells. The progression of ISKNV infection is slow, and infection is not inhibited when the cells are treated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), chloroquine, sucrose, and chlorpromazine, which are inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The depletion of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin results in the significant inhibition of ISKNV infection; however, the infection is resumed with cholesterol replenishment. Inhibitors of caveolin-1-involved signaling events, including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), genistein, and wortmannin, impair ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells. Moreover, ISKNV entry is dependent on dynamin and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Cofraction analysis of ISKNV and caveolin-1 showed that ISKNV colocates with caveolin-1 during virus infection. These results indicate that ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells proceeds via classical caveola-mediated endocytosis and is dependent on the microtubules that serve as tracks along which motile cavicles may move via a caveola-caveosome-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway. As a fish iridovirus, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells is different from the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of frog virus 3 entry into mammalian cells (BHK-21) at 28°C, which has been recognized as a model for iridoviruses. Thus, our work may help further the understanding of the initial steps of iridovirus infection.","Guo, Chang-Jun; Wu, Yan-Yan; Yang, Li-Shi; Yang, Xiao-Bo; He, Jian; Mi, Shu; Jia, Kun-Tong; Weng, Shao-Ping; Yu, Xiao-Qiang; He, Jian-Guo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06947-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22171272/,174

102459,Obesity and Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Severity: Available Evidence and Mechanisms.,2021,"INTRODUCTION The commonly expected causative agents associated with flu-like symptoms in Kenya are the classical viral pathogens identifiable as influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, enteroviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus. However, newer agents have been identified globally that present with illnesses clinically indistinguishable from those caused by the classical pathogens; one of them is human bocavirus. METHODOLOGY A total of 384 specimens were analyzed, primarily to determine if the emerging human bocavirus (HBoV) infections exist in Kenya as coinfections with other respiratory viruses and to describe the genotype of the virus in circulation. In brief, viral nucleic acids were extracted from culture supernatants, amplified by PCR, and sequenced. RESULTS HBoV DNA was amplified from 1.8% of screened specimens. Coinfection with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus was 2.5%, 2%, and 1.4%, respectively. Multiple coinfections consisting of HBoV plus two other viruses were found in 3% of specimens. Isolation occurred in the months of January, March, April, August, and November. Retrospective review of clinical parameters indicated that all the individuals complained of non-specific symptoms, mainly fever, coughs, nasal stuffiness, runny noses, and vomiting. Phylogenetically, the GenBank deposited sequences of this study's isolates cluster closely to the reference strain NC_07455 (HBoV1). CONCLUSION Coinfections with human bocavirus (HBoV1) occur in Kenya, and high incidence might primarily be during the early stages of children's lives.","Misigo, Dennis; Mwaengo, Dufton; Mburu, David",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.3050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24518633/,174

METHODS All patients treated endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) for juxta/pararenal AAAs or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs), both elective and acute, as well as reoperations, from 2010 to 2015 were included. Treatment was fenestrated (FEVAR) or branched (BEVAR), and outcomes were analyzed for technical success and mortality at 30 and 90 days and by Kaplan-Meier curve estimates at 3 years. Outcomes on target vessels were reported as freedom from branch instability in the follow-up period. Reinterventions, endoleaks and perioperative and postoperative morbidities were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 71 patients were treated for juxta/pararenal AAA (n = 40) or TAAA (n = 31): 14 type II, 4 type III, and 13 type IV. There were 47 FEVAR (including 2 physician-modified fenestrated grafts) and 24 BEVAR procedures performed. Four TAAAs were ruptured. No open repairs were performed for these pathologies in this period. Mortality was 2.8% (n = 2) at 30 days and 9.9% at 90 days (n = 7). One late rupture occurred in a patient whose treatment was a technical failure. Survival at 3 years was 77.9% ± 5.6% overall, 90.9% ± 5.2% for juxta/pararenal AAAs, and 60.7% ± 10.3% for TAAAs. Graft deployment was successful in 69 of 71 patients. Revascularization was successful in 205 of 208 target vessels (98.6%): 51 of 51 superior mesenteric arteries, 27 of 27 celiac arteries, and 127 of 130 renal arteries. There were 131 fenestrated bridging stent grafts and 74 branched bridging stent grafts. Technical success was 68 of 71 (95.7%). There were nine cases of branch instability (5 BEVARs, 4 FEVARs) in five patients (7.0%). Seven vessels (5 renal arteries and 2 superior mesenteric arteries) underwent reintervention: 5 for stenoses, 1 for occlusion, and 1 for stent migration. Freedom from branch instability at 3 years was 92.7% ± 2.5% overall, 88.6% ± 6.4% for BEVAR, and 94.6% for FEVAR. CONCLUSIONS The short- and midterm results obtained here indicate that the benefits of a total endovascular treatment for complex aortic aneurysms, as demonstrated by large and multicenter studies, can be adapted and replicated at other centers with a dedicated aortic service. This may help guide future considerations of how to refer or treat this complex patient group.","Budtz-Lilly, Jacob; Wanhainen, Anders; Eriksson, Jacob; Mani, Kevin",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.03.422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28647195/,174

DATA SOURCES Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and Embase) were searched from inception to November 2020, including reference and citation list searches. STUDY SELECTION The initial search yielded 1499 papers, with 14 included in the review. Included articles were peer-reviewed, qualitative studies, reporting on the perceived factors influencing physical activity levels of independently mobile community-dwelling adults, greater than 3 months post stroke. DATA EXTRACTION Data extracted included location, study aim, design, participant and recruitment information and how data were collected and analysed. DATA SYNTHESIS Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify meanings and patterns, generate codes and develop themes. Five main themes were identified: (i) Social networks are important influencers of physical activity; (ii) Participation in meaningful activities rather than 'exercise' is important; (iii) Self-efficacy promotes physical activity and physical activity enhances self-efficacy; (iv) Pre-stroke identity related to physical activity influences post-stroke physical activity; and (v) Formal programmes are important for those with low self-efficacy or a sedentary pre-stroke identity. CONCLUSIONS Physical activity levels in stroke survivors are influenced by social activities and support, pre-stroke identity, self-efficacy levels and completion of activities that are meaningful to stroke survivors.","Espernberger, Karl R; Fini, Natalie A; Peiris, Casey L",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215521993690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586479/,174

Open surgical repair is the treatment of choice but is associated with morbidity. OBJECTIVE To describe the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic management for benign secondary UAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A review was performed of the 11 initial procedures performed at our academic center from December 2010 to December 2014, with mean follow-up of 38 mo (range 12-169). Patients included had benign ureteroileal strictures longer than 1cm. SURGICAL PROCEDURE A pure laparoscopic approach was systematically used, involving a two-step procedure for left and a one-step procedure for right ureteral stenosis. MEASUREMENTS Perioperative data were collected and complications were assessed using the Clavien-Dindo grading system. Outcomes and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A descriptive statistical analysis was performed for 11 surgeries in ten patients. The median stricture length was 2.4cm. No conversion to open surgery was required. The mean blood loss was 180ml and the mean hospital stay was 10 d. Early complications included limited lymphorrhea (n=1), limited anastomotic leakage (n=2), and accidental descent of a ureteral catheter (n=1) that was replaced with radiologic intervention. The mean follow-up was 38 mo (range 12-169). No late complications were reported. After 1 yr of follow-up, six patients had good glomerular filtration rates, all patients were asymptomatic, and no stenotic relapses were detected. CONCLUSIONS This laparoscopic technique for the management of benign secondary UAS is feasible, with good results and without long-term complications. This minimally invasive approach reduces the morbidity associated with open surgery while retaining good success rates. PATIENT SUMMARY We describe a novel laparoscopic approach for patients with a ureteroileal anastomosis stricture after radical cystectomy to avoid the complications associated with open surgery.

Both drugs are believed to act via a p53-dependent apoptosis pathway. The TP53 gene is frequently mutated in esophageal cancer. OBJECTIVE To test the value of TP53 as a biomarker prognosing outcome in patients with neoadjuvantly treated esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS The investigation included 36 patients with primary operable esophageal cancer who were treated neoadjuvantly with cisplatin and fluorouracil. The TP53 genotype was assessed from paraffin-embedded diagnostic tumor biopsies using a standardized gene-specific TP53 sequencing protocol (mark53 kit; mark53 Ltd, Vienna, Austria). RESULTS Mutations in the TP53 gene were present in 50% of tumors. Two-year overall survival rates were 55.6% in patients with a normal TP53 marker status, compared with 16.7% in those with a mutant TP53 gene. In patients with normal TP53, neoadjuvant treatment resulted in significant advantages in terms of tumor-associated survival (P=.0049) and overall survival (P=.0304) compared with those with mutant TP53. The median tumor-associated survival was 34.2 months for patients with normal TP53, compared with 8.9 months for those with mutant TP53. The latter had a 3-fold higher risk of dying (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.359-6.86). CONCLUSIONS The biomarker TP53 divides esophageal cancer patients into 2 categories with markedly different outcomes: patients with a normal TP53 marker status may experience notable benefits from neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil, whereas those with a mutant TP53 marker status appear to be at risk for lack of response.","Kandioler, Daniela; Schoppmann, Sebastian F; Zwrtek, Ronald; Kappel, Sonja; Wolf, Brigitte; Mittlböck, Martina; Kührer, Irene; Hejna, Michael; Pluschnig, Ursula; Ba-Ssalamah, Ahmed; Wrba, Fritz; Zacherl, Johannes",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.06.079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135238/,174

The extent of this condition and the reasons behind it are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the presence of respiratory agents in the oropharynx of adolescents healthy enough to attend school activities. METHODS On a single day in December, samples from the posterior wall of the oropharynx of adolescents aged 10-15 y were obtained using cotton-tipped swabs. The samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of 13 respiratory viruses and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae). RESULTS Out of the 232 adolescents sampled, 67 (29%) had any respiratory symptom. A positive PCR result was found in 50 individuals (22%). Human rhinovirus was the most commonly found agent. Respiratory agents were significantly more frequent in the younger age group (10-13 y) than in the older age group (14-15 y): 26% (38/148) vs 14% (12/84), respectively; p = 0.04. Cough was the only symptom that was more common among individuals with a positive PCR test than among those with a negative PCR test: 8/50 (16%) vs 11/182 (6%); p = 0.02. Family size and class size were not associated with the likelihood of a positive PCR test. CONCLUSIONS The presence of respiratory agents in the oropharynx is a frequent finding among adolescents healthy enough to attend school activities.

METHODS A telephone interview study was conducted at the end of April 2020. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was chosen to identify themes and concepts and a semi-structured interview guide was developed. The analysis was structured according to constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, including attitudes to breast cancer screening, norms and motivations to comply with breast cancer screening, perceived control and anticipated regret. RESULTS Interviews were carried out with 33 women aged 50-69 (mean 62) years. The women felt that screening was of secondary importance during the height of the pandemic and they felt low perceived control over transportation to the screening clinic and over the screening situation itself, where social distancing was impossible. They perceived messages from the authorities as conflicting regarding the request for social distancing and a lack of recommendations about using face masks at the screening clinic. CONCLUSIONS Women who postponed or cancelled breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic felt that public recommendations appeared contradictory. Uncertainty about the 'new norm(al)' of COVID-19 made them stay at home, although the screening clinics remained open. The findings point to the importance of addressing perceived inconsistency between recommendations from the World Health Organization and the national management of these recommendations, and to secure univocal information from the authorities about the recommended use of healthcare services in a time of crisis.","Kirkegaard, Pia; Edwards, Adrian; Andersen, Berit",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211002648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764227/,174

111704,Isolation and molecular characterisation of chicken parvovirus from Brazilian flocks with enteric disorders.,2015,"In light of concerns over the potential detrimental effects of declining care continuity, and the need for connection between patients and health care providers, our multidisciplinary group considered the possible ways that relationships might be developed in different kinds of health care encounters.We were surprised to discover many avenues to invest in relationships, even in non-continuity consultations, and how meaningful human connections might be developed even in telehealth visits. Opportunities range from the quality of attention or the structure of the time during the visit, to supporting relationship development in how care is organized at the local or system level and in the use of digital encounters. These ways of investing in relationships can exhibit different manifestations and emphases during different kinds of visits, but most are available during all kinds of encounters.Recognizing and supporting the many ways of investing in relationships has great potential to create a positive sea change in a health care system that currently feels fragmented and depersonalized to both patients and health care clinicians.The current COVID-19 pandemic is full of opportunity to use remote communication to develop healing human relationships. What we need in a pandemic is not social distancing, but physical distancing with social connectedness.","Bergman, David; Bethell, Christina; Gombojav, Narangerel; Hassink, Sandra; Stange, Kurt C",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393566/,174
111720,Strategy Combining Nonanimal Methods for Ocular Toxicity Evaluation.,2021,"PURPOSE To describe the effects of COVID-19 lockdown and a subsequent retraining on the training workloads, autonomic responses, and performance of a group of elite athletes. METHODS The training workloads and heart rate variability (assessed through the log-transformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals) of 7 elite badminton players were registered daily during 4 weeks of normal training (baseline), 7 to 10 weeks of lockdown, and 6 to 8 weeks of retraining. Physical performance was assessed at baseline and after each phase by means of a countermovement jump and the estimated squat 1-repetition maximum. RESULTS A reduction in training workloads was observed in all participants during the lockdown (-63.7%), which was accompanied by a reduced heart rate variability in all but one participant (-2.0%). A significant reduction was also observed for countermovement jump (-6.5%) and 1-repetition maximum performance (-11.5%), which decreased in all but one participant after the lockdown. However, after the retraining phase, all measures returned to similar values to those found at baseline. At the individual level, there were divergent responses, as exemplified by one athlete who attenuated the reduction in training workloads and increased her performance during the lockdown and another one who markedly reduced his workload and performance, and got injured during the retraining phase. CONCLUSIONS Although there seems to be a large interindividual variability, COVID-19 lockdown is likely to impose negative consequences on elite athletes, but these detrimental effects might be avoided by attenuating reductions in training workloads and seem to be overall recovered after 6 to 8 weeks of retraining.","Valenzuela, Pedro L; Rivas, Fernando; Sánchez-Martínez, Guillermo",International journal of sports physiology and performance,https://doi.org/10.1123/ijspp.2020-0735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33873155/,174

112001,Cannulation of the mouse submandibular salivary gland via the Wharton's duct.,2011,"Monopolar electrocautery is a fast and elegant cutting option. However, as it creates surgical smoke containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), it may be hazardous to the health of the surgical team. Although new technologies, such as feedback mode (FM) and Teflon-coated blades (TBs), reduce tissue damage, their impact on surgical smoke creation has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, we analyzed the plume at its source.The aim of this study was to evaluate if electrocautery FM and TBs create less surgical smoke.Porcine tissue containing skin was cut in a standardized manner using sharp-edged Teflon-coated blades (SETBs), normal-shaped TBs, or stainless steel blades (SSBs). Experiments were performed using FM and pure-cut mode. Surgical smoke was sucked through filters or adsorption tubes. Subsequently, filters were scanned and analyzed using a spectrophotometer. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) was performed to detect benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and phenanthrene as 2 of the most critical PAHs. Temperature changes at the cutting site were measured by an infrared thermometer.In FM, more surgical smoke was created using SSB compared with TBs (P < 0.001). Furthermore, differences between FM and pure-cut mode were found for SSB and TB (P < 0.001), but not for SETB (P = 0.911). Photometric analysis revealed differences in the peak heights of the PAH spectrum. In HLPC-UV, the amount of BaP and phenanthrene detected was lower for TB compared with SSB. Tissue temperature variations increased when SSB was used in FM and pure-cut mode. Furthermore, different modes revealed higher temperature variations with the use of SETB (P = 0.004) and TB (P = 0.005) during cutting, but not SSB (P = 0.789).We found that the use of both TBs and FM was associated with reduced amounts of surgical smoke created during cutting. Thus, the surgical team may benefit from the adoption of such new technologies, which could contribute to the primary prevention of smoke-related diseases.","Kisch, Tobias; Liodaki, Eirini; Kraemer, Robert; Mailaender, Peter; Brandenburger, Matthias; Hellwig, Veronika; Stang, Felix H",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000001104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26166102/,174

Objectives are to identify: (1) evidence-informed interventions for individuals with visual dysfunction after mild traumatic brain injury; (2) professions providing these interventions; (3) gaps in the literature and areas for further research. Methods: A scoping review was conducted of four electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature from the databases earliest records to June 2017. Articles were included if the study population was mild traumatic brain injury/concussion and a vision rehabilitation intervention was tested. Two independent reviewers screened articles for inclusion, extracted data, and identified themes. Results: The initial search identified 3111 records. Following exclusions, 22 articles were included in the final review. Nine studies evaluated optical devices, such as corrective spectacles, contact lenses, prisms, or binasal occlusion. Two studies assessed vision therapy. Ten studies examined vision therapy using optical devices. One study investigated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Optometrists performed these interventions in most of the studies. Future research should address quality appraisal of this literature, interventions that include older adult and pediatric populations, and interdisciplinary interventions. Conclusions: There are promising interventions for vision deficits following mild traumatic brain injury. However, there are multiple gaps in the literature that should be addressed by future research. Implications for Rehabilitation Mild traumatic brain injury may result in visual deficits that can contribute to poor concentration, headaches, fatigue, problems reading, difficulties engaging in meaningful daily activities, and overall reduced quality of life. Promising interventions for vision rehabilitation following mild traumatic brain injury include the use of optical devices (e.g., prism glasses), vision or oculomotor therapy (e.g., targeted exercises to train eye movements), and a combination of optical devices and vision therapy. Rehabilitation Professionals (e.g., optometrists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists) have an important role in screening for vision impairments, recommending referrals appropriately to vision specialists, and/or assessing and treating functional vision deficits in individuals with mild traumatic brain injury.","Simpson-Jones, Mary E; Hunt, Anne W",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1460407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29631511/,174

We examined the characteristics of Ontario families with youth with MHA issues and their service needs. METHODS A cross-sectional survey study investigated the characteristics and service needs of families with youth with MHA issues across the province of Ontario, Canada. A total of 840 caregivers were recruited. RESULTS 259 participants (Mage = 45.94, SD = 7.11) identified as caregiving for at least one youth with MHA issues. The majority of the participants were female (70.7%), married (73.4%), and completed at least some college/Bachelor degree (59.1%). The mean age of youth was 16.72 years (SD = 5.33) and the most frequently reported diagnoses were Depression (30.1%), ADHD (27.8%) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (21.2%). Regression results demonstrated that presently accessing services, presently seeking services, and higher levels of barriers MHA services were significantly predictive of identifying navigation as helpful for finding appropriate MHA services (χ2(7) = 28.69, p < .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .16). Furthermore, presently accessing services was significantly predictive of identifying case management as helpful (χ2(7) = 29.59, p < .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .156), and of identifying a primary healthcare provider as helpful (χ2(7) = 38.75, p < .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .197) for finding appropriate MHA services. CONCLUSION Identifying the nature and extent of youth MHA issues, service needs, and family preferences can inform the development of services that address families' needs and lend vital support for accessing services within a complex system.","Markoulakis, Roula; Chan, Samantha; Levitt, Anthony",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02801-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795285/,174
112850,Efficacy of oral meloxicam suspension for prevention of pain and inflammation following band and surgical castration in calves.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Mast cells (MCs) and their products (e.g., histamine, serotonin, heparin, prostaglandins, cytokines, etc.) play key roles in controlling local inflammation, wound healing, and foreign body reactions in vivo. Investigation of the role of MCs in mediating local tissue responses to synthetic hernia meshes has been very limited to date. We aimed to determine the effects of MCs/MC products in mice undergoing synthetic mesh implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Circular samples (5 mm) of heavyweight microporous polypropylene (Trelex), midweight microporous polypropylene (ProLite), lightweight macroporous polypropylene with poliglecaprone (Ultrapro), and 3-dimensional macroporous polyester (Parietex) meshes were implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 J mice with and without cromolyn (MC stabilizer/suppressant) treatment (50 mg/kg, daily IP). Two weeks post-implantation, all meshes were explanted and evaluated histologically using H&E and trichrome stains. RESULTS Chronic inflammation was focused around individual mesh fibers; inter-fiber inflammation and fibrosis diminished as mesh porosity increased. MC accumulation was seen at the periphery of inflammatory reactions, and in association with mesh-induced fibrosis and neovascularization. Cromolyn treatment resulted in significantly decreased fibrotic responses to all four meshes and reduced inflammation induced by Trelex, ProLite, and Parietex meshes but not Ultrapro. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that MCs play important roles in mesh-induced host tissue reactions. Blocking MC degranulation decreased early inflammation and fibrosis induced by most synthetic meshes in this study. Further evaluation and understanding of the role of MCs in mesh-induced tissue reactions will provide new therapeutic approaches to enhance the biocompatibility of surgical meshes and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing hernia repair with synthetic biomaterials.","Orenstein, S B; Saberski, E R; Klueh, U; Kreutzer, D L; Novitsky, Y W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0680-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20526725/,174

First identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has since become a global pandemic. Although the reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), computed tomography (CT) is recommended for both initial evaluation and follow-up. The CT findings in COVID-19 are varied, but typical ground-glass opacities are usually reported to occupy a peripheral costal subpleural distribution. Here we report eight confirmed COVID-19 cases who underwent clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and unenhanced chest CT. In all patients, chest CT showed the presence of ground-glass opacities in the mediastinal subpleural parenchyma. While these cases also showed the typical CT features of COVID-19, involvement of the mediastinal subpleural parenchyma should not lower the index of suspicion for COVID-19.","Urciuoli, Luigi; Guerriero, Elvira; Musto, Lanfranco",Journal of radiology case reports,https://doi.org/10.3941/jrcr.v14i11.3974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708340/,174

Only in vitro antibody selection technologies are able to provide the required throughput to generate these large numbers. Phage display is the most widely used technology for in vitro selection of antibodies. The major bottleneck of a phage display selection pipeline is the production of monoclonal antibody fragments for screening and further analysis. In this study, we describe the development of improved protocols for the production of single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragments in 96-well microtitre plates (MTPs) in Escherichia coli. Four scFvs were expressed using the antibody expression vector pOPE101-XP to analyse the influence of a set of different parameters on their production. Further, six scFvs were expressed using the phage display vector pHAL14 to investigate the effect on the production of functional scFvs using those parameters that improved production from pOPE101-XP. Yield in MTPs was influenced by a variety of conditions and was also strongly dependent on the individual scFv clone. Although it was not possible to deduce a single set of optimal parameters applicable to all the tested scFvs, a combined protocol was developed which improved the expression of scFv fragments over standard methods.","Hust, Michael; Steinwand, Miriam; Al-Halabi, Laila; Helmsing, Saskia; Schirrmann, Thomas; Dübel, Stefan",New biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2009.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19552889/,174

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the technical success of LL in pancreatic duct (PD) stones. DESIGN Retrospective cohort. SETTING Four tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS Patients undergoing endotherapy for PD stones. INTERVENTIONS ERCP with per-oral pancreatoscopy (POP)-guided LL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT Technical success was defined as complete stone clearance. RESULTS Over 3 years, 28 patients (16 men, 51 years [mean age]) underwent a median of 1 (range, 1-4) POP-LL for PD stones. Baseline parameters included pain requiring hospitalization (n=19, 68%), opiate use (n=14, 50%), or weight loss (n=11, 39%). Before POP-LL, 22 of 28 patients (79%) had a median of 1 (range, 1-5) ERCP, 9 of 28 (32%) underwent a median of 2 (range, 1-3) ESWL sessions, and 5 underwent a median of 1 (range, 1-3) POP-guided electrohydraulic lithotripsy with failed (n=2) or partial (n=3) fragmentation. A median of 2 (range, 1-3) stones sized 15 mm (range, 4-32 mm) were identified in the head (n=9, 32%), neck (n=3, 11%), body (n=9, 32%), tail (n=1, 4%), or multiple sites (n=6, 21%).

However, it exhibits significant polarization, limited rate and cycling performances due to its lower electronic conductivity and formation of Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ during cycling. In this report, a chemical approach is presented to partially replace Mn2+ of the NVMP framework by Mg2+ and Al3+ substitutions. The Mg- and Al-substituted NVMP cathodes present smoother voltage profiles, facile sodium (de)intercalation, enhanced rate performances (80 mA h g-1 at 5C rate) and capacity retention (≈96% after 100 cycles) in comparison with the unsubstituted sample. Their enhanced performances are attributed to suppressed Jahn-Teller effect, increased covalent character and sodium ion vacancies of the NASICON framework.

Respiratory symptoms are infrequently observed, likely reflecting variations in infection kinetics in human airways. Supporting this idea, we recently identified individual differences in NiV replication kinetics in cultured airway epithelia from different human donors. As type III interferons (IFN-λ) represent major players in the defence mechanism against viral infection of the respiratory mucosa, we studied IFN-λ induction and antiviral activity in NiV-infected primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) cultured under air-liquid interface conditions. Our studies revealed that IFN-λ was upregulated in airway epithelia upon NiV infection. We also show that IFN-λ pretreatment efficiently inhibited NiV replication. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of IFN-λ varied in HBEpCs from two different donors. Increased sensitivity to IFN-λ was associated with higher expression levels of IFN-λ receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as enhanced induction of interferon-stimulated gene expression. These findings suggest that individual variations in IFN-λ receptor expression affecting IFN responsiveness can play a functional role for NiV replication kinetics in human respiratory epithelial cells of different donors.","Sauerhering, Lucie; Müller, Helena; Behner, Laura; Elvert, Mareike; Fehling, Sarah Katharina; Strecker, Thomas; Maisner, Andrea",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984239/,174
119630,Use of a Steerable Sheath for Antegrade Catheterization of a Supra-Aortic Branch of an Inner-Branched Arch Endograft via a Percutaneous Femoral Access.,2020-07-07,"Despite the ubiquity of the body mass index (BMI) in discourse on health, there is ambiguity in its use as a biomarker of current abnormality versus future risk. This distinction is consequential for knowledge of the relationship between body size and health, as well as for individuals deemed to have abnormal and 'unhealthy' bodies. Consequently, the purposes of this review are threefold. The first is to differentiate this 'biomarker' perspective from extant critiques of BMI as a proxy for health behaviours or as the defining characteristic of obesity as a disease. The second is to highlight the shift towards treating BMI as a measure of attained unhealthiness, rather than a probabilistic indicator of risk. Finally, rather than call for the abolition of BMI, this paper argues that its continued use as 'just a number' is in keeping with the push for weight neutrality in research and practice. The review concludes by demonstrating how the riskiness and unhealthiness of body size is conflated in public health messaging on COVID-19. BMI is a marker of risk, but its use as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity equates body size with health, shaping beliefs about vulnerability and personal responsibility amid an ongoing pandemic.","Gutin, Iliya",Sociology of health & illness,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086365/,174

Here, we describe our institutional experience with a rapid influx of patients at the epicenter of the pandemic. METHODS We retrospectively review our experience with the departments of cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, anesthesia, and critical care medicine and summarize protocols developed in the midst of the pandemic. RESULTS The rapid influx of patients requiring an intensive level of care required a complete restructuring of units, including the establishment of a new COVID-19 negative unit for the care of patients requiring urgent or emergent non-COVID-19 related care including open-heart surgery. This unique unit allowed for the delivery of safe and effective care in the epicenter of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Here, we demonstrate the response of a large tertiary academic medical center to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we demonstrate how rapid structural changes can allow for the continued delivery of cardiac surgical care with similar outcomes as those reported before the pandemic.","Farrington, Woodrow J; Mack, Charles A; Karas, Maria G; Ivascu, Natalia S; Robinson, N Bryce; Iannacone, Erin; Lau, Christopher; Mick, Stephanie L; Girardi, Leonard N",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939825/,174

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time-Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time-Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned.","Lin, Huang-Chen; Wang, Shyh-Hau",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599928/,174

We report our initial experience in children with a variety of single-site procedures. METHOD A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent a single-site procedure from April 2009 to April 2010. RESULTS There were 142 consecutive procedures: 24 cholecystectomies, 103 appendectomies for nonperforated appendicitis, 2 splenectomies, 1 combined splenectomy/cholecystectomy, 8 ileocecectomies, 2 Meckel diverticulectomies, 1 small bowel duplication resection, and 1 jejunal stricture resection. There were 12 conversions to conventional laparoscopy: 10 during appendectomy and 2 during cholecystectomy. Mean operative time was 34 minutes for appendectomy, 73 minutes for cholecystectomy, 90 minutes for splenectomy, 116 minutes for combined splenectomy/cholecystectomy, 86 minutes for ileocecectomy, and 43 minutes for the small bowel procedures. The only complications were umbilical surgical site infections after appendectomy in 6 patients. CONCLUSION This institution's preliminary experience suggests that single-incision laparoscopic surgery in children has at least comparable outcomes to conventional laparoscopic surgery. However, prospective data are needed to prove that single-incision laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional laparoscopy.","Garey, Carissa L; Laituri, Carrie A; Ostlie, Daniel J; Snyder, Charles L; Andrews, Walter S; Holcomb, G Whit; St Peter, Shawn D",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2011.02.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616250/,174

124622,Passive immunization with hyperimmune egg-yolk IgY as prophylaxis and therapy for poultry diseases--A review.,2015,"PURPOSE It is often assumed a person with a higher mean skin temperature (Tsk) will sweat more during exercise. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether Tsk describes any individual variability in whole-body sweat rate (WBSR) independently of the evaporative requirement for heat balance (Ereq). METHODS 140 bouts of 2-h treadmill walking completed by a pool of 21 participants (23±4 y, 174±8 cm, 76±11 kg, 1.9±0.2 m) under up to 9 conditions were analyzed. Trials employed varying rates of metabolic heat production (Hprod) (197-813 W), and environmental conditions (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C; all 50% RH), yielding a wide range of Ereq (86-684 W) and Tsk values (26.9-34.4°C). RESULTS The individual variation observed in WBSR was best described using Ereq (in W) (R=0.784) as a sole descriptor, relative to Ereq (in W·m) (R=0.735), Hprod (in W) (R=0.639), Hprod (in W·m) (R=0.584), Ta (R=0.263) and Tsk (R=0.077); all P<0.001. A multiple stepwise linear regression included only Ereq (in W) (adjusted R=0.784), with Tsk not significantly correlating with the residual variance (P=0.285), independently of Ereq (in W). Hprod (in W) had similar predictive strength to Ereq (in W) at a fixed air temperature, explaining only 5.2% at 30°C, 4.9% at 25°C, 2.7% at 20°C and 0.5% at 15°C (all P<0.001) less variance in WBSR compared to Ereq. However, when data from all ambient temperatures were pooled, Hprod alone was a markedly worse predictor of WBSR than Ereq (R=0.639 vs. 0.784; P<0.001). CONCLUSION Ereq (in W) explained approximately four-fifths of the individual variation in WBSR over a range of ambient temperatures and exercise intensities, while Tsk did not explain any residual variance independently of Ereq.","Hospers, Lily; Cheuvront, Samuel N; Kenefick, Robert W; Jay, Ollie",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735116/,174
124841,Sequentially addressable dielectrophoretic array for high-throughput sorting of large-volume biological compartments.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the most common manifestations of atherosclerotic disease worldwide. Peripheral arterial calcification reduces acute success and long-term patency of endovascular therapy for PAD. Several calcium modification devices are available for use in peripheral interventions. Outcomes after peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a novel approach using pulsatile sonic waves to treat luminal and medial calcium in patients with PAD, have not been extensively characterized. Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient-level data (IPD) pooled analysis of available studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled IPD, including baseline and procedural variables, from five prospective studies which assessed IVL in the treatment of patients with extensive peripheral artery calcification. Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and procedural angiographic complications were assessed by independent core laboratory. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using linear mixed effects models and safety endpoints were tabulated overall and by vascular bed. Among 336 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization with use of IVL, there was a significant reduction between pre-procedural and final %DS of 55.1% (95% confidence interval 53.3-57.0%, p < .0001). Core-laboratory assessed lesion-level complications, including flow-limiting dissections (Types D-F), vessel perforation, distal embolization, thrombus, abrupt closure, and no reflow, occurred in 4/328 (1.22%) of treated lesions. CONCLUSIONS The present IPD of five prospective studies, marking the largest analysis to date evaluating the use of IVL in significantly calcified PAD lesions, demonstrates this treatment strategy to be both effective and safe.","Madhavan, Mahesh V; Shahim, Bahira; Mena-Hurtado, Carlos; Garcia, Lawrence; Crowley, Aaron; Parikh, Sahil A",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31957955/,174

But have surgeons actually changed their practice as a result of these recent data? The purpose of this study was to compare pin configuration, loss of reduction and rate of nerve injuries before and after the RCT. METHODS This was a retrospective review of patients with Gartland type 3 SCHF who were treated before the RCT (April 2000 to April 2003: 141 patients) and after the trial (April 2006 to April 2009: 126 patients). Eight surgeons were included. Patient demographic data, pin configuration, neurovascular status, and radiographic results were compared. Comparisons between the pretrial cohort and the posttrial cohort as a group as well as for each individual surgeon were performed. Comparisons included the choice of pin configuration, incidence of loss of radiographic reduction, iatrogenic nerve injuries, return to the operating room, and infection before and after the clinical trial. RESULTS There was a statistically different pin configuration in the pretrial group compared with the posttrial group (P<0.0001) with the posttrial group having a much higher percentage of bicolumnar lateral entry only pins. Five out of 8 surgeons individually had a statistically significant change in their practice pattern for pin configuration. There was no difference from pretrial to posttrial in loss of radiographic reduction, infection rate, iatrogenic nerve injuries, or return to the operating room. CONCLUSIONS Data showing change in surgeon practice have been relatively sparse. In this group of surgeons who participated in an RCT, there was a statistically significant change in pin configuration for treatment of Gartland type 3 SCHF after the results of the RCT were known. The change in clinical practice did not have an effect on outcomes.

METHODS Twenty-one subjects with chronic lung disease (18 with COPD, 3 with pulmonary fibrosis) and documented room air exertional S(pO2) ≤ 85% performed four 6-min walk tests: a control walk using the subject's current oxygen system and prescribed exertional flow rate, and 1 walk with each of the 3 POCs (Eclipse 3, EverGo, and iGo) at their maximum pulse-dose setting. RESULTS S(pO2) was significantly higher pre-walk and post-walk with the Eclipse 3, compared to the other POCs (all P < .01). The subjects also walked farther and maintained a mean S(pO2) ≥ 90% with the Eclipse 3 (both P < .01), which delivers the largest oxygen bolus. The subjects indicated that they preferred the EverGo's physical characteristics, but that the Eclipse 3 responded best to their breathing. The iGo was rated less favorably than Eclipse 3 or EverGo. CONCLUSIONS The Eclipse 3 was best at meeting the subjects' clinical needs. POC users should be appropriately tested during all activities of daily living, to ensure adequate oxygenation. The healthcare provider should provide information and help to direct the subject toward the most clinically appropriate oxygen system, while being mindful of the patient's preferences and lifestyle.

127782,3-Trifluoromethylpyrazolones derived nucleosides: Synthesis and antiviral evaluation.,2019,"Bone wax, primarily composed of beeswax and softening agent, is a century-old material used to control bleeding of disrupted bone surfaces by acting as a mechanical barrier to seal the wound. The current bone wax products are commonly packed in easy-to-open foil in the form of sterile sticks or plates, with excellent malleability and smooth consistency, enabling cost-effective and easy handling approach for bleeding control. It has also been reported that the inert nature of bone wax causes complications including foreign body reaction, infection promotion and bone healing inhibition. With the advances in biomaterials and the market boost of bone haemostatic materials, the arena of bone wax substitute research has expanded to a wide spectrum of material formulations and forms. However, the development of substitutes of bone wax for translation is a pivotal yet challenging topic because currently a potential candidate is recommended to be just as simple to use, effective and inexpensive to produce as traditional bone wax but also be absorbable and osteogenic. This review provides an overview of bone wax including its history, clinical applications and associated complication. In addition, emerging substitutes of bone wax and outlooks of future directions including the standardised evaluation methods are also discussed as an effort to catalyse the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future. The translational potential of this article: Occurrence of osseous haemorrhage is common in surgically incised or traumatically fractured bone. It is essential to stop bone bleeding to avoid further pathologic consequences such as tissue necrosis and eventually mortalities due to blood loss. Medical sterile bone wax is a classical material for haemostasis of bone during orthopaedic surgeries, thoracic surgeries, neurological surgeries and so on. Along with its widespread use, complications such as foreign body reaction, bone healing inhibition and infection promotion associated with bone wax are observed. With the growing knowledge in biomaterials and the boost of market of bone haemostatic materials, bone wax substitute research is thriving. An overview of bone and its substitutes together with evolution of their design criteria is carried out in this work, providing information for the innovation and translation of bone haemostatic agents in the near future.","Zhou, Huan; Ge, Jun; Bai, Yanjie; Liang, Chunyong; Yang, Lei",Journal of orthopaedic translation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jot.2019.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194062/,174

At that time, three healthy kittens had already been delivered. Physical examination identified the mass as a portion of the uterus that was eviscerated without eversion of the mucosa. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a vaginal vault rupture with a large portion of the uterus herniated through the tear and eviscerated through the vulva. Ovariohysterectomy was performed, and a dead fetus was removed with the uterus. Reconstruction of the vaginal rupture required careful dissection and urethral catheterization. The queen recovered without complications. Relevance and novel information Uterine evisceration through a vaginal tear is a very rare condition that sometimes is erroneously referred to as 'prolapse'. Uterine prolapse and uterine evisceration may have similar presenting signs; however, proper identification and surgical correction is key when the uterus is eviscerated.

METHODS This was a retrospective review of medical records of patients seen in the Sleep and Circadian Clinic at Brigham Health during the immediate period of one month after the national lockdown was announced on March 15, 2020. Patients with OSA were included only if PAP adherence data was available in the 12- months prior and in the month after the lockdown. Patients with other sleep disorders and OSA patients without the adherence data were excluded. RESULTS Mean age was 63.5± 13.9 years, 55% of the participants were men, and mean BMI was 31.8 ± 7.9 kg/m². Severe OSA was noted among 59.5% compared to 29.3% moderate, and 11.2% mild OSA.

Unknown and re-emerging infectious diseases are a growing concern for many healthcare facilities. The purpose of this project was to develop a modular approach to integrate rapid deployment of clinical decision support for infectious diseases into the clinical workflow and evaluate the usability of the design. This article reports on the results of a quality improvement project to develop, implement, and evaluate rapid deployment of a clinical decision support module using a tuberculosis use case. Important lessons learned from the electronic health record build with previous Ebola and Zika decision support alert strategy are discussed as foundational in guiding the overall design, implementation, and evaluation of improvement strategies. Subject matter expert feedback was sought throughout the project for electronic health record design and build considerations. Usability evaluation was conducted using the classic Task, User, Representation, and Function unified framework of electronic health record usability. Usability satisfaction for both providers and nurses remained high. Tuberculosis cases pre-alert and post-alert had decreased order times for diagnostic studies. Results suggest satisfied clinicians coupled with usable systems create a more efficient workflow resulting in safer and timelier diagnostic testing.","Hoelscher, Dwayne; McBride, Susan","Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN",https://doi.org/10.1097/cin.0000000000000654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769624/,174

134222,Neonatal Cardiac Scaffolds: Novel Matrices for Regenerative Studies.,2016,"BACKGROUND Hereditary diffuse gastric carcinomas (HDGCs) are particularly troubling because of autosomal dominant heritance, high penetrance, early age of onset, and a lack of effective treatment once symptomatic. HDGC is further complicated by difficulty of effective screening. Gastrectomy provides definitive treatment for CDH1 mutation-positive patients. Attempting to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this procedure via a laparoscopic approach is appropriate. METHODS Six consanguineous patients, 21 to 51 years of age, were identified as carriers of the CDH1 gene mutation. All of the patients' gastric mucosa was normal by endoscopic appearance and biopsy. After appropriate multispecialty counseling, all patients elected to undergo a laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Demographics, genealogy, operative approach, outcomes, and pathology were reviewed. RESULTS All gastrectomies were completed using a laparoscopic approach. Gross examination of resected stomachs was unremarkable. Histological examination demonstrated multiple foci of invasive signet ring adenocarcinoma in all patients. There were no anastomotic leaks, one small bowel obstruction requiring reoperation, and one esophageal stricture requiring dilation. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates the utility and safety of the laparoscopic approach for prophylactic total gastrectomy for carriers of the CDH1 gene mutation. It serves to highlight that patients with CDH1 mutations may be more likely to undergo gastrectomy if they are offered the lower risk laparoscopic approach.","Hackenson, David; Edelman, David A; McGuire, Tim; Weaver, Donald W; Webber, John D",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680810x12924466007449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21333186/,174

The patterns of glycosylation camouflage suggest that the answer is negative while also suggesting an alternative antigen that appears to be better optimized, eliciting an additional immune attack as the virus gets primed for cell penetration. This type of vaccine is expected to induce antibodies capable of defusing the virus during the priming phase while also circumventing antigenic drift.","Fernández, Ariel",ACS pharmacology & translational science,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.1c00054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860219/,174

Among the tested compounds present in common spices used in Kimchi, quercetin showed the highest selectivity index against influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1. In this study, the effect of pretreatment and periodic treatment with quercetin against IAV in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was observed. Compared to pretreatment, periodic treatment resulted in significantly higher cell viability but lower relative expression of the IAV PA gene and total apoptosis and cell death. To explain the mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of quercetin treatment, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed in four samples (mock, quercetin-treated, IAV-infected, and quercetin-treated IAV-infected). Among the 220 proteins, 56 proteins were classified nonhierarchically into three clusters and were differentially modulated by quercetin treatment in IAV-infected cells. Post-translational modifications were identified in 68 proteins. In conclusion, periodic treatment with quercetin is effective in reducing IAV infection, and differentially regulates the expression of key proteins, including heat shock proteins, fibronectin 1, and prohibitin to reduce IAV replication.","Vaidya, Bipin; Cho, Se-Young; Oh, Kyung-Seo; Kim, Song Hak; Kim, Yeong O; Jeong, Eun-Hye; Nguyen, Thoa Thi; Kim, Sung Hyun; Kim, In Seon; Kwon, Joseph; Kim, Duwoon",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27157719/,174

In attempting to develop a model that explained this behavior, we examined the behavior of the Graseby 3400 syringe pump under a range of flow conditions and with variations in syringe characteristics. Two issues were identified: start-up loss (the difference between actual and ideal delivery on initial infusion) and update loss (the difference between actual and ideal delivery when transmitting a command to change infusion rate). Under worst-case conditions, this may result in a 20-second period of zero delivery during start-up, and when updating infusion rates once per second, zero output. These effects are influenced by syringe characteristics and vary sufficiently as to make it impossible to isolate this effect from the pharmacokinetic process being controlled. The implications of this for previous published results and clinical application of target-controlled infusions are discussed.","Sarraf, Elie; Mandel, Jeff E",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/01.ane.0000438349.21617.2f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24356164/,174

We aimed to describe the characteristics and short-term outcomes of children diagnosed with MIS-C. Material and Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 24 patients who were diagnosed with MIS-C between June 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020. A total of 24 (14 male and 10 female) patients were included in the study. Results The median age at the diagnosis was 111 (10-180) months. A total of 17 patients had a history of contact with a patient with COVID-19. Among the 24 patients, the most common findings were gastrointestinal involvement (n=20), followed by conjunctivitis (n=12), erythematous rash (n=11), and oral changes (n=10). Cardiovascular involvement was detected in 12 patients, of whom six had systolic dysfunction, four had mild coronary artery involvement, four had pericardial effusion, and three had mitral insufficiency. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 14 patients were treated with methylprednisolone in addition. Anti-interleukin-1 was given to two patients. The median duration of hospitalization was 8 (5-15) days. A total of 23 patients were discharged and evaluated on the median of 68.5 (52-140) days after discharge. The remaining one patient with dilated cardiomyopathy died after 2 months in the intensive care unit. Conclusion Increasing the knowledge on MIS-C will provide clinicians with information on early recognition, evaluation, and management of these patients.","Başar, Eviç Zeynep; Sönmez, Hafize Emine; Öncel, Selim; Yetimakman, Ayşe Filiz; Babaoğlu, Kadir",Turkish archives of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkarchpediatr.2021.21018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104908/,174

This review article summarizes the current evidence by also emphasizing its heterogeneity. Importantly, current evidence suggests that these non-invasive strategies can be successfully used even in case of severe respiratory failure and are, thus, indeed capable of avoiding intubation, and consequently, tube-related complications. In contrast, it also remains to be emphasized that prolonged spontaneous breathing supported by non-invasive treatment strategies is also prone to complications. In particular, late NIV failure is associated with substantially deteriorated outcome, which is suggested to be meaningful in view of NIV failure rates still being high in Germany. Finally, the current article also refers to a parallel article that addresses the discussion being held in the public media in Germany concerning this topic. Here, its textual questionability, but also its negative consequences for both the research community and the general society are elaborated. In this context, the importance of national and regularly updated guidelines is emphasized.","Windisch, Wolfram; Schönhofer, Bernd; Majorski, Daniel Sebastian; Wollsching-Strobel, Maximilian; Criée, Carl-Peter; Schwarz, Sarah Bettina; Westhoff, Michael",Pneumologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1486-1015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975371/,174

This molecular machine couples the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to binding and release of substrate proteins. The switches that are involved in allosteric communication within this multidomain protein are mostly unknown. Previous insights were largely obtained by mutants, which displayed either wild-type activity or reduced folding assistance of substrate proteins. With a directed evolution approach for improved folding assistance we selected a DnaK variant characterized by a glycine to alanine substitution at position 384 (G384A); this resulted in a 2.5-fold higher chaperone activity in an in vitro DnaK-assisted firefly luciferase refolding assay. Quantitative biochemical characterization revealed several changes of key kinetic parameters compared to the wild type. Most pronounced is a 13-fold reduced rate constant for substrate release in the ATP-bound state, which we assume, in conjunction with the resulting increase in substrate affinity, to be related to improved chaperone activity. As the underlying mechanistic reason for this change we propose an altered interface of allosteric communication of mutant G384A, which is notably located at a hinge position between nucleotide and substrate binding domain.","Schweizer, Regina S; Aponte, Raphael A; Zimmermann, Sabine; Weber, Annika; Reinstein, Jochen",Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/cbic.201000786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656889/,174

A collection of 295 bacterial isolates was constituted from droppings of capybara, alpaca, muntjac, zebra, tapir, rhinoceros, binturong, armadillo, saki monkey and cockatoo. Of 295 isolates, 51 exhibited antagonism against a panel of pathogenic target bacteria like Escherichia coli MC4100, Clostridium perfringens DSM 756 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Newport ATCC6962. Remarkably, within this collection, only 2 Gram-negative bacilli exhibited activity against E. coli MC4100 strain used as target organism. Then, the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed these thereafter cited species, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella cibaria, E. coli, Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecalis. Characterization of this antagonism has revealed 11 strains able producing extracellular protease-sensitive inhibitory compounds. These strains included E. coli ICVB442 and ICVB443, Ent. faecalis ICVB472, ICVB474, ICVB477 ICVB479, ICVB481, ICVB497 and ICVB501 and Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491 and ICVB492.

Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood. METHODS Potential convalescent plasma donors with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. RESULTS Amongst 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers ≥1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing.

Through the lenses of privacy concerns and user expectations of digital pandemic-mitigation techniques, we identify possible long-term sociotechnical implications of such an infrastructure. OBJECTIVE We explore how people in the United States perceive the possible routinization of pandemic-tracking apps for public health surveillance in general. Our interdisciplinary analysis focuses on the interplay between privacy concerns, data practices of surveillance capitalism, and trust in healthcare providers. We conducted this analysis to achieve a richer understanding of the sociotechnical issues raised by the deployment and use of technology for pandemic mitigation. METHODS We conducted scenario-based, semi-structured interviews (n = 19) with adults in the United States. The interviews focused on how people perceive the short- and long-term privacy concerns associated with a fictional smart-thermometer app deployed to mitigate the ""outbreak of a contagious disease."" In order to elicit future-oriented discussions, the scenario indicated that the app would continue functioning ""after the disease outbreak has dissipated."" We analyzed interview transcripts using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS In the context of pandemic-mitigation technology, including app-based tracking, people perceive a core trade-off between public health and personal privacy. People tend to rationalize this trade-off by invoking the concept of, 'the greater good.' The interplay between the trade-off and rationalization forms the core of sociotechnical issues that pandemic-mitigation technologies raise. Participants routinely expected that data collected through apps related to public health would be shared with unknown third parties for the financial gain of the app makers. This expectation suggests a perceived alignment between an app-based infrastructure for public health surveillance and the broader economics of surveillance capitalism. Our results highlight unintended and unexpected sociotechnical impacts of routinizing app-based tracking on post-pandemic life, which are rationalized by focusing on a nebulous concept of the greater good. CONCLUSIONS While technologies such as app-based tracking could be useful for pandemic mitigation and preparedness, the routinization of such apps as a form of public health surveillance may have broader, unintentional sociotechnical implications for individuals and the societies in which they live. Although technology has the potential to increase the efficacy of pandemic mitigation, it exists within a broader network of sociotechnical concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the long-term implications of pandemic-mitigation technologies beyond the immediate needs of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential negative consequences include the erosion of patient trust in health care systems and providers, grounded in concerns about privacy violations and overly broad surveillance.

Absent or inadequate blinding in clinical trials has consistently been shown in large meta-analyses to result in overestimation of intervention effects. Blinding in dry needling trials, particularly blinding of participants and therapists, is a practical challenge; therefore, specific effects of dry needling have yet to be determined. Despite this, dry needling is widely used by health practitioners internationally for the treatment of pain. This review presents the first empirical account of the influence of blinding on intervention effect estimates in dry needling trials. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether participant beliefs about group allocation relative to actual allocation (blinding effectiveness), and/or adequacy of blinding procedures, moderated pain outcomes in dry needling trials. Methods Twelve databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, The Cochrane Library, Trove, ProQuest, trial registries) were searched from inception to February 2016. Trials that compared active dry needling with a sham that simulated dry needling were included. Two independent reviewers performed screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. Available blinding effectiveness data were converted to a blinding index, a quantitative measurement of blinding, and meta-regression was used to investigate the influence of the blinding index on pain. Adequacy of blinding procedures was based on critical appraisal, and subgroup meta-analyses were used to investigate the influence of blinding adequacy on pain. Meta-analytical techniques used inverse-variance random-effects models. Results The search identified 4,894 individual publications with 24 eligible for inclusion in the quantitative syntheses. In 19 trials risk of methodological bias was high or unclear. Five trials were adequately blinded, and blinding was assessed and sufficiently reported to compute the blinding index in 10 trials. There was no evidence of a moderating effect of blinding index on pain. For short-term and long-term pain assessments pooled effects for inadequately blinded trials were statistically significant in favour of active dry needling, whereas there was no evidence of a difference between active and sham groups for adequately blinded trials. Discussion The small number and size of included trials meant there was insufficient evidence to conclusively determine if a moderating effect of blinding effectiveness or adequacy existed. However, with the caveats of small sample size, generally unclear risk of bias, statistical heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and the limitations of subgroup analyses, the available evidence suggests that inadequate blinding procedures could lead to exaggerated intervention effects in dry needling trials.","Braithwaite, Felicity A; Walters, Julie L; Li, Lok Sze Katrina; Moseley, G Lorimer; Williams, Marie T; McEvoy, Maureen P",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30083458/,174
146810,Molecular Mechanisms of Vascular Damage During Lung Injury.,2021,"Diagnostic Microbiology is the tool that makes it possible to identify the exact etiology of infectious diseases and the most optimal therapy at the level of individual patients as well as communities. Conventional methods require time to grow the microbes in vitro under specific conditions and not all microbes are easily cultivable. This is followed by biochemical methods for identification which also require hours and sometimes days. Transport of the specimens under less than ideal conditions, prior use of antibiotics and small number of organisms are among the factors that render culture-based methods less reliable. Newer methods depend on amplification of nucleic acids followed by use of probes for identification. This mitigates the need for higher microbial load, presence of metabolically active viable organisms and shortens the time to reporting. These methods can be used to detect antibiotic resistance genes directly from the specimen and help direct targeted therapy. Since these methods will not fulfill all the diagnostic needs, a second approach is being used to shorten the time to identification after the organism has already grown. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics are the tools making this possible. This review gives a historical perspective on diagnostic microbiology, discusses the pitfalls of current methodology and provides an overview of newer and future methods.","Khardori, N",Indian journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/0255-0857.142233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25297019/,174

METHODS A pneumatic lung simulator was connected to 5 different circuits for aerosol delivery, 2 delivering CPAP through a high-flow generator tested at 30, 60, and 90 L/min supplementary flow and 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O CPAP and 3 with no CPAP: a T-piece configuration with one extremity closed with a cap, a T-piece configuration without cap and nebulizer positioned proximally, and a T-piece configuration without cap and nebulizer positioned distally. Albuterol was collected with a filter, and the percentage amount delivered was measured by infrared spectrophotometry. RESULTS Configurations with continuous high-flow CPAP delivered higher percentage amounts of albuterol compared with the configurations without CPAP (9.1 ± 6.0% vs 6.2 ± 2.8%, P = .03). Among configurations without CPAP, the best performance was obtained with a T-piece with one extremity closed with a cap. In CPAP configurations, the highest delivery (13.8 ± 4.4%) was obtained with the nebulizer placed proximal to the lung simulator, independent of flow. CPAP at 15 cm H2O resulted in the highest albuterol delivery (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Based on our in vitro study, without CPAP, a T-piece with a cap at one extremity maximizes albuterol delivery. During high-flow CPAP, the nebulizer should always be placed proximal to the patient, after the T-piece, using the highest CPAP clinically indicated.","Ball, Lorenzo; Sutherasan, Yuda; Caratto, Valentina; Sanguineti, Elisa; Marsili, Maria; Raimondo, Pasquale; Ferretti, Maurizio; Kacmarek, Robert M; Pelosi, Paolo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577198/,174

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Cinesi Gómez, César; Peñuelas Rodríguez, Óscar; Luján Torné, Manel; Egea Santaolalla, Carlos; Masa Jiménez, Juan Fernando; García Fernández, Javier; Carratalá Perales, José Manuel; Heili-Frades, Sarah Béatrice; Ferrer Monreal, Miquel; de Andrés Nilsson, José M; Lista Arias, Eva; Sánchez Rocamora, Juan Luis; Garrote, José Ignacio; Zamorano Serrano, Miguel J; González Martínez, Mónica; Farrero Muñoz, Eva; Mediano San Andrés, Olga; Rialp Cervera, Gemma; Mas Serra, Arantxa; Hernández Martínez, Gonzalo; de Haro López, Candelaria; Roca Gas, Oriol; Ferrer Roca, Ricard; Romero Berrocal, Antonio; Ferrando Ortola, Carlos",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629620/,174

This study aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative PPI use to reduce post-ESD bleeding. METHODS PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi database were searched to identify randomized trials eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Data from four studies (406 patients) were combined to calculate a pooled risk difference (RD) for developing post-ESD bleeding. RESULTS Compared with patients who received no premedication, the pooled RD for post-ESD bleeding in patients who received preoperavive PPI was -0.027 (95% confidence interval: -0.070-0.017, p = 0.228), without significant heterogeneity. Preoperavive PPI use significantly increased gastric pH (weighted mean difference: 1.289, 95% CI: 0.227-2.352, p = 0.0174). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that premedication with PPI had no advantage for the prevention of post-ESD bleeding, despite increasing gastric pH.","Nishizawa, Toshihiro; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Akimoto, Teppei; Maehata, Tadateru; Morizane, Toshio; Kanai, Takanori; Yahagi, Naohisa",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640615588023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26966517/,174

In order to know RSV's genetic changes we examined 4028 respiratory specimens from local hospital outpatients in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea over six consecutive years by real-time one-step RT-PCR; 183 patients were positive for RSV infection. To investigate the specific distribution of RSV genotypes, we performed partial sequencing of the glycoprotein gene. Of the 131 RSV-A specimens sequenced, 61 (43·3%) belonged to the ON1 genotype, 66 (46·8%) were NA1 genotype, 3 (2·1%) were GA5 genotype, and 1 (0·7%) belonged to the GA1 genotype. Of the 31 RSV-B specimens sequenced, 29 were BA9 genotype (87·9%) and 2 were BA10 genotype (6·1%). The most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, nasal discharge, and phlegm; multiple logistic regression analysis showed that RSV-positive infection on pediatric patients was strongly associated with cough (OR = 2·8, 95% CI 1·6-5·1) and wheezing (OR = 2·8, 95% CI 1·7-4·4). The ON1 genotype was significantly associated with phlegm (OR = 11·8, 95% CI 3·8-46·7), while the NA1 genotype was associated with the pediatric patients' gender (males, OR = 2·4, 95% CI 1·1-5·4) and presence of chills (OR = 5·1, 95% CI 1·1-27·2). RSV subgroup B was showed association with nasal obstruction (OR = 4·6, 95% CI 1·2-20·0). The majority of respiratory virus coinfections with RSV were human rhinovirus (47·2%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, DARE, and PROSPERO databases was made on 5 November 2019 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) using intention-to-treat analysis to compare a paclitaxel-coated device to an uncoated device in PAD patients having clinical follow-up of at least 6 months. Half of the study population had to have CLTI or extractable data on the CLTI subgroup if <50%. The search identified 11 trials having 1450 patients randomized to a paclitaxel-coated device (n=866) or an uncoated control (n=584). There were 1367 (94.3%) patients with CLTI (range 10-429). The single endpoint was all-cause mortality, which was analyzed by pooling the mortality data in a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Summary statistics are expressed as relative risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The mean follow-up was 25.6 months (range 6-60); 10 of 11 studies reported a minimum 12-month follow-up. There were 161 (18.6%) deaths among 866 subjects in the paclitaxel device group and 116 deaths among 584 (19.9%) subjects in the non-coated control group (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12, p=0.45). CONCLUSION There was no observed difference in short- to midterm mortality among a pooled patient population of predominately CLTI patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons or stents compared with uncoated controls.","Dinh, Krystal; Gomes, Miguel Lemos; Thomas, Shannon D; Paravastu, Sharath C V; Holden, Andrew; Schneider, Peter A; Varcoe, Ramon L",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602820904783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066315/,174

METHODS The Vascular Surgery Group of Regione Lombardia Register, a real-word, multicenter, retrospective register was interrogated. All patients admitted with vascular disease were included. Patients' data on demographics, COVID-19 positivity, comorbidities and outcomes were extrapolated. Two cohorts were obtained: patients admitted to HH or SH. Primary endpoint was 30- day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were 30-day complications and amputation (in case of peripheral artery disease [PAD]) rates. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to compare HH and SH groups and predictors of poor outcomes. RESULTS During the study period, 659 vascular patients in 4 HH and 27 SH were analyzed. Among these, 321 (48.7%) were admitted to a HH. No difference in COVID-19 positive patients was described (21.7% in HH vs 15.9% in SH; p=.058). After 30 days from intervention, HH and SH experienced similar mortality and no-intervention-related complication rate (12.1% vs 10.0%; p=.427 and 10.3% vs 8.3%; p=.377, respectively). Conversely, in HH postoperative complications were higher (23.4% vs 16.9%, p=.038) and amputations in patients treated for PAD were lower (10.8% vs 26.8%; p<.001) than in SH. Multivariate analysis demonstrated in both cohorts COVID-19-related pneumonia as independent predictor of death and postoperative complications, while age for death.

153597,Establishing the allosteric mechanism in CRISPR-Cas9.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Prior studies show that staffing a physician at triage expedites care in the emergency department. Our objective was to describe the novel application and effect of a telemedicine medical screening evaluation (Tele-MSE) at triage on quality metrics in the pediatric emergency department (PED). METHODS We conducted a retrospective quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study of patients presenting to an urban PED from December 2017 to November 2019 who received a Tele-MSE at triage. We analyzed 4 diagnostic cohorts: gastroenteritis, psychiatry evaluation, burn injury, and extremity fracture. We matched cases with controls who received standard triage, from December 2015 to November 2017, by age, diagnosis, weekday versus weekend, and season of presentation. Outcome measures included door-to-provider time, time-to-intervention order, and PED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS We included 557 patients who received Tele-MSE during the study period. Compared with controls, patients who received a Tele-MSE at triage had a shorter median door-to-provider time (median difference [MD], 8.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-11.0), time-to-medication order (MD, 27.3 minutes; 95% CI, 22.9-35.2), time-to-consult order (MD, 10.0 minutes; 95% CI, 5.3-12.7), and PED LOS (MD, 0.4 hours; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6). CONCLUSIONS A Tele-MSE is an innovative modality to expedite the initiation of emergency care and reduce PED LOS for children.

154067,Purkinje fiber dysplasia (histiocytoid cardiomyopathy) with ventricular noncompaction in a savannah kitten.,2009,"Cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is a non-invasive monitor used to monitor cerebral oxygen balance and perfusion. Decreases in rSO2 >20 % from baseline have been associated with cerebral ischemia and increased perioperative morbidity. During transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), hemodynamic manipulation with ventricular pacing up to 180 beats per minute is necessary for valve deployment. The magnitude and duration of rSO2 change during this manipulation is unclear. In this small case series, changes in rSO2 in patients undergoing TAVR are investigated. Ten ASA IV patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia at a university hospital were prospectively observed. Cerebral oximetry values were analyzed at four points: pre-procedure (baseline), after tracheal intubation, during valve deployment, and at procedure end. Baseline rSO2 values were 54.5 ± 6.9 %. After induction of general anesthesia, rSO2 increased to a mean of 66.0 ± 6.7 %. During valve deployment, the mean rSO2 decreased <20 % below baseline to 48.5 ± 13.4 %. In two patients, rSO2 decreased >20 % of baseline. Cerebral oxygenation returned to post-induction values in all patients 13 ± 10 min after valve deployment. At procedure end, the mean rSO2 was 67.6 ± 8.1 %. As expected, rapid ventricular pacing resulting in the desired decrease in cardiac output during valve deployment was associated with a significant decrease in rSO2 compared to post-induction values. However, despite increased post-induction values in all patients, whether related to increased inspired oxygen fraction or reduced cerebral oxygen consumption under anesthesia, two patients experienced a significant decrease in rSO2 compared to baseline. Recovery to baseline was not immediate, and took up to 20 min in three patients. Furthermore, baseline rSO2 in this population was at the lower limit of the published normal range. Significant cerebral desaturation during valve deployment may potentially be limited by maximizing rSO2 after anesthetic induction. Future studies should attempt to correlate recovery in rSO2 with recovery of hemodynamics and cardiac function, provide detailed neurological assessments pre and post procedure, determine the most effective method of maximizing rSO2 prior to hemodynamic manipulation, and provide the most rapid method of recovery of rSO2 following valve deployment.","Brodt, Jessica; Vladinov, Greta; Castillo-Pedraza, Catalina; Cooper, Lebron; Maratea, Edward",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9758-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26969373/,174

The results of network analysis showed that 8 genera were identified to be the main potential hosts of ARGs, including Mycobacterium, Ferruginibacter, Thermomonas, Morganella, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Myroides and Romboutsia. The removal of ARGs and their possible bacterialhosts were synchronous and consistent by chlorine or ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in WWTPs. The mechanisms of ARB and ARGs removal, and conjugation transfer of RP4 plasmids by UV, chlorine and synergistic UV/chlorine disinfection was revealed. Compared to UV alone, ARB inactivation was improved 1.4 log and photoreactivation was overcomeeffectively by UV/chlorine combination (8 mJ/cm2, chlorine 2 mg/L). However, ARGs degradation was more difficult than ARB inactivation. Until UV dosage enhanced to 320 mJ/cm2, ARGs achieved 0.58-1.60 log removal. Meanwhile, when 2 mg/L of chlorine was combined with UV combination, ARGs removal enhanced 1-1.5 log. The synergistic effect of adding low-dose chlorine (1-2 mg/L) during UV radiation effectively improved ARB and ARGs removal simultaneously. The same synergistic effect also occurred in the horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Non-lethal dose chlorine (0.5 mg/L) increased the conjugation transfer frequency,which confirmed that the mRNA expression levels of type IV secretion system (T4SS) proteins vir4D, vir5B and vir10B were significantly enhanced. The risk of RP4 plasmid conjugation transfer was significantly reduced with UV/chlorine (UV ≥ 4 mJ/cm2, chlorine ≥ 1 mg/L). These findings may serve as valuable implications for assessing and controlling the risk of ARGs transfer and propagation in the environment.","Wang, Haichao; Wang, Jin; Li, Shuming; Ding, Guoyu; Wang, Kun; Zhuang, Tao; Huang, Xue; Wang, Xiaoyue",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818733/,174
156310,A General Strategy to Control Viscosity Sensitivity of Molecular Rotor-Based Fluorophores.,2020-09-29,"PURPOSE To retrospectively evaluate long-term survival outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of colorectal lung metastases and evaluate factors associated with improved survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients (46 male and 38 female; median age, 65 y) with 172 colorectal lung metastases (median size, 1.2 cm) underwent 113 RF ablation sessions. Thirteen patients had viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation. The primary endpoint was patient survival. Prognostic factors associated with survival were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Secondary endpoints were local tumor progression and adverse events (per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0). RESULTS During follow-up (median duration, 37.5 mo), 36 patients (42.9%) died. The estimated overall survival (OS) rates were 95.2%, 65.0%, and 51.6% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively (median OS time, 67.0 mo). Multivariate analysis revealed that a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of at least 5 ng/mL before RF ablation (P = .03) and the presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation (P = .001) were independent negative prognostic factors. The local tumor progression rate was 14.0% (24 of 172 tumors). Grade 3 adverse events were observed after two sessions (1.8%), and grade 4/5 adverse events were not observed. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation of colorectal lung metastases provided favorable long-term survival with a low incidence of severe adverse events. Independent prognostic factors were a high CEA level before RF ablation and the presence of viable extrapulmonary recurrences at the time of RF ablation.","Matsui, Yusuke; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Nagasaka, Takeshi; Toyooka, Shinichi; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612808/,174

On impact, the seat propels the driver's torso forward relative to the head, resulting in forced flexion of the occipitoatlantal (OA) joint, accompanied by forced stretching of the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) muscles. Flexion of the OA joint and stretching of the RCPm muscles continues to increase until the vehicle's headrest strikes the back of the driver's head. It is known that externally applied forces that attempt to move the OA joint beyond its anatomic barrier can result in fracture, dislocation, or soft tissue damage to its structural components. However, the magnitude of headrest backset, defined as the distance between the driver's head and the vehicle's headrest, that would result in RCPm muscles being stretched to a length that would put them at risk for a muscle strain injury is unknown. OBJECTIVES To quantify the relationships among flexion of the OA joint, RCPm muscle stretch, and backset, and to quantify the biomechanical response of RCPm muscles to increasing levels of axial load due to stretching. METHODS Unembalmed head and neck specimens from three White females aged 85, 63, and 70 years were obtained from the Anatomical Services Division at the University of Maryland. Donors had provided written consent allowing use of their body for research purposes. Using an analytic model of the OA joint, the relationships between flexion of the OA joint and RCPm muscle stretch as a function of backset were estimated. RCPm muscles were removed from the cadavers and forcibly stretched using a servomechanism controlled hydraulic testing machine to quantify the load/displacement properties. After testing, the tissues were sectioned, mounted, and stained using Masson's trichrome to selectively stain muscle fibers red and collagen blue. RESULTS Forced flexion of the OA joint was seen to be directly related to the magnitude of headrest backset. For values of backset greater than 7.2 cm, biomechanical testing of the RCPm muscles revealed that strain injuries ranged from the tearing of a few muscle fibers to complete rupture of the muscle and separation of the tendon at the posterior process of C1. CONCLUSIONS Results showed that headrest backset at the time of vehicle impact is an important factor in estimating the risk of muscle strain injury to RCPm muscles. Muscle strain injury would be expected to impact the functional relationship between the RCPm muscles and the pain sensitive spinal dura. Physicians should be alert to the possibility that cervicogenic pain patients who have experienced whiplash associated with REMVA may show clinically relevant structural damage to the RCPm muscles on MRI.","Hallgren, Richard C; Rowan, Jacob J",Journal of osteopathic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2021-0094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087970/,174

This study was planned to assess the status of the practice of sleep medicine in India during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. METHODS This was an online questionnaire-based descriptive study. A 25-item questionnaire was developed to assess the functioning of sleep laboratories, use of telemedicine, and positive airway pressure therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The questionnaire was sent to the sleep physicians of two major sleep medicine societies of India. Responses were analyzed. RESULTS In this study, the response rate was 64.6%. During this pandemic, 72% of physicians reported that they had closed sleep laboratory while 24% reported shifting to home sleep apnea testing. Only half of the sleep physicians confirmed awareness of the disinfection guidelines proposed by AASM to prevent COVID-19 infection in the sleep laboratory. However, almost all of them reported taking preventive measures like the use of protective gear. 61% of physicians advised mitigating strategies as a temporary measure to their patients of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 58.6% opined that auto-PAP might be used for uncomplicated OSA without diagnostic polysomnography during the pandemic. 84% of physicians reported that they were continuing their services through telemedicine facility. Physicians reported that consultations for insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Sleep laboratories were reportedly closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of the sleep physicians were providing services through telemedicine. The majority reported that auto-PAP without diagnostic polysomnography could be an effective option for uncomplicated OSA. Consultation for insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders reportedly increased during the lockdown.","Kanchan, Shweta; Saini, Lokesh Kumar; Daga, Ritu; Arora, Pankaj; Gupta, Ravi",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.9172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612159/,174

For the detection of retinopathy lesions from retinal images, several automatic approaches based on deep neural networks have been developed in the recent years. Most of the proposed methods produce point estimates of pixels belonging to the lesion areas and give no or little information on the uncertainty of method predictions. However, the latter can be essential in the examination of the medical condition of the patient when the goal is early detection of abnormalities. This work extends the recent research with a Bayesian framework by considering the parameters of a convolutional neural network as random variables and utilizing stochastic variational dropout based approximation for uncertainty quantification. The framework includes an extended validation procedure and it allows analyzing lesion segmentation distributions, model calibration and prediction uncertainties. Also the challenges related to the deep probabilistic model and uncertainty quantification are presented. The proposed method achieves area under precision-recall curve of 0.84 for hard exudates, 0.641 for soft exudates, 0.593 for haemorrhages, and 0.484 for microaneurysms on IDRiD dataset.","Garifullin, Azat; Lensu, Lasse; Uusitalo, Hannu",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399196/,174

METHODS Adolescents with RR-TB from two hospitals were included in this retrospective study. All patients received the longer regimen containing bedaquiline. Sputum culture, chest computed tomography, blood tests and electrocardiography were performed regularly, and the outcomes after 24 weeks of treatment were reported. RESULTS Four male and six female adolescents aged 11 to 17 years old were included. Among them, four (40.0%), four (40.0%) and two (20.0%) were confirmed to have RR-TB, multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB, respectively. The most common companion drugs included linezolid (100.0%), cycloserine (90.0%), pyrazinamide (80.0%), moxifloxacin (50.0%) and levofloxacin (40.0%). Culture conversion rates of 80.0%, 100.0% and 100.0% were observed at weeks 2, 4 and 24, respectively. The mean maximum drug concentration of bedaquiline at weeks 2, 12 and 24 was 3.29 ± 0.66, 1.78 ± 0.81 and 1.93 ± 0.74 μg/mL, respectively. Six adverse events including leukopenia (50.0%), Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval prolongation (16.7%), anaemia (16.7%) and peripheral neuropathy (16.7%) were observed in five (50.0%) patients. No patient discontinued bedaquiline owing to QTcF interval prolongation. Meanwhile, no deaths, reversions or serious adverse events were reported during 24 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION A longer regimen containing bedaquiline was effective and well tolerated in Chinese adolescents with RR-TB. The combination of bedaquiline and linezolid may be a favourable choice for this population.","Wu, Hao-Yu; Tian, Yao; Wang, Xiao-Dan; Sun, Ji-Si; Fan, Li-Chao; Chen, Mo-Xin; Li, Ran; Chen, Yu",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323328/,174

159913,First principles investigations on the controversy of structural phase transitions in thorium dialuminide under pressure.,2021-06-21,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm. This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate cancer on MRI.

Large-scale seroprevalence studies provide better estimates of the proportion of the population previously infected. Objective To estimate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in convenience samples from several geographic sites in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages. The serum was collected from March 23 through May 12, 2020, for routine clinical testing by 2 commercial laboratory companies. Sites of collection were San Francisco Bay area, California; Connecticut; south Florida; Louisiana; Minneapolis-St Paul-St Cloud metro area, Minnesota; Missouri; New York City metro area, New York; Philadelphia metro area, Pennsylvania; Utah; and western Washington State. Exposures Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and estimates were standardized to the site populations by age and sex. Estimates were adjusted for test performance characteristics (96.0% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity). The number of infections in each site was estimated by extrapolating seroprevalence to site populations; estimated infections were compared with the number of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases as of last specimen collection date. Results Serum samples were tested from 16 025 persons, 8853 (55.2%) of whom were women; 1205 (7.5%) were 18 years or younger and 5845 (36.2%) were 65 years or older. Most specimens from each site had no evidence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Adjusted estimates of the proportion of persons seroreactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies ranged from 1.0% in the San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) to 6.9% of persons in New York City (collected March 23-April 1). The estimated number of infections ranged from 6 to 24 times the number of reported cases; for 7 sites (Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New York City metro area, Utah, and western Washington State), an estimated greater than 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred than the number of reported cases. Conclusions and Relevance During March to early May 2020, most persons in 10 diverse geographic sites in the US had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The estimated number of infections, however, was much greater than the number of reported cases in all sites. The findings may reflect the number of persons who had mild or no illness or who did not seek medical care or undergo testing but who still may have contributed to ongoing virus transmission in the population.","Havers, Fiona P; Reed, Carrie; Lim, Travis; Montgomery, Joel M; Klena, John D; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia M; Cannon, Deborah L; Chiang, Cheng-Feng; Gibbons, Aridth; Krapiunaya, Inna; Morales-Betoulle, Maria; Roguski, Katherine; Rasheed, Mohammad Ata Ur; Freeman, Brandi; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Carroll, Darin S; Owen, S Michele; Johnson, Jeffrey A; Semenova, Vera; Blackmore, Carina; Blog, Debra; Chai, Shua J; Dunn, Angela; Hand, Julie; Jain, Seema; Lindquist, Scott; Lynfield, Ruth; Pritchard, Scott; Sokol, Theresa; Sosa, Lynn; Turabelidze, George; Watkins, Sharon M; Wiesman, John; Williams, Randall W; Yendell, Stephanie; Schiffer, Jarad; Thornburg, Natalie J",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.4130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32692365/,174

Isolated metastasis is even rarer and may be difficult to differentiate from primary pancreatic neoplasm. The leading sources of metastases are breast, lung, kidney, and skin (melanoma). We present our experience with 12 cases of isolated pancreatic metastasis. METHODS We made a retrospective review from a series of pancreatic resections for metastatic disease, which occurred during the last decade. RESULTS The sites of origin were as follows: kidney (8 cases), lung (2 cases), bone (1 case), and breast (1 case). Only 4 patients were symptomatic (abdominal pain, 3 cases; melena, 1 case). The metastasis was metachronous in 11 cases, with mean disease-free interval of 9 years. The preoperative diagnosis was endocrine tumor in 4 cases. All patients underwent complete extirpation. At the time of follow-up, 3 patients had died of malignancy and 9 were still alive and free of disease, with a mean follow-up of 3 years. CONCLUSIONS Isolated metastatic tumors to the pancreas may be detected decades after the initial diagnosis and can be asymptomatic, emphasizing the need for lifelong surveillance in this population. Surgical extirpation of these lesions may offer the chance of long-term survival.","Mourra, Najat; Arrive, Lionel; Balladur, Pierre; Flejou, Jean-François; Tiret, Emmanuel; Paye, François",Pancreas,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0b013e3181c75f74; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20173671/,174

In particular, antibody testing is crucial in identifying COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use as passive immune therapy for hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. Currently, high-titer CCP can be qualified by Ortho's Vitros COVID-19 IgG antibody test (VG). OBJECTIVE.– To explore the use of an efficient testing method to identify high-titer CCP for use in treating COVID-19 infected patients and track COVID-19 positivity over time. DESIGN.– We evaluated an ELISA-based method that detects antibodies specific to the SARSCoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with individual and pooled plasma samples and compared its performance against VG. Using the pooled RBD-ELISA (P-RE) method, we also screened over 10,000 longitudinal healthy blood donor samples to assess seroprevalence. RESULTS.– P-RE demonstrates 100% sensitivity in detecting FDA-defined high-titer samples when compared to VG. Overall sensitivity of P-RE when compared to VG and our individual sample RBD-ELISA (I-RE) were 83% and 56%, respectively. When screening 10,218 healthy blood donor samples by P-RE, we found the seroprevalence correlated with the local infection rates with a correlation coefficient of 0.21 (P< .001). CONCLUSIONS.– Pooling plasma samples can be used to efficiently screen large populations for individuals with high-titer anti-RBD antibodies, important for CCP identification.","Nguyen, Khoa D; Wirz, Oliver F; Röltgen, Katharina; Pandey, Suchitra; Tolentino, Lorna; Boyd, Scott D; Pham, Tho D",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2021-0215-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101801/,174

The suitability of the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients for low-dose aspirin deprescribing is unknown. To apply the 3 low-dose aspirin guidelines to EHR data, the guidelines were deconstructed into components from their narrative text and assigned computer-interpretable definitions based on electronic data interchange standards. These definitions were used to search EHR data to identify patients for aspirin deprescribing. To verify EHR records for low-dose aspirin, we then compared the records with a survey of patients' self-reported use of low-dose aspirin. Of the 3 aspirin guidelines, only 1 had a definition suitable for EHR implementation. The other 2 contained difficult-to-implement phrases (e.g. ""higher ASCVD risk"", ""increased bleeding risk""). An EHR search with the single implementable guideline identified 86,555 people for possible aspirin deprescribing (2% of 5,598,604). Only 676 out of 1,135 (60%) patients who self-reported taking low-dose aspirin had an active EHR record for low-dose aspirin at that time. Limitations exist when using EHR data to identify patients for possible low-dose aspirin deprescribing such as incomplete EHR capture of and the interpretation of non-specific terminology when translating guidelines into an electronic equivalent.

163921,Programmable RNA base editing with a single gRNA-free enzyme,2021-08-31,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have become an increasingly popular approach for demonstrating polygenic influences on complex traits and for establishing common polygenic signals between different traits. PRSs are typically constructed using pruning and thresholding (P+T), but the best choice of parameters is uncertain; thus multiple settings are used and the best is chosen. This optimization can lead to inflated type I error. To correct this, permutation procedures can be used but they can be computationally intensive. Alternatively, a single parameter setting can be chosen a priori for the PRS, but choosing suboptimal settings result in loss of power. We propose computing PRSs under a range of parameter settings, performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the resulting set of PRSs, and using the first PRS-PC in association tests. The first PC reweights the variants included in the PRS with new weights to achieve maximum variation over all PRS settings used. Using simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed PRS-PCA approach with a permutation test and a priori selection of p-value threshold. We then apply the approach to the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank study to test for PRS association with psychosis using a variety of PRSs constructed from summary statistics from the largest studies of psychiatric disorders and related traits. The PRS-PCA approach is simple to implement, outperforms the other strategies in most scenarios, and provides an unbiased estimate of prediction performance. We therefore recommend it to be used PRS association studies where multiple phenotypes and/or PRSs are being investigated.","Coombes, Brandon J.; Biernacka, Joanna M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/847020,174

From this perspective, the present paper deals with the different strategies that have been implemented in institutions of several countries located in different geographical areas, including Portugal, Spain, Japan and Australia. It is shown that the use of methodologies, such as flip teaching, has provided a wide variety of possibilities to adapt to the new educational context. Moreover, for Industrial Electronics degrees, the use of virtual or remote laboratories, portable learning tools and advanced information and communication technologies have also risen as valuable resources.

To assess robustness of mRNA vaccine-induced immunity, we compared antibody durability and breadth after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. While vaccination delivered robust initial virus-specific antibodies with some cross-variant coverage, pre-variant SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced antibodies, while modest in magnitude, showed highly stable long-term antibody dynamics. Vaccination after infection induced maximal antibody magnitudes with enhanced longitudinal stability while infection-naïve vaccinee antibodies fell with time to post-infection-alone levels. The composition of antibody neutralizing activity to variant relative to original virus also differed between groups, with infection-induced antibodies demonstrating greater relative breadth. Differential antibody durability trajectories favored COVID-19-recovered subjects with dual memory B cell features of greater early antibody somatic mutation and cross-coronavirus reactivity. By illuminating an infection-mediated antibody breadth advantage and an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability-enhancing function conferred by recalled immunity, these findings may serve as guides for ongoing vaccine strategy improvement.","Chen, Yuezhou; Tong, Pei; Whiteman, Noah B.; Moghaddam, Ali Sanjari; Zuiani, Adam; Habibi, Shaghayegh; Gautam, Avneesh; Xiao, Tianshu; Cai, Yongfei; Chen, Bing; Wesemann, Duane R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.09.459504,174

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention recommends that immunocompromised individuals with no contraindications to vaccines may receive an mCV. The CDC suggests that patients receiving cancer therapies should be consulted about the unknown vaccine safety profile and effectiveness. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recognizes that vaccine may reduce the risk of infection for individuals with cancer. Vaccine trials have not actively enrolled immunocompromised or patients on active cancer therapy;therefore, the potential side effects and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines in these individuals are unexplored. Per state guidelines, many patients with cancer undergoing treatment qualify for vaccination however current vaccine uptake in that population is unknown. Data in this specific high-risk population is needed to increase confidence in the vaccine. We explored adverse events (AE) to the mCV in a small cohort of patients undergoing cancer therapy. Methods: Our case series evaluated patients' tolerance to the voluntary but recommended 2 doses of the mCV while on chemotherapy (CX), checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) at the George Washington University (GWU) Cancer Center in Washington DC. Patient chart review and phone interviews were conducted. Patients had independently signed up for the mCV at the GWU Hospital or through the DC Health Department. Patients were asked if they had experienced any of the commonly reported side effects listed by the CDC or others new symptoms receiving the vaccine. Results: 12 patients had voluntarily received the mCV, all patients were above the age of 65 with a mean age of 72 (66-85). ECOG performance status was 2 or above in 4 patients. 6 patients were receiving single agent CPI, 1 patient was on combination CX and CPI. 2 patients were on oral TKI for EGFR mutated lung cancer. 3 other patients were on combination CX with rituximab, ramucirumab or radiation. In the 2 patients on daily TKI, treatment was not interrupted for the mCV. In the 10 other patients, all but one patient received the mCV at least one week after the last therapy. Both mCV were tolerated without any life-threatening AE or hospitalization. Pain and swelling at the vaccine site were the most common local AE and reported in 7 patients. 6 patients reported systemic AE most commonly myalgia and headaches. Conclusions: This exploratory analysis in 12 patients with cancer undergoing treatment did not uncover any additional SE signals. Larger studies are needed to evaluate AE and efficacy and to guide recommendations for COVID19 vaccination in this patient population.","Haroun, F.; Alharbi, M.; Hong, A.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.e14562,174

We show that a 12-band filter system (5 Sloan-like and 7 narrow bands) allows better performance for object classification than the usual analysis based solely on broad bands (regardless of infrared information). Moreover, we show that our classification is robust against missing values. Using spectroscopically confirmed sources retrieved from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR16 and DR14Q, we train a random forest classifier with the 12 S-PLUS magnitudes + 4 morphological features. A second random forest classifier is trained with the addition of the W1 (3.4 $\mu$m) and W2 (4.6 $\mu$m) magnitudes from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Forty-four percent of our catalogue have WISE counterparts and are provided with classification from both models. We achieve 95.76% (52.47%) of quasar purity, 95.88% (92.24%) of quasar completeness, 99.44% (98.17%) of star purity, 98.22% (78.56%) of star completeness, 98.04% (81.39%) of galaxy purity, and 98.8% (85.37%) of galaxy completeness for the first (second) classifier, for which the metrics were calculated on objects with (without) WISE counterpart. A total of 2,926,787 objects that are not in our spectroscopic sample were labelled, obtaining 335,956 quasars, 1,347,340 stars, and 1,243,391 galaxies.

This is especially so in children from developing countries who are exposed to other infections simultaneously. In this article we investigated the impact of indolent Schistosoma haematobium infection on background of a respiratory infection Method: A cross sectional study with 237 preschool age children with a respiratory infection, was performed during winter months in a schistosomiasis endemic area. Participants were clinically examined and investigated appropriately. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and pneumonia were defined and classified as per IMCI and WHO guidelines, respectively. S. haematobium infection diagnosis was by urine filtration on urine collected over three consecutive days. Data was analysed using SPSS. Results: S haematobium infection prevalence was 29% (69). Prevalence of repiratory infections were as follows: common cold 79% (188), pneumonia 15% (36) and severe pneumonia 6% (15). Eighty-one percent of participants with the common cold were S. haematobium negative, whilst 80 % of those with severe pneumonia were infected. Schistosomiasis infected children were at greater odds of developing; pneumonia (aOR=3.61 (95% CI 1.73-7.55) and severe pneumonia (aOR=21.13 (95% CI 4.65-95.89). High intensity S. haematobium infection was associated with an increased risk of severe pneumonia RR= 23.78(95% CI 6.86-82.32). Mortality from coinfection emanated from severe pneumonia and severe S. haematobium infection intensity (RR= 26.56 (95% CI 1.49 to 473.89). Number needed to harm (NNH) for S. haematobium infected children who develop respiratory tract infection was 4:1 for pneumonia and 5:1 for severe pneumonia. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that coinfection with Schistosomiasis increases morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract infections by up to 20 times in children less than five years old. There is need to cover schistosomiasis screening and treatment in children under 5 years old to avert mortality and morbidity due to coinfection with respiratory infections.","Mduluza-Jokonya, T. l.; Jokonya, L.; Naicker, T.; Mduluza, T.; Midzi, H.; Vengesai, A.; Sibanda, E.; Thakataka, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.06.20227173v1?rss=1,174

However, the effect of cell differentiation on T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is not investigated. Here, we examined the features of TCR beta (TCRB) repertoire of the top clones within naïve, memory and regular T cell (Treg) subsets: repertoire structure, gene usage, length distribution and sequence composition. First, we found that memory subsets and Treg would be discriminated from naïve by the features of TCRB repertoire. Second, we found that the correlations between the features of memory subsets and naïve were positively related to differentiation levels of memory subsets. Third, we found that public clones presented a reduced proportion and a skewed sequence composition in differentiated subsets. Furthermore, we found that public clones led naïve to recognize a broader spectrum of antigens than other subsets. Our findings suggest that TCRB repertoire of CD4+ T cell subsets is skewed in a differentiation-depended manner. Our findings show that the variations of public clones contribute to these changes. Our findings indicate that the reduce of public clones in differentiation trim the antigen specificity of CD4+ T cells. The study unveils the physiological effect of memory formation and facilitates the selection of proper CD4+ subset for cellular therapy.","Wang, Shiyu; Wang, Longlong; Liu, Ya",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.01.364224,174

For many human pathogens the burden of disease depends on age and prior exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured (RAS) mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing and immunity to establish the suite of possible scenarios of future age-incidence and burden of mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age-structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism, whether assuming long-lasting or brief protective immunity, and across a range of assumptions of relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured social mixing patterns to bound expectations for changing age-incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailoring mitigation strategies countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.","Li, R.; Metcalf, C. J. E.; Stenseth, N.

During pandemics, physical distancing renders the social support strategy less viable, increasing mental health risks.ObjectivesThe current work aims to understand the range of emotions and strategies used in a population of Mental Health staff.MethodsWe conducted an anonymous survey on staff from OMH facilities (n=211) to assess the impact of Covid-19. The current survey captures a host of social, affective, and demographic variables. Accompanied by scales on emotions, emotion regulation, risk, and perception.ResultsWork, family, and health-concerns were the primary contributors to mood. The most common strategy was “situation-avoidance,” then “exercising.” When comparing depression scores against whether or not specific kinds of regulation strategies were utilized, only differences in the strategy of “emotion-suppression” and “authority-seeking” were substantially related to the CES-D scores. Specifically, participants who kept feelings to themselves tended to have higher CES-D scores than those who let their feelings show, while those who sought out authority scored lower on the CES-D, on average than those that did not seek authority.ConclusionsHealthcare staff are under greater stress and pressure during national emergencies, and to regulate emotions during consistent high-stress, our preliminary data suggest that suppression and distraction strategies are dominant.

184153,Immunity against mucosal pathogens.,2010,"Introduction: Treatment-free remission (TFR) is an emerging treatment goal for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in deep molecular response (DMR). Current evidence shows that 40%-60% of patients relapse while in TFR;and nearly all regain response once tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment are reinitiated. However a robust predictor of prolonged TFR has not been reported yet. Considering real-life setting, 2 key factors may affect TFR outcome if not properly done: Access to serial molecular monitoring at optimal timepoints and quality laboratory terms as accuracy, sensitivity and rapid results. This motivated the creation of the AST study in our region to guarantee adequate molecular monitoring for TFR in Argentina and characterize new prognostic biomarkers helpful to identify more accurately patients who will be able to sustain TFR. We aimed to assess the proportion of patients with sustained major molecular response (MMR) after TKIs discontinuation and define precise conditions for stopping treatment. Methods: This prospective, multicentre Argentina Stop Trial (AST) trial is recruiting chronic phase CML patients under TKI treatment for at least ≥ 4 years, in DMR (≥MR4.0) sustained for ≥ 2 years in standardized laboratory, confirmed typical BCR-ABL1 transcripts b3a2 and/or b2a2 and aged > 18 years. Molecular tests are centralized in 2 harmonized laboratories and performed monthly for the first 6 months, every 2 months until the first year, and every 3 months during the second year. If patients lost MMR, TKI was restarted immediately. Molecular relapse Free Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Difference between survival variables was evaluated through log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed through Cox proportional hazards model. The cutoffs of the numerical variables were considered according to the log-rank test. Results: Between February 2019 and July 2020, we evaluated 50 CML patients of whom 46 were enrolled from 7 centers in Argentina and 4 were screening failures. Recruitment was interrupted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Patient median age was 57.5 years (range 24-85). Before discontinuation, TKI treatment was as follows: Imatinib 37/46 (80%), Nilotinib 5/46 (11%) and Dasatinib 4/46 (9%), 2G-TKI as 1st line, 11% of the patients received non-branded treatment. Sokal risk score showed to be low in 22 patients (48%), intermediate in 14 (30%) and high in 10 (22%). Median follow-up was 10 months (range 4-17) and the estimated molecular relapse-free survival was 80.2% (95%CI 69-93) at 6 months Fig 1. Longer DMR durations before discontinuation were associated with increased probability of maintaining response at 6 and 12 months: 83.2% for patients who had >54 months in DMR vs 70% with <54 months and 72% vs 23.3% respectively (p=0.0453) Fig 2. Cox multivariate analysis was performed including different variables as age at diagnosis, time in DMR, time in TKI previous to discontinuation and Sokal risk. The only significant variable associated to improved prognosis was time in DMR (HR 2.8 95%CI 1.002-8.07 p=0.0495). Our cohort had a long time on TKI treatment previous to discontinuation, median 10.5 years (4.16-17.5) probably considering it a favorable factor for the high TFR rates described at 6 months. Among the 46 patients included, 15 (33%) lost MMR, all restarted treatment with the same TKI used before discontinuation, 12/15 (80%) regained MMR with a median time of 3 months (range1-8) and 9/15(60%) obtained MR 4.0 with a median time of 3 months (range1-5). Conclusion: This is the first multicenter study of TKI discontinuation in CML patients in Argentina showing that TKI can be safely discontinued in those who achieve and maintain a DMR before discontinuation. We observed high rates of molecular relapse free survival, although longer follow-up is needed. We must continue with this approach for patients participating in TFR trials or TFR programs in order to decrease the risk of relapse and make this goal a fact in our region. This discontinuation study will allow in a near futu e significant saving of economic resources and might improve patients quality of life specially in those who are currently experiencing treatment adverse events.

In this context, a software fault may result in poorly informed decisions that lead to disastrous consequences. The ability to rigorously test these models is therefore essential. In this systematic literature review, we answer five research questions related to the key aspects of test case generation in agent-based models: What are the information artifacts used to generate tests? How are these tests generated? How is a verdict assigned to a generated test? How is the adequacy of a generated test suite measured? What level of abstraction of an agent-based model is targeted by a generated test? Our results show that whilst the majority of techniques are effective for testing functional requirements at the agent and integration levels of abstraction, there are comparatively few techniques capable of testing society-level behaviour. Additionally, we identify a need for more thorough evaluation using realistic case studies that feature challenging properties associated with a typical agent-based model.","Clark, Andrew G.; Walkinshaw, Neil; Hierons, Robert M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07370v2.pdf,174

Based on daily data we divided the whole sample into two sub-samples according to its breakpoints and found that they occurred right after the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization — WHO (2020). This approach allows us to assess the main differences between these two distinct phases. Thus, while the first sub-period is relatively calm, the second one, which coincides with the pandemic outbreak, shows higher levels of volatility. Considering this, we rely on GARCH-type models to assess the degree of persistence of volatility and to evaluate how it has evolved across sub-samples. Our results show that the FIGARCH(1,d,1) is the best model to describe the data and that the degree of persistence is very different from the first to the second sub-sample. Thus, while the pre-pandemic period exhibits lower levels of persistence it has greatly increased with the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, S&P 500 and FTSE/MIB became the most persistent indices in contrast to NIKKEI 225 and FTSE 100, which were amongst the least persistent.","Bentes, Sónia R.",Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2021.126210,174
184992,"Coronaviruses, a new group of animal RNA viruses.",1970,"Introduction: Pregnant women are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to several factors and therefore require special attention. However, consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women and their newborns remain uncharted. The aim of PregCovid registry is to document the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant, post-partum women and their new-borns. The aim of the registry is also to determine mother to child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in India. Methods and analysis: PregCovid is a hospital based registry for capturing information of pregnant, post-partum women with COVID-19 and their new-borns in India. Medical case records of pregnant and post-partum women with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be captured in real time using an online electronic patient record (EPR) software. The frequency of each symptom will be calculated. The laboratory data will be analyzed for calculating the frequency of laboratory parameters consistently higher in women with COVID-19. The adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes will be analyzed and their frequency will be calculated. Response to treatment will be analyzed for frequency calculation (number of women treated with different treatment regimens). The mother to child transmission data will be analyzed from the RT-PCR and/ antibody data of neonatal and maternal samples tested wherever the information is available. The registry data will be crucial for developing strategies for reducing the adverse impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their new-born.

184994,Case report on mixed infection of canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus--electron microscopy and recovery of canine coronavirus.,1983,"Background: Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaVac,Sinovac, or SV) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria,Oxford-Astra Zeneca, or AZ) vaccines have been administered to the health care workers (HCWs) in Thailand. Objective: To determine the short-term immune response after the SV and AZ vaccinations in HCWs. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, HCWs who completed a 2-dose regimen of the SV or AZ were included. Immune response was evaluated by surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody. Blood samples were analyzed at 4 and 12 weeks after the complete SV vaccination and at 4 weeks after each dose of the AZ vaccination. The primary outcome was the seroconversion rate at 4-weeks after complete immunization. Results: Overall, 185 HCWs with a median (IQR) age of 40.5(30.3-55.8) years (94 HCWs in the SV group and 91 in the AZ group) were included. At 4 weeks after completing the SV vaccination, 60.6% (95%CI:50.0-70.6%) had seroconversion evaluated by sVNT([≥]68%inhibition), comparable to the patients recovered from mild COVID-19 infection(69.0%), with a rapid reduction to 12.2%(95%CI:6.3-20.8) at 12 weeks. In contrast, 85.7%(95%CI:76.8-92.2%) HCWs who completed the second dose of the AZ for 4 weeks had seroconversion, comparable to the COVID-19 pneumonia patients(92.5%). When using the anti-SAR-CoV-2 total antibody level([≥]132 U/ml) criteria, only 71.3% HCWs in the SV group had seroconversion, compared to 100% in the AZ group. Conclusion: A rapid decline of short-term immune response in the HCWs after the SV vaccination indicates the need for a vaccine booster, particularly during the ongoing spreading of the SAR-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Jantarabenjakul, W.; Chantasrisawad, N.; Puthanakit, T.; Wacharapluesadee, S.; Hirankarn, N.; Ruenjaiman, V.; Paitoonpong, L.; Suwanpimolkul, G.; Torvorapanit, P.; Pradit, R.; Sophonphan, J.; PUTCHAROEN, O.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.27.21262721v1?rss=1,174
185422,Equine viral arteritis.,2000,"Objective: Coronavirus disease(COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide after its first report in December 2019, in China. This spread drastically reduced the number of blood donations, thereby creating a shortage at blood banks in the whole world. Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) is the only legal authority that organizes collection, production, storage and distribution of blood and blood products in Turkey. Only in case of emergency TRC gives permanent permission to hospitals;for collecting blood and producing its components through their own transfusion centers. This report describes how the COVID-19 impacted blood supplies of TRC and hospital demands in Turkey with an aim to improve the management of blood supply and demand during the COVID-19 and future pandemics. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a period of nine months from November 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020. Data were retrospectively obtained from donor attendance and blood inventory records of TRC and included;1) the number of donated units of apheresis platelet concentrates (APC) and blood to TRC, 2) the number of units of APC and erythrocyte suspensions (ES) supplied by the hospitals themselves, 3) the number of units of APC and ES supplied to hospitals by TRC (APCH and ESH). The periods before (first period) and after (third period) emergence of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey were compared. Results: An increase of 52% in the number of APC donations, but a decrease of 22% in the number of blood donations (NBDs) were detected in the third period compared to the first one. Mean APCH values were 7081±550 and 5121±55 units in the first and third periods,respectively. The mean ESH values in the first, and third periods were 873±326, and 3694±3143 units. Conclusion: It is obvious that we have learnt many lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, like how to face challenges in maintaining the balance between blood demand and blood supply. Utilizing media to encourage donors and implementation of Patient Blood Management on national and institutional levels may be some of the key components of a comprehensive strategy. The collaboration of Ministry of Health, TRC and hospitals was successful in securing a balance between blood supply and demand in Turkey, on which COVID-19 pandemic impacted significantly.

186172,Challenges for the development of ribonucleoside analogues as inducers of error catastrophe.,2004,"The codon that is in-frame prior to +1 frameshifting at the E.coli prfB (RF2 gene) frameshift site is randomized to create thirty-two variants. These alleles vary 1000-fold in frameshift-dependent expression in fusions to lacZ. Frameshifting is more frequent at sites where the in-frame codon ends in uridine, as if third position wobble pairs to message uridine facilitate slippage into the +1 frame. Consistent with other studies of programmed frameshift sites, efficient frameshifting depends on stable message:tRNA base pairs after rephasing. For complexes with mispairs, frameshift frequency depends on the nature, number, and position of mispairs. Central purine:purine mispairs are especially inhibitory. Relative stabilities of +1 rephased complexes are estimated from published data on the stabilities of tRNA:tRNA complexes. Stability correlates with frameshifting over its entire range, which suggests that stability is an important determinant of the probability of translation of the rephased complex.","Curran, J F",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC309422/,174

Yet, no vaccine or efficient treatments are found against the disease. The viral RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) is a suitable target for developing antiviral agents. SARS-CoV-2 RdRP was employed to test its binding activity with some drugs. METHODS: Using some docking methods, RdRP was targeted by Milbemycins (MMs), Ivermectin (IMT), Baloxavir Marboxil (BM), and Tadalafil (TF), a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. RESULTS: MM-A3 5-oxime (MMA35O), MM-A3 (MMA3), MM-A4 5-oxime (MMA45O), IMT, BM, and TF showed the highest binding affinity to RdRp. CONCLUSION: The drugs used in the present computational investigation are effective against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRP with high affinity values especially, milbemycins, ivermectin, and Baloxavir marboxil, which could further be studied in laboratory and clinical trials for saving millions of lives around the world.","Daghir Janabi, Ali Hassan",Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502160/,174

However, this coronavirus is capable of directly or indirectly affecting other organs, including the kidneys. Here, we summarize the presumed pathophysiology of COVID-19 renal disease. The incidence of acute kidney injury ranges from 0,5 to 22 % of all patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The need for renal replacement therapy is reported in 5-9 % of patients in intensive care. Histological analysis of renal biopsies mainly shows acute tubular necrosis of varying severity, as well as the congestion of glomerular and peri-tubular capillaries. Endothelitis has been described in few cases. Evidence for a factual inflammation of the glomerulus remains controversial.

187246,Ocelots on Barro Colorado Island are infected with feline immunodeficiency virus but not other common feline and canine viruses.,2008,"BACKGROUND Tumor-specific fluorescent antibodies, which can be recognized at a cellular or tissue level using optical imaging such as confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), could provide a means for rapid and accurate tumor diagnosis and staging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of CLE to detect the presence of tagged cells within lymph nodes in an original simulated metastatic model. MATERIALS AND METHODS A solution of indocyanine green containing a suspension of porcine hepatocytes, marked with carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl-ester (CFSE), was injected endoscopically in the gastric submucosa of 10 pigs. Fluorescence lymphography using a near-infrared laparoscope was used to identify sentinel and secondary drainage nodes. Additionally, a nonfluorescent gastric and a mesenteric node were identified. Every 5-10 min, those nodes were scanned using probe-based or needle-based CLE (pCLE or nCLE). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using anti-cytokeratin 18 antibodies was subsequently performed to confirm the presence of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes. RESULTS A total of 36 lymph nodes were analyzed with both CLE probes. Hepatocyte penetration in lymph nodes, as assessed by repeated CLE scanning, took 10-40 min after submucosal injection. Concordance between CLE and IHC was 84 and 72 % for pCLE and nCLE, respectively. False negatives were partly due to incomplete CFSE labeling of hepatocytes, which could not be recognized by CLE, but were detected with IHC. CONCLUSIONS Real-time CLE analysis effectively recognized the presence in perigastric nodes of marked hepatic cells that had been injected endoscopically in the stomach. Validation studies on tumor-bearing animals using tumor-specific antibodies should be performed.","Diana, Michele; Robinet, Eric; Liu, Yu-Yin; Legnèr, Andras; Kong, Seong-Ho; Schiraldi, Luigi; Marchegiani, Francesco; Halvax, Peter; Swanstrom, Lee; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Annals of surgical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511264/,174

Since BCV was discovered (MEBUS et al., 1969), there have been many published reports describing the virus and its importance in calves. In China, we first investigated the seroepidemiological status of BCV infections in cattle (YAO et al., 1990). The results showed that the incidence of infections with BCV in cattle in different chinese regions are high. Further work on direct diagnosis of BCV as a causative agent of diarrhea was therefore necessary. In the last years we have developed diagnostic methods including a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA to detect BCV and other diarrheal viruses. In this study, the diagnosis of an outbreak of BCV in chinese dairy cattle is described.","Lu, C P; Yao, H C; Eichhorn, W",Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin. Reihe B. Journal of veterinary medicine.

METHODS PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial.gov, CNKI, Wanfang Data, China Biomedical Literature Service System, and China Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials of COVID-19 vaccines published up to December 31, 2020. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the quality of studies. A qualitative analysis was performed on the results of clinical trials. RESULTS Thirteen randomized, blinded, controlled trials, which involved the safety and efficacy of 11 COVID-19 vaccines, were included. In 10 studies, the 28-day seroconversion rate of subjects exceeded 80%. In two 10 000-scale clinical trials, the vaccines were effective in 95% and 70.4% of the subjects, respectively. The seroconversion rate was lower than 60% in only one study. In six studies, the proportion of subjects who had an adverse reaction within 28 days after vaccination was lower than 30%. This proportion was 30%-50% in two studies and > 50% in the other two studies. Most of the adverse reactions were mild to moderate and resolved within 24 hours after vaccination. The most common local adverse reaction was pain or tenderness at the injection site, and the most common systemic adverse reaction was fatigue, fever, or bodily pain. The immune response and incidence of adverse reactions to the vaccines were positively correlated with the dose given to the subjects. The immune response to the vaccines was worse in the elderly than in the younger population. In 6 studies that compared single-dose and double-dose vaccination, 4 studies showed that double-dose vaccination produced a stronger immune response than single-dose vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Most of the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be effective and safe. Double-dose vaccination is recommended. However, more research is needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the vaccines and the influence of dose, age, and production process on the protective efficacy.","Xing, Kai; Tu, Xiao-Yan; Liu, Miao; Liang, Zhang-Wu; Chen, Jiang-Nan; Li, Jiao-Jiao; Jiang, Li-Guo; Xing, Fu-Qiang; Jiang, Yi",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33691913/,174

To further examine this trend, CDC analyzed the most current data from the National Vital Statistics System. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that poisoning mortality rates in the United States increased each year from 1999 to 2004, rising 62.5% during the 5-year period. The largest increases were among females (103.0%), whites (75.8%), persons living in the southern United States (113.6%), and persons aged 15-24 years (113.3%). Larger rate increases occurred in states with mostly rural populations. Rates for drug poisoning deaths increased 68.3%, and mortality rates for poisonings by other substances increased 1.3%.

188427,Prevalence and implications of feline coronavirus infections of captive and free-ranging cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).,1990,"OBJECTIVES We demonstrate indications for external mechanical stapler diverticulectomy in the modern era of endoscopic treatment. We review treatment of a large diverticulum and discuss considerations that should be made in deciding on the type of surgical treatment. METHODS The index case was in a 75-year-old man who had undergone open cricopharyngeal myotomy with diverticulopexy 35 years earlier. He presented with 25 years of recurrent symptoms. A swallow study showed a 6.5 x 5.0-cm diverticulum. The diverticulum was deemed too large for standard endoscopic myotomy, so diverticulectomy was performed with a stapler. RESULTS The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 without complications. A swallow study on postoperative day 5 demonstrated no diverticulum or extravasation of barium. The patient resumed a normal diet with resolution of dysphagia. Two additional patients with large Zenker's diverticula that were managed similarly are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS Although endoscopic laser cricopharyngeal myotomy and stapler diverticulostomy have become standard treatments for Zenker's diverticulum, this case of a large recurrent diverticulum illustrates a situation in which older techniques may be preferred. Use of the mechanical stapler allowed for a shorter surgery time than traditional suture techniques, and the potential for an earlier return to a normal diet.","Courson, Andy M; Landry, April M; Lott, David G; Hinni, Michael L","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592574/,174

Variability in TLR3 expression may play an important role in disease susceptibility of white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses, which are dsRNA viruses. Because little is known about TLR3 in WTD, our objective was to sequence WTD TLR3 mRNA and to determine baseline levels of tissue expression. A 209-base pair sequence of TLR3 mRNA was obtained from WTD peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dot blots confirmed that the sequence obtained was part of total WTD mRNA. Variable expression or ligand binding of TLR3 may contribute to observed susceptibility differences between populations of WTD, so the level of TLR3 in small intestine, skin, spleen, heart, cecum, rumen, lymph node, lung, kidney, and liver from WTD fawns (n=2) was analyzed using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

188651,"Lactic acid and glucose metabolism in healthy, lactic acid-infused, and diarrheic calves.",1980,"The COVID-19 disease is caused by the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 virus, thought to have originated in bats (Rhinolophus affinis), the virus being highly infective within the human population and spread by respiratory droplets, contaminated surfaces and close person-to-person contact. The virus is now pandemic and widely disseminated to almost every continent and nation with globally over twenty-seven million infections and over ninety-thousand reported deaths attributed to the COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA virus, similar in structure to that of other coronaviruses and comprising three main viral proteins; membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E). The clinical features of COVID-19 disease can be classified according to different degrees of severity, with some patients, particularly those of older age and with long-standing chronic illnesses, developing progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. In these severe cases, the disease can frequently be fatal. In addition, many infections are asymptomatic or only cause mild symptoms. As there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 there is considerable scientific endeavor globally to raise a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, in addition to engineering neutralizing antibody interventions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, interim measures involving movement control and lock downs of varying stringencies have been imposed, in order to control the spread of the virus. Whilst early enforced lockdown measures have been effective in reducing the spread of infection, these measures may prove to be less effective against the current and predominant strain of SARS-CoV-2, the G614 clade. Conversely, other mutations of the virus, such as the Δ382 variant could reduce the clinical relevance of infection, and therefore may reduce the need for stringent movement control, particularly once vaccines become widely available. The front runners in the race to develop an effective vaccine focus on the SARS-Co-V-2 Spike protein. However, vaccines that produce a CD4 and CD8 response to a wider range of SARS-Co-V-2 viral proteins, may be more effective. Lastly, population based studies that determine the level of innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 existing in the community, from prior exposure to the virus or to other coronaviruses, will have important implications for the stringencies of government imposed movement control and upon the strategic delivery of vaccination programmes.","Salvamani, S; Tan, H Z; Thang, W J; Ter, H C; Wa, M Shafiq; Gunasekaran, B; Rhodes, A",British journal of biomedical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942955/,174
188833,Virus maturation by budding.,1998,"Vero/Shiga toxins (VT/Stx) have an A-B structure: the A subunit carries the enzymatic activity and the B subunit binds the toxin to the membrane receptor (Gb3 or Gb4). The VT/Stx inhibit protein synthesis in the target eucaryotic cells, mainly the endothelial cells of blood vessels. The VT/Stx are subdivided into two families. VT1/Stx1 is a homogeneous family of toxins identical to the Stx of Shigella dysenteriae. VT2/Stx2 is a more heterogeneous family of toxins more distantly related to this Stx toxin. The VT2/Stx2 variants can be distinguished by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or the reaction with monoclonal antibodies. The VT/Stx-producing Escherichia coli are also subdivided into two main groups on the basis of the presence or absence of additional properties: the enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) induce the formation of attaching/effacing lesions and carry a 60 MD plasmid encoding a specific haemolysin (the enterohaemolysin); the vero/shiga-toxigenic E. coli (VTEC/STEC) do not show these properties. The EHEC are isolated from humans and ruminants, especially young calves. They are associated with haemorrhagic enterocolitis and its sequelae in humans, the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). The VT/Stx play a role in the occurrence of blood in the faeces and in the HUS by their action on the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the intestinal submucosa and in the renal glomeruli, after resorption through the intestinal walls. The VTEC/STEC are isolated from piglets, calves and humans. In recently weaned piglets, they cause the oedema disease, an enterotoxaemia characterized by subcutaneous, mesenteric and cerebral oedemas, with nervous disorders as main clinical signs. The oedema disease is the consequence of the action of the VT/Stx on the endothelial cells of blood vessels in various organs. In calves and humans, the role in disease of VTEC/STEC is controversial, but they could be associated with some cases of diarrhoea and HUS.

It is an important cause of buttock pain that may often be accompanied by sciatica. The pain is usually increased by muscular contraction, palpation or prolonged sitting. The diagnosis relies on the clinical presentation and the electromyelography (EMG) findings. Other causes of symptoms should be excluded by careful examination and detailed neuroradiological studies of the lumbosacral spine, sacro-iliac and hip joints.

190321,A study of naturally occurring feline coronavirus infections in kittens.,1992,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a newly identified acute respiratory disease caused by a strain of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has become a worldwide pandemic. From December 2019 to present, millions of cases have been reported, bringing unprecedented pressure on both health and epidemic prevention services in every country. As frontline healthcare workers, ophthalmologists face an increased threat of viral infection, not only because of close contact with patients during examinations or operations, but also due to evidence showing that ocular fluids such as tears or conjunctival secretions may carry the virus. The risk that healthcare workers face is emphasized by the loss of our colleagues who have sacrificed themselves in combating the virus. As a result, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the threats that we face. In the first part of this review, we start by explaining the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and examining its transmission and means of infection. Next, we summarize the latest scientific advancements of epidemiology, clinical presentations, and current treatments of COVID-19. In the second half of the review, we emphasize the ocular transmission, symptomatic manifestations, and the essential knowledge in an ophthalmology clinic setting. As the pandemic of COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to global health, we hope that this review makes a contribution to combating COVID-19.","Sun, Shuo; Su, Wenqi; Lin, Christopher Q; Li, Xiaorong; Yan, Hua; Tian, Bo; Lin, Haijiang",Discovery medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007190/,174

190621,The causes of glaucoma in cats.,1990,"OBJECTIVE To analyze diagnostic approach to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) according to the diagnostic criteria issued by the Ministry of Health of China (MHC). METHODS The clinical data and the diagnostic results of 108 cases of SARS were retrospectively reviewed according to the MHC criteria. RESULTS There were 55 men and 53 women, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 12 - 78 years). The interval between their first visit and clinical diagnosis was 3 days (range, 0 - 14 days). The diagnosis was made at the first visit in 7 (6.5%, 7/108) cases with a history of exposure to SARS patients and infiltrates on chest radiograph. Eighty-nine (82.4%) and 12 (11.1%) patients were categorized as probable cases and suspected cases respectively at their first visit and a clinical diagnosis of SARS was made subsequently. The interval between first visit and reaching the final diagnosis was 1 - 3 days in 72 (66.7%) cases and 4 days in 29 (26.9%) cases. The final diagnosis was made in 0 - 14 days (median, 2 days) for those (n = 59, 54.6%) with a history of close contact with SARS patients and 2 - 8 days (median, 3 days) for those (n = 49, 45.4%) living in Beijing but without such a history (P = 0.03). The chest radiograph was interpreted as unremarkable in 26 (24.1%) cases at their first visit, and the diagnosis was made in 4 days (range 2 - 8 days), which was significantly longer compared with other cases (P < 0.001). In patients without a history of close contact with SARS patients, all the five criteria were met after combination antibiotic therapy had failed. CONCLUSIONS A chest radiograph without infiltrates at the early stage of SARS is an important factor responsible for delayed diagnosis. In patients without a history of close contact with SARS cases, antibiotic effect was a major factor influencing doctors' diagnosis.","Sun, Yongchang; Yao, Wanzhen; Wang, Xiaohong; He, Bei; Zhao, Mingwu; Sun, Bozhang; Shan, Yun; Zheng, Ya'an; Zhang, Fuchun; Sun, Wei",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14570601/,174

190872,"Listeric meningoencephalomyelitis in a cougar (Felis concolor): characterization by histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular methods.",2006,"Aim The present study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19. Background This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of the β-coronaviruses wages a full-scale war against human health. Notwithstanding atypical pneumonia being the primary symptom, the emergence of severe disease mainly resulting from the injury of non-pulmonary organs leaves no alternative, in some cases, other than a dreadful death. Methods To provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint representing the prognostic values of liver-related laboratory parameters in COVID-19, a meta-analysis was performed with the calculation of mean difference and 95% conﬁdence intervals of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Bili), and albumin (Alb) in severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Results While severe COVID-19 cases displayed higher values of ALT, AST, and Bili compared to non-severe patients (mean differences of 7.48, 12.07, and 3.07, respectively), the value of Alb was significantly lower in severe cases (mean differences of -6.15). There was also a correlation between alterations in all of the parameters; however, only correlations between ALT and Bili (R=0.98, p=0.0031), and Bili and Alb (R=-1, p=0.0012) were significant. Conclusion Abnormal values of liver-related examinations outwardly contribute to reflect the progression of the disease toward an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, careful scrutiny of these parameters will provide clinicians with invaluable information regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least in terms of liver injury.","Bashash, Davood; Olfatifar, Meysam; Hadaegh, Farzad; Asadzadeh Aghdaei, Hamid; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244373/,174

It is one of the most severe and common, is usually observed in the elderly mainly in poorly controlled diabetes. The proper treatment requires involvement of doctors of various specialities and, although numerous newest, supportive therapies and rehabilitation are used, the diabetic foot syndrom may lead to limb amputation and, consequently, serious disability. A CASE REPORT A patient was hospitalized in the Department of Oncological Surgery UCK in July and August 2020. He was admitted to the Department from the Emergency Department due to the phlegmon of the left foot and toes necrosis in progress of the diabetic foot syndrome. The patient was treated with type II insulin-dependent diabetes for many years. In the last months before admission to the hospital, the controls in the Diabetic and Diabetic Foot Syndrom Outpatient Departments were not exact due to the ongoing pandemic of COVID- 19. Thanks to the use of modern techniques of local wound healing, including negative pressure wound therapy and supportive therapies it was possible to preserve the limb, despite being qualified for amputation on admission to the hospital. We achieved a fairly good cosmetic effect and in the consequence - a chance for an independent life in an acceptable condition. CONCLUSIONS The involvement of medical personnel, the use of negative pressure therapy and hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of wounds and supportive therapies allowed for limb preservation and improvement of the patient's quality of life.","Cichon, Paulina; Ekmana, Marcin",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218241/,174
191927,Adenovirus uncoating and nuclear establishment are not affected by weak base amines.,1996,"A reverse genetic system was recently established for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), in which cDNA fragments of the RNA genome are assembled in vitro into a full-length genome cDNA, followed by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed genome RNA into cells with recovery of viable virus. The ""in vitro-assembled"" wild-type MHV-A59 virus (icMHV-A59) demonstrated replication identical to laboratory strains of MHV-A59 in tissue culture; however, icMHV-A59 was avirulent following intracranial inoculation of C57BL/6 mice. Sequencing of the cloned genome cDNA fragments identified two single-nucleotide mutations in cloned genome fragment F, encoding a Tyr6398His substitution in open reading frame (ORF) 1b p59-nsp14 and a Leu94Pro substitution in the ORF 2a 30-kDa protein. The mutations were repaired individually and together in recombinant viruses, all of which demonstrated wild-type replication in tissue culture. Following intracranial inoculation of mice, the viruses encoding Tyr6398His/Leu94Pro substitutions and the Tyr6398His substitution alone demonstrated log10 50% lethal dose (LD50) values too great to be measured. The Leu94Pro mutant virus had reduced but measurable log10 LD5), and the ""corrected"" Tyr6398/Leu94 virus had a log10 LD50 identical to wild-type MHV-A59. The experiments have defined residues in ORF 1b and ORF 2a that attenuate virus replication and virulence in mice but do not affect in vitro replication. The results suggest that these proteins serve roles in pathogenesis or virus survival in vivo distinct from functions in virus replication. The study also demonstrates the usefulness of the reverse genetic system to confirm the role of residues or proteins in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis.","Sperry, Steven M; Kazi, Lubna; Graham, Rachel L; Baric, Ralph S; Weiss, Susan R; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15731233/,174
192108,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,2005,"The temporal sequence of coronavirus plus-strand and minus-strand RNA synthesis was determined in 17CL1 cells infected with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV-induced fusion was prevented by keeping the pH of the medium below pH 6.8. This had no effect on the MHV replication cycle, but gave 5- to 10-fold-greater titers of infectious virus and delayed the detachment of cells from the monolayer which permitted viral RNA synthesis to be studied conveniently until at least 10 h postinfection. Seven species of poly(A)-containing viral RNAs were synthesized at early and late times after infection, in nonequal but constant ratios. MHV minus-strand RNA synthesis was first detected at about 3 h after infection and was found exclusively in the viral replicative intermediates and was not detected in 60S single-stranded form in infected cells. Early in the replication cycle, from 45 to 65% of the [3H]uridine pulse-labeled RF core of purified MHV replicative intermediates was in minus-strand RNA. The rate of minus-strand synthesis peaked at 5 to 6 h postinfection and then declined to about 20% of the maximum rate. The addition of cycloheximide before 3 h postinfection prevented viral RNA synthesis, whereas the addition of cycloheximide after viral RNA synthesis had begun resulted in the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. The synthesis of both genome and subgenomic mRNAs and of viral minus strands required continued protein synthesis, and minus-strand RNA synthesis was three- to fourfold more sensitive to inhibition by cycloheximide than was plus-strand synthesis.","Sawicki, S G; Sawicki, D L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2867230/,174
192210,Examination of animal and zoonotic pathogens using microarrays.,2008,"Woodchucks (Marmota monax) have a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and serve as a model of hepatitis B virus-associated HCC in humans. Helicobacter hepaticus, an enterohepatic helicobacter in mice, is known to cause hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in susceptible mouse strains. In long-term chemical bioassays conducted with B6C3F(1) mice, H. hepaticus has been regarded as a confounding factor because of its tumor-promoting activity. In order to determine if woodchucks harbor a Helicobacter sp. that might play a role in potentiating hepatic inflammation or neoplasia, a study was undertaken to determine whether woodchucks' livers were infected with a Helicobacter sp. Frozen liver samples from 20 (17 WHV-infected and 3 noninfected) woodchucks, 10 with WHV-associated hepatic tumors and 10 without tumors, were cultured by microaerobic techniques and analyzed by using genus- and species-specific helicobacter PCR primers. A 1,200-bp Helicobacter sp.-specific sequence was amplified from 14 liver samples. Southern hybridization confirmed the specific identity of the PCR products. Nine of the 10 livers with tumors had positive Helicobacter sp. identified by PCR, whereas 5 of the 10 livers without tumors were positive. By use of 16S rRNA species-specific primers for H. marmotae, two additional liver samples from the nontumor group had positive PCR amplicons confirmed by Southern hybridization. A urease-, catalase-, and oxidase-positive bacterium was isolated from one liver sample from a liver tumor-positive woodchuck. By 16S rRNA analysis and biochemical and phenotypic characteristics, the organism was classified as a novel Helicobacter sp. Subsequently, four additional bacterial strains isolated from feces of cats and characterized by biochemical, phenotypic, and 16S rRNA analysis were determined to be identical to the woodchuck isolate. We propose the name Helicobacter marmotae sp. nov. for these organisms. Further studies are required to ascertain if this novel Helicobacter sp. plays a tumor promotion role in hepadnavirus-associated tumors in woodchucks or causes enterohepatic disease in cats.","Fox, James G; Shen, Zeli; Xu, Shilu; Feng, Yan; Dangler, Charles A; Dewhirst, Floyd E; Paster, Bruce J; Cullen, John M",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12089272/,174

Many attempts have been undertaken previously to create animal models of chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases through autoimmunity or virus infection. Recently, however, a new model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis became available, which, in a very standardized and predictable way, leads to chronic (relapsing or progressive) disease and widespread CNS demyelination. In the present study we actively induced MOG-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in different inbred rat strains using different immunization protocols. The pathology found in our models closely reflects the spectrum of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology: Classical MS as well as variants such as optic neuritis, Devic's disease and Marburg's type of acute MS are mimicked in rats immunized with MOG antigen. Furthermore we demonstrate, that by using the proper strain/sensitization regime, subforms of MS such as for instance neuromyelitis optica can be reproducibly induced. Our study further supports the notion, that incidence and expression of the disease in this model, alike the situation in multiple sclerosis, is determined by genetic and environmental factors.","Storch, M K; Stefferl, A; Brehm, U; Weissert, R; Wallström, E; Kerschensteiner, M; Olsson, T; Linington, C; Lassmann, H",Brain pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9804377/,174

The observation that a subset of HIV infected individuals, who do not develop AIDS, have a broadly neutralizing antibody response has drawn attention to deciphering the nature of this response. It is hoped that an understanding of these protective antibodies, developed over time in response to the ongoing accumulation of mutations in the infecting virus, will facilitate the development of a vaccine that can elicit a similar response. This strategy will be greatly aided by the identification of broadly neutralizing monoclonal HIV antibodies from infected individuals. Several methods have been utilized to isolate and characterize individual antibodies from the human repertoire and each of these methods has been applied to the generation of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies, albeit with differing rates of success. This review describes several of these methods including human hybridoma; EBV transformation; non-immortalized B cell culture; clonal sorting; and combinatorial display. Key considerations used in the comparison of different methods includes: efficiency of interrogation of an individual's entire repertoire; assay formats that can be used to screen for antibodies of interest (i.e., binding versus biological assays); and the ability to recover native antibody heavy and light chain pairs.","Hammond, Philip W",mAbs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20168075/,174

In the mucosa, these responses would be most effective if a preferential stimulus of HIV-1 neutralizing secretory immunoglobulin A and G were obtained. The attractive property of mucosal immunization is the obtained mucosal and systemic immunity, whereas systemic immunization induces a more limited immunity, predominantly in systemic sites. These objectives will require new vaccine regimens, such as multiclade HIV DNA and protein vaccines (nef, tat, gag and env expressed in DNA plasmids) delivered onto mucosal surfaces with needle-free delivery methods, such as nasal drop, as well as oral and rectal/vaginal delivery, and should merit clinical trials.","Hinkula, Jorma",Expert review of vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17408370/,174

The Taiwanese government also recognizes the need to implement a nationwide health care quality indicator system to strengthen quality surveillance. CHOICE OF SOLUTION In 1999, the Department of Health funded a 2-year project led by the Taiwan Healthcare Executive College to develop a comprehensive performance assessment system, subsequently named as Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series (THIS). The series includes four categories of indicators, namely outpatient, in-patient, emergency care, and intensive care, and has 139 items in total. IMPLEMENTATION The system was officially launched in 2001. Participation is voluntary. The Taiwan Healthcare Executive College processes the data and provides feedback to the participating hospitals. The information is for the participating hospitals' own use and is not released to the public. EVALUATION Participating hospitals have increased from 45 in 2001 to 227 in 2006 and now constitute approximately 50% of the total hospital population in Taiwan. The reporting rate averaged 77.7% in 2004. The first five most reported indicators are the percentage of first-visit outpatients to outpatient clinics, the average length of in-patient stay, the nosocomial infection rate, the occupancy rate, and the crude mortality rate. LESSONS LEARNED How the data are interpreted and how data interpretation can lead to quality improvement are the principal concerns of participating hospitals.

The mutated envelopes were tested for intracellular maturation and for functions, including ability to elicit syncytium formation and ability to mediate cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. Three major phenotypes, defining three functionally distinct regions, were identified. (i) Mutations causing defects in intracellular maturation of the envelope precursor are mostly distributed in the central portion of the TM ectodomain, containing the immunosuppressive peptide. This region, which includes vicinal cysteines thought to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, is probably essential for correct folding of the protein. (ii) Mutations resulting in reduced syncytium-forming ability despite correct intracellular maturation are clustered in the amino-terminal part of the TM ectodomain, within the leucine zipper-like motif. Similar motifs with a propensity to form coiled-coil structures have been implicated in the fusion process driven by other viral envelope proteins, and HTLV-1 may thus conform to this general rule for viral fusion. (iii) Mutants with increased syncytium-forming ability define a region immediately amino-terminal to the membrane-spanning domain. Surprisingly, these mutants exhibited severe defects in infectivity, despite competence for fusion. Existence of this phenotype indicates that capacity for cell-to-cell fusion is not sufficient to ensure viral entry, even in cell-to-cell transmission. The ectodomain of the TM glycoprotein thus may be involved in postfusion events required for full infectivity of HTLV-1, which perhaps represents a unique feature of this poorly infectious retrovirus.","Rosenberg, A R; Delamarre, L; Pique, C; Pham, D; Dokhélar, M C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9311790/,174

Group 1 affects dogs, cats, pigs, and the human agent is 229 E. Group 2 affects bovines or rodents, and the human agent is OC43. And group 3 corresponds to the avian pathology.... The epidemics emerged on February 2003 in Guangdong, South China, due to consumption of exotic animals (Civeta, etc.), and it spread through interperson contagion to other regions in Asia, America and Europe. Incubation period is about 2-7 days. Transmission Of the virus is person-to person, but also by excretions and residual water. Basic reproductive rate is 2 to 4, and it is considered that 2.7 persons are infected from the initial case. In June 2003, SARS affected over 8,000 people and 774 were killed. Mortality approaches to 10%, and it is higher among older people rising up to 50% in those aged over 65 years. It is important to quickly establish action protocols regarding clinical, epidemiological and prevention aspects. Avian influenza is an infection caused by type A Influenza Orthomixovirus, in which migration birds and wild ducks are the main reservoir. Avian viruses correspond to H5, H7, H9. In 1997 it was observed that type AH5N1 jumped interspecies barrier and affected 18 humans, and 6 of them died. At the end of 2003 and in 2004 this type of poultry flu was described in Asia. FAO has emphasized that sacrifice of chicken in affected farms is the most effective measure to fight against the disease. It has also been established suppression of imports from these countries.

Because these patients require follow-up in the outpatient setting, family physicians should be prepared to provide ongoing care and screening for post-ICU complications. Risk factors for complications after ICU discharge include previous ICU admissions, preexisting mental illness, greater number of comorbidities, and prolonged mechanical ventilation or higher opioid exposure while in the ICU. Early nutritional support and mobilization in the ICU decrease the risk of complications. After ICU discharge, patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cognitive impairment using standardized screening tools. Physicians should also inquire about weakness, fatigue, neuropathy, and functional impairment and perform a targeted physical examination and laboratory evaluation as indicated; treatment depends on the underlying cause. Exercise regimens are beneficial for reducing several post-ICU complications. Patients who were treated for COVID-19 in the ICU may require additional instruction on reducing the risk of virus transmission.

194966,SARS- and other coronaviruses.,2008,"Testing field-caught mosquito collections can result in thousands of pools, and testing pools of 50 mosquitoes each can be both time consuming and cost prohibitive. Consequently, we have developed an alternative approach to testing mosquito pools for arboviruses, utilizing a superpool strategy. When mosquito samples are processed for extraction of viral RNA and subsequent virus testing via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, each pool is tested individually. Using the method described here, 0.025 ml from each of 10 pools is combined into a superpool for RNA extraction and testing. When a virus-positive superpool sample is found, each of the original 10 pools that constitute this sample is tested individually in order to find the specific positive sample. By retesting the original samples after the initial superpool screen, we are still able to obtain reliable estimates for minimum infection rates or maximum likelihood estimations. To test this principle, we created controlled mosquito pools of known titer and subjected them to our superpool process. We were able to detect our entire range of laboratory-created pools as being West Nile virus (WNV) positive. In 2005, field surveillance efforts from our laboratory resulted in over 4,000 mosquito pools tested, with 8 resulting WNV-positive samples. We found that all of these field samples were detected as WNV positive using the superpool method and contained calculated virus titers from < 0.1 to 4.1 log10 plaque-forming units/ml WNV, indicating that the limit of superpool detection of WNV is below this point. These results reveal that the superpool method could be accurately used to detect WNV in field-collected specimens.","Chisenhall, Daniel M; Vitek, Christopher J; Richards, Stephanie L; Mores, Christopher N",Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18666541/,174

In 2011 and 2012, serum samples and tonsils were recovered from 162 and 37 feral swine, respectively, in the US to evaluate exposure to important swine endemic pathogens. Antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) were found in 2.5% and 25.3% of tested sera, respectively. Positive serological reactions against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae have been detected in 19.7% and 69.7% of animals. More than 15% of animals presented antibodies against these 2 pathogens simultaneously. Most animals were also seropositive for Lawsonia intracellularis. Feral swine can also be involved in transmission of zoonotic agents. Almost 50% of animals possessed antibodies against Salmonella. In addition, 94.4% of animals were carriers of Streptococcus suis in their tonsils. In conclusion, feral swine may be considered as a potential reservoir for different endemic diseases in domestic pigs, as well as for important zoonotic agents.","Baroch, John A; Gagnon, Carl A; Lacouture, Sonia; Gottschalk, Marcelo",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25673913/,174

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: General scientific and specific historical methods were used, and methods of related sciences were applied as well. The main methods of historical research included, in particular, historical analytical, chronological and comparative historical; methods of medical statistics, etc. The historiography of the issue was analyzed, unpublished archival materials, local press were studied. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Despite the progress made, mortality remained high in general, proving the public health system had to be reorganized. The death rate shocked the local community so much that the authorities had to apply an information blockade. Anti-epidemic components included explanatory work by priests and police, sanitary measures, measures on strict compliance with observation and quarantine, food supplies to the blocked city and free medicine dispensation, involvement of all available medical institutions, and the establishment of special temporary facilities, actual mobilization of medical personnel. It was impossible to act in the other way, because the treatment methods seemed to be ineffective, like today, under the COVID-19 pandemic. When the medical component is proved ineffective in fighting the epidemic, relatively effective administrative measures, tried and tested over the centuries reasonably seem to be useful, and this experience has not lost its relevance.","Robak, Ihor Yu; Alkov, Volodymyr A; Demochko, Hanna L; Chernukha, Oleksandr V",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090298/,174
198423,Suspect Odontogenic Infection Etiology for Canine Lymphoplasmacytic Rhinitis.,2015,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate in a group of physicians the relation between burnout, demographic or job characteristics, anxiety, and immune variables. METHODS Seventy one physicians of all grades were recruited among different departments to a cross sectional survey. The Maslach burnout inventory, scales of emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and personal accomplishment, the trait scale of anxiety inventory (STAI-Y2), and a questionnaire on personal and professional characteristics were administered. The immune profile included quantitative (number (%) of lymphocytes and subsets) and functional (natural killer cytotoxicity) measures. RESULTS With a model of stepwise multiple regression analysis, emotional exhaustion was significantly affected by both personal (marital, sex) and job characteristics (qualification, working activity), whereas only patient contact explained a portion of variation in depersonalisation. Furthermore, trait anxiety was found to predict the Maslach burnout inventory scores. After correction for potential confounders, physicians who scored high levels of personal accomplishment showed significantly higher numbers of total lymphocytes, T cells (CD3), T helper cells (CD4), and T suppressor cells (CD8) than those who scored low levels. No other correlation was found between burnout and immune variables. CONCLUSIONS In our group of relatively young physicians a high degree of personal accomplishment was associated with an increase in the number of peripheral lymphocytes, particularly T subsets. The meaning of this is not clear, although it could be speculated that to evaluate oneself positively, particularly with regard to work with patients in the health services, might help to stimulate the immune system. By contrast, there is no evidence that to work hard, to feel tired from work, and to have a cynical reaction towards patient care is related to immunosuppression.","Bargellini, A; Barbieri, A; Rovesti, S; Vivoli, R; Roncaglia, R; Borella, P",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10854497/,174

198510,Variation in rotavirus virulence: a comparison of pathogenesis in calves between two rotaviruses of different virulence.,1993,"It has been shown previously that the fusion glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-F) interacts with cellular heparan sulfate. Synthetic overlapping peptides derived from the F-protein sequence of RSV subtype A (strain A2) were tested for their ability to bind heparin using heparin-agarose affinity chromatography (HAAC). This evaluation identified 15 peptides representing eight linear heparin-binding domains (HBDs) located within F1 and F2 and spanning the protease cleavage activation site. All peptides bound to Vero and A549 cells, and binding was inhibited by soluble heparins and diminished by either enzymatic treatment to remove cell surface glycosaminoglycans or by treatment with sodium chlorate to decrease cellular sulfation. RSV-F HBD peptides were less likely to bind to glycosaminoglycan-deficient CHO-745 cells than parental CHO-K1 cells that express these molecules. Three RSV-F HBD peptides (F16, F26, and F55) inhibited virus infectivity; two of these peptides (F16 and F55) inhibited binding of virus to Vero cells, while the third (F26) did not. These studies provided evidence that two of the linear HBDs mapped by peptides F16 and F55 may mediate one of the first steps in the attachment of virus to cells while the third, F26, inhibited infectivity at a postattachment step, suggesting that interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans may play a role in infectivity of some RSV strains.","Crim, Roberta L; Audet, Susette A; Feldman, Steven A; Mostowski, Howard S; Beeler, Judy A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17050595/,174

Penicillin remains the cornerstone of treatment in GABHS pharyngitis. Early treatment effects prompt clinical improvement and reduces the risk of transmission. Whether early treatment suppresses immunologic response and results in a higher recurrence rate than does delayed treatment is still unknown, but recent evidence suggests that it does not. The causes of persistent GABHS carriage, its clinical importance, and optimal methods of treatment are all still in question. When penicillin treatment does not eradicate carriage, other drugs may be efficacious. In children severely affected with recurrent throat infection, tonsillectomy is generally effective and is sometimes a desirable option.","Paradise, J L","The Annals of otology, rhinology & laryngology.

Measurement of droplet production and size was recorded in vitro using three methods: (1) Malvern Spraytec (LASER particle size measurement device with detectable particle size of 0.1-2500 µm) and brushes mounted on a 3D-printed, two-shell form-fit fixture with a supply of tap water; (2) a DustTrak aerosol measurement device and toothpaste slurry, with brushing simulated in the oral cavity of a phantom head; (3) high-speed visualization in a simulated-use situation in the oral cavity of a phantom head, with individual evaluation of tap water, water with detergent, 70% ethanol, glycerin and toothpaste slurry. Both brushes showed the size of emitted droplets was consistently between 200 and 1200 µm, categorized as splatter (dental aerosols are <50 µm diameter). No significant incremental aerosol-sized matter was detected during toothbrush operation. The high-speed video visualization confirmed only splatter-sized droplets during operation. These findings indicate that oscillating-rotating toothbrushes do not produce aerosol-sized particles during simulated use.","Mark, Erwin P; Lewis, Michael A O; Graziani, Filippo; Atlas, Boris; Utsch, Joern",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,174

DESIGN: This is a prospective observational survey-based study. SETTING: This study was conducted at academic medical center in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-four scribes working in ambulatory practices within an academic medical center. INTERVENTIONS: All medical scribes received a survey assessing their workflow since beginning of COVID-19 restrictions. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: To assess the current workflow of medical scribes since transition to virtual care. Secondary outcomes are to assess the equipment used and location of their new workflow. RESULTS: Fifty-seven scribes completed the survey. Overall 42% of scribes have transitioned to remote scribing with 97% serving as remote scribes for remote visits. This workflow is conducted at home and with personal equipment. Of those not working as scribes, 46% serve in preclinic support, with a wide range of EHR-related activities being reported. The remaining scribes have been either redeployed or furloughed. CONCLUSION: The rapid transition to virtual care brought about by COVID-19 has resulted in a dramatic shift in scribe workflow with the adoption of a previously unreported workflow of remote scribing for virtual care. Additional work is now needed to ensure these new workflows are safe and effective and that scribes are trained to work in this new paradigm.","Gold, Jeffrey A; Becton, James; Ash, Joan S; Corby, Sky; Mohan, Vishnu",Appl Clin Inform,,174

These regulations aimed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among farmworkers, but made compromises that may fail to reduce the risk of further outbreaks among Oregon's agricultural workers, particularly those living in agricultural labor housing. Instead of considering the scientific literature that called for attention to space and length of time for social distancing among unrelated persons in indoor areas, the agency accepted the 6-foot social distancing rule of thumb and allowed even shorter distances between beds with the installation of plastic or plywood barriers. The 6-foot distance (or less with a barrier) between people sleeping next to each other in poorly ventilated housing has proved disastrous. Additionally, testing for migrant and seasonal farmworkers is neither uniform nor thorough, and little data have been collected to assess the success of existing testing efforts. New regulations must be adopted for farm labor housing that limit occupancy to at most two unrelated individuals for a room of 200 square feet; include expanded specification on the provision of fresh air in shared living spaces; and support increased access to testing, surveillance testing, and alternative safe housing at labor housing sites for identified cases.","Accorsi, Emma K; Samples, Julie; McCauley, Linda A; Shadbeh, Nargess",J Agromedicine,,174

An early-stage detection of COVID-19 is crucial for the containment of the pandemic it has caused. In this study, a transfer learning-based COVID-19 screening technique is proposed. The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning-based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images. The results obtained on diverse datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed work. A pre-processing technique has also been proposed for radiological data.

On the one hand, it requires much cognitive effort to cope with new tasks of working in virtual environment, and on the other, it promotes further development of cognitive abilities of all participants in the educational process. Reforms include changes in learning environment (for students), and new approaches to teaching methods (for teaching staff). It is worth mentioning that lately most of the teaching staff have also become 'students' while acquiring new skills of working with information technologies in E-learning environment. The current research was held on the basis of two universities, the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University) and Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI University). The aim of the study is to analyze students' and educators' attitude (expectations, readiness, experience obtained) towards the e-learning environment and to identify the essence of cognitive abilities development for students in the format of forced distance learning. The research included 234 respondents (134 from MAI University and 100 from MGIMO University) who were to take part in two questionnaires (one for educators, and the other for students of foreign languages) to get their attitude to the forced substitution of the traditional, in-person, form of education;benefits remote telecommuting classes can offer;virtual learning and educational environment;new skills and abilities e-learning environment require and develop. The research has also proved an increase in digital 'literacy' of both educators and students. It presumes that educators have acquired new digital skills and have developed new forms of distance learning and virtual collaboration. As for the students, e-learning has promoted development of their cognitive abilities (information comprehension, procession, content structuring) and new skills of telecommuting, telecommunicating and telepresenting the results of their work. All respondents highlighted that on-line education and collaboration has required psychological adaption and self-discipline. Nevertheless, current situation caused by the pandemic proves that developing cognitive abilities has become a prerequisite for sustainable education. It is necessary to work out scientific tools and procedures to assess the cognitive abilities of students and teaching staff in order to elaborate effective mechanisms of collaboration in virtual environment. The results may assist students, educators, regulators and employers in efficient and fruitful cooperation with IT experts in order to address the current challenges in the sphere of education. © 2021 ACM.","Kurbakova, S.

Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","Balboa-Castillo, Teresa; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar; Marzuca-Nassr, Gabriel Nasri; Morales Illanes, Gladys; Ortiz, Manuel; Schiferlli, Ingrid; Aguilar-Farias, Nicolas; Soto, Álvaro; Sapunar, Jorge",Medwave,,174

286024,Resveratrol inhibits inflammation after spinal cord injury via SIRT-1/NF-κB signaling pathway,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) may result in hearing loss, chronic otitis and cholesteatoma. With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS: All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS: A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube. FUNDING: none. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (VD-2018-33, I-Suite 6229).","Krog, Sebastian M; Bang, Lia E; Holmvang, Lene; Räder, Sune B; Fanø, Søren; Egstrup, Michael; Hassager, Christian; Høfsten, Dan Eik; Lassen, Jens Flensted; Lindholm, Matias Greve; Engstrøm, Thomas; Kjærgaard, Jesper",Danish medical journa,,174

We collected serum samples of patients and health-care professionals to assess the accuracy of chemiluminescent (CLIA) and two lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIA) to determine IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. We calculated the &#966; correlation for qualitative results and test accuracy, adopting the following case definition: either real-time-PCR positivity or serological positivity with at least two different tests. We analyzed 259 samples, obtaining strong correlation between CLIA and both LFIA for IgG (&#966;=0.9), and moderate correlation for IgM (&#966;=0.6). For patients, the sensitivity was suboptimal for all methods (CLIA 81%, LFIA A 85%, LFIA B 78%), while it was poor in asymptomatic health-care workers (CLIA 50%, LFIA A 50%, LFIA B 33%). Overall, CLIA is more sensitive and specific for the determination of both IgG and IgM, whilst both LFIA methods reported good sensitivity and specificity for IgG, but scarce sensitivity for the IgM determination. The determination of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG is useful to detect infection 6 days from symptom onset.","Pecoraro, Valentina; Cassetti, Tiziana; Meacci, Marisa; Gargiulo, Raffaele; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Mussini, Cristina; Vecchi, Elena; Pecorari, Monica; Gagliotti, Carlo; Trenti, Tommaso; Sarti, Mario",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,174

An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported. Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechanism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia. ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs. Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation. Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms. The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.","D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Baumgart, Daniel C; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,,174

To make more accurate diagnosis on COVID-19 than existing approaches, this paper proposed a novel method combining DenseNet and optimization of transfer learning setting (OTLS) strategy. Preprocessing was used to enhance, crop, and resize the collected chest CT images. Data augmentation method was used to increase the size of training set. A composite learning factor (CLF) was employed which assigned different learning factor to three types of layers: frozen layers, middle layers, and new layers. Meanwhile, the OTLS strategy was proposed. Finally, precomputation method was utilized to reduce RAM storage and accelerate the algorithm. We observed that optimization setting ""201-IV"" can achieve the best performance by proposed OTLS strategy. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy of our proposed method were 96.35 ± 1.07, 96.25 ± 1.16, 96.29 ± 1.11, and 96.30 ± 0.56, respectively.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent abdominal CT for abdominal complaints from March 1 to April 15, 2020, in a large urban multihospital Health System were included. Those with positive abdominal CT findings (n = 14) were then excluded, with 62 patients undergoing final analysis (30M/32F; median age 63 years, interquartile range (IQR) 52-75 years, range 30-90 years). Demographic and clinical data were extracted. CT lung base assessment was performed by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Data were compared between discharged and hospitalised patients using Wilcoxon or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: The majority of the population was non-elderly (56.4%, < 65 years) and most (81%) had underlying health conditions. Nineteen percent were discharged and 81% were hospitalised. The most frequent abdominal symptoms were pain (83.9%) and nausea/vomiting/anorexia (46.8%). Lung base CT findings included ground-glass opacities (95.2%) in a multifocal (95.2%) and peripheral (66.1%) distribution. Elevated laboratory values (when available) included C-reactive protein (CRP) (97.3%), D-dimer (79.4%), and ferritin (68.8% of males and 81.8% of females). Older age (p = 0.045), hypertension (p = 0.019), and lower haemoglobin in women (p = 0.042) were more frequent in hospitalised patients. There was no difference in lung base CT findings between discharged and hospitalised patients (p > 0.165). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients can present with abdominal symptoms, especially in non-elderly patients with underlying health conditions. Lung base findings on abdominal CT are consistent with published reports. Radiologists should be aware of atypical presentations of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ COVID-19 infected patients can present with acute abdominal symptoms, especially in non-elderly patients with underlying health conditions, and may frequently require hospitalisation (81%). â¢ There was no difference in lung base CT findings between patients who were discharged and those who were hospitalised. â¢ Lung base CT findings included multifocal and peripheral ground-glass opacities, consistent with published reports.","King, Michael J; Lewis, Sara; El Homsi, Maria; Hernandez Meza, Gabriela; Bernheim, Adam; Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Taouli, Bachir",Eur Radiol,,174

Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals. MethodsHIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naive to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine). ResultsEleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity. ConclusionHIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population. However, HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts (<250 cells/mm3) have a weaker response. These data would support the hypothesis that a booster dose might be needed in this subgroup of HIV-positive individuals, depending on their response to the second dose.","Nault, Lauriane; Marchitto, Lorie; Goyette, Guillaume; Tremblay-Sher, Daniel; Fortin, Claude; Martel-Laferriere, Valerie; Trottier, Benoit; Richard, Jonathan; Durand, Madeleine; Kaufmann, Daniel E; Finzi, Andres; Tremblay, Cecile",,,174
325484,Reaction Coordinate and Thermodynamics of Base Flipping in RNA,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine the effect of a daily dose of ivermectin administered in three consecutive days to non-severe COVID-19 patients with no more than 96 hours of symptoms, on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs at day seven post-treatment initiation. The secondary objectives are: 1. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab on days 4, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment initiation 2. To assess the efficacy of ivermectin on the improvement of symptoms 3. To assess the proportion of seroconversions at day 21 4. To assess the safety of ivermectin at the proposed dose 5. To determine the magnitude of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 6. To assess correlation of the presence of intestinal helminths on participants on baseline and day 14 with COVID-19 progression and treatment. TRIAL DESIGN: SAINT PERU is a triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in negativizing nasopharyngeal PCR in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PARTICIPANTS: The trial is conducted in two national hospitals in Lima-Peru. The study population is patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal specimen, symptomatic for 96 hours or less, with non-severe COVID-19 disease at baseline, regardless of the presence of risk factors for progression to severity. The study will not include pregnant women or minors (17 years old or younger). Inclusion criteria 1. COVID-19 symptomatology (cough, fever, anosmia, etc.) lasting no more than 96 hours, with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. 2. 18 years or older. 3. No use of ivermectin in the month prior to the visit. 4. No known history of ivermectin allergy. 5. Capable to give informed consent. 6. Not current use of CYP 3A4 or P-gp inhibitor drugs such as quinidine, amiodarone, diltiazem, spironolactone, verapamil, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, indinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat or critical CYP3A4 substrate drugs such as warfarin. Exclusion criteria 1. COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by the attending physician (oxygen saturation < 95% or lung examination) 2. Positive pregnancy test for women at childbearing age. 3. Positive IgG against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid diagnostic test at screening. Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency services of the study sites. They are expected to remain in the trial for a period of 21 days. Follow-up visits will be conducted by the trial medical staff at the participant's home or at a hospital in case of hospitalization. Follow-up visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin (300 mcg/kg) or placebo will be administered in one daily dose for three consecutive days. Currently, there is no solid data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo; therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. Secondary 1. Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) on days 4, 7, 14, and 21 2. Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial 2. Proportion of patients with a positive rapid diagnostic test at day 21 3. Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial 4. Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized to receive one dose of 300 mcg/kg ivermectin or placebo daily for three consecutive days. The epidemiologist will generate a list of correlative numbers, in randomized blocks of size 4, with the assignment to the treatment groups (a and b). The randomization list will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. This list will be handed directly to the pharmacist. Independently, the principal investigator will randomly assign the intervention (ivermectin) to one of the two groups (a or b) by tossing a coin, and will inform the pharmacist of the result of this process. The pharmacist will prepare and label the treatment vials according to the randomization list prepared by the epidemiologist and the treatment assignment given by the principal investigator. Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using this randomization list. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team, the statistician, and the patients will be blinded as to arm allocation. The vials with placebo will be visibly identical to the ones with the active drug. Treatment will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant's follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The planned sample size is 186 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients: 93 patients to treatment and 93 to the placebo group.

Results & methodology: We present the case of a 68-year-old man with COVID-19 who was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and lenzilumab, but continued to develop hypoxemia, requiring an increase in respiratory support with an associated rise in serum inflammatory markers. He was subsequently treated with tocilizumab with marked clinical improvement and a decrease in acute phase reactants within 48 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case demonstrates the effective use of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 and suggests the superiority of tocilizumab over lenzilumab in the management of this cytokine-mediated syndrome.","Melody, Megan; Nelson, Jared; Hastings, Jacquelyn; Propst, Joshua; Smerina, Michael; Mendez, Julio; Guru, Pramod",Immunotherapy,,174

347311,"Selective multiresidue determination of highly polar anionic pesticides in plant-based milk, wine and beer using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry",2020,"Background: As of 23rd February 2020, China had 77,048 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and only 2. 1% of patients were under the age of 19 years. Morbidity among children was much lower, with milder or absent signs and symptoms; chest CT scans showed milder symptoms, if at all, compared to adults. Objective: Report the epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory, radiological characteristics, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Compare additional signs and symptoms, investigate familial clustering, compare laboratory results, and find out relevance between age and typical chest CT scans in patients. Methods: We studied 33 young patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Anhui Province of China by 16th February 2020. Their signs, symptoms, and familial clustering were analyzed. We compared the laboratory test results, age, and gender among three parts based on their chest CT scans. Results: Familial clustering was seen in 30 (30/33; 90.91%) patients; three families had seven confirmed members infected with the disease. Eight (8/33; 24.24%) patients had no symptoms, 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had only fever, nine (9/33; 27.27%) patients had fever and additional symptoms, and 12 (12/33; 36.36%) patients had no fever. Dry cough was the most common additional symptom. In 25 (25/33; 75.76%) patients, the percent of lymphocytes decreased; 26 (26/33; 78.79%) patients were older than 7 years. More male than female patients and patients older than 8 years showed typical abnormalities in the chest CT scans (P = 0.038). Only two 18 years old patients had hepatic injury. Conclusion: Children's infection is mild and familial clustering was the most common channel. The older patients had more typical ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation in chest CT scans. Cases without fever strongly suggested that non-symptomatic children should not be assumed to be free of infection when their family members have confirmed infection. Most children showed clinical features distinguishable from adults and with increased susceptibility within family members.","Zhang, Lan; Huang, Songming",Front. Public Health,,174

364128,The Hendra virus vaccine: perceptions regarding the role of antibody titre testing,2021,"BACKGROUND: As mental illness continues to affect 1 in 5 individuals, and the need for support has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of digital mental health tools remains largely unrealized due to a lack of uptake by patients and providers. Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.","Strudwick, Gillian; McLay, David; Lo, Brian; Shin, Hwayeon Danielle; Currie, Leanne; Thomson, Nicole; Maillet, Éric; Strong, Vanessa; Miller, Alanna; Shen, Nelson; Campbell, Janis",J Med Internet Res,,174
364557,Fermentation and metabolic pathway optimization to de novo synthesize (2S)-naringenin in Escherichia coli,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has incurred significant disease burden worldwide, particularly on the elderly population. This study aims to explore how risks of coronavirus infection interact across age groups using data from South Korea. METHODS: Daily new COVID-19 cases from 10 March to 30 April 2020 were scraped from online open sources. A multivariate vector autoregressive model for time series of count data was used to examine the risk interactions across age groups. Case counts from previous days were included as predictors to dynamically examine the change of risk patterns. RESULTS: In South Korea, the risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people was significantly affected by other age groups. An increase in virus infection among people aged 20-39 was associated with a double risk of infection among elderly people. Meanwhile, an increase in virus infection among elderly people was also significantly associated with risks of infection among other age groups. The risks of infection among younger people were relatively unaffected by that of other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could not only reduce the risk of infection among themselves but also ameliorate the risks of virus infection among other age groups. Such interventions should be effective and for the long term.","Yu, Xinhua",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,174
365609,The role of water in ligand binding,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying safety measures, including confinement, has meant an unprecedented challenge for the world population today. However, it has entailed additional difficulties for specific populations, including children and people with disabilities. Being out of school for months has reduced the learning opportunities for many children, such as those with less academic resources at home or with poorer technological connectivity. For students with disabilities, it has entailed losing the quality of the special attention they often need, in addition to a more limited understanding of the situation. In this context, a case study was conducted in a special education classroom of a secondary education school. This class started implementing Dialogic Literary Gatherings with their special education students before the COVID-19 confinement and continued online during the confinement. Qualitative data was collected after a period of implementation of the gatherings showing positive impacts on the participants. The case study shows that interactive learning environments such as the Dialogic Literary Gatherings can provide quality distance learning for students with disabilities, contributing to overcome some of the barriers that the pandemic context creates for the education of these students.","Álvarez-Guerrero, G.; López de Aguileta, A.; Racionero-Plaza, S.; Flores-Moncada, L.

We modified our protocols and procedures in line with COVID-19 guidelines. Since the restructuring, we have performed 20 LDLTs. Our study reports the outcomes of these cases and demonstrates the feasibility of LDLT during this pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The changes were influenced by experiences and communications from across the globe. A month-long self-imposed moratorium was spent in restructuring the program and implementing new protocols. Twenty LDLTs were performed between April 18 and September 15 using the new protocols. Our experience includes 2 simultaneous liver-kidney transplants, 1 ABO-incompatible LDLT, and 1 pediatric case (age 11 months). RESULTS: Nineteen patients recovered and 1 patient died. We maintained our postoperative immunosuppression protocol without many changes. Major complications were observed in 30% of recipients but none of the donors. One recipient was infected with COVID-19 during the postoperative period. A donor-recipient couple contracted COVID-19 after discharge from the hospital. All patients recovered from COVID-19 and liver enzymes were unaffected. CONCLUSION: This study represents a microcosm of experience in LDLT during the COVID-19 era. Outcomes of LDLT are not affected by COVID-19 per se, provided that we make necessary changes.","Jha, Sandeep K; Jamir, Imtiakum; Sisodia, Kshitij; Kumar, Niteen; Sood, Gaurav; Shanker, Nitin; Anand, Sachin; Dubey, Gaurav; Choudhary, Vinod; Lohia, Pankaj; Singhal, Amit; Wadhawan, Manav; Kumar, Ajay; Chaudhary, Abhideep",Transplant. proc,,174
369191,Control of Listeria monocytogenes Biofilms in a Simulated Food-Processing Environment,2021,"Although urological diseases are not directly related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), urologists need to make comprehensive plans for this disease. Urological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and tumors are very common in elderly patients. This group of patients is often accompanied by underlying comorbidities or immune dysfunction. They are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and they tend to have severe manifestations. Although fever can occur along with urological infections, it is actually one of the commonest symptoms of COVID-19; urologists must always maintain a high index of suspicion in their clinical practices. As a urological surgeon, how we can protect medical staff during surgery is a major concern. Our hospital had early adoption of a series of strict protective and control measures, and was able to avoid cross-infection and outbreak of COVID-19. This paper discusses the effective measures that can be useful when dealing with urological patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Wei; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Fu, Guang-Qing; Zeng, Xiang; Wu, Cui-Ping; Liang, Yong; Liu, Jian-Hui; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",Int Braz J Urol,,174
371504,Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology reveals disease transmission coupled to variant emergence and allelic variation,2021,"An outbreak of rapidly spreading coronavirus established human to human transmission and now became a pandemic across the world. The new confirmed cases of infected individuals of COVID-19 are increasing day by day. Therefore, the prediction of infected individuals has become of utmost important for health care arrangements and to control the spread of COVID-19. In this study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model with intervention strategies such as lockdown, quarantine, and hospitalization. We compute the basic reproduction number (R0), which plays a vital role in mathematical epidemiology. Based on R0, it is revealed that the system has two equilibrium, namely disease-free and endemic. We also demonstrate the non-negativity and boundedness of the solutions, local and global stability of equilibria, transcritical bifurcation to analyze its epidemiological relevance. Furthermore, to validate our system, we fit the cumulative and new daily cases in India. We estimate the model parameters and predict the near future scenario of the disease. The global sensitivity analysis has also been performed to observe the impact of different parameters on R0. We also investigate the dynamics of disease in respect of different situations of lockdown, e.g., complete lockdown, partial lockdown, and no lockdown. Our analysis concludes that if there is partial or no lockdown case, then endemic level would be high. Along with this, the high transmission rate ensures higher level of endemicity. From the short time prediction, we predict that India may face a crucial phase (approx 6000000 infected individuals within 140 days) in near future due to COVID-19. Finally, numerical results show that COVID-19 may be controllable by reducing the contacts and increasing the efficacy of lockdown.","Bugalia, Sarita; Bajiya, Vijay Pal; Tripathi, Jai Prakash; Li, Ming-Tao; Sun, Gui-Quan",Math Biosci Eng,,174

One hundred and thirty-seven coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) samples from 96 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed patients were chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis. Non-SARS-CoV-2 sera (n = 141) with a potential cross-reaction to SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were included in the specificity analysis. None of these tests demonstrated a sufficiently high clinical sensitivity to diagnose acute infection. Fourteen days since symptom onset, we did not find any significant difference between the three techniques in terms of sensitivities. However, Elecsys performed better in terms of specificity. All three anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays had equivalent sensitivities 14 days from symptom onset to diagnose past-COVID-19 infection. We also confirmed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 determination before Day 14 is of less clinical interest.","Favresse, Julien; Cadrobbi, Julie; Eucher, Christine; Elsen, Marc; Laffineur, Kim; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan",J. med. virol,,174

We prospectively collected fecal samples from 50 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, 9 SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients, and 34 uninfected subjects seen by the hospital with unrelated respiratory medical conditions (controls). 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR analysis was performed on fecal DNA/RNA. The fecal microbial composition was found to be significantly different between SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls (PERMANOVA FDR-P = .004), independent of antibiotic exposure. Peptoniphilus, Corynebacterium and Campylobacter were identified as the three most significantly enriched genera in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Actively infected patients were also found to have a different gut microbiota than recovered patients (PERMANOVA FDR-P = .003), and the most enriched genus in infected patients was Campylobacter, with Agathobacter and Faecalibacterium being enriched in the recovered patients. No difference in microbial community structure between recovered patients and uninfected controls was observed, nor a difference in alpha diversity between the three groups. 24 of the 50 COVID-19 patients (48%) tested positive via RT-qPCR for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A significant difference in gut microbial composition between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples was observed, with Klebsiella and Agathobacter being enriched in the positive cohort. No significant associations between microbiome composition and disease severity was found.

In this regard, it is worth mentioning the so-called 'last bed dilemma'. In this paper, we examine this dilemma, pointing out the main criteria used to solve it and argue that we cannot face these ethical issues as though they are only a dilemma. A more complex ethical view regarding the care of COVID-19 patients that is focused on proportional and ordinary treatments is required. Furthermore, discussions and forward planning are essential because deliberation becomes extremely complex during an emergency and the physicians' sense of responsibility may be increased if it is faced only as a moral dilemma.","Valera, Luca; Carrasco, María A; Castro, Ricardo",J. med. ethics,,174
386198,"The COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Our Early Life Environment, Life Trajectory and Socioeconomic Status Determine Disease Susceptibility and Severity?",2020,"Previous studies from our institution have demonstrated the value of pharmacology educational games in promoting recall practice and topic interest necessary for medical students to learn pharmacology. At our institution, pharmacology and other basic science topic games are embedded into curricular activities, in-class, faculty facilitated team competitions, and self-learning modules (SLMs). Little work has been done to assess student perceptions of virtual versus in-class games, despite the fact that developing effective virtual pharmacology learning tools has become essential due to curricular changes adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this pilot study was to survey students on their perceptions and preferences for in-class, faculty facilitated games vs. virtual electronic games. Since we hypothesized that students? perceptions of feedback would differ between in-class and virtual games, we additionally surveyed students on their preferences for enriched auditory vs. simple text feedback within virtual games. Methods An end of module survey was sent to all students in a second-year medical school (M2) systems course (N=110 total, 70% participated) to get a broad class perceptive. A subset of M2's (N=14) volunteered to beta test pharmacology virtual trivia games with feedback that ranged from plain text answers to enriched auditory feedback performed by actors (varied genders, ages, personalities) and feedback from a trusted pharmacology instructor offering coaching and praise similar to classroom feedback. Results Approximately 70% of students reported using the games and answered survey items, with most affirming (reported as % agreeing/strongly agreeing) that virtual and in-class games promoted active learning (80%), integrated basic and clinical concepts (84%), and stimulated thinking (84%). About 60% preferred participating in or watching videos of in-class games with auditory feedback from instructors. Of those with a preference, 50% preferred Trivia while 25% preferred Jeopardy. Of the 14 students beta testing virtual trivia games, most agreed (83%) that the virtual games increased pharmacology interest and promoted active learning, though fewer than 25% preferred enriched auditory feedback from actors over simple written text. A majority (61%) agreed that hearing the voice of a trusted professor was beneficial. Conclusion Most M2 students used game-based methods and highly valued either in-class team or virtual games for promoting topic interest, active learning, and integration. Students valued coaching and auditory feedback from a trusted professor in either classroom or virtual games. However, most students preferred simple text feedback over auditory, unless the feedback voice was the pharmacology instructor's. Thus, virtual pharmacology educational games with simple feedback designs appear to be engaging virtual teaching tools for pharmacology learning in the age of COVID and beyond.","Wilhelm, John Cowan Melissa Gorman Laurel",The FASEB Journal,,174

There is an increasing number of cases described as (meningo)encephalitis although evidence often lacks. Anosmia, another atypical form of COVID-19, has been considered as testimony of the potential of neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, though this hypothesis remains highly speculative. We did a review of the cases reported as brain injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Over 98 papers found, 21 were analyzed. Only four publications provided evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the central nervous system (CNS). When facing acute neurological abnormalities during an infectious episode it is often difficult to disentangle neurological symptoms induced by the brain infection and those due to the impact of host immune response on the CNS. Cytokines release can disturb neural cells functioning and can have in the most severe cases vascular and cytotoxic effects. An inappropriate immune response can lead to the production of auto-antibodies directed toward CNS components. In the case of proven SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion, the main hypothesis found in the literature focus on a neural pathway, especially the direct route via the nasal cavity, although the virus is likely to reach the CNS using other routes. Our ability to come up with hypotheses about the mechanisms by which the virus might interact with the CNS may help to keep in mind that all neurological symptoms observed during COVID-19 do not always rely on CNS viral invasion.","Pouga, Lydia",J Med Virol,,174

DATA SOURCES: Between April and July 2020, articles were selected using the databases: Virtual Health Library, PubMed and Scientific Electronic Library Online. The following descriptors were used: [(pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging) AND (medical overuse)] and [(Coronavirus infections) OR (COVID-19) AND (pediatrics) AND (emergencies) AND (diagnostic imaging)]. Inclusion criteria were articles available in full, in Portuguese or English, published from 2016 to 2020 or from 2019 to 2020, and articles that covered the theme. Articles without adherence to the theme and duplicate texts in the databases were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: 61 publications were identified, of which 17 were comprised in this review. Some imaging tests used in pediatric emergency departments increase the possibility of developing future malignancies in patients, since they emit ionizing radiation. There are clinical decision instruments that allow reducing unnecessary exam requests, avoiding over-medicalization, and hospital expenses. Moreover, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a growing concern about the overuse of imaging exams in the pediatric population, which highlights the problems pointed out by this review. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to improve hospital staff training, use clinical decision instruments and develop guidelines to reduce the number of exams required, allowing hospital cost savings; and reducing children's exposure to ionizing agents.","Floriani, Isabela Dombeck; Borgmann, Ariela Victoria; Barreto, Marina Rachid; Ribeiro, Elaine Rossi",Rev Paul Pediatr,,174

This study aims to assess whether digestive symptoms are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: We will search PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to September, 2020, to identify studies that compared the prevalence of at least one specific digestive symptom between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients or between non-survivors and survivors. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included cohort studies using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses will be conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of individual symptoms using the inverse variance method with the random-effects model. We will conduct subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression analyses to explore the sources of heterogeneity. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to assess the quality of the evidence.

408086,Daylight-Induced Antibacterial and Antiviral Cotton Cloth for Offensive Personal Protection,2020,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as one of the most important reactive oxygen species in the organism, its role is more and more recognized. In fact, in recent years, various HOCl fluorescent probes have been developed unprecedentively based on various mechanisms. However, because most of the mechanisms are based on the oxidation characteristics of HOCl, the excellent detection performance of probes depends on the activation ability of some functional groups to reaction sites. The C = C bond in the probe is often oxidized by HOCl to realize HOCl detection. However, due to the break of conjugated structure, the probe often present as a quenchable or turning on fluorescence emission. In this work, malononitrile was introduced as the ""double-edged sword"" of passivation-activation when in HOCl fluorescent probe was designed. Passivation-activation regulated two ICT (Intermolecular Charge Transfer, ICT) processes to ratiometric fluorescent detection for HOCl. Highly sensitive and accurate detection realized efficient application in biological imaging.","Shi, Yan; Huo, Fangjun; Yin, Caixia",Sens Actuators B Chem,,174

We report the recent spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 spike 501Y variant. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from human nasopharyngeal samples by Illumina next-generation sequencing were analysed using Nextclade and an in-house Python script and were compared using BLASTn to the GISAID database. Phylogeny was investigated using the IQ-TREE software. RESULTS: We identified that SARS-CoV-2 genomes from four patients diagnosed in our institute harboured a new set of amino acid substitutions including L18F, L452R, N501Y, A653V, H655Y, D796Y, G1219V ± Q677H. These spike N501Y genomes are the first of Nextstrain clade 19B. We obtained partial spike gene sequences of this genotype for an additional 43 patients. All patients infected with this genotype were diagnosed since mid-January 2021. We detected 42 other genomes of this genotype in GISAID, which were obtained from samples collected in December 2020 in four individuals and in 2021 in 38 individuals. The 89 sequences obtained in our institute or other laboratories originated from the Comoros archipelago, western European countries (mostly metropolitan France), Turkey and Nigeria. CONCLUSION: These findings warrant further studies to investigate the spread, epidemiological and clinical features, and sensitivity to immune responses of this variant.","Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Delerce, Jeremy; Pinault, Lucile; Dudouet, Pierre; Devaux, Christian; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; La Scola, Bernard; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Raoult, Didier",Clin. microbiol. infect,,174

OBJECTIVE: (1) evaluate the effectiveness and cost of using social media news feed advertisements, clinic-based approach, and web-based snowball sampling to reach inadequately active adults with T1D, and (2) compare characteristics of enrollees against normative data. METHODS: Participants were recruited between November 2019 and August 2020. Method #1: Facebook and Instagram news feed advertisements ran for five 1-8 day windows targeting adults (18-64yr) in the greater New Haven and Hartford, CT areas with &#8805;1 diabetes-related profile interest. If interested, participants completed a webform so that the research team could contact them for eligibility screening. Method #2: In-person approach of patients 18-24yr with T1D at clinical visits November-December 2019. Those interested immediately completed eligibility screening. Older patients could not be approached due to clinic restrictions. Method #3: Snowball sampling by physically active individuals with T1D contacting their peers on Facebook and emails for 48 days with details to contact the research staff to express interest and complete eligibility screening. Other methods referred participants similarly to snowball sampling. RESULTS: Method #1: Advertisements were displayed to 11,738 unique viewers and attracted 274 clickers (2.33%), of whom 20 (7.3%) volunteered, of whom 8 (40%) were eligible. Costs averaged US $1.20 per click and US $95.88 per eligible volunteer. Men had lower click rates than women (1.71% vs 3.17%, P < .001) but their responsiveness and eligibility rates did not differ. Method #2: We approached 40 patients of whom 32 (80%) inquired about the study, of whom 20 (63%) volunteered, of whom 2 (10%) were eligible. Costs including personnel for in-person approaches averaged US $21.01 per inquirer and US $479.79 per eligible volunteer. Method #3: Snowball sampling generated 13 inquirers, of whom 12 (92%) volunteered, of whom 8 (67%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible and total costs averaged $20.59 per eligible volunteer. Other methods yielded 7 inquirers, of whom 5 (71%) volunteered, of whom 2 (40%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible and total costs averaged $34.94 per eligible volunteer. Demographic overrepresentations emerged in the overall cohort (optimal glycemic control, obesity, low exercise), those recruited by news feed (obesity, older age), and snowball sampling (optimal glycemic control, low exercise). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based advertising and recruitment strategies are a promising means to attract adults with T1D to clinical trials and exercise interventions, costs comparing favorably to prior trials despite targeting an uncommon condition (i.e., T1D) and commitment to an intervention. They should be tailored in future studies to increase access to higher-risk participants.","Ash, Garrett I; Griggs, Stephanie; Nally, Laura M; Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew; Jeon, Sangchoon; Brandt, Cynthia; Gulanski, Barbara I; Spanakis, Elias K; Baker, Julien S; Whittemore, Robin; Weinzimer, Stuart A; Fucito, Lisa M",,,174

Here we provide a synthesis of the techniques and associated findings in relation to COVID-19 and its geographic, environmental, and socio-demographic characteristics, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) methodology for scoping reviews. We searched PubMed for relevant articles and discussed the results separately for three categories: disease mapping, exposure mapping, and spatial epidemiological modeling. The majority of studies were ecological in nature and primarily carried out in China, Brazil, and the USA. The most common spatial methods used were clustering, hotspot analysis, space-time scan statistic, and regression modeling. Researchers used a wide range of spatial and statistical software to apply spatial analysis for the purpose of disease mapping, exposure mapping, and epidemiological modeling. Factors limiting the use of these spatial techniques were the unavailability and bias of COVID-19 data-along with scarcity of fine-scaled demographic, environmental, and socio-economic data-which restrained most of the researchers from exploring causal relationships of potential influencing factors of COVID-19. Our review identified geospatial analysis in COVID-19 research and highlighted current trends and research gaps. Since most of the studies found centered on Asia and the Americas, there is a need for more comparable spatial studies using geographically fine-scaled data in other areas of the world.","Fatima, Munazza; O039,; Keefe, Kara J; Wei, Wenjia; Arshad, Sana; Gruebner, Oliver",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,174

457846,"Intracellular autoactivation of TMPRSS11A, an airway epithelial transmembrane serine protease",2020,"To provide instructive clues for clinical practice and further research of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we analyzed the existing literature on viral neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain parenchyma in quite a few patients, which provide undeniable evidence for the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus. In contrast with the cerebrum and cerebellum, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the olfactory system and the brainstem, both of which also showed severe microgliosis and lymphocytic infiltrations. As compared with the number of patients who underwent viral testing in the central nervous system (CNS), the number of patients showing positive results seems very small. However, it seems too early to conclude that the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is rare in COVID-19 patients because the detection methods or sampling procedures in some studies may not be suitable or sufficient to reveal the CNS infection induced by neurotropic viruses. Moreover, the primary symptoms and/or causes of death were distinctly different among examined patients, which probably caused more conspicuous pathological changes than those due to the direct infection that usually localized to specific brain areas. Unfortunately, most autopsy studies did not provide sufficient details about neurological symptoms or suspected diagnoses of the examined patients, and the documentation of neuropathological changes was often incomplete. Given the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the characteristics of neurotropic viruses, it is understandable that any study of the CNS infection may inevitably have limitations.","Li, Yan-Chao; Zhang, Yan; Tan, Bai-Hong",J. med. virol,,174
460594,Biopolymer-Based Filtration Materials,2021,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) is a coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with mild to severe respiratory illness. It is a highly contagious disease transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are being investigated. OBJECTIVE: It is known that coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause a variety of ocular pathologies in animals, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis, many of which are severe. However, there is no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the eye tissue of asymptomatic patients, even if the symptomatic incidence is low. This systematic review presents updated literature on this issue. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: COVID-19 has now spread throughout the continents and poses a global threat to public health. The risk of rapidly overloading health care systems and causing substantial mortality worldwide is real. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced coronavirus as a global pandemic. Several studies described a few cases with initial ocular symptoms followed by systemic symptoms of the disease. SUMMARY: Although the frequency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the eye is low, ocular symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19. In some cases, eye symptoms may be the first signs of illness. This implies the need for hygienic recommendations and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff and other services to minimize COVID-19 infection of both health-care workers and patients. A triage for ophthalmic outpatient clinic is mandatory.","Latalska, Malgorzata; Mackiewicz, Jerzy",Ann Agric Environ Med,,174
462683,A molecular pore spans the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle,2020,"BACKGROUND: Numerous barrier devices have recently been developed and rapidly deployed worldwide in an effort to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from exposure to COVID-19 during high-risk procedures. However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data was captured by high-speed flash photography and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS: Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed towards the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled towards the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the healthcare worker located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSION: Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution and further validation studies are necessary.","Fried, Eric A; Zhou, George; Shah, Ronak; Shin, Da Wi; Shah, Anjan; Katz, Daniel; Burnett, Garrett W",,,174

Through the use of telephone and video technology, virtual clinics were rapidly introduced to reduce hospital footfall. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed patient experiences in virtual and traditional face-to-face clinics through the month of April 2020, from the second week of the government-imposed lockdown. A 5-point Visit-Specific Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to subsequently collect patients' feedback regarding their appointments. RESULTS: A total of 107 hand injury-related follow-up appointments were recorded during the 4-week period. Sixty (56.0%) appointments were performed as a virtual consultation, and 47 (43.9%) face-to-face consultations were carried out on site. It was possible to discharge 43.3% from the virtual clinic group and 57.4% from the face-to-face group. We identified no significant difference in patient satisfaction (P = .368, Mann-Whitney U test) between the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSION: Virtual clinics appear to be safe and effective for the follow-up of patients with traumatic hand injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach may prove beneficial in terms of workforce organization, reducing waiting times, and providing an alternative for patients unable to attend physical appointments.","Popova, Dardan; Young, Kieron; Hobday, Dorian; Welman, Ted; Pahal, Gurjinderpal S",Hand (N Y),,174

487891,Protein Corona on Gold Nanoparticles Studied with Coarse-Grained Simulations,2020,"Moroccan employers have a strong responsibility for the safety and health of their employees in the workplace and for protecting them from the risk of COVID-19 and any occupational hazards, as required by Moroccan law. As a consequence, industries, including the agri-food sector, have put in place preventive measures to deal with this pandemic on several fronts, including the use of hydroalcoholic products and bleach for personal and surface disinfection. These disinfection actions may eliminate or reduce the risk of coronavirus infection, but the increased use of these products by employees could lead to serious health problems and increase the occupational chemical risk in the event of uncontrolled exposure. In order to analyze this risk in the dairy industry in Morocco, we have launched a qualitative and quantitative study to identify and assess the severity of chemical risk to which its employees are exposed. This involves an analysis of the safety data sheets [MSDS] of the disinfectants used and a health and safety survey of the users of these products, particularly for hand disinfection. This analysis showed that this chemical risk is omnipresent and prevention measures are partially adopted. Indeed, the strengthening of health safety measures to combat COVID-19 has significantly increased this risk, resulting in a remarkable imbalance in the assessment and management of occupational risks in this industry. These results have led us to propose corrective and preventive measures against this risk to interested parties and to adopt an integrated management of food and occupational health risks in a single system. This is the use of the Risk Analysis-Critical Control Points (HACCP)-Tool for a First Risk Assessment by Activity Analysis (OPERA) approach, which we developed and proposed in a previous study, for a simplified management of chemical risk in the food industry, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises.","Rachidi, Hafida; Hamdaoui, Samir; Merimi, Imane; Bengourram, Jamae; Latrache, Hassan",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

With the help of Caputo fractional derivative, We capture the epidemiological system for the transmission of Novel Coronavirus-19 Infectious Disease (nCOVID-19). We constructed the model in four compartments susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered. We obtained the conditions for existence and Ulam's type stability for proposed system by using the tools of non-linear analysis. The author's thoroughly discussed the local and global asymptotical stabilities of underling model upon the disease free, endemic equilibrium and reproductive number. We used the techniques of Laplace Adomian decomposition method for the approximate solution of consider system. Furthermore, author's interpret the dynamics of proposed system graphically via Mathematica, from which we observed that disease can be either controlled to a large extent or eliminate, if transmission rate is reduced and increase the rate of treatment.","Ali, Amjad; Khan, Muhammad Yasin; Sinan, Muhammad; Allehiany, F M; Mahmoud, Emad E; Abdel-Aty, Abdel-Haleem; Ali, Gohar",Results Phys,,174

METHODS: A study was conducted using online survey from May 2nd to 14th, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic information, anxiety (18 questions), and general health (GH) (GHQ-28). Scoring system was based on Likert scale. The questionnaire was registered at Porsline website. Data were analyzed using t test and Pearson's correlation coefficient statistical tests. RESULTS: A total of 320 dentists from all over the country fully completed questionnaires. 42.5% of dentist had corona-associated anxiety and 32.5% out of them had mild severity and no severe anxiety was observed. 62.5% of dentists were nonpsychiatric according to GHQ-28, 35% had mild disorders in GH, and no one had severe GH disorders. There were significant relationships between gender, marital status, and family history of psychiatric disorders with GH status. There was a significant relationship between history of physical illness with corona-associated anxiety. There was a significant relationship between history of psychiatric disorders with corona-associated anxiety and GH status. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of corona-associated anxiety and mental disorders in dentists was moderate; by holding psychological workshops to maintain and strengthen the morale of dentists during the corona pandemic, along with teaching them the correct way to use personal protective equipment, while maintaining the mental health of dentists, we will help them return to work and provide dental services.","Salehiniya, Hamid; Abbaszadeh, Hamid",Neuropsychopharmacol. rep,,174
515523,Distribution of graph-distances in Boltzmann ensembles of RNA secondary structures,2013-07-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic has currently overtaken every other health issue throughout the world. There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues. Here we reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB), which still ranks as the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease globally. There may be grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped. TB control programmes will be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus, such that some activities cannot or will not be prioritised. This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes. Further, TB patients often have underlying co-morbidities and lung damage that may make them prone to more severe COVID-19. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the ""collateral damage"". There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TB-HIV, and this will require unpicking. Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.","Togun, Toyin; Kampmann, Beate; Stoker, Neil Graham; Lipman, Marc",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,174

590186,Giant Reverse Transcriptase-Encoding Transposable Elements at Telomeres,2017-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were shown to harbor therapeutic potential in models of respiratory diseases, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the most common sequel of preterm birth. In these studies, cells or animals were challenged with hyperoxia or other injury-inducing agents. However, little is known about the effect of MSCs on immature fetal lungs and whether MSCs are able to improve lung maturity, which may alleviate lung developmental arrest in BPD. METHODS: We aimed to determine if the conditioned medium (CM) of MSCs stimulates functional and structural lung maturation. As a measure of functional maturation, Na(+) transport in primary fetal distal lung epithelial cells (FDLE) was studied in Ussing chambers. Na(+) transporter and surfactant protein mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Structural maturation was assessed by microscopy in fetal rat lung explants. RESULTS: MSC-CM strongly increased the activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and the Na,K-ATPase as well as their mRNA expression. Branching and growth of fetal lung explants and surfactant protein mRNA expression were enhanced by MSC-CM. Epithelial integrity and metabolic activity of FDLE cells were not influenced by MSC-CM. Since MSC’s actions are mainly attributed to paracrine signaling, prominent lung growth factors were blocked. None of the tested growth factors (VEGF, BMP, PDGF, EGF, TGF-β, FGF, HGF) contributed to the MSC-induced increase of Na(+) transport. In contrast, inhibition of PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling reduced MSC-CM efficacy, suggesting an involvement of these pathways in the MSC-CM-induced Na(+) transport. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that MSC-CM strongly stimulated functional and structural maturation of the fetal lungs. These effects were at least partially mediated by the PI3-K/AKT and Rac1 signaling pathway. Thus, MSCs not only repair a deleterious tissue environment, but also target lung cellular immaturity itself.","Obendorf, Janine; Fabian, Claire; Thome, Ulrich H.; Laube, Mandy",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-02028-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298180/,174

Fusion of the HCV envelope proteins is triggered by low pH within the endosome. Lysosomotropic agents (LA) such as Chloroquine and Ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) are the weak bases and penetrate in lysosome as protonated form and increase the intracellular pH. To investigate the antiviral effect of LA (Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl) on pH dependent endocytosis, HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) of 1a and 3a genotype were produced and used to infect liver cells. The toxicological effects of Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl were tested in liver cells through MTT cell proliferation assay. For antiviral screening of Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl, liver cells were infected with HCVpp of 3a and 1a genotype in the presence or absence of different concentrations of Chloroquine and NH4Cl and there luciferase activity was determined by using a luminometer. The results demonstrated that Chloroquine and NH(4)Cl showed more than 50% reduction of virus infectivity at 50 μM and 10 mM concentrations respectively. These results suggest that inhibition of HCV at fusion step by increasing the lysosomal pH will be better option to treat chronic HCV.","Ashfaq, Usman A; Javed, Tariq; Rehman, Sidra; Nawaz, Zafar; Riazuddin, Sheikh",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21481279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-163,174

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients died of COVID‐19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: Most of the young deceased COVID‐19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by the higher severity of Patchy shadows (100.00% vs. 48.70%, P = 0.006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs. 12.80%, P = 0.012), mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs. 0.00%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher BMI (OR = 1.354, 95% CI = 1.075‐1.704, P = 0.010), inflammatory‐related index CRP (OR = 1.014, 95% CI = 1.003‐1.025, P = 0.014), cardiac injury biomarker hs‐cTnI (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.112‐1.814, P = 0.005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D‐Dimer (OR = 418.7, P = 0.047), as compared to that of survivors.

Despite their limited genome size, arterivirus particles contain a multitude of membrane proteins, the Gp5/M and the Gp2/3/4 complex, the small and hydrophobic E protein and the ORF5a protein. Their function during virus entry and budding is understood only incompletely. We summarize current knowledge of their primary structure, membrane topology, (co-translational) processing and intracellular targeting to membranes of the exocytic pathway, which are the budding site. We profoundly describe experimental data that led to widely believed conceptions about the function of these proteins and also report new results about processing steps for each glycoprotein. Further, we depict the location and characteristics of epitopes in the membrane proteins since the late appearance of neutralizing antibodies may lead to persistence, a characteristic hallmark of arterivirus infection. Some molecular features of the arteriviral proteins are rare or even unique from a cell biological point of view, particularly the prevention of signal peptide cleavage by co-translational glycosylation, discovered in EAV-Gp3, and the efficient use of overlapping sequons for glycosylation. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of these cellular processes. Based on this, we present hypotheses on the structure and variability of arteriviral membrane proteins and their role during virus entry and budding.","Veit, Michael; Matczuk, Anna Karolina; Sinhadri, Balaji Chandrasekhar; Krause, Eberhard; Thaa, Bastian",Virus Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278143/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.010,174

However, transfection into fish sperm cells still needs to be improved. The objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of tip type electroporation in zebrafish sperm, showing a protocol that provide high transfection efficiency, with minimal side-effects. Sperm was transfected with a Cy3-labelled DNA using tip type electroporation with voltages ranging from 500 to 1500 V. Sperm kinetics parameters were assessed using Computer Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) and cell integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial functionality and transfection rate were evaluated by flow cytometry. The transfection rates were positively affected by tip type electroporation, reaching 64.9% ± 3.6 in the lowest voltage used (500 V) and 86.6% ± 1.9 in the highest (1500 V). The percentage of overall motile sperm in the electrotransfected samples was found to decrease with increasing field strength (P < 0.05). Increase in the sperm damaged plasma membrane was observed with increasing field strength (P < 0.05). ROS and sperm mitochondrial functionality did not present a negative response after the electroporation (P > 0.05). Overall results indicate that tip type electroporation enhances the internalization of exogenous DNA into zebrafish sperm cells with minimal harmful effects to sperm cells.

A high number of thrombotic episodes are reported, along with the mortality benefits of heparin. COVID-19 can be viewed as a prothrombotic disease. We overviewed the available evidence to explore this possibility. We identified various histopathology reports and clinical case series reporting thromboses in COVID-19. Also, multiple coagulation markers support this. COVID-19 can be regarded as a risk factor for thrombosis. Applying the principles of Virchow’s triad, we described abnormalities in the vascular endothelium, altered blood flow, and platelet function abnormalities that lead to venous and arterial thromboses in COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the release of procoagulant plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and hyperimmune response with activated platelets seem to be significant contributors to thrombogenesis in COVID-19. Stratifying risk of COVID-19 thromboses should be based on age, presence of comorbidities, D-dimer, CT scoring, and various blood cell ratios. Isolated heparin therapy may not be sufficient to combat thrombosis in this disease. There is an urgent need to explore newer avenues like activated protein C, PAI-1 antagonists, and tissue plasminogen activators (tPA). These should be augmented with therapies targeting RAAS, antiplatelet drugs, repurposed antiinflammatory, and antirheumatic drugs.","Ahmed, Sakir; Zimba, Olena; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri",Clin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32654082/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05275-1,174

Studies have shown that deaths occur due to a dysregulated immune system that overreacts, producing a plethora of cytokines, leading to the so-called “cytokine storm” phenomenon. In this direction, many drugs that are used in the everyday practice of Rheumatologists have been used. Indeed, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as the IL-1 and IL-6 have been shown to be the pivotal cytokines expressed, and anti-cytokine treatment has been tried so far with various results. In addition, hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has been shown to reduce COVID-19 symptoms. Other drugs have also been used, such as intravenous pulses of immunoglobulins, and colchicine. Robust clinical trials are needed in order to find the suitable treatment. Current data indicate that hydroxychloroquine and cytokine targeting therapies may prove helpful in the fight of SARS-CoV-2 in appropriately selected patients.","Pelechas, Eleftherios; Drossou, Vassiliki; Voulgari, Paraskevi V.; Drosos, Alexandros A.",Mediterr J Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196003/; https://doi.org/10.31138/mjr.31.3.259,174

595713,Programmable nano-reactors for stochastic sensing,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Australia’s mental health care system has long been fragmented and under-resourced, with services falling well short of demand. In response, the World Economic Forum has recently called for the rapid deployment of smarter, digitally enhanced health services to facilitate effective care coordination and address issues of demand. The University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre (BMC) has developed an innovative digital health solution that incorporates 2 components: a highly personalized and measurement-based (data-driven) model of youth mental health care and a health information technology (HIT) registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Importantly, research into implementation of such solutions considers education and training of clinicians to be essential to adoption and optimization of use in standard clinical practice. The BMC’s Youth Mental Health and Technology Program has subsequently developed a comprehensive education and training program to accompany implementation of the digital health solution. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for an evaluation study to assess the effectiveness of the education and training program on the adoption and optimization of use of the digital health solution in service delivery. It also describes the proposed tools to assess the impact of training on knowledge and skills of mental health clinicians. METHODS: The evaluation study will use the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model as a framework with 4 levels of analysis: Reaction (to education and training), Learning (knowledge acquired), Behavior (practice change), and Results (client outcomes). Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using a variety of tools, including evaluation forms, pre- and postknowledge questionnaires, skill development and behavior change scales, as well as a real-time clinical practice audit. RESULTS: This project is funded by philanthropic funding from Future Generation Global. Ethics approval has been granted via Sydney Local Health District’s Human Research Ethics Committee. At the time of this publication, clinicians and their services were being recruited to this study. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The education and training program teaches clinicians the necessary knowledge and skills to assess, monitor, and manage complex needs; mood and psychotic syndromes; and trajectories of youth mental ill-health using a HIT that facilitates a highly personalized and measurement-based model of care. The digital health solution may therefore guide clinicians to help young people recover low functioning associated with subthreshold diagnostic presentations and prevent progression to more serious mental ill-health.

Methods and Materials: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from 1 April to 1 May 2020. Clinical, microbiological and therapeutic characteristics, clinicopathological patterns of skin lesions, and direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical findings in skin biopsies were analyzed. Results: Fifty-eight out of the 2761 patients (2.1%) either consulting to the emergency room or admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 suspicion during the study period presented COVID-19 related skin lesions. Cutaneous lesions could be categorized into six patterns represented by the acronym “GROUCH”: Generalized maculo-papular (20.7%), Grover’s disease and other papulo-vesicular eruptions (13.8%), livedo Reticularis (6.9%), Other eruptions (22.4%), Urticarial (6.9%), and CHilblain-like (29.3%). Skin biopsies were performed in 72.4%, including direct immunofluorescence in 71.4% and immunohistochemistry in 28.6%. Patients with chilblain-like lesions exhibited a characteristic histology and were significantly younger and presented lower rates of systemic symptoms, radiological lung infiltrates and analytical abnormalities, and hospital and ICU admission compared to the rest of patients. Conclusion: Cutaneous lesions in patients with COVID-19 appear to be relatively rare and varied. Patients with chilblain-like lesions have a characteristic clinicopathological pattern and a less severe presentation of COVID-19.","Giavedoni, Priscila; Podlipnik, Sebastián; Pericàs, Juan M.; Fuertes de Vega, Irene; García-Herrera, Adriana; Alós, Llúcia; Carrera, Cristina; Andreu-Febrer, Cristina; Sanz-Beltran, Judit; Riquelme-Mc Loughlin, Constanza; Riera-Monroig, Josep; Combalia, Andrea; Bosch-Amate, Xavier; Morgado-Carrasco, Daniel; Pigem, Ramon; Toll-Abelló, Agustí; Martí-Martí, Ignasi; Rizo-Potau, Daniel; Serra-García, Laura; Alamon-Reig, Francesc; Iranzo, Pilar; Almuedo-Riera, Alex; Muñoz, Jose; Puig, Susana; Mascaró, José M.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053817/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103261,174

598234,The transfer of serum IgG1 antibody into the gastrointestinal tract in newborn calves,1987-12-31,"Background: Excess winter mortality (EWM) has been attributed to both seasonal cold exposure, and to infectious disease. In 2020, New Zealand's border management and lockdown measures successfully eliminated community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and also largely eliminated influenza and many other respiratory viruses. This study investigates the contribution of infections and temperature to EWM and typical extended winter (May to October) deaths in this natural experiment created by New Zealand's COVID-19 pandemic response. Methods: We used age-standardised weekly deaths to measure EWM 2011 to 2019, then used historical patterns to estimate high, medium and low scenario 2020 EWMs. We then modelled typical year and 2020 heating degree day: mortality relationships to estimate relative contributions of cold temperature and infection to typical extended winter deaths. Results: EWM 2011 to 2019 averaged 14.7% (low 11.4%, high 20.9%). In contrast, 2020 EWM was estimated at 1.6%, 2.7%, or 3.8% under high, medium, and low spring-summer mortality scenarios. Between 2011 and 2019, temperature was estimated to explain 47% of extended winter deaths, and infection 27%, with the remaining 26% attributable to the interaction between infection and temperature. Discussion: The society-wide response to COVID-19 in 2020 resulted in a major reduction of winter mortality in this high-income nation with a temperate climate. In addition to influenza, other respiratory pathogens likely also make a significant contribution to EWM. Low cost protection measures such as mask wearing (eg, in residential care facilities), discouragement of sick presenteeism, and increased influenza vaccine coverage, all have potential to reduce future winter mortality.","Telfar-Barnard, L.; Baker, M.

600527,How Far Are Non-Viral Vectors to Come of Age and Reach Clinical Translation in Gene Therapy?,2021-07-14,"For the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been increasing rapidly. Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells- (WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients' lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. There are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. This study provides an Internet of Medical Things- (IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. The system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19. The methods used for the identification of leukemia subtypes in the suggested framework are Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet-121) and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-34). Two publicly available datasets for leukemia, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, are used in this study. The results demonstrated that the suggested models supersede the other well-known machine learning algorithms used for healthy-versus-leukemia-subtypes identification.","Bibi, Nighat; Sikandar, Misba; Ud Din, Ikram; Almogren, Ahmad; Ali, Sikandar",J Healthc Eng,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6648574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343851/,174

The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical characteristics of the initial wave of patients with COVID-19 attended in our center, and to identify the key variables predicting the development of respiratory failure. Prospective design study with concurrent data retrieval from automated medical records of all hospitalized adult patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rRT-PCR assay performed on respiratory samples from March 2nd to 18th, 2020. Patients were followed up to May 1st, 2020 or death. Respiratory failure was defined as a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio ≤ 200 mm Hg or the need for mechanical ventilation (either non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation). We included 521 patients of whom 416 (81%) had abnormal Chest X-ray on admission. Median age was 64.6 ± 18.2 years. One hundred eighty-one (34.7%) developed respiratory failure after a median time from onset of symptoms of 9 days (IQR 6–11). In-hospital mortality was 23.8% (124/521). The modeling process concluded into a logistic regression multivariable analysis and a predictive score at admission. Age, peripheral pulse oximetry, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein were the selected variables. The model has a good discriminative capacity with an area under the ROC curve of 0.85 (0.82–0.88). The application of a simple and reliable score at admission seems to be a useful tool to predict respiratory failure in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Early identification of risk factors in exposed individuals will help to develop interventions that may eliminate and/or reduce these risks and prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases. So, it is necessary to investigate the risk of impaired cardiovascular function in university students due to the increase in some risk factors and cardiovascular events in young adults, and to describe its epidemiology among international university students. For this, an observational cross-sectional study through interviews is designed. The clinical validity was addressed following the Fehring model. In addition, anthropometric data and results of laboratory tests were collected. The nursing diagnosis “Risk of impaired cardiovascular function” showed clinical validity, high sensitivity and specificity, as well as predictive values. Fehring ratio values were above 0.79 and Kappa Index above 0.72. The study showed a high frequency of this nursing diagnosis among university students, especially in students of Brazilian nationality. The main risks of impaired cardiovascular function found in 86.8% of students were: family history of cardiovascular disease, sedentary lifestyle, pharmacological agent, dyslipidemia, and insufficient knowledge. The most prevalent risk factors of the nursing diagnosis in the studied population were related to insufficient knowledge of modifiable health habits, such as sedentary lifestyle. The information provided is expected to serve as the basis for the planning and implementation of health actions aimed at reducing modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.","Duarte-Clíments, Gonzalo; Mauricio, Tibelle Freitas; Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Moreira, Rafaella Pessoa; Romero-Martín, Macarena; Sánchez-Gómez, María Begoña",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33477383/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9010091,174

The purpose of our study was to describe and evaluate a Patient Engagement Messaging campaign (PEM campaign) promoting health care seeking behaviors among community and rural clinic patients in North Carolina. Text and voice messages were delivered over 3-weeks. Messages encouraged patients to call a regional operation call center (ROC) line for information related to health care appointments and testing. A cross-sectional evaluation was conducted on the total population (n = 48,063) and a sample without recent health care contact (n = 29,214). Among the sample, logistic regression was used to model determinants of calls to the ROC-line and associations between calling the ROC-line and health care seeking behaviors (scheduling any health care appointment or receiving a COVID-19 test). 69.9% of text messages and 89% of voice messages were delivered. Overall, 95.4% of the total population received at least 1 message. Successful delivery was lower among Black patients and higher among patients with moderate health-risk comorbidities. Among the sample, 7.4% called the ROC-line, with higher odds of calling among minority patients (vs. White) and among Medicaid and uninsured (vs. private insurance). Calling the ROC-line was associated with higher odds of scheduling any health care appointment (OR: 4.14; 95% CI 2.93–5.80) and receiving a COVID-19 test (OR: 2.39; 95% CI 1.64–3.39).

603343,On an enhancement of RNA probing data using information theory,2020-08-07,"INTRODUCTION: Discovering the source of a patient’s fever, in the absence of clinical localizing signs, can be a formidable undertaking. Without a clear symptom pattern to narrow the focus of a diagnostic workup, this task can require numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures, imaging studies, and laboratory tests to arrive at a conclusion. Identifying the source of a patient’s fever in the setting of an acute spinal cord injury can present a unique challenge because this population is at risk for many different conditions that can cause fever, some of which are rarely seen in the general population. CASE PRESENTATION: This case report describes a unique case and diagnostic workup of fever of unknown origin in a 51-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities who presented to an inpatient rehabilitation service following an acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury. Ultimately, it was determined that the patient had several different factors that were causing him to have intermittent fevers over a 5-week period. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates the importance of obtaining serial medical histories and physical examinations during the investigation for fever of unknown origin. It also supports why additional workup of a patient’s fever may need to be considered even after a potential source is found. Finally, it demonstrates the need for increased awareness of quadriplegic fever so that this condition can be more effectively recognized, prevented, and managed in the future.","Connolly, Brian R.; Harden, Jeannie K.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712553/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-021-00385-7,174

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients. METHODS. We systematically reviewed all the studies about thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MedRxiv, bioRxiv, from Dec 1, 2019 to July 5, 2020. The weighted mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for clinical data in COVID-19 patients with or without thrombotic events was calculated. RESULTS: 12 articles contained 1083 patients were included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of thrombosis was 22 % (95 % CI 0.08–0.40) in COVID-19 patients and increased to 43 % (95 % CI 0.29–0.65) after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with non-thrombotic patients, thrombotic patients had higher levels of D-dimer (MD = 2.79 μg/ml, 95 % CI 2.27–3.31 μg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (MD = 112.71 U/L, 95 % CI 62.40–163.02 U/L), and white blood cells (WBC) (MD = 1.14 *10(9)/L, 95 % CI 0.47–1.81*10(9)/L) while decreased lymphocytes (MD= -0.20*10(9)/L, 95 % CI -0.38 – -0.02*10(9)/L). Age, platelet counts, and male sex tended to be risks while diabetes tended to be a protection for thrombosis for COVID-19 patients, although no statistical difference was achieved. Finally, patients with thrombosis were at a higher risk of death (OR = 2.39, 95 % CI 1.36–4.20). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients was high, especially in ICU, though pharmacologic thromboembolism prophylaxis was applied. Therefore, higher levels of D-dimer, LDH, WBC, and decreased lymphocytes needed to be paid close attention to in patients with COVID-19.","Xiong, Xiaoming; Chi, Jianhua; Gao, Qinglei",Thromb J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12959-021-00284-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011381/,174

Patients and methods A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. Results A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 and 425.0 cases per 100000 infants <12 months old, with 2 peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (p <.05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. Conclusions The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.","Iglesias, Laura; Casabella Pernas, Antonio; Hernández Febles, Melisa; Colino Gil, Elena; Eisman Maraver, Alicia; Pena López, María José",Anales de Pediatría (English Edition),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287918301364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2341287918301364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337323/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2017.10.007,174

Data are urgently needed to select assays with optimal sensitivity at acceptable specificity for antibody detection. METHODS: A comparative evaluation was performed of 7 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with polymerase chain reaction–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (71 hospitalized patients and 64 paucisymptomatic individuals). Kinetics of IgA/IgM/IgG seroconversion to viral N and S protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after onset of symptoms. Cross-reactivity was verified on 57 prepandemic samples. RESULTS: Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test showed superior overall sensitivity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG/IgA showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) vs the consensus result of all assays from 10 days post onset of symptoms. Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test showed least cross-reactivity, resulting in an optimal analytical specificity greater than 98%.

606610,There is nothing permanent except change. The emergence of new virus diseases,1995-02-28,"Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% [CrI: 12.3%-14.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% [CrI: 0.1%-0.3%] in Hawaii to 2.8% [CrI: 1.8%-4.1%] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% [CrI: 1.2%-2.0%] in Vermont to 23% [CrI: 20%-28%] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chiu, Weihsueh A.; Ndeffo-Mbah, Martial L.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34491990/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009374,174

Vaccines must be evaluated and approved by the appropriate regulatory and/or health authorities. To date, the worldwide regulatory landscape for vaccines is very broad. Bringing COVID‐19 vaccines to the market, the authorities followed at least 51 different pathways, offering various types of accelerated vaccine approval. (1) China, Russia and the United Arab Emirates initiated the vaccine administration before the conclusion of clinical trials. This patchwork of approval processes has revived a long‐standing question, how to better facilitate harmonization in vaccine regulation and whether a harmonized approval process would make the vaccine development procedures more effective, quicker, broadly accessible and administered by the whole world and even less expensive. In this issue, experts from the Paul‐Ehrlich Institute, the regulatory institution for vaccine development in Germany, describe the regulatory procedures, concepts and requirements that are applied to guide and promote the accelerated development and licensure of safe and efficacious COVID‐19 vaccines in Europe.(2)","Klimek, Ludger; Agache, Ioana; Cooke, Emer; Jutel, Marek; Akdis, Cezmi A.; O'Hehir, Robyn",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191300/,174

Alterations in the inflammatory cytokines pathway represent a strong signature during SARS-COV-2 infection and correlate with poor prognosis and severity of the illness. The hyper-activation of the immune system results in an acute severe systemic inflammatory response named cytokine release syndrome (CRS). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure treatments are available, although some anti-inflammatory compounds are currently in clinical trials. Studies of plant extracts and natural compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation. The aim of this manuscript is to review the published background on the possible effectiveness of polyphenols to fight SARS-COV-2 infection, contributing to the reduction of inflammation. Here, some of the anti-inflammatory therapies are discussed and although great progress has been made though this year, there is no proven cytokine blocking agents for COVID currently used in clinical practice. In this regard, bioactive phytochemicals such as polyphenols may become promising tools to be used as adjuvants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such nutrients, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, associated to classical anti-inflammatory drugs, could help in reducing the inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Gerardi, Carmela; Uberti-Foppa, Caterina; Lopalco, Lucia",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322757/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25245888,174

Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 34 countries with 2,445 deaths and 78,811 confirmed cases. Currently, there is no vaccine available against COVID-19. The traditional vaccines development requires more time and high cost and due to this, the disease outbreaks becomes more challenging. Now a days, plants have become more attractive platform for edible vaccine production than the other system. The development of an edible vaccine in a selected plant system has many significant advantages such as; easy and efficient oral delivery, low cost with higher scale production, avoidance of any trained medical personnel for delivery, lack of any pathogenic infection, multicomponent expression in a single plant, and so forth. In this manuscript, the concept, development, and importance of an edible vaccine have been discussed. By using this plant-based platform, an edible vaccines can be produced in many crops like banana, cucumber, carrot, lettuce, and tomato against various diseases.

608380,Rapid detection of viral antibodies based on multifunctional Staphylococcus aureus nanobioprobes,2016-09-20,"A central problem in the COVID-19 pandemic is that there is not enough testing to prevent infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2, causing surges and lockdowns with human and economic toll. Molecular tests that detect viral RNAs or antigens will be unable to rise to this challenge unless testing capacity increases by at least an order of magnitude while decreasing turnaround times. Here, we evaluate an alternative strategy based on the monitoring of olfactory dysfunction, a symptom identified in 76-83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections -- including those that are otherwise asymptomatic -- when a standardized olfaction test is used. We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events. In light of these estimated impacts, and because olfactory tests can be mass produced at low cost and self-administered, we suggest that screening for olfactory dysfunction could be a high impact and cost effective method for broad COVID-19 screening and surveillance.","Larremore, D.

As a preliminary study, we investigated service utilization patterns and the characteristics of doctors and patients involved in these temporary teleconsultation services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using national health insurance claims data from February 23, 2020 to June 30, 2020 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, 228269875 cases were identified. Among them, 567390 cases that received teleconsultation services were included in our study. We performed descriptive analyses according to the types of healthcare institutions. RESULTS: In total, 6193 healthcare institutions provided teleconsultation. Of these, 5466 (88.3%) were clinics. Physicians providing teleconsultations were most likely to be doctors of internal medicine (34.0%) or pediatricians (7.0%) and based in the Seoul Metropolitan area (30.4%). In terms of patients undergoing teleconsultation, the most common major disease categories treated were circulatory system diseases (I00–I99). In a detailed analysis, hypertensive diseases (I10–I15) were the most common diagnoses, with a total of 88726 cases (15.6%), followed by diabetes mellitus at 60298 cases (10.6%). The proportion of Medical Aid recipients receiving teleconsultations was higher (9.5%) than other socioeconomic groups. Among all participants, 356622 cases (84.6%) were from a return visit, and 108838 cases (19.2%) received teleconsultation services without being prescribed drugs.

609636,Empowering Virus Sequences Research through Conceptual Modeling,2020-05-01,"The public health crisis created by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred a deluge of scientific research aimed at informing public health and medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those working in frontline public health and clinical care had insufficient time to parse the rapidly evolving evidence and use it for decision making. Academics in public health and medicine were well-placed to translate the evidence for use by frontline clinicians and public health practitioners. The Novel Coronavirus Research Compendium (NCRC), a group of >50 faculty and trainees, began in March 2020 with the goal to quickly triage and review the large volume of preprints and peer-reviewed publications on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and to summarize the most important, novel evidence to inform pandemic response. From April 6, 2020 through January 1, 2021, 54,192 papers and preprints were screened by NCRC teams and 527 were selected for review and uploaded to the NCRC website for public consumption. The majority of papers reviewed were peer-reviewed publications (n=395, 75%), published in 102 journals; 25% (n=132) of papers reviewed were of preprints. The NCRC is a successful model of how academics can support practitioners by translating scientific knowledge into action and help to build capacity among students for this work. This approach could be used for health problems beyond COVID-19, but the effort is resource intensive and may not be sustainable over the long term.","Redd, Andrew D.; Peetluk, Lauren; Jarrett, Brooke; Hanrahan, Colleen; Schwartz, Sheree; Rao, Amrita; Jaffe, Andrew; Jones, Carli; Lutz, Chelsea; McKee, Clif; Patel, Eshan; Rosen, Greg; Desany, Henri Garrison; McKay, Heather; Muschelli, John; Andersen, Kayte; Link, Malen A.; Wada, Nikolas; Baral, Prativa; Young, Ruth; Boon, Denali; Grabowski, M.

615380,Characterization of Foot and Mouth Disease Virus Serotype SAT-2 in Swamp Water Buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) under the Egyptian Smallholder Production System.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: Spotted fever group rickettsiae represent one of the most diverse groups of vector-borne bacteria, with several human pathogenic species showing an emerging trend worldwide. Most species are vectored by ticks (Ixodidae), with many zoonotic reservoir species among most terrestrial vertebrate groups. While the reservoir competence of many different vertebrate species is well known (e.g. birds, rodents and dogs), studies on insectivorous bats have been rarely performed despite their high species diversity, ubiquitous urban presence and importance in harboring zoonotic disease agents. Romania has a high diversity and ubiquity of bats. Moreover, seven out of eight SFG rickettsiae species with zoonotic potential were previously reported in Romania. Based on this, the aim of this study was to detect Rickettsia species in tissue samples in bats. METHODS: Here we report a large-scale study (322 bats belonging to 20 species) on the presence of Rickettsia spp. in Romanian bat species. Tissue samples from insectivorous bats were tested for the presence of Rickettsia DNA using PCR detection amplifying a 381 bp fragment of the gltA gene. Positive results were sequenced to confirm the results. The obtained results were statistically analyzed by chi-squared independence test. RESULTS: Positive results were obtained in 14.6% of bat samples. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of R. monacensis in two bat species (Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in two locations. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of a possible involvement of these bat species in the epidemiology of Rickettsia spp., highlighting the importance of bats in natural cycles of these vector-borne pathogens.

615393,Stability of bovine coronavirus on lettuce surfaces under household refrigeration conditions,2012-05-01,"Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) is a common etiology of bacteria-mediated lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Given the paucity of novel antibiotics in our foreseeable pipeline, developing novel non-antibiotic antimicrobial therapies saliently targeting drug resistant PsA isolates remains a priority. Lytic bacteriophages (or phages) have come under scrutiny as a potential antimicrobial for refractory bacterial infections. We evaluated intratracheally and intraperitoneally (IP) administered phage therapy (with/without meropenem) in an acute immunocompromised mouse model of multi-drug resistant (MDR) PsA pulmonary infection. The MDR P. aeruginosa respiratory disease model used in these studies was developed to investigate novel therapies that might have efficacy as either monotherapies or as combination therapy with meropenem. Methods: We utilized eight-week-old, 18 g BALB/cJ female mice and an MDR strain of PsA (UNC-D). Mice were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide. We employed a three-phage cocktail targeting PsA (PaAH2ΦP (103), PaBAP5Φ2 (130), and PaΦ (134)), confirmed to exhibit in vitro suppression of the infecting isolate out to 45 h. Suppression was confirmed with phages acting in isolation and in combination with meropenem. Results: IP administration of phage did not protect mice from death. A one-time delivery of phage directly to the lungs via a single intubation-mediated, intratracheal (IMIT) instillation protected mice from lethal infection. Protection was observed despite delaying therapy out to 6 h. Finally, we observed that, by slowing the progression of infection by treatment with a sub-efficacious dose of meropenem, we could protect the mice from lethal infection via IP phage administration coupled to meropenem, observing partial additive effects of phage–antibiotic combination therapy. Conclusions: A personalized phage cocktail administered via IMIT exhibits high therapeutic efficacy, despite delayed treatment of 6 h in a lethal MDR PsA pneumonia model. IP phage alone did not forestall mortality, but exhibited efficacy when combined with meropenem and IMIT-administered phage. These additive effects of combined IP phage and meropenem confirm that phage may indeed reach the lung bed via the systemic circulation and protect mice if the infection is not too acute. Therefore, adjunctive phage therapy with concerted attention to identifying optimal phage targeting of the infecting isolate in vitro may exhibit transformative potential for combating the specter of MDR bacterial infections. Phage should serve as an integral component of a four-pronged approach coupled with antibiotics, source control, and immune optimization.","Duplessis, Christopher; Warawa, Jonathan M.; Lawrenz, Matthew B.; Henry, Matthew; Biswas, Biswajit",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10080946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438996/,174
617224,Identifying Small Molecules That Promote Quasipalindrome-Associated Template-Switch Mutations in Escherichia coli,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND: Health care planning for pandemic influenza is a challenging task which requires predictive models by which the impact of different response strategies can be evaluated. However, current preparedness plans and simulations exercises, as well as freely available simulation models previously made for policy makers, do not explicitly address the availability of health care resources or determine the impact of shortages on public health. Nevertheless, the feasibility of health systems to implement response measures or interventions described in plans and trained in exercises depends on the available resource capacity. As part of the AsiaFluCap project, we developed a comprehensive and flexible resource modelling tool to support public health officials in understanding and preparing for surges in resource demand during future pandemics. RESULTS: The AsiaFluCap Simulator is a combination of a resource model containing 28 health care resources and an epidemiological model. The tool was built in MS Excel© and contains a user-friendly interface which allows users to select mild or severe pandemic scenarios, change resource parameters and run simulations for one or multiple regions. Besides epidemiological estimations, the simulator provides indications on resource gaps or surpluses, and the impact of shortages on public health for each selected region. It allows for a comparative analysis of the effects of resource availability and consequences of different strategies of resource use, which can provide guidance on resource prioritising and/or mobilisation. Simulation results are displayed in various tables and graphs, and can also be easily exported to GIS software to create maps for geographical analysis of the distribution of resources. CONCLUSIONS: The AsiaFluCap Simulator is freely available software (http://www.cdprg.org) which can be used by policy makers, policy advisors, donors and other stakeholders involved in preparedness for providing evidence based and illustrative information on health care resource capacities during future pandemics. The tool can inform both preparedness plans and simulation exercises and can help increase the general understanding of dynamics in resource capacities during a pandemic. The combination of a mathematical model with multiple resources and the linkage to GIS for creating maps makes the tool unique compared to other available software.","Stein, Mart Lambertus; Rudge, James W; Coker, Richard; van der Weijden, Charlie; Krumkamp, Ralf; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Chavez, Irwin; Putthasri, Weerasak; Phommasack, Bounlay; Adisasmito, Wiku; Touch, Sok; Sat, Le Minh; Hsu, Yu-Chen; Kretzschmar, Mirjam; Timen, Aura",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23061807/,174

The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same RBD surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies, and enable us to design escape-resistant antibody cocktails–including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same surface of the RBD but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.","Greaney, Allison J.; Starr, Tyler N.; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Zost, Seth J.; Binshtein, Elad; Loes, Andrea N.; Hilton, Sarah K.; Huddleston, John; Eguia, Rachel; Crawford, Katharine H.D.; Dingens, Adam S.; Nargi, Rachel S.; Sutton, Rachel E.; Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Rothlauf, Paul W.; Liu, Zhuoming; Whelan, Sean P.J.; Carnahan, Robert H.; Crowe, James E.; Bloom, Jesse D.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935107/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.10.292078,174

This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes. METHODS: Secondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions. RESULTS: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth. The early implementation of lockdown initially decreased the doubling rate of cases and allowed time to upscale critical medical infrastructure. Measures such as asymptomatic testing, public–private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine can be developed and deployed in India.

Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (≥85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","Zhang, Lei; Shen, Mingwang; Ma, Xiaomeng; Su, Shu; Gong, Wenfeng; Wang, Jing; Tao, Yusha; Zou, Zhuoru; Zhao, Rui; Lau, Joseph; Li, Wei; Liu, Feng; Ye, Kai; Wang, Youfa; Zhuang, Guihua; Fairley, Christopher K",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042374,174
620153,Effects of lipopolysaccharide structure on lycopene production in Escherichia coli,2019-01-24,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply and a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two out of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 is resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. B.1.617 evades antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although less so than the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.","Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Krüger, Nadine; Kempf, Amy; Nehlmeier, Inga; Graichen, Luise; Arora, Prerna; Sidarovich, Anzhalika; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Winkler, Martin S.; Schulz, Sebastian; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Stankov, Metodi V.; Behrens, Georg M.N.; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124721008287?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34270919/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124721008287,174

621706,Torovirus,2008-07-30,"Thorough postmortem investigations of fatalities following vaccination with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are of great social significance. From 11.03.2021 to 09.06.2021, postmortem investigations of 18 deceased persons who recently received a vaccination against COVID-19 were performed. Vaxzevria was vaccinated in nine, Comirnaty in five, Spikevax in three, and Janssen in one person. In all cases, full autopsies, histopathological examinations, and virological analyses for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were carried out. Depending on the case, additional laboratory tests (anaphylaxis diagnostics, VITT [vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia] diagnostics, glucose metabolism diagnostics) and neuropathological examinations were conducted. In 13 deceased, the cause of death was attributed to preexisting diseases while postmortem investigations did not indicate a causal relationship to the vaccination. In one case after vaccination with Comirnaty, myocarditis was found to be the cause of death. A causal relationship to vaccination was considered possible, but could not be proven beyond doubt. VITT was found in three deceased persons following vaccination with Vaxzevria and one deceased following vaccination with Janssen. Of those four cases with VITT, only one was diagnosed before death. The synopsis of the anamnestic data, the autopsy results, laboratory diagnostic examinations, and histopathological and neuropathological examinations revealed that VITT was the very likely cause of death in only two of the four cases. In the other two cases, no neuropathological correlate of VITT explaining death was found, while possible causes of death emerged that were not necessarily attributable to VITT. The results of our study demonstrate the necessity of postmortem investigations on all fatalities following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. In order to identify a possible causal relationship between vaccination and death, in most cases an autopsy and histopathological examinations have to be combined with additional investigations, such as laboratory tests and neuropathological examinations.","Schneider, Julia; Sottmann, Lukas; Greinacher, Andreas; Hagen, Maximilian; Kasper, Hans-Udo; Kuhnen, Cornelius; Schlepper, Stefanie; Schmidt, Sven; Schulz, Ronald; Thiele, Thomas; Thomas, Christian; Schmeling, Andreas",Int J Legal Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-021-02706-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591186/,174

During this quarantine, alteration of dietary habits occurred, due to the changes in food availability and mandatory meal house-consumption. The change in dietary habits could somehow be directed by freely accessible information available on internet. Thus, we evaluated the type and the scientific quality of the information provided to the Italian population by the most visible web sites found on Google, relating diet in Covid-19 time. METHODS: we systematically performed a reliability and content analysis of Italian language websites using Google as search engine and a combination of diet/nutrition/Covid-19 as search terms. RESULTS: 88 webpages were included in the study, the great part representing newspaper webpages. Institutional webpages, despite having high scientific quality, did not have high visibility. Generally, all the other webpages reported information of medium-quality scientific level.

622958,Evaluating ultraviolet sensitivity of adventitious agents in biopharmaceutical manufacturing,2017-03-10,"India has recently started sequencing SARS-CoV2 genome from clinical isolates. Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on ‘a global initiative on sharing avian flu data’ (GISAID) platform. In this paper we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all these five isolates and also compared for their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and the other at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only and one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western part of India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","Begum, Feroza; Mukherjee, Debica; Thagriki, Dluya; Das, Sandeepan; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Ray, Upasana",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.066985,174

At our institution, the preclinical Practice of Medicine (POM) course was transitioned to large‐group, synchronous, video‐conference sessions. The aim of this study is to assess whether there were differences in learner engagement, as evidenced by student question‐asking behaviors between in‐person and videoconferenced sessions in one preclinical medical student course. In Spring, 2020, large‐group didactic sessions in POM were converted to video‐conference sessions. During these sessions, student microphones were muted, and video capabilities were turned off. Students submitted typed questions via a Q&A box, which was monitored by a senior student teaching assistant. We compared student question asking behavior in recorded video‐conference course sessions from POM in Spring, 2020 to matched, recorded, in‐person sessions from the same course in Spring, 2019. We found that, on average, the instructors answered a greater number of student questions and spent a greater percentage of time on Q&A in the online sessions compared with the in‐person sessions. We also found that students asked a greater number of higher complexity questions in the online version of the course compared with the in‐person course. The video‐conference learning environment can promote higher student engagement when compared with the in‐person learning environment, as measured by student question‐asking behavior. Developing an understanding of the specific elements of the online learning environment that foster student engagement has important implications for instructional design in both the online and in‐person setting.","Caton, Julia B.; Chung, Sukyung; Adeniji, Nia; Hom, Jason; Brar, Kiran; Gallant, Audra; Bryant, Madika; Hain, Adam; Basaviah, Pree; Hosamani, Poonam",FASEB Bioadv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615156/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fba.2020-00089,174
625046,Plasmid DNA Production in Proteome-Reduced Escherichia coli,2020-09-21,"There is a steadily growing literature on the role of the immune system in psychiatric disorders. So far, these advances have largely taken the form of correlations between specific aspects of inflammation (e.g. blood plasma levels of inflammatory markers, genetic mutations in immune pathways, viral or bacterial infection) with the development of neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression. A fundamental question remains open: why are psychiatric disorders and immune responses intertwined? To address this would require a step back from a historical mind–body dualism that has created such a dichotomy. We propose three contributions of active inference when addressing this question: translation, unification, and simulation. To illustrate these contributions, we consider the following questions. Is there an immunological analogue of sensory attenuation? Is there a common generative model that the brain and immune system jointly optimise? Can the immune response and psychiatric illness both be explained in terms of self-organising systems responding to threatening stimuli in their external environment, whether those stimuli happen to be pathogens, predators, or people? Does false inference at an immunological level alter the message passing at a psychological level (or vice versa) through a principled exchange between the two systems?","Bhat, Anjali; Parr, Thomas; Ramstead, Maxwell; Friston, Karl",Biol Philos,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-021-09801-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948044/,174

METHODS: Clinical assessment of symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in an initial case series of four families and confirmatory case series of seven families, within which one family member developed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and exposed another family member receiving methotrexate treatment; experimental part with methotrexate treatment of mice and organoids followed by the assessment of mRNA and protein expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. RESULTS: In the initial case series, three of four women on a joint ski trip developed COVID-19, while the fourth woman, under treatment with methotrexate, remained virus-free. Two of the three diseased women infected their husbands, while the third husband treated with methotrexate remained virus-free. In addition, 7 other families were identified in a follow-up case series, in which one member developed COVID-19, while the other, receiving methotrexate, remained healthy. Experimentally, when mice were treated with methotrexate, ACE2 expression significantly decreased in the lung, in the intestinal epithelium, and in intestinal organoids.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, <$75 000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020). EXPOSURE: Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report. RESULTS: Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75 000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 [53.6%] White individuals; mean [SD] age 45 [15] years; 732 [65.4%] women). Of those who lost employment, 415 (37.1%) reported food insecurity and 437 (39.1%) reported eating less due to financial constraints in 1 or more waves of the study. Among people who lost work, receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) percentage point decrease in food insecurity (a 35.0% relative reduction) and a 5.7 (95% CI, 3.0-8.4) percentage point decrease in eating less due to financial constraints (a 47.8% relative reduction). Decreases in food insecurity were larger with the $600/wk supplement and for individuals who were receiving larger amounts of unemployment insurance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this US national cohort study, receiving unemployment insurance was associated with large reductions in food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The $600/wk federal supplement and larger amounts of unemployment insurance were associated with larger reductions in food insecurity.","Raifman, Julia; Bor, Jacob; Venkataramani, Atheendar",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512519/,174

Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. Objective To validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods Three validation cohorts were generated: two external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and one internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes SpO2/FiO2 ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH, interleukin-6 and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by re-estimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N=1477). Results The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (AUC 0.94, 0.86 and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope 0.86, 0.94 and 0.79; intercept 0.05, 0.03 and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (AUC 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves. The updated model was also useful to predict fatal outcome in patients without respiratory distress at the time of evaluation.

We evaluated 254 COVID-19 patients longitudinally from early infection and for eight months thereafter and found a predominant broad-based immune memory response. SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and neutralizing antibodies exhibited a bi-phasic decay with an extended half-life of >200 days suggesting the generation of longer-lived plasma cells. In addition, there was a sustained IgG+ memory B cell response, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure. Polyfunctional virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also generated and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days. Interestingly, the CD4+ T cell response equally targeted several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whereas the CD8+ T cell response preferentially targeted the nucleoprotein, highlighting the importance of including the nucleoprotein as a potential vaccine antigen.

631837,Detection and molecular characteristics of bovine rotavirus A in dairy calves in China,2021-08-03,"The evolution of cats as a solitary species has pressured feline viruses to develop highly efficient transmission strategies, the ability to persist within the host for long periods of time and the aptitude to adapt to natural and vaccine-induced immunological pressures. These characteristics render feline viruses particularly dangerous in catteries, shelters and rescue homes, were cats from different backgrounds live in close proximity. The possibility to induce short-term resistance of newcomer cats to a broad variety of viruses could help prevent the dissemination of viruses both within and outside such facilities. Oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine phosphate guanosine (CpG) motifs stimulate innate immune responses in mammals. We have previously shown that ODN 2216, a class A CpG ODN, promotes the expression by feline immune cells of potent antiviral molecules that increase resistance of feline fibroblastic and epithelial cell lines to five common feline viruses. With the aim to test the safety and extent of the biological effects of ODN 2216 in the domestic cat, we performed an initial in vivo experiment in which two cats were injected the molecule once subcutaneously and two additional cats received control treatments. No side effects to administration of ODN 2216 were observed. Moreover, this molecule induced the expression of the myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene, a marker for the instigation of innate antiviral processes, in blood as well as in oral, conjunctival and rectal mucosa cells, indicating systemic biological activity of the molecule with protective potential at viral entry sites. Mx mRNA levels were already elevated in blood 6 h post injection of ODN 2216, reached peak levels within 24 h and returned to basal values by 96–192 h after administration of the molecule. Similar induction patterns were observed in all analyzed mucosal cells. Plasma collected from treated cats at regular intervals until 96–192 h could moreover induce Mx mRNA expression in fcwf-4 cells and increase resistance of these cells to feline calicivirus inoculation. Finally, Mx mRNA levels measured in blood correlated with the degree of viral inhibition that was induced by plasma from the same cat and the same experimental time point. Our results altogether underline the promising potential of ODN 2216 in promoting antiviral defense mechanisms and inducing temporary resistance to viral infections in vivo in the domestic cat.","Robert-Tissot, Céline; Meli, Marina L.; Riond, Barbara; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712002905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974542/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712002905,174

RVP was also evaluated for its ability to differentiate seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and novel H1N1. RESULTS: The sensitivities, specificities, PPVs and NPVs for the detection of novel H1N1, determined by comparing all four-test methods, were: rapid antigen: 17.8%, 93.6%, 77.4%, 47.9%; DFA: 46.7%, 94.5%, 91.3%, 58.9%; R-Mix culture: 88.9%, 100%, 100%, 87.9%; RVP: 97.8%, 100%, 100%, 97.3%. The individual sensitivities of BinaxNOW and 3MA + B as compared to R-Mix culture for the detection of novel H1N1 were 9.6% and 40%, respectively. All unsubtypeable influenza A specimens identified by RVP and tested with the CDC novel H1N1 specific RT-PCR assay were confirmed to be novel H1N1. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid antigen tests, DFA, R-Mix culture and the xTAG RVP test all detected the novel H1N1 strain, but with highly varied sensitivity. The RVP test provided the best diagnostic option as RVP demonstrated superior sensitivity for the detection of all influenza strains, including the novel H1N1, provided accurate influenza A subtyping and identified a significant number of additional respiratory pathogens.","Ginocchio, Christine C.; Zhang, Frank; Manji, Ryhana; Arora, Suman; Bornfreund, Mark; Falk, Leon; Lotlikar, Madhavi; Kowerska, Margaret; Becker, George; Korologos, Diamanto; de Geronimo, Marcella; Crawford, James M.",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19540158/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653209002546; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653209002546; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.06.005,174

The inspiration to present this numerical framework comes through the objective of introducing a reliable structure that associates the operative ANNs features using the optimization procedures of soft computing to deal with such stimulating systems. Four different problems that are based on the singular equations involving Neumann–Robin, Dirichlet, and Neumann boundary conditions have been occupied to scrutinize the robustness, stability, and proficiency of the designed ANN-GA-SQPM. The proposed results through ANN-GA-SQPM have been compared with the exact results to check the efficiency of the scheme through the statistical performances for taking fifty independent trials. Moreover, the study of the neuron analysis based on three and 15 neurons is also performed to check the authenticity of the proposed ANN-GA-SQPM.","Nisar, Kashif; Sabir, Zulqurnain; Asif Zahoor Raja, Muhammad; Ag Ibrahim, Ag Asri; J.

As such, there has been significant research into all aspects of the disease, including diagnostic biomarkers, associated risk factors, and strategies that might be used for its treatment and prevention. Toward this end, eosinopenia has been identified as one of many factors that might facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of severe COVID-19. However, this finding is neither definitive nor pathognomonic for COVID-19. While eosinophil-associated conditions have been misdiagnosed as COVID-19 and others are among its reported complications, patients with pre-existing eosinophil-associated disorders (e.g., asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease; interestingly, several recent studies suggest that a diagnosis of asthma may be associated with some degree of protection. Finally, although vaccine-associated aberrant inflammatory responses, including eosinophil accumulation in the respiratory tract, were observed in preclinical immunization studies targeting the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, no similar complications have been reported clinically in response to the widespread dissemination of either of the two encapsulated mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19.","Rosenberg, Helene F.; Foster, Paul S.",Semin Immunopathol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-021-00850-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728484/,174

632759,Structural genomics of infectious disease drug targets: the SSGCID,2011-08-13,"Coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE) are among the most significant diseases affecting the poultry industry. These diseases have become more prominent in the wake of policies to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production. This has led to more research focused on better understanding the immune system and its responses to pathogen challenge, and thus developing informed strategies to exploit immune responses that can support enhanced disease resistance and growth performance. Some chicken breeds and lines show greater resistance or susceptibility to various diseases, and thus these birds maybe able to shed light on immune processes or pathways that contribute to the more resistant/susceptible state. This review attempts to identify potentially important genes that show some consistency in (relative) up or downregulation in key tissues between the resistant and susceptible chickens. For coccidiosis and NE, relative downregulation of IL-10 and (slightly less consistently) upregulation of IFN-γ appear to be features of more resistant birds. Data for IFN-α, IL-12, and IL-17D are currently less consistent. Gene expression data from NE studies have identified some potentially interesting, perhaps less well understood, immune-related genes (e.g., TCF12, BCL2, IRF2, TRAF3, TAB3, etc.,) that maybe associated with the resistant and/or susceptible phenotype. Salmonella and Campylobacter are important foodborne pathogens harbored by the chicken intestinal tract, while infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis are also important viral diseases of poultry. We, therefore, consider whether there are consistent features from resistant/susceptible disease models with these pathogens that relate to findings from the coccidiosis and NE studies. It is not anticipated that ideal immune responses to these pathogens will be identical but rather that consistent elements maybe identified that could help inform breeding or alternative strategies to support general disease resistance and enhanced (and efficient) flock productivity.","Broom, Leon J; Kogut, Michael H",Poult Sci,https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey535; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119300914; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119300914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30534980/,174

Successful viral reproduction requires the precise assembly of progeny virions from viral genomes, structural proteins, and membrane components. Such spatial and temporal separation of assembly reactions depends on accurate coordination among intracellular compartmentalization in multiple organelles. Here, we overview the rearrangement and morphology remodeling of virus-triggered intracellular organelles. Focus is given to the quality control of intracellular organelles, the hijacking of the modified organelle membranes by viruses, morphology remodeling for viral replication, and degradation of intracellular organelles by virus-triggered selective autophagy. Understanding the functional reprogram and morphological remodeling in the virus-organelle interplay can provide new insights into the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.","Ren, Shanhui; Ding, Chan; Sun, Yingjie",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456258/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21103689,174

Epidemiological data from LTCFs are scarce. We used population-level active surveillance to estimate incidence of, and risk factors for Covid-19, and attributable mortality in elderly residents of LTCFs. Methods: Cohort study using individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents and daily counts of infection for 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff across 179 UK LTCFs. We modelled risk factors for infection and mortality using Cox proportional hazards and estimated attributable fractions. Findings: 2,075/9,339 residents developed Covid-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory confirmed infections. Confirmed infection incidence in residents and staff respectively was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days. 121/179 (67.6%) LTCFs had at least one Covid-19 infection or death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 1,694 all-cause deaths occurred in 8,713 (19.4% [18.6%; 20.3%]) residents. 217 deaths occurred in 607 residents with confirmed infection (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). 567/1694 (33.5%) of all-cause deaths were attributable to Covid-19, 28.0% of which occurred in residents with laboratory-confirmed infection. The remainder of excess deaths occurred in asymptomatic or symptomatic residents in the context of limited testing for infection, suggesting substantial under-ascertainment. Interpretation: 1 in 5 residents had symptoms of infection during the pandemic, but many cases were not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels increase infection risk. Disease control measures should integrate active surveillance and testing with fundamental changes in staffing and care home occupancy to protect staff and residents from infection.

635133,The solution structure of coronaviral stem-loop 2 (SL2) reveals a canonical CUYG tetraloop fold,2011-04-06,"Abstract We determined the complete nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the genomic RNA of PL97-1, the first Korean strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which was isolated from the serum of an infected pig in 1997. We found that the 15411-nucleotide genome of PL97-1 consisted of a 189-nucleotide 5′ noncoding region (NCR), a 15071-nucleotide protein-coding region, and a 151-nucleotide 3′NCR, followed by a poly (A) tail. The 5′-end of PL97-1 began with 1 ATG ACG TAT AGG12. Comparison of the PL97-1 genome with the 11 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes currently available revealed sequence divergence ranging from 0.3% (the VR-2332-derived vaccine MLV RespPRRS/Repro strain) to 38% (the Dutch Lelystad strain). To better understand the genetic relationships between these different strains, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the full-length PRRSV genomes. Significantly, the phylogenetic tree based on the ORF1b or ORF7 genes most closely resembled the tree based on the full-length genomes. Thus, these single genes will be the most useful in revealing the genetic relationships between the different strains relative to their geographical distribution. Extensive phylogenetic analyses using the ORF7 sequences of 111 PRRSV isolates available revealed that PL97-1 is most closely related to the North American genotype VR-2332, a VR-2332-derived vaccine strain, and Chinese BJ-4. It is distantly related to the European genotype Lelystad. This study provides the largest full-length genome phylogenetic analysis of PRRSV that has been published to date, and supports an earlier genetic grouping of the many temporally and geographically diverse PRRSV strains currently isolated.","Kang, Shien-Young; Yun, Sang-Im; Park, Hyo-Sun; Park, Choi-Kyu; Choi, Hyo-Seong; Lee, Young-Min",Virus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15246654/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170204001868; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170204001868,174
635193,Use of chimeric influenza viruses as a novel internal control for diagnostic rRT-PCR assays,2015-10-16,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are important triggers of wheezing in young children. Wheezy illness has increasingly been recognised as an important cause of morbidity in African children, but there is little information on the contribution of HRV to this. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HRV as a cause of acute wheezing in South African children. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty children presenting consecutively at a tertiary children's hospital with a wheezing illness from May 2004 to November 2005 were prospectively enrolled. A nasal swab was taken and reverse transcription PCR used to screen the samples for HRV. The presence of human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus and human coronavirus-NL63 was assessed in all samples using PCR-based assays. A general shell vial culture using a pool of monoclonal antibodies was used to detect other common respiratory viruses on 26% of samples. Phylogenetic analysis to determine circulating HRV species was performed on a portion of HRV-positive samples. Categorical characteristics were analysed using Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 128 (58.2%) of children, most (72%) of whom were under 2 years of age. Presenting symptoms between the HRV-positive and negative groups were similar. Most illness was managed with ambulatory therapy, but 45 (35%) were hospitalized for treatment and 3 (2%) were admitted to intensive care. There were no in-hospital deaths. All 3 species of HRV were detected with HRV-C being the most common (52%) followed by HRV-A (37%) and HRV-B (11%). Infection with other respiratory viruses occurred in 20/128 (16%) of HRV-positive children and in 26/92 (28%) of HRV-negative samples. CONCLUSION: HRV may be the commonest viral infection in young South African children with acute wheezing. Infection is associated with mild or moderate clinical disease.","Smuts, Heidi E; Workman, Lesley J; Zar, Heather J",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-11-65; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21401965/,174
635824,Virus demyelination,2003,"PURPOSE: Exercise improves the quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients recovering from treatment. Since group exercise fosters cohesion, we sought to determine if paired exercise would have similar, positive effects. An experiential study design was used to compare the effect of exercise (12 weeks) on psychosocial health in paired versus individually trained cancer patients. METHODS: Female cancer patients (n = 28) who completed cancer treatment were placed into either the singly trained or paired group. Groups were matched for cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption, single: 24.1 ± 7.4, pair: 24.8 ± 6.3 ml/kg/min) and age (single: 58 ± 12, pair: 58 ± 9 years). Patients participated in 36, 90-min exercise sessions in accordance with exercise recommendations. QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, FACT-G), depressive, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms were measured before, midway, and after the intervention. Fitness was measured pre- and post-intervention. Participants did not meet prior to the intervention. Two-way ANOVAs and multiple comparisons tests were used to detect differences (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Emotional well-being and total FACT-G scores were significantly improved in the paired but not individually trained patients. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved at mid- and final time points in the paired group. Paired patients reported significant improvements in insomnia symptoms from pre- to mid-intervention. Depressive and insomnia symptoms in the individually trained group were unchanged. A significant main effect of group was detected in fatigue scores in patients who were not chronically tired at baseline (F(1, 12) = 6.318, p = 0.0272). Both groups exhibited similar improvements in fitness. CONCLUSION: Paired exercisers had greater benefits in QOL, emotional well-being, and insomnia and depressive symptoms compared to individual exercisers.","Yamada, Paulette M.; Teranishi-Hashimoto, Cheri; Bantum, Erin O.",Support Care Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06209-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855612/,174
636286,Feline immunodeficiency virus in puma: Estimation of force of infection reveals insights into transmission,2019-09-26,"Studies have shown that calves fed milk replacers (MR) with crude protein (CP) concentrations greater than 20%, as typically found in conventional MR, have higher dry matter intakes (DMI) and greater average daily gains (ADG) but consume less starter, which can lead to stress during weaning and reduced rumen development. The greater amount of CP being fed to preweaned calves may alter their nitrogen (N) balance, and excess N may be excreted in the urine. The objective of this study was to determine N utilization in preweaned calves fed diets varying in the amount of CP and MR fed. This study used 24 newborn dairy heifer calves blocked by birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) 446 g dry matter (DM) of a conventional MR (CON; 20% CP, 20% fat), (2) 669 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (moderate; MOD; 26% CP, 18% fat), or (3) 892 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (aggressive; AGG; 26% CP, 18% fat). All calves had ad libitum access to starter and water. Both MR and starter were medicated with decoquinate. During weaning (d 43–49), the morning MR feeding ceased. On d 50, all MR feedings ended; however, starter and water intakes were continuously recorded until d 56. At 5 wk of age, urine was collected using urinary catheters for 3 d and chromium oxide was administered by bolus at 2 g/d for 7 d to estimate N efficiency. Calves fed MOD and AGG had similar starter intakes, feed efficiencies, and ADG, with the combined treatments having reduced starter intakes (258 vs. 537 g/d), greater ADG (674 vs. 422 g/d), and improved feed efficiency (0.57 vs. 0.45 gain:feed) compared with CON calves preweaning. However, DMI and water intake were similar across all treatments. Results from the N utilization phase showed that MOD and AGG treatments had similar but lower N efficiency compared with CON calves (45.5 vs. 52.7%). This could be due to MOD- and AGG-fed calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON calves (17.6 vs. 12.1 g/d). In summary, feeding >0.66 kg (DM) from a 26% CP MR increased ADG and improved feed efficiency during the preweaning period but reduced starter intake and lowered N efficiency.","Chapman, C.E.; Hill, T.M.; Elder, D.R.; Erickson, P.S.",J Dairy Sci,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-11886; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216308189; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030216308189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865505/,174

COVID-19 has claimed many lives across the globe and severely impacted the livelihood of a considerable section of the world’s population. We are still in the process of finding optimal and effective solutions to control the pandemic and minimise its negative impacts. In the process of developing effective strategies to combat COVID-19, different countries have adapted diverse policies, strategies and activities and yet there are no universal or comprehensive solutions to the problem. In this context, this paper brings out a conceptual model of multistakeholder participation governance as an effective model to fight against COVID-19. Accordingly, the current study conducted a scientific review by examining multi-stakeholder disaster response strategies, particularly in relation to COVID-19. The study then presents a conceptual framework for multistakeholder participation governance as one of the effective models to fight against COVID-19. Subsequently, the article offers strategies for rebuilding the economy and healthcare system through multi-stakeholder participation, and gives policy directions/decisions based on evidence to save lives and protect livelihoods. The current study also provides evidence about multidimensional approaches and multi-diplomatic mechanisms during the COVID-19 crisis, in order to examine dimensions of multi-stakeholder participation in disaster management and to document innovative, collaborative strategic directions across the globe.

In this assay, the primers were designed and custom-synthesized based on nucleotide sequence of VP2 gene of CPV 2. A standard curve was plotted using 10-fold serial dilution of standard plasmid DNA and Ct value. The standard curve was found to be linear over a 10(−7) dilution. The real-time PCR results were expressed as the number of DNA copies of CPV 2 per mg of faecal samples and showed range of 1.0 × 10(3) to 7.0 × 10(9) copies of viral DNA per mg of stool samples. The analytical sensitivity of the SYBR Green based real-time PCR was shown to be equivalent to 10 copies. Faecal samples (47) from dogs suspected of CPV 2 infection were analyzed by real-time PCR, haemagglutination (HA) assay and by a conventional PCR and 24, 20 and 22 samples were found positive for CPV 2, respectively.

The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (−41%), wounds (−29%), thoracic (−24%) and abdominal pain (−23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency. CONCLUSION: In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed a significant decline in the number of patients in one of the largest emergency rooms in Munich. This has to be avoided with existing hospital capacities, in order to prevent potential damage to health caused by postponed or missing emergency presentations.","Tschaikowsky, T.; Becker von Rose, A.; Consalvo, S.; Pflüger, P.; Barthel, P.; Spinner, C.

Neurotoxins present in their venoms are responsible for their toxicity. Due to their medical relevance, toxins have been the driving force in the scorpion natural compounds research field. On the other hand, for thousands of years, scorpions and their venoms have been applied in traditional medicine, mainly in Asia and Africa. With the remarkable growth in the number of characterized scorpion venom components, several drug candidates have been found with the potential to tackle many of the emerging global medical threats. Scorpions have become a valuable source of biologically active molecules, from novel antibiotics to potential anticancer therapeutics. Other venom components have drawn attention as useful scaffolds for the development of drugs. This review summarizes the most promising candidates for drug development that have been isolated from scorpion venoms.","Ortiz, Ernesto; Gurrola, Georgina B.; Schwartz, Elisabeth Ferroni; Possani, Lourival D.",Toxicon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010114006047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432067/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041010114006047; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2014.11.233,174
640369,What does the future hold for clinical microbiology?,2004,"Following the introduction of unprecedented “stay-at-home” national policies, the COVID-19 pandemic recently started declining in Europe. Our research aims were to characterize the changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and chronic care facilities.","Vokó, Zoltán; Pitter, János György",GeroScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529592/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-020-00205-0,174

The dataset presented here is the assessment of the psychological distress experienced by people in India following the implementation of lockdown as a measure to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. The data was collected through a survey conducted by employing an online questionnaire assessing the socio-demographic information (9-items) as well as the administration of the short version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12 items) originally developed by Goldberg (1972). The period of data collection is between 9th April 2020 and 20th April 2020 where a total of 1,894 responses were obtained. The Google forms containing the questionnaire of the study were shared publicly through emails and via the social media forum like WhatsApp and Facebook. Thereby, those who took the initiative to fill-up the responses were included as the survey participants. Thus, the final sample had participants representing 17 states and Union territories of India. The entire dataset is stored in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xls) and the questionnaire is attached as a supplementary file. The data is beneficial for the timely assessment of the nature and degree of the psychological distress experienced by people in India during the COVID-19 crisis.

640763,Infectious canine hepatitis: An “old” disease reemerging in Italy,2007-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Simulation-based surgical training (SBST) is key to securing future surgical expertise. Proficiency-based training (PBT) in laparoscopy has shown promising results on skills transfer. However, time constraints and limited possibilities for distributed training constitute barriers to effective PBT. Home-based training may provide a solution to these barriers and may be a feasible alternative to centralized training in times of assembly constraints. METHODS: We randomly assigned first-year trainees in abdominal surgery, gynecology, and urology to either centralized instructor-regulated training (CIRT) or home-based self-regulated training (HSRT) in laparoscopy. All participants trained on portable box trainers providing feedback on metrics and possibility for video reviewing. Training in both groups was structured as PBT with graded proficiency exercises adopted from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS). The HSRT group trained at home guided by online learning materials, while the CIRT group attended two training sessions in the simulation center with feedback from experienced instructors. Performance tests consisted of hand–eye and bimanual coordination, suture and knot-tying, and FLS exercises. We analyzed passing rates, training time and distribution, and test performances. RESULTS: Passing rates were 87% and 96% in the CIRT and HSRT group, respectively. HSRT facilitated distributed training and resulted in greater variation in training times. Task times for hand–eye and bimanual coordination were significantly reduced between pretest and posttest in both groups. Trainees maintained their posttest performances at the 6-month retention test. Our analyses revealed no significant inter-group differences in performances at pretest, posttest, or retention test. Performance improvements in the two groups followed similar patterns. CONCLUSION: CIRT and HSRT in laparoscopy result in comparable performance improvements. HSRT in laparoscopy is a feasible and effective alternative to CIRT when offered inside a supportive instructional design. Further research is needed to clarify trainees’ preferences and explore facilitators and barriers to HSRT.","Sloth, Sigurd Beier; Jensen, Rune Dall; Seyer-Hansen, Mikkel; Christensen, Mette Krogh; De Win, Gunter",Surg Endosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08429-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33742271/,174

Yet, its application is still in its infancy for monitoring and outbreak investigations of foods. Here we review the published literature, covering not only bacterial but also viral and Eukaryote food pathogens, to assess the status and potential of HTS implementation to inform stakeholders, improve food safety and reduce outbreak impacts. The developments in sequencing technology and bioinformatics have outpaced the capacity to analyze and interpret the sequence data. The influence of sample processing, nucleic acid extraction and purification, harmonized protocols for generation and interpretation of data, and properly annotated and curated reference databases including non-pathogenic “natural” strains are other major obstacles to the realization of the full potential of HTS in analytical food surveillance, epidemiological and outbreak investigations, and in complementing preventive approaches for the control and management of foodborne pathogens. Despite significant obstacles, the achieved progress in capacity and broadening of the application range over the last decade is impressive and unprecedented, as illustrated with the chosen examples from the literature. Large consortia, often with broad international participation, are making coordinated efforts to cope with many of the mentioned obstacles.

METHODS: Data for the monthly incidence of TB from January 2004 to December 2015 were obtained from the National Scientific Data Sharing Platform for Population and Health (China). The Box–Jenkins method was applied to fit a seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model to forecast the incidence of TB over the subsequent six months. RESULTS: During the study period of 144 months, 12,321,559 TB cases were reported in China, with an average monthly incidence of 6.4426 per 100,000 of the population. The monthly incidence of TB showed a clear 12-month cycle, and a seasonality with two peaks occurring in January and March and a trough in December. The best-fit model was SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,1)(12), which demonstrated adequate information extraction (white noise test, p > 0.05). Based on the analysis, the incidence of TB from January to June 2016 were 6.6335, 4.7208, 5.8193, 5.5474, 5.2202 and 4.9156 per 100,000 of the population, respectively.

643953,Sequential Vaccination for Containing Epidemics,2020-04-14,"Induction of membrane rearrangements in the cytoplasm of infected cells is a hallmark of positive-strand RNA viruses. These altered membranes serve as scaffolds for the assembly of viral replication factories (RFs). We have recently shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) representing the major constituent of the RF within the infected cell. RF formation requires the concerted action of nonstructural action of nonstructural protein (NS)3, -4A, protein (NS)3 -4A, -4B, -5A, and -5B. Although the sole expression of NS5A is sufficient to induce DMV formation, its efficiency is very low. In this study, we dissected the determinants within NS5A responsible for DMV formation and found that RNA-binding domain 1 (D1) and the amino-terminal membrane anchor are indispensable for this process. In contrast, deletion of NS5A D2 or D3 did not affect DMV formation but disrupted RNA replication and virus assembly, respectively. To identify cis- and trans-acting factors of DMV formation, we established a trans cleavage assay. We found that induction of DMVs requires full-length NS3, whereas a helicase-lacking mutant was unable to trigger DMV formation in spite of efficient polyprotein cleavage. Importantly, a mutation accelerating cleavage kinetics at the NS4B-5A site diminished DMV formation, while the insertion of an internal ribosome entry site mimicking constitutive cleavage at this boundary completely abolished this process. These results identify key determinants governing the biogenesis of the HCV RF with possible implications for our understanding of how RFs are formed in other positive-strand RNA viruses.","Romero-Brey, Inés; Berger, Carola; Kallis, Stephanie; Kolovou, Androniki; Paul, David; Lohmann, Volker; Bartenschlager, Ralf",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00759-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26152585/,174

Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation in COVID-19 patients, and compare these data from non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes in COVID-19 patients. Results: The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury.

Azithromycin targets the ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis that cause trachoma. Regions with low prevalence of active trachoma may have little if any ocular chlamydia, and, thus, may not benefit from azithromycin treatment. Understanding what happens to active trachoma and ocular chlamydia prevalence after stopping azithromycin MDA may improve future treatment decisions. We systematically reviewed published evidence for community prevalence of both active trachoma and ocular chlamydia after cessation of azithromycin distribution. We searched electronic databases for all peer-reviewed studies published before May 2020 that included at least 2 post-MDA surveillance surveys of ocular chlamydia and/or the active trachoma marker, trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) prevalence. We assessed trends in the prevalence of both indicators over time after stopping azithromycin MDA. Of 140 identified studies, 21 met inclusion criteria and were used for qualitative synthesis. Post-MDA, we found a gradual increase in ocular chlamydia infection prevalence over time, while TF prevalence generally gradually declined. Ocular chlamydia infection may be a better measurement tool compared to TF for detecting trachoma recrudescence in communities after stopping azithromycin MDA. These findings may guide future trachoma treatment and surveillance efforts.","Mahmud, Hamidah; Landskroner, Emma; Amza, Abdou; Aragie, Solomon; Godwin, William W.; de Hostos Barth, Anna; O’Brien, Kieran S.; Lietman, Thomas M.; Oldenburg, Catherine E.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237074/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009491,174

The 4(th) edition of the national guidelines for the management of COVID-19 provides an herbal formula with 9 herbs for its management. Aim of Study. We aimed to predict the mechanism of binding of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to provide a molecular-level explanation of the higher pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify protein sites which may be targeted by therapeutic agents to disrupt virus-host interactions. Subsequently, we aimed to investigate the formula for the initial-stage management to identify a therapeutic agent with the most likely potential to become pharmaceutical candidate for the management of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GenBank and SWISS-MODEL were applied for model creation. ClusPro was used for protein-protein docking. PDBePISA was applied for identification of possible binding sites. TCMSP was employed for identification of the chemical compounds. AutoDock Vina together with PyRx was used for the prediction and evaluation of binding pose and affinity to ACE2. SwissADME and PreADME were applied to screening and prediction of the pharmacokinetic properties of the identified chemical compounds. PyMOL was used to visualise the structural models of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins complexed to ACE2 and to examine their interactions. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 had two chains (labelled chains B and C) which were predicted to bind with ACE2. In comparison, the SARS-CoV had only one chain (labelled chain C) predicted to bind with ACE2. The spike glycoproteins of both viruses were predicted to bind with ACE2 via position 487. Molecular docking screening and pharmacokinetic property prediction of the herbal compounds indicated that atractylenolide III (−9.1 kcal/mol) from Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) Dc.

As such, cancer is very likely to continue to pose a major threat to human health. Radiation oncology is an indispensable pillar of cancer treatment and a well‐developed discipline. Nevertheless, key trends in cancer research and care, including improved primary prevention, early detection, integrated multidisciplinary approaches, personalized strategies at all levels of care, value‐based assessments of healthcare systems, and global health perspectives, will all shape the future of radiation oncology. Broader scientific advances, such as rapid progress in digitization, automation, and in our biological understanding of cancer, as well as the wider societal view of healthcare systems will also influence radiation oncology and how it is practiced. To stimulate a proactive discussion on how to adapt and reshape our discipline, this review provides some predictions on what the role and practice of radiation oncology might look like in 30 years’ time.","Baumann, Michael; Ebert, Nadja; Kurth, Ina; Bacchus, Carol; Overgaard, Jens",Mol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463984/; https://doi.org/10.1002/1878-0261.12731,174
651434,Feline Coronavirus Antivirals: A Review,2021-09-07,"OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence and to determine the clustering of children who were seropositive within school classes in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland from June to November 2020. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Switzerland had one of the highest second waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe in autumn 2020. Keeping schools open provided a moderate to high exposure environment to study SARS-CoV-2 infections. Children from randomly selected schools and classes, stratified by district, were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2. Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and health related questions. PARTICIPANTS: 275 classes in 55 schools; 2603 children participated in June-July 2020 and 2552 in October-November 2020 (age range 6-16 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serology of SARS-CoV-2 in June-July and October-November 2020, clustering of children who were seropositive within classes, and symptoms in children. RESULTS: In June-July, 74 of 2496 children with serological results were seropositive; in October-November, the number had increased to 173 of 2503. Overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 2.4% (95% credible interval 1.4% to 3.6%) in the summer and 4.5% (3.2% to 6.0%) in late autumn in children who were not previously seropositive, leading to an estimated 7.8% (6.2% to 9.5%) of children who were ever seropositive. Seroprevalence varied across districts (in the autumn, 1.7-15.0%). No significant differences were found among lower, middle, and upper school levels (children aged 6-9 years, 9-13 years, and 12-16 years, respectively). Among the 2223 children who had serology tests at both testing rounds, 28/70 (40%) who were previously seropositive became seronegative, and 109/2153 (5%) who were previously seronegative became seropositive. Symptoms were reported for 22% of children who were seronegative and 29% of children who were newly seropositive since the summer. Between July and November 2020, the ratio of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection to those who were seropositive was 1 to 8. At least one child who was newly seropositive was detected in 47 of 55 schools and in 90 of 275 classes. Among 130 classes with a high participation rate, no children who were seropositive were found in 73 (56%) classes, one or two children were seropositive in 50 (38%) classes, and at least three children were seropositive in 7 (5%) classes. Class level explained 24% and school level 8% of variance in seropositivity in the multilevel logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS: With schools open since August 2020 and some preventive measures in place, clustering of children who were seropositive occurred in only a few classes despite an increase in overall seroprevalence during a period of moderate to high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Uncertainty remains as to whether these findings will change with the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and dynamic levels of community transmission.

The aim of this study was to characterize how vaccine safety and effectiveness impact acceptance of a vaccine, and whether this impact varied over time or across socioeconomic and demographic groups. Repeated cross-sectional surveys of an opt-in internet sample were conducted in 2020 in the US, mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and India. Individuals were randomized into receiving information about a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine with different safety and effectiveness profiles (risk of fever 5% vs. 20% and vaccine effectiveness 50% vs. 95%). We examined the effect of the vaccine profile on vaccine acceptance in a logistic regression model, and included interaction terms between vaccine profile and socioeconomic/demographic variables to examine the differences in sensitivity to the vaccine profile. In total, 12,915 participants were enrolled in the six-country study, including the US (4054), China (2797), Taiwan (1278), Malaysia (1497), Indonesia (1527), and India (1762). Across time and countries, respondents had stronger preferences for a safer and more effective vaccine. For example, in the US in November 2020, acceptance was 3.10 times higher for a 95% effective vaccine with a 5% risk of fever, vs a vaccine 50% effective, with a 20% risk of fever (95% CI: 2.07, 4.63). Across all countries, there was an increase in the effect of the vaccine profile over time (p < 0.0001), with stronger preferences for a more effective and safer vaccine in November 2020 compared to August 2020. Sensitivity to the vaccine profile was also stronger in August compared to November 2020, in younger age groups, among those with lower income; and in those that are vaccine hesitant. Uptake of COVID-19 vaccines could vary in a country based upon effectiveness and availability. Effective communication tools will need to be developed for certain sensitive groups, including young adults, those with lower income, and those more vaccine hesitant.","Kerekes, Stefania; Ji, Mengdi; Shih, Shu-Fang; Chang, Hao-Yuan; Harapan, Harapan; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Singh, Awnish; Kanwar, Shailja; Wagner, Abram L.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9091010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579247/,174

Panther Fusion® Respiratory Assays (Fusion), which includes FluA/B/RSV (FFABR), Paraflu and AdV/hMPV/RV, offers a modular approach to syndromic testing on a fully automated platform while improving gene targets and expanding the test menu. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated Fusion using 275 consecutive nasopharyngeal specimens previously used in an analysis of five PCRs, as well as 225 archived specimens. RESULTS: Of the combined 500 specimens, 134 were positive for influenza A (FluA), 54 for FluB, 65 for RSV, 64 for parainfluenza (PIV), 24 for adenovirus (AdV), 21 for humanmetapneumovirus (hMPV), and 40 for rhinovirus (RV) with Fusion. Of the positive samples Fusion correlated with historical results for all but one, despite multiple freeze-thaws cycles of this collection. Fusion was positive for an additional 33 samples, including 11 FluAs, 7 RSVs, 3 PIV3s, 3 AdV, 6 hMPV and 3 RVs. These samples were retested with corresponding Prodesse (Pro) assays using quadruple sample volume. This resolver test confirmed Fusion results for an additional 4 FluAs, 4 RSVs, 1 PIV3 and 3 AdVs. The sensitivity and specificity ranges of Fusion were 99–100% and 98–100%. Limit of detection (LOD) analyses were performed on a variety of Flu isolates.

In this paper, we introduce a model of integrated behavioral health (IBH) in a primary care practice for adults with childhood onset medical and developmental conditions. Our discussion includes the role of IBH providers (i.e., psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers) as members of the integrated team, patient engagement and response to treatment, and innovative ways we strive to meet patient needs. Our review of electronic health records of patients seen at the UR Medicine Complex Care Center suggest that IBH is feasible and highly utilized, with 216 patients (40%) having had contact with an IBH provider on the team at least once.

653731,Sex as an important factor in nanomedicine,2021-05-20,"Currently approved replication-competent and inactivated vaccines are limited by excessive reactogenicity and poor safety profiles, while subunit vaccines are often insufficiently immunogenic without co-administering exogenous adjuvants. Self-assembling peptide-, peptidomimetic-, and protein-based biomaterials offer a means to overcome these challenges through their inherent modularity, multivalency, and biocompatibility. As these scaffolds are biologically derived and present antigenic arrays reminiscent of natural viruses, they are prone to immune recognition and are uniquely capable of functioning as self-adjuvanting vaccine delivery vehicles that improve humoral and cellular responses. Beyond this intrinsic immunological advantage, the wide range of available amino acids allows for facile de novo design or straightforward modifications to existing sequences. This has permitted the development of vaccines and immunotherapies tailored to specific disease models, as well as generalizable platforms that have been successfully applied to prevent or treat numerous infectious and non-infectious diseases. In this review, we briefly introduce the immune system, discuss the structural determinants of coiled coils, β-sheets, peptide amphiphiles, and protein subunit nanoparticles, and highlight the utility of these materials using notable examples of their innate and adaptive immunomodulatory capacity.","O’Neill, Conor L.; Shrimali, Paresh C.; Clapacs, Zain P.; Files, Megan A.; Rudra, Jai S.",Acta Biomater,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010691/,174

SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at the time of autopsy in all “checklist-positive” decedents. Additional “checklist-negative” decedents were randomly tested daily. Lung slides were blindly reviewed by 3 pathologists, assessing for the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and other findings. Sixteen decedents had positive postmortem SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs and underwent complete autopsies. Seven decedents had positive screening checklists. Of these, 4 had DAD and 1 had COVID-19–associated thromboembolic disease. Of the 9 decedents with negative screening checklists, 2 had DAD, but only 1 was attributed to COVID-19; the other was likely drug related. Acute bronchopneumonia was the second most common finding, and aspiration was the likely etiology in cases without concomitant DAD. COVID-19–related DAD was identified more commonly in decedents who screened positive by CDC checklist, but false-negatives did occur. Medical examiner offices should maintain a low threshold for random testing of decedents even when COVID-19 is not suspected.","Konopka, Kristine E.; Nguyen, Teresa; Hlavaty, Leigh; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J.; Dahl, Julia; Myers, Jeffrey L.",Am J Forensic Med Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833197/; https://doi.org/10.1097/paf.0000000000000681,174

Emotion identification may improve peoples’ emotion regulation strategies and interaction with multiple life contexts. Several studies have investigated emotion classification systems, but most of them are based on the analysis of only one, a few, or isolated physiological signals. Understanding how informative the individual signals are and how their combination works would allow to develop more cost-effective, informative, and objective systems for emotion detection, processing, and interpretation. In the present work, electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrodermal activity were processed in order to find a physiological model of emotions. Both a unimodal and a multimodal approach were used to analyze what signal, or combination of signals, may better describe an emotional response, using a sample of 55 healthy subjects. The method was divided in: (1) signal preprocessing; (2) feature extraction; (3) classification using random forest and neural networks. Results suggest that the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is the most effective for emotion classification. Yet, the combination of all signals provides the best emotion identification performance, with all signals providing crucial information for the system. This physiological model of emotions has important research and clinical implications, by providing valuable information about the value and weight of physiological signals for emotional classification, which can critically drive effective evaluation, monitoring and intervention, regarding emotional processing and regulation, considering multiple contexts.","Pinto, Gisela; Carvalho, João M.; Barros, Filipa; Soares, Sandra C.; Pinho, Armando J.; Brás, Susana",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20123510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32575894/,174

We show how quickly rock art panels have degraded in recent decades, contending that climate-catalysed salt efflorescence is responsible for increasing exfoliation of the limestone cave surfaces that house the ~ 45 to 20-thousand-year-old paintings. These artworks are located in the world’s most atmospherically dynamic region, the Australasian monsoon domain. The rising frequency and severity of El Niño-induced droughts from anthropogenic climate change (that is, higher ambient temperatures and more consecutive dry days), combined with seasonal moisture injected via monsoonal rains retained as standing water in the rice fields and aquaculture ponds of the region, increasingly provide ideal conditions for evaporation and haloclasty, accelerating rock art deterioration.","Huntley, J.; Aubert, M.; Oktaviana, A.

A mathematical model could be used to capture the dynamics of the disease spread to estimate the infections, recoveries, and deaths that may result from the disease. An estimation is crucial to make policy decisions and for the alerts for the medical emergencies that may arise. Many epidemiological models are being used to make such an estimation. One major factor that is important in the forecasts using the models is the dynamic nature of the disease spread. Unless we can come up with a way of estimating the parameters that guide this dynamic spread, the models may not give accurate forecasts. In this work, using the SEIRD model, attempts are made to forecast Infected, Recovered and Death rates of COVID-19 up to a week using an incremental approach. A method of optimizing the parameters of the model is also discussed thoroughly in this work. The model is evaluated using the data taken from the COVID-19 India tracker [2], a crowd-sourced platform for India. The model is tested with the whole country as well as all the states and districts. The results of all the states and districts obtained from our model can be seen in [12]. Forecasts for infected and Deaths for the whole country and the state of Maharashtra are satisfactory with an average % error rate of 3.47 and 3.60 for infected and 3.88 and 1.61 for deaths respectively.

Various factors exacerbate the issues in commercializing products across regions, including the lack of established regulatory frameworks for developing gene therapy products in many jurisdictions. While some countries have established separate regulatory frameworks for advanced therapies/regenerative medicine products, differences exist between them. Recommended solutions to overcome these hurdles include fostering convergence among countries with separate regulatory frameworks for these products and utilizing reliance and recognition for countries without such frameworks. Additionally, regulators who choose to establish new dedicated frameworks for regulating gene therapies should consider the inclusion of key elements such as expedited regulatory pathways that offer early engagement with regulators, innovative clinical trial design, and adequate post-market confirmatory studies.

Identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity could help to direct these efforts. This study aimed to estimate the associations between demographic factors and social behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. METHODS: In September 2020, we randomly sampled Indiana University Bloomington undergraduate students. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey about demographics, SARS-CoV-2 testing history, relationship status, and risk behaviors. Additionally, during a subsequent appointment, participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a fingerstick procedure and SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG rapid assay kit. We used unadjusted modified Poisson regression models to evaluate the associations between predictors of both SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 infection history. RESULTS: Overall, 1,076 students were included in the serological testing analysis, and 1,239 students were included in the SARS-CoV-2 infection history analysis. Current seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.6% (95% confidence interval: 3.3%, 5.8%). Prevalence of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection history was 10.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.6%, 12.0%). Greek membership, having multiple romantic partners, knowing someone in one's immediate environment with SARS-CoV-2 infection, drinking alcohol more than 1 day a week, and hanging out with more than five people when drinking alcohol increased both the likelihood of seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection history.

We performed a retrospective review of medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation. Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death. Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes. The model was validated by splitting the data into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count. Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age. The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables. The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95% CI, 0.63–0.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95% CI, 0.73–0.92], p<0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset.

This risk score system may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.","Zhao, Zirun; Chen, Anne; Hou, Wei; Graham, James M.; Li, Haifang; Richman, Paul S.; Thode, Henry C.; Singer, Adam J.; Duong, Tim Q.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730358/,174
662480,"LIST OF CONTENTS, AUTHOR AND SUBJECT INDEX FOR VOLUME 43, 2006",2006-07-31,"PURPOSE: To evaluate morpho-functional outcomes of the intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) implant. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, single-center study. Primary endpoint was the mean change in central macular thickness (CMT) from baseline to month 1–3. Secondary endpoints included mean CMT change from baseline to month 4–8 and 9–14 and mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), photopic negative response (PhNR) and b-wave of flash full-field electroretinogram (ERG) changes from baseline to month 1–3, 4–8, and 9–14. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (18 eyes) were included. Mean (standard deviation) CMT decreased from 473 (196) µm at baseline to 371 (163) µm at month 1–3 (mean difference − 102.3 ± 98.35 µm, 95% CI ± 46.4 µm; p < 0.0001) and this decrease tended to endure up to month 9–14. BCVA did not change significantly. There was an improvement in mean PhNR amplitude from 2.76 (1.65) µV at baseline to 3.73 (2.32) µV at month 1–3 (mean difference 0.91 (1.14) µV, 95% CI ± 0.54 µV, p = 0.003); b-wave amplitude improved from 8.83 (4.52) µV at baseline versus 10.05 (5.04) µV at month 1–3 (mean difference 1.22 (2.23) µV, 95% CI ± 1.08 µV, p = 0.0384). These ERG positive changes tended to endure up to month 9–14, although they did not reach statistical significance after month 3. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal FAc implant significantly improved anatomic as well as functional outcomes related to middle and inner retinal layers, known to be altered in diabetic retinopathy. Our findings support the hypothesis that intravitreal FAc implant may exert a protective effect in diabetic retinas with diabetic macular edema.","Minnella, Angelo Maria; Picardi, Stefano Maria; Maceroni, Martina; Albanesi, Francesca; De Siena, Elisa; Placidi, Giorgio; Caputo, Carmela Grazia; De Vico, Umberto; Rizzo, Stanislao; Falsini, Benedetto",Adv Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-01751-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948926/,174
664253,Macroscopic mixer for disparate property liquid–liquid mixing in aqueous sanitizer preparation,2021-09-28,"We assessed patient-provider communication in HIV care; data were from the 2019 Positive Perspectives Survey of people living with HIV (PLHIV) from 25 countries (n = 2389). A significantly greater proportion of recently diagnosed individuals were interested in being involved when it comes to decisions about their HIV treatment compared with any other group (72.8% [399/548], 63.1% [576/913], and 62.6% [581/928], diagnosis year: 2017–2019, 2010–2016, and pre-2010 respectively) but reported less understanding of their treatment compared with those reporting the longest duration (66.8% [366/548], 68.6% [626/913], and 77.3% [717/928], respectively). One-third of PLHIV with salient treatment-related concerns were uncomfortable discussing with providers. Of participants who felt that their HIV medication limited their life but did not discuss their concerns with their provider (n = 203), top reasons for not discussing were: perception nothing could be done (49.3% [100/203]), provider never brought up the issue (37.9% [77/203]), and not wanting to appear difficult (30.5% [62/203]). To continue to identify and address unmet treatment needs among PLHIV, providers need to ensure that there is ongoing open dialogue.

664732,Paramyxoviruses of Animals,2008-07-30,"Objective To report the cognitive features of severe COVID-19 patients entering in the post-acute phase, to understand whether COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome itself could result in long-term cognitive deficits and whether neuropsychological treatment after the acute stage might represent a specific rehabilitation need. Design Case series. Setting Rehabilitation hospital. Participants We assessed the general cognitive functioning, through tablet-supported video-call, in 9 of 12 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital at least 30 days earlier for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. None of these patients presented cognitive symptoms before the hospitalization. Main Outcome Measures General Cognitive functioning, measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination Test. Results A general cognitive decay was observed in three patients (33.3%), who had a pathological score at the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), with a specific decline in attention, memory, language and praxis abilities. The cognitive (mal)functioning seems to be linearly associated with the length of stay (in days) in the intensive care unit (ICU): the higher the number of days spent in the ICU, the lower the MMSE score (indicating a lower global cognitive functioning). Conclusions Our results indicate that some COVID-19 patients might also benefit from a neuropsychological rehabilitation, given their possible global cognitive decay. The link between the neuropsychological functioning and the length of stay in the ICU suggests that neurocognitive rehabilitative treatments should be directed explicitly towards patients who are treated in the ICU care, rather than towards every patient who suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. However, given the limitation of a case series study, those hypotheses should be tested with future studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up.","Negrini, Francesco; Ferrario, Irene; Mazziotti, Daniele; Berchicci, Marzia; Bonazzi, Maurizio; de Sire, Alessandro; Negrini, Stefano; Zapparoli, Laura",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991870/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003999320309618?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003999320309618; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.09.376,174

665752,Genetic analysis of canine group 2 coronavirus in Korean dogs,2010-02-24,"Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and ammonia (NH(3)) are among the main contributors to the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM(2.5)), which represent a severe risk to human health. Even if important improvements have been achieved worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for NOx and SOx release; instead, the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for NH(3) emissions. Due to the emergency of coronavirus disease, in Italy schools and universities have been locked down from late February 2020, followed in March by almost all production and industrial activities as well as road transport, except for the agricultural ones. This study aims to analyze NH(3), PM(2.5) and NOx emissions in principal livestock provinces in the Lombardy region (Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, and Mantua) to evaluate if and how air emissions have changed during this quarantine period respect to 2016-2019. For each province, meteorological and air quality data were collected from the database of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment, considering both data stations located in the city and the countryside. In the 2020 selected period, PM(2.5) reduction was higher compared to the previous years, especially in February and March. Respect to February, PM(2.5) released in March in the city stations reduced by 19%-32% in 2016-2019 and by 21%-41% in 2020. Similarly, NOx data of 2020 were lower than in the 2016-2019 period (reduction in March respect to February of 22-42% for 2016-2019 and of 43-62% for 2020); in particular, this can be observed in city stations, because of the current reduction in anthropogenic emissions related to traffic and industrial activities. A different trend with no reductions was observed for NH(3) emissions, as agricultural activities have not stopped during the lockdown. Air quality is affected by many variables, for which making conclusions requires a holistic perspective. Therefore, all sectors must play a role to contribute to the reduction of harmful pollutants.","Lovarelli, Daniela; Conti, Cecilia; Finzi, Alberto; Bacenetti, Jacopo; Guarino, Marcella",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120309452; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120309452?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818500/,174

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these measurements. METHODS: Parents and then nurses measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use (home thermometer). The reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals (hospital thermometer). A difference of ≥ 0.5 °C was considered clinically significant. A fever was defined as a temperature ≥ 38.5 °C. RESULTS: The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent and the nurse with the home thermometer was 0.44 ± 0.61 °C, and 33% of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. The mean absolute difference between the readings done by the parent with the home thermometer and the nurse with the hospital thermometer was 0.51 ± 0.63 °C, and 72 % of the readings differed by ≥ 0.5 °C. Using the home thermometer, parents detected fever with a sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 50–93%), a specificity of 95% (95% CI 84–99%), a positive predictive value of 87% (95% CI 60–98%), and a negative predictive value of 91% (95% CI 79–98 %). In comparing the readings the nurse obtained from the two different tympanic thermometers, the mean absolute difference was 0.24 ± 0.22 °C. Nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94% (95 % CI 71–100 %), a specificity of 88% (95% CI 75–96 %), a positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI 53–92%), and a negative predictive value of 97% (95%CI 87–100 %) using the home thermometer. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the three sets of readings was 0.80, and the consistency of readings was not affected by the body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: The readings done by parents with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use differed a clinically significant amount from the reference standard (readings done by nurses with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals) the majority of the time, and parents failed to detect fever about one-quarter of the time. Tympanic readings reported by parents should be interpreted with great caution.","Robinson, Joan L; Jou, Hsing; Spady, Donald W",BMC Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15644134/,174

However, its effects on important employee outcomes such as work productivity, job performance, and satisfaction are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the factors previously identified as important determinants of telework effectiveness are also relevant in the context of the pandemic. Drawing on Baruch and Nicholson’s Model of Teleworking, the relationship between individual, home/family, job, and organizational factors and adjustment to telework during COVID-19 was examined. Survey data was collected from 482 employees who worked from home on a full-time basis during the pandemic. Results indicated that individual factors (i.e., self-management tactics) and home/family factors (i.e., the need for adequate telework conditions) are important predictors for employee productivity, performance and satisfaction while teleworking during COVID-19. Furthermore, workload (i.e., job factor) was a significant predictor for work productivity and satisfaction with telework. Surprisingly, organizational support for teleworking was not related to any of these outcomes. Implications for research and practice concerning telework during the pandemic are discussed. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

669977,"SmartBac, a new baculovirus system for large protein complex production",2019-03-31,"Several epidemiological studies using sensitive detection methodologies have confirmed that the majority of acute asthma exacerbations follow upper respiratory tract infections – common colds. Most of these colds are due to human rhinoviruses (RVs). RVs are able to reach and replicate in epithelial cells of the lower airways and can activate these cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators. Under some circumstances, RVs can also become cytotoxic to the epithelium. Atopic asthmatic individuals produce less interferon-γ and more interleukin-10 than normal subjects in response to RV infection. Symptom severity as well as viral shedding after experimental RV infection, is inversely correlated with ‘atopic’ status, expressed as the interferon-γ to interleukin-5 ratio. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules on immune cells is also affected in atopic asthmatics, suggesting an aberrant immune response to RV that may lead to suboptimal viral clearance and viral persistence. Some of the above effects can be reversed in vitro by corticosteroids, second-generation antihistamines or anti-oxidants; however, the optimal strategy for treating acute asthma exacerbations requires further research at both mechanistic and clinical levels.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Papi, Alberto; Psarras, Stelios; Johnston, Sebastian L",Paediatr Respir Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054204000284; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054204000284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15276138/,174

To address this gap in training and practice, we developed, implemented, and evaluated an educational module enhanced by videotaped depictions of expert clinicians interacting with professional actors performing as standardized patients (SPs). Methods: We developed an educational resource highlighting common issues of sexual health relevant to CAP practice, including sexual development, psychotropic-related side effects, and sexuality in children with autism. We wrote original scripts, based on which two clinicians interacted with three SPs. Digital recordings were edited to yield 5 clips with a cumulative running time of 20 min. The clips were interspersed during a 90-min session comprising didactic and interactive components. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we used synchronous videoconferencing, which allowed content dissemination to several training programs across the country. Results: We recruited 125 learners from 16 CAP training programs through the American Academy of CAP's Alliance for Learning and Innovation (AALI). Routine inquiry into adolescent patients' sexual function was uncommon, reported by only 28% of participants, with “awkward” and “uncomfortable” the most common terms mentioned in reference to the clinical task. The didactic intervention led to measurable improvements after 2 weeks in skills and knowledge (p = 0.004) and in attitudes (p < 0.001). The three items with the greatest improvement were: (a) availability of developmentally tailored resources; (b) comfort in addressing sexual development with underage patients; and (c) with parents or guardians of neuroatypical or developmentally disabled patients (p < 0.001 for each). Conclusions: A sexual health curriculum enriched by video-based examples can lead to measurable improvement in outcomes pertinent to the clinical practice of CAP. These educational materials are available for distribution, use and adaptation by local instructors. Our study also provides proof-of-principle for the use of multisite educational initiatives in CAP through synchronized videoconferencing.","Drozdowicz, Linda; Gordon, Elisabeth; Shapiro, Desiree; Jacobson, Sansea; Zalpuri, Isheeta; Stewart, Colin; Lewis, A.

In recent years, many studies have analyzed their antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anticancer properties in vitro and on experimentally induced animal models of colitis and colorectal cancer. However, there are still few clinical studies aimed to understand their role in the modulation of the intestinal pathophysiology. Many EOs and some of their molecules have demonstrated their efficacy in inhibiting bacterial, fungi and virus replication and in modulating the inflammatory and oxidative processes that take place in experimental colitis. In addition to this, their antitumor activity against colorectal cancer models makes them extremely interesting compounds for the modulation of the pathophysiology of the large bowel. The characterization of these EOs is made difficult by their complexity and by the different compositions present in the same oil having different geographical origins. This review tries to shift the focus from the EOs to their individual compounds, to expand their possible applications in modulating colon pathophysiology.","Spisni, Enzo; Petrocelli, Giovannamaria; Imbesi, Veronica; Spigarelli, Renato; Azzinnari, Demetrio; Donati Sarti, Marco; Campieri, Massimo; Valerii, Maria Chiara",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21114152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532055/,174

The information regarding adverse events of the unapproved vaccines in Japan (Havrix(®), Verorab(®), Boostrix(®), Priorix(®), Typhim Vi(®), and Mencevax(®)) was also collected. RESULTS: Of 645 patients, 58.6% were men and the median age was 31 years. Business was the most common travel purpose (34.9%), and Southeast Asia was the most common destination (40.2%). More than 80% of travelers to low- and middle-income countries were vaccinated against hepatitis A, while the rabies vaccination rate was approximately 50%. Typhoid vaccination coverage among travelers to South Asia was approximately 50%. The incidence of adverse events requiring medical consultation, telephonic consultation, or prolonged stay in the examination room was less than 5% for all unapproved vaccines in Japan.

Neonatal calves are particularly sensitive to infections with enteropathogens. The present study focused on prevention against the main infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea i.e. Escherichia coli, rota- and coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Dairy herds (n = 24) with a high percentage of neonatal calves scouring (>10%) were included and calves were sampled for the presence of these four enteropathogens. To decrease diarrhoea problems among neonatal calves, a standard protocol was tested on 13 herds (treatment group) where both C. parvum and either E. coli or rota- or coronavirus were identified as being involved, the other 11 herds served as control group. The protocol consisted of 2 points of action: preventive vaccination of dams against E. coli, rota- and coronavirus, and preventive administration of halofuginone lactate to newborn calves. The average percentage of calves suffering from neonatal diarrhoea (39.7% versus 14.3%, P < 0.01) and the average percentage of faecal samples positive for C. parvum (34% versus 11%, P < 0.05) differed significantly between control herds and treatment herds after implementation of the protocol. No significant differences between control and treatment group were observed in the percentage of calves excreting E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus, both before and at the end of the trial. Furthermore, risk factors potentially associated with the development of neonatal calf scours were determined. Non-significant results were obtained for the effect of the protocol on duration of diarrhoea and the effect of the colostral IgG quantity on the risk of diarrhoea. Passive immunity transfer status of the calves, measured both before the onset and at the end of the study, were non-significant between groups.","Meganck, V.; Hoflack, G.; Piepers, S.; Opsomer, G.",Prev Vet Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016758771400381X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2014.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475689/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758771400381X,174

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in HCPs. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in 21 ICUs in France between April 20, 2020, and May 21, 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified. Measurements and Main Results: The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (odds ratio of 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.79], 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.39–0.82], and 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.72], respectively). HCPs working in non–university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified the following six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions. Conclusions: HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.","Azoulay, Elie; Cariou, Alain; Bruneel, Fabrice; Demoule, Alexandre; Kouatchet, Achille; Reuter, Danielle; Souppart, Virginie; Combes, Alain; Klouche, Kada; Argaud, Laurent; Barbier, François; Jourdain, Mercé; Reignier, Jean; Papazian, Laurent; Guidet, Bertrand; Géri, Guillaume; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Guisset, Olivier; Labbé, Vincent; Mégarbane, Bruno; Van Der Meersch, Guillaume; Guitton, Christophe; Friedman, Diane; Pochard, Frédéric; Darmon, Michael",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866409/; https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202006-2568oc,174

As proposals cover also prophylactic use, the treatment could be massive, resulting in unprecedent levels of antiviral emissions to the aquatic environment. We have adapted previous models and used available information for predicting the environmental impact of representative medicinal products, covering the main groups under consideration: multitarget antiparasitic (chloroquines and ivermectin), glucocorticoids, macrolide antibiotics and antiviral drugs including their pharmacokinetic boosters. The retrieved information has been sufficient for conducting a conventional environmental risk assessment for the group of miscellaneous medicines; results suggest low concern for the chloroquines and dexamethasone while very high impact for ivermectin and azithromycin, even at use levels well below the default value of 1% of the population. The information on the ecotoxicity of the antiviral medicines is very scarce, thus we have explored an innovative pharmacodynamic-based approach, combining read-across, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), US EPA's Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) in vitro data, pharmacological modes of action, and the observed adverse effects.

In this review, we consider a year later where we are now, what the future holds, and what the long-term effects of the pandemic will be on stroke. Stroke occurs in about 1.4% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, who show an excess of large vessel occlusion and increased mortality. Despite this association, stroke presentations fell dramatically during the pandemic, although emerging data suggest that total stroke mortality may have risen with increased stroke deaths at home and in care homes. Strategies and guidelines have been developed to adapt stroke services worldwide, and protect healthcare workers. Adaptations include increasing use of telemedicine for all aspects of stroke care. The pandemic is exacerbating already marked global inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality. Lastly, the pandemic has had a major impact on stroke research and funding, although it has also emphasized the importance of large scale collaborative research initiatives.","Markus, Hugh S; Martins, Sheila",Int J Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709834/; https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930211005373,174
677470,Systemic fatal type II coronavirus infection in a dog: Pathological findings and immunohistochemistry,2007-07-05,"Background Based on cases and deaths, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in England peaked in late March and early April 2020 and then declined until the end of June. Since the start of July, cases have increased, while deaths have continued to decrease. Methods We report results from 594,000 swabs tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained from a representative sample of people in England over four rounds collected regardless of symptoms, starting in May 2020 and finishing at the beginning of September 2020. Swabs for the most recent two rounds were taken between 24th July and 11th August and for round 4 between 22nd August and 7th September. We estimate weighted overall prevalence, doubling times between and within rounds and associated reproduction numbers. We obtained unweighted prevalence estimates by sub-groups: age, sex, region, ethnicity, key worker status, household size, for which we also estimated odds of infection. We identified clusters of swab-positive participants who were closer, on average, to other swab-positive participants than would be expected. Findings Over all four rounds of the study, we found that 72% (67%, 76%) of swab-positive individuals were asymptomatic at the time of swab and in the week prior. The epidemic declined between rounds 1 and 2, and rounds 2 and 3. However, the epidemic was increasing between rounds 3 and 4, with a doubling time of 17 (13, 23) days corresponding to an R value of 1.3 (1.2, 1.4). When analysing round 3 alone, we found that the epidemic had started to grow again with 93% probability. Using only the most recent round 4 data, we estimated a doubling time of 7.7 (5.5, 12.7) days, corresponding to an R value of 1.7 (1.4, 2.0). Cycle threshold values were lower (viral loads were higher) for rounds 1 and 4 than they were for rounds 2 and 3. In round 4, we observed the highest prevalence in participants aged 18 to 24 years at 0.25% (0.16%, 0.41%), increasing from 0.08% (0.04%, 0.18%) in round 3. We observed the lowest prevalence in those aged 65 and older at 0.04% (0.02%, 0.06%) which was stable compared with round 3. Participants of Asian ethnicity had elevated odds of infection. We identified clusters in and around London, transient clusters in the Midlands, and an expanding area of clustering in the North West and more recently in Yorkshire and the Humber. Interpretation Although low levels of transmission persisted in England through to mid-summer 2020, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is now increasing. We found evidence of accelerating transmission at the end of August and beginning of September. Representative community antigen sampling can increase situational awareness and help improve public health decision making even at low prevalence.","Riley, S.; Ainslie, K. E.

678575,Alongshan virus in Russia,2019-12-03,"In an epidemic, individuals can widely differ in the way they spread the infection depending on their age or on the number of days they have been infected for. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions such as a vaccine or treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. social distancing) are essential to mitigate the pandemic. We develop an original approach to identify the optimal age-stratified control strategy to implement as a function of the time since the onset of the epidemic. This is based on a model with a double continuous structure in terms of host age and time since infection. By applying optimal control theory to this model, we identify a solution that minimizes deaths and costs associated with the implementation of the control strategy itself. We also implement this strategy to three countries with contrasted age distributions (Burkina-Faso, France, and Vietnam). Overall, the optimal strategy varies over the course of the epidemic, with a more intense control early on, and depending on host age, with a stronger control for the older population, except in the scenario where the cost associated with the control is low. In the latter scenario, we find strong differences across countries because the control extends to younger population in France and Vietnam 2-3 months after the onset of the epidemic, but not in Burkina Faso. Finally, we show that the optimal control strategy strongly outperforms constant uniform control of the whole population or over its younger fraction. This better understanding of the effect of age-based control interventions opens new perspectives for the field, especially for age-based contact tracing.","Richard, Q.; Alizon, S.; Choisy, M.; Sofonea, M.

(2) Methods: In the synthetic procedures, Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was applied as a key synthetic step for introducing a 1,2,3-triazole ring as a part of a junction unit in the molecular ribbons. (3) Results: The antimicrobial activity, antiviral activity, and cytotoxicity of the prepared compounds were studied. Most of the molecular ribbons showed antimicrobial activity, especially on Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis, with a 50–90% inhibition effect (c = 25 µg·mL(−1)). No target compound was effective against HSV-1, but 8a displayed activity against HIV-1 (EC(50) = 50.6 ± 7.8 µM). Cytotoxicity was tested on several cancer cell lines, and 6d showed cytotoxicity in the malignant melanoma cancer cell line (G-361; IC(50) = 20.0 ± 0.6 µM). Physicochemical characteristics of the prepared compounds were investigated, namely a formation of supramolecular gels and a self-assembly potential in general, with positive results achieved with several target compounds.

682090,Enzyme Therapy: Current Challenges and Future Perspectives,2021-08-25,"Smallholder farmer and tribal communities are often characterised as marginalised and highly vulnerable to emerging zoonotic diseases due to their relatively poor access to healthcare, worse-off health outcomes, proximity to sources of disease risks, and their social and livelihood organisation. Yet, access to relevant and timely disease information that could strengthen their adaptive capacity remain challenging and poorly characterised in the empirical literature. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the role of disease information in shaping the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmer and tribal groups to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever. We carried out household surveys (n = 229) and in-depth interviews (n = 25) in two affected districts–Shimoga and Wayanad–in the Western Ghats region. Our findings suggest that, despite the generally limited awareness about KFD, access to disease information improved households’ propensity to implement adaptation strategies relative to households that had no access to it. Of the variety of adaptation strategies implemented, vaccination, avoiding forest visits, wearing of protective clothing and footwear, application of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil and income diversification were identified by respondents as important adaptive measures during the outbreak seasons. Even so, we identified significant differences between individuals in exposure to disease information and its contribution to substantive adaptive action. Households reported several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including, lack of disease information, low efficacy of existing vaccine, distrust, religio-cultural sentiments, and livelihood concerns. We also found that informal information sharing presented a promising avenue from a health extension perspective albeit with trade-offs with potential distortion of the messages through misinformation and/or reporting bias. Altogether, our findings stress the importance of contextualising disease information and implementing interventions in a participatory way that sufficiently addresses the social determinants of health in order to bolster households’ adaptive capacity to KFD and other neglected endemic zoonoses.","Asaaga, Festus A.; Rahman, Mujeeb; Kalegowda, Suresh D.; Mathapati, Jagadeesh; Savanur, Irfanahemad; Srinivas, Prashanth N.; Seshadri, Tanya; Narayanswamy, Darshan; Kiran, Shivani K.; Oommen, Meera A.; Young, Juliette C.; Purse, Bethan V.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705400/,174

Minimally invasive robotic HPB surgeries including robotic whipple and major hepatectomies are resource intense. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges in terms of resources and patient safety. We evaluate outcomes of patients undergoing Robotic HPB oncology surgery at high volume community center during COVID-19 pandemic Methods: All patients undergoing robotic HPB and foregut surgery for malignancies from March 2020 to January 2021 were included. Non-malignant indications were excluded. Mortality, morbidity, length of stay and oncologic outcomes were evaluated. Nosocomial COVID-19 infection and mortality and morbidity associated with it were evaluated separately Results: 33 patients were included out of which 22 of which were robotic and others included laparoscopy and hybrid approaches Surgeries included robotic whipple, robotic major hepatectomies, robotic gastrectomies, robotic duodenal resection, robotic biliary and gastric bypass surgery. Clavien III/IV morbidity was 6.5%. There was no post-operative respiratory failure or 30-day mortality. No patients were diagnosed with COVID 19 in the postoperative setting and none developed symptoms in the 30-day post-operative period. All patients were cared for in dedicated non COVID units and were discharged home or COVID free rehab centers. All patients who needed adjuvant treatment received it in a timely setting. Conclusion: Although COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity in the general setting and data has demonstrated worse outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in the post-operative period, we describe in this case series that with COVID safety protocols and preoperative testing, even complex and resource intense surgeries like robotic HPB surgeries can be performed safely in a community hospital setting with significant resource limitations.","Siddiqui, I.",HPB,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1365182X21005323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1365182X21005323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2021.06.361,174

686297,Conventional and Unconventional Approaches for Innovative Drug Treatments in COVID-19: Looking Outside of Plato’s Cave,2021-07-05,"African swine fever (ASF), caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a devastating infectious disease of domestic pigs and wild boars, and has tremendous negative socioeconomic impact on the swine industry and food security worldwide. It is characterized as a notifiable disease by World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). No effective vaccine or treatment against ASF has so far been available. Early detection and rapid diagnosis are of potential significance to control the spread of ASF. Recombinase-based isothermal amplification assay, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) developed by TwistDx (Cambridge, United Kingdom) or recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) by Qitian (Wuxi, China), is becoming a molecular tool for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of multiple pathogens. In this study, we aim to investigate if RPA/RAA can be a potential candidate for on-site, rapid and primary detection of ASFV. A panel of 152 clinical samples previously well-characterized by OIE-recommended qPCR was enrolled in this study, including 20 weak positive (Ct value ≥ 30) samples. This panel was consisted of different types, such as EDTA-blood, spleen, lung, lymph node, kidney, tonsil, liver, brain. We evaluated two recombinase-based isothermal amplification assays, RPA or RAA, by targeting the ASFV B646L gene (p72), and validated the clinical performance in comparison with OIE real-time PCR. Our result showed that the analytical sensitivity of RPA and RAA was as 93.4 and 53.6 copies per reaction, respectively at 95% probability in 16 min, at 39°C. They were universally specific for all 24 genotypes of ASFV and no cross reaction to other pathogens including Classical swine fever virus (CSV), Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), Pseudorabies virus, Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV). The results on detection of various kinds of clinical samples indicated an excellent diagnostic agreement between RPA, RAA and OIE real-time PCR method, with the kappa value of 0.960 and 0.973, respectively. Compared to real-time PCR, the specificity of both RPA and RAA was 100% (94.40% ∼ 100%, 95% CI), while the sensitivity was 96.59% (90.36% ∼ 99.29%, 95% CI) and 97.73% (92.03% ∼ 99.72%, 95% CI), respectively. Our data demonstrate that the developed recombinase-based amplification assay (RPA/RAA), promisingly equipped with field-deployable instruments, offers a sensitive and specific platform for the rapid and reliable detection of ASFV, especially in the resource-limited settings for the purpose of screening and surveillance of ASF.","Fan, Xiaoxu; Li, Lin; Zhao, Yonggang; Liu, Yutian; Liu, Chunju; Wang, Qinghua; Dong, Yaqin; Wang, Shujuan; Chi, Tianying; Song, Fangfang; Sun, Chengyou; Wang, Yingli; Ha, Dengchuriya; Zhao, Yang; Bao, Jingyue; Wu, Xiaodong; Wang, Zhiliang",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32793160/,174

We screened a panel of already-approved drugs in a cell culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and identified two new agents having higher antiviral potentials than the drug candidates such as Remdesivir and Chroloquine in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells: the anti-inflammatory drug Cepharanthine and HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir. Cepharanthine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry through the blocking of viral binding to target cells, whilst Nelfinavir suppressed viral replication partly by protease inhibition. Consistent with their different modes of action, synergistic effect of this combined treatment to limit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation was highlighted. Mathematical modeling in vitro antiviral activity coupled with the calculated total drug concentrations in the lung predicts that Nelfinavir will shorten the period until viral clearance by 4.9-days and the combining Cepharanthine/Nelfinavir enhanced their predicted efficacy. These results warrant further evaluation of the potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Cepharanthine and Nelfinavir.","Ohashi, Hirofumi; Watashi, Koichi; Saso, Wakana; Shionoya, Kaho; Iwanami, Shoya; Hirokawa, Takatsugu; Shirai, Tsuyoshi; Kanaya, Shigehiko; Ito, Yusuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Nomura, Takao; Suzuki, Tateki; Nishioka, Kazane; Ando, Shuji; Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Tanaka, Tomohiro; Aoki, Shin; Kuramochi, Kouji; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hashiguchi, Takao; Maenaka, Katsumi; Matano, Tetsuro; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Saijo, Masayuki; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Iwami, Shingo; Takeda, Makoto; McKeating, Jane A.; Wakita, Takaji",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817567/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004221003357; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221003357?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102367,174

This interest, in part, is supported by the fact that the main outcome of DNA-responses is production of type I interferon (IFN-I), which, if produced in excessive amounts, leads to various pathologies. STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) is positioned in the center of these responses and is activated either via direct sensing of second messengers or via interaction with upstream sensors of dsDNA. STING mediates responses to pathogens as well as host-derived DNA and is, therefore, linked to various autoimmune diseases, cancer predisposition and ageing. Recent mouse models of DNA damage showed the adaptor STING to be crucial for heightened resting levels of IFN-I. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in understanding the regulation of STING-signaling and identification of its novel components.","Surpris, Guy; Poltorak, Alexander",Current Opinion in Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27414485/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4983512?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527416300698; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2016.05.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1369527416300698,174

Here, we examine the interplay between the genetic neuronopathic Gaucher’s disease (nGD), and neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI) infection. Infection of nGD mice with SVNI had no influence on nGD severity. However, nGD mice were more resistant to SVNI infection. Significantly different inflammatory responses were seen in nGD brains when compared with SVNI brains: the inflammatory response in the nGD brains consisted of reactive astrocytes and microglia with no infiltrating macrophages, but the inflammatory response in the brains of SVNI-infected mice was characterized by infiltration of macrophages and altered activation of microglia and astrocytes. We suggest that the innate immune response activated in nGD confers resistance against viral infection of the CNS.

Although the value and effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in severe respiratory illness from COVID-19 remains unclear at this time, there is emerging evidence suggesting that it could be utilized as an ultimate treatment in appropriately selected patients not responding to conventional care. We present a case of a 32-year-old COVID-19 positive male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was intubated for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient’s hypoxemia failed to improve despite positive pressure ventilation, prone positioning, and use of neuromuscular blockade for ventilator asynchrony. He was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team for considering ECMO for refractory ARDS. He was initiated on venovenous ECMO via dual-site cannulation performed at the bedside. Although his ECMO course was complicated by bleeding, he showed a remarkable improvement in his lung function. ECMO was successfully decannulated after 17 days of initiation. The patient was discharged home after 47 days of hospitalization without any supplemental oxygen and was able to undergo active physical rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative in the initiation and management of ECMO in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. While ECMO is labor-intensive, using it in the right phenotype and in specialized centers may lead to positive results. Patients who are young, with fewer comorbidities and single organ dysfunction portray a better prognosis for patients in which ECMO is utilized.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Farr, Lyndie A.; Saeed, Muhammad Ahsan; Hooten, Rorak; Baus, Joseph; Boer, Brian",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911986/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2324709620957778,174
