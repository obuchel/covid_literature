931,931,931,Serum Levels of Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin as Indicator of the Inflammatory Status in Coronary Artery Disease,16.025957,9.902918,2012-09-04,"Background. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the acute clinical manifestations represent acute on chronic inflammation. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is found in the granules of human neutrophils, with many diverse functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the inflammatory process in various stages of coronary artery disease. Methods. We studied 140 patients, with SA 40, UA 35, NSTEMI 40, and STEMI 25, and 20 healthy controls. Serum NGAL was measured upon admission and before coronary angiography. Results. Significant differences were observed in median serum-NGAL(ng/mL) between patients with SA (79.23 (IQR, 37.50–100.32)), when compared with UA (108.00 (68.34–177.59)), NSTEMI (166.49 (109.24–247.20)), and STEMI (178.63 (111.18–305.92)) patients and controls (50.31 (44.30–69.78)) with significant incremental value from SA to STEMI. We observed a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP (spearman coefficient rho = 0.685, P < 0.0001) as well as with neutrophil counts (r = 0.511, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. In patients with coronary artery disease serum levels of NGAL increase and reflect the degree of inflammatory process. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, serum levels of NGAL have high negative predictive value and reflecting the inflammatory status could show the severity of coronary clinical syndrome.","Kafkas, Nikolaos; Demponeras, Christos; Zoubouloglou, Filitsa; Spanou, Loukia; Babalis, Dimitrios; Makris, Konstantinos",Int J Inflam,248,17
1013,1013,1013,Infant Pertussis and Household Transmission in Korea,16.076765,9.988606,2012-12-07,"A recent resurgence of pertussis has raised public health concerns even in developed countries with high vaccination coverage. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of infant pertussis, and to determine the relative importance of household transmission in Korea. The multicenter study was prospectively conducted from January 2009 to September 2011. We identified the demographic and clinical data from these patients and performed the diagnostic tests for pertussis in their household contacts. Twenty-one patients with confirmed pertussis were included in the analysis. All infections occurred in infants younger than 6 months of age (mean age, 2.5 months) who had not completed the primary DTaP vaccination except for one patient. Infants without immunization history had a significant higher lymphocytosis and longer duration of hospital stay compared to those with immunization. All were diagnosed with PCR (100%), however, culture tests showed the lowest sensitivity (42.9%). Presumed source of infection in household contacts was documented in 85.7%, mainly parents (52.6%). Pertussis had a major morbidity in young infants who were not fully immunized. Household members were responsible for pertussis transmission of infants in whom a source could be identified. The control of pertussis through booster vaccination with Tdap in family who is taking care of young infants is necessary in Korea.","Kwon, Hyo Jin; Yum, Sook Kyung; Choi, Ui Yoon; Lee, Soo Young; Kim, Jong Hyun; Kang, Jin Han",J Korean Med Sci,248,22
1395,1395,1395,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 as a Therapeutic Target for Heart Failure,16.311321,10.238384,2013-11-30,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disorders. Angiotensin II (Ang-II), the final product of this pathway, is known for its vasoconstrictive and proliferative effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a newly discovered homolog of ACE, plays a key role as the central negative regulator of the RAS. It diverts the generation of vasoactive Ang-II into the vasodilatory and growth inhibiting peptide angiotensin(1–7) [Ang(1–7)], thereby providing counter-regulatory responses to neurohormonal activation. There is substantial experimental evidence evaluating the role of ACE2/Ang(1–7) in hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. In this review, we aim to focus on the conceptual facts of the ACE2-Ang(1–7) axis with regards to clinical implications and therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disorders, with emphasis on the potential therapeutic role in cardiovascular diseases.","Chamsi-Pasha, Mohammed A.

1990,1990,1990,Prognosis of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia correlates with perivascular CD4+ T lymphocyte infiltration of the lung,15.918257,9.919645,2015-10-24,"BACKGROUND: Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterized by interstitial infiltration of T lymphocytes, and subpopulations of these cells may be associated with the progression of fibrosis. However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 ± 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883–0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP correlated with prognosis. The underlying mechanisms are unknown and require further studies.

2801,2801,2801,Intravenous superoxide dismutase as a protective agent to prevent impairment of lung function induced by high tidal volume ventilation,16.079823,10.267682,2017-07-26,"BACKGROUND: Positive-pressure mechanical ventilation is essential in assisting patients with respiratory failure in the intensive care unit and facilitating oxygenation in the operating room. However, it was also recognized as a primary factor leading to hospital-acquired pulmonary dysfunction, in which pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation had been known to play important roles. Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidant, and possesses anti-inflammatory capacity. In this study, we aimed to study the efficacy of Cu/Zn SOD, administered intravenously during high tidal volume (HTV) ventilation, to prevent impairment of lung function. METHODS: Thirty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: 5 h ventilation with (A) low tidal volume (LTV; 8 mL/kg; n = 10), (B) high tidal volume (HTV; 18 mL/kg; n = 14), or (C) HTV and intravenous treatment of Cu/Zn SOD at a dose of 1000 U/kg/h (HTV + SOD; n = 14). Lung function was evaluated both at baseline and after 5-h ventilation. Lung injury was assessed by histological examination, lung water and protein contents in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Pulmonary oxidative stress was examined by concentrations of methylguanidine (MG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in BALF, and antioxidative activity by protein expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in the lung. Severity of lung inflammation was evaluated by white blood cell and differential count in BALF, and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and mRNA expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in the lung. We also examined protein expression of surfactant protein (SP)-A and D and we measured hourly changes in serum nitric oxide (NO) level. RESULTS: Five hours of LTV ventilation did not induce a major change in lung function, whereas 5 h of HTV ventilation induced apparent combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorder, together with increased pulmonary oxidative stress, decreased anti-oxidative activity and increased lung inflammation (P < 0.05). HTV ventilation also decreased SP-A and SP-D expression and suppressed serum NO level during the time course of ventilation. Cu/Zn SOD administered intravenously during HTV ventilation effectively reversed associated pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation (P < 0.05); moreover, it preserved SP-A and SP-D expressions in the lung and increased serum nitric oxide (NO) level, enhancing vascular NO bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: HTV ventilation can induce combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorders. Intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD during HTV ventilation can prevent lung function impairment and lung injury via reducing pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation, preserving pulmonary surfactant expression, and enhancing vascular NO bioavailability.","Wu, Nan-Chun; Liao, Fan-Ting; Cheng, Hao-min; Sung, Shih-Hsien; Yang, Yu-Chun; Wang, Jiun-Jr",BMC Pulm Med,248,22
3163,3163,3163,Acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia following lung transplantation is associated with severe allograft dysfunction and poor outcome: a case series,16.083803,9.98979,2015-12-01,"Acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia (AFOP) is a histopathologic variant of acute lung injury that has been associated with infection and inflammatory disorders and has been reported as a complication of lung transplantation. A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients transplanted at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics from January 1995 to December 2013 (n = 561). We identified 6 recipients whose clinical course was complicated by AFOP. All recipients were found to have AFOP on lung biopsy or at post-mortem examination, and 5 of the 6 patients suffered progressive allograft dysfunction that led to fatal outcome. Only 1 of the 6 patients stabilised with augmented immunosuppression and had subsequent improvement and stabilisation of allograft function. We could not clearly identify any specific cause of AFOP, such as drug toxicity or infection. Lung transplantation can be complicated by lung injury with an AFOP pattern on histopathologic examination of lung biopsy specimens. The presence of an AFOP pattern was associated with irreversible decline in lung function that was refractory to therapeutic interventions in 5 of our 6 cases and was associated with severe allograft dysfunction and death in these 5 individuals. AFOP should be considered as a potential diagnosis when lung transplant recipients develop progressive decline in lung function that is consistent with a clinical diagnosis of chronic lung allograft dysfunction.","Meyer, Keith C.; Bierach, Jennifer; Kanne, Jeffrey; Torrealba, Jose R.; De Oliveira, Nilto C.",Pneumonia (Nathan),248,1

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study, and children with CHD who underwent open-heart surgeries at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2018 were included. The baseline characteristics of these patients of different ages, including neonates (0–1 months old), infants (1–12 months old) and children (1–10 years old), were analyzed, and the association of risk factors with postoperative nosocomial infection were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 11,651 subjects were included in the study. The overall nosocomial infection rate was 10.8%. Nosocomial infection rates in neonates, infants, and children with congenital heart disease were 32.9, 15.4, and 5.2%, respectively.

These frameworks are based on assumptions that marks are conserved and animals are present at the sampling location over the entire duration of the study.

We use 22 years of photographic data from aggregation sites in central California to support the use of dorsal fin morphology as long-term individual identifiers. We identified five individuals over 16–22 years, which support the use of dorsal fins as long-time individual identifiers, illustrate strong yearly site fidelity to coastal aggregation sites across extended time periods (decades), and provide the first empirical validation of white shark longevity >22 years.

The utility of self-management has been proven in certain chronic conditions. However, very little work has been undertaken regarding self-management in people with dementia. METHODS: The SHAPE trial will include 372 people with mild to moderate dementia to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an educational programme combining approaches of self-management, health promotion, and e-learning for care partners. The study is a multi-site, single-randomised, controlled, single-blinded trial with parallel arms. The intervention arm is compared with treatment as usual. The intervention comprises a 10-week course delivered as group sessions for the participants with dementia. The sessions are designed to develop self-management skills and to provide information on the nature of the condition and the development of healthy behaviours in a supportive learning environment. An e-learning course will be provided for care partners which covers similar and complementary material to that discussed in the group sessions for the participant with dementia. DISCUSSION: This trial will explore the effect of the SHAPE group intervention on people with mild to moderate dementia in terms of self-efficacy and improvement in key health and mental health outcomes and cost-effectiveness, along with carer stress and knowledge of dementia.

This systematic review aimed at identifying the common psychosocial factors that predict the subjective and psychological well-being in RTW processes after having a long-standing health problem or disability. Objective: To evaluate the subjective and psychological well-being at work of employees with chronic or long-standing health problems or those returning to work after any cause of disability. Data source: Systematic review of articles published in English or Spanish using PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, Psychology, and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and Pubpsych. An additional study was identified by contacting expert academics in the field. The search equations used included terms such as Return to Work, Long-Standing Health Problems or Disability, Work Health Balance, and job satisfaction or subjective well-being. Eligibility criteria for the studies: Studies that included a measure of employees’ well-being at work following return to work were selected for the review. Evaluation of the studies and synthesis methods: The studies were selected using predefined fields which included quality criteria. Results: Of the 264 articles returned by the initial search, a total of 20 were finally selected. Results were organized around the three different theoretical approaches for understanding RTW and its antecedents and consequences: (a) RTW and autonomy at work have a positive effect on psychological well-being; (b) job demand is linked to less job satisfaction, whereas a higher level on the work–health balance is associated with job satisfaction and work engagement; (c) internal and external support is linked to job satisfaction in the case of a disease. Limitations: The evidence provided by the results is restricted by the limited availability of studies focusing on well-being at work following return to work. Moreover, the studies identified are of different kinds, thereby preventing comparisons. Conclusions and implications of the main findings: Employees’ subjective well-being after return to work has received very little attention to date.

Knowing the level of this and the factors that influence or not their dynamic represents a challenge, due to the degree of complexity and specificity of the elements involved. The aim of this study was to analyze predictors of patient safety culture in public and private hospitals and examining the factors that contribute to it, constructing a new and specific theoretical and methodological model. This study was carried out by reviewing medical records, detecting healthcare professionals directly involved in caring (N = 588), for patients in 2 public hospitals and 2 private hospitals in Venezuela (N = 566), conducting an “Analysis of Patient Safety Culture” questionnaire. The results were subsequently analyzed, derived 3 predictors factors and using a Patient Safety Culture Index (PSCI) for specific determination to evaluate patient safety culture level. The analysis showed that all hospitals had a “moderately unfavorable” PSCI (public = 52.96, private = 52.67, sig = 0.90). The PSCI was calculated by assessing the weight of the following factors in the index: occupational factors (factor loading = 32.03), communication factors (factor loading = 11.83), and organizational factors (factor loading = 9.10). Traumatology presented the lowest PSCI of all the care units, falling into the “unfavorable” category (36.48), and Laboratory the highest (70.02) (sig = 0.174), falling into the “moderately favorable” category. When analyzing professional groups, nurses had the highest PSCI, with a “moderately unfavorable” rating (PSCI = 61.1) and medical residents the lowest, falling into the “unfavorable” category (35.2). Adverse event reporting is determined by “management expectations and actions” (sig = 0.048) and “direct interaction with the patient” (sig = 0.049). The use of this theoretical and methodological approach in other contexts may provide a more objective system for identifying more specific needs and factors that influence in patient safety culture, and consequently, opportunities for improvement when constructing a patient safety culture in healthcare institutions.

Smooth muscle cells (SMCs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are involved in the maturation process of the newly formed vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) treatment could enhance pericyte-like properties of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and how TGF-β1-treated DPSCs for 7 days (T-DPSCs) stabilize the newly formed blood vessels. METHODS: We utilized TGF-β1 to treat DPSCs for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the expression of SMC markers. Functional contraction assay was conducted to assess the contractility of T-DPSCs. The effects of T-DPSC-conditioned media (T-DPSC-CM) on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration were examined by MTT, wound healing, and trans-well migration assay. Most importantly, in vitro 3D co-culture spheroidal sprouting assay was used to investigate the regulating role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 signaling on angiogenic sprouting in 3D co-cultured spheroids of HUVECs and T-DPSCs. Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and VEGF were used to treat the co-cultured spheroids to explore their roles in angiogenic sprouting. Inhibitors for Tie2 and VEGFR2 were used to block Ang1/Tie2 and VFGF/VEGFR2 signaling. RESULTS: Western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that the expression of SMC-specific markers (α-SMA and SM22α) were significantly increased after treatment with TGF-β1. Contractility of T-DPSCs was greater compared with that of DPSCs. T-DPSC-CM inhibited HUVEC migration. In vitro sprouting assay demonstrated that T-DPSCs enclosed HUVECs, resembling pericyte-like cells. Compared to co-culture with DPSCs, a smaller number of HUVEC sprouting was observed when co-cultured with T-DPSCs. VEGF and Ang2 co-stimulation significantly enhanced sprouting in HUVEC and T-DPSC co-culture spheroids, whereas VEGF or Ang2 alone exerted insignificant effects on HUVEC sprouting. Blocking Tie2 signaling reversed the sprouting inhibition by T-DPSCs, while blocking VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling boosted the sprouting inhibition by T-DPSCs.

Growing evidence also implicates role of lysosome-related mechanisms in pathologic process. In this review, we discuss physiological function of lysosomes and, more importantly, how the homeostasis of lysosomes is disrupted in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, lysosomal storage disorders, and malignant tumors. In atherosclerosis and Gaucher disease, dysfunction of lysosomes changes cytokine secretion from macrophages, partially through inflammasome activation. In neurodegenerative diseases, defect autophagy facilitates accumulation of toxic protein and dysfunctional organelles leading to neuron death. Lysosomal dysfunction has been demonstrated in pathology of pancreatitis. Abnormal autophagy activation or inhibition has been revealed in autoimmune disorders. In tumor microenvironment, malignant phenotypes, including tumorigenesis, growth regulation, invasion, drug resistance, and radiotherapy resistance, of tumor cells and behaviors of tumor-associated macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and T cells are also mediated by lysosomes. Based on these findings, a series of therapeutic methods targeting lysosomal proteins and processes have been developed from bench to bedside. In a word, present researches corroborate lysosomes to be pivotal organelles for understanding pathology of atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, pancreatitis, and lysosomal storage disorders, and malignant tumors and developing novel therapeutic strategies.","Zhang, Ziqi; Yue, Pengfei; Lu, Tianqi; Wang, Yang; Wei, Yuquan; Wei, Xiawei",J Hematol Oncol,248,33

We sought to examine the longitudinal association of medication risk score with mortality. This retrospective cohort study included patients whose data were available through electronic health records from multiple health care organizations in the United States that provided data as part of a Patient Safety Organization. Patients were included if they had ≥1 visit and ≥1 medication in their record between January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2017. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between continuous and categorized medication risk score with all-cause mortality. Among 427,103 patients, the median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 29–64 years); 61% were female; 50% were White, 11% were Black, and 38% were Hispanic; and 6873 had a death date recorded. Patients 30 to 49 years old had the highest hazard ratios (HRs), followed by the 50- to 64-year-olds and lastly those 65 years or older. Controlling for all covariates, 30- to 49-year-olds with a score of 20 to 30 (versus <10) had a 604% increase in the hazard of death (HR, 7.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.86–12.85), 50- to 64-year-olds had a 254% increase (HR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.71–4.63), and ≥65-year-olds had an 87% increase (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.67–2.09). The medication risk score was independently associated with death, adjusting for multimorbidities and other conditions. Risk was found to vary by age group and score. Results suggest that pharmaceutical interventions among those with elevated scores could improve medication safety for patients taking multiple medications.","Ratigan, Amanda Rondinelli; Michaud, Veronique; Turgeon, Jacques; Bikmetov, Ravil; Gaona Villarreal, Gabriela; Anderson, Heather D.; Pulver, Gerald; Pace, Wilson D.",J Patient Saf,248,3

The present study reported the facile synthesis of anticancer bioactive peptide (ACBP)-functionalized selenium (ACBP-S-Se) particles with enhanced anticancer activities and a detailed mechanistic evaluation of their ability to regulate oxidative stress in vitro. Structural and chemical characterizations were revealed by ultraviolet absorption, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron, nuclear magnetic resonance carbon and hydrogen, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Sulfhydrylation modifications of ACBP were achieved with Sacetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride via chemical absorption. After the polypeptide was modified by sulfhydrylation, the ACBP chain was linked to sulfhydryl groups by amide bonds to form the ACBP-chelated selenium complex. Two gastric cancer cell lines (MKN-45 and MKN-74 cells) demonstrated high susceptibility to ACBP-S-Se particles and displayed significantly decreased proliferation ability following treatment. The results suggested that the bioactive peptide-chelated selenium particles effectively inhibited the proliferation of MKN-45 and MKN-74 cells in vitro. The genes encoding CDK inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), cyclin B1, thioredoxin (TXN) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 are associated with regulation of oxidative stress, while CDKN1A and TXN protect cells by decreasing oxidative stress and promoting cell growth arrest. Therefore, ACBP-S-Se may be an ideal chemotherapeutic candidate for human cancer, especially gastric cancer.","Li, Xian; Wang, Xianjue; Liu, Gang; Xu, Yanan; Wu, Xinlin; Yi, Ru; Jin, Feng; Sa, Chula; Su, Xiulan",Int J Mol Med,248,11

Amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) possess embryonic-like proliferation ability and multipotent differentiation potential. Despite the simple isolation procedure, inter-individual variability and different isolation steps can cause differences in isolation yield and cell proliferation ability, compromising reproducibility observations among centers and further applications. We investigated the use of a new technology as a diagnostic tool for quality control on stem cell isolation. The instrument label-free separates cells based on their physical characteristics and, thanks to a micro-camera, generates a live fractogram, the fingerprint of the sample. Eight amniotic membranes were processed by trypsin enzymatic treatment and immediately analysed. Two types of profile were generated: a monomodal and a bimodal curve. The first one represented the unsuccessful isolation with all recovered cell not attaching to the plate; while for the second type, the isolation process was successful, but we discovered that only cells in the second peak were alive and resulted adherent. We optimized a Quality Control (QC) method to define the success of AEC isolation using the fractogram generated. This predictive outcome is an interesting tool for laboratories and cell banks that isolate and cryopreserve fetal annex stem cells for research and future clinical applications.","Zia, Silvia; Martini, Giulia; Pizzuti, Valeria; Maggio, Alessia; Simonazzi, Giuliana; Reschiglian, Pierluigi; Bonsi, Laura; Alviano, Francesco; Roda, Barbara; Zattoni, Andrea",Micromachines (Basel),248,17

Using a targeted proteomic approach, we aimed to identify circulating biomarkers associated with early stages of heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 575 community‐based participants (mean age, 57 years; 51.7% women) underwent echocardiography and proteomic profiling (CVD II panel, Olink Proteomics). We applied partial least squares‐discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA) and a machine learning algorithm [eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)] to identify key proteins associated with echocardiographic abnormalities. We used Gaussian mixture modelling for unbiased clustering to construct phenogroups based on influential proteins in PLS‐DA and XGBoost. Of 87 proteins, 13 were important in PLS‐DA and XGBoost modelling for detection of left ventricular remodelling, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and/or left atrial reservoir dysfunction: placental growth factor, kidney injury molecule‐1, prostasin, angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2, galectin‐9, cathepsin L1, matrix metalloproteinase‐7, tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily members 10A, 10B, and 11A, interleukins 6 and 16, and α1‐microglobulin/bikunin precursor. Based on these proteins, the clustering algorithm divided the cohort into two distinct phenogroups, with each cluster grouping individuals with a similar protein profile. Participants belonging to the second cluster (n = 118) were characterized by an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and adverse cardiac structure and function. The adjusted risk of presenting echocardiographic abnormalities was higher in this phenogroup than in the other (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified proteins related to renal function, extracellular matrix remodelling, angiogenesis, and inflammation to be associated with echocardiographic signs of early‐stage heart failure. Proteomic phenomapping discriminated individuals at high risk for cardiac remodelling and dysfunction.","Cauwenberghs, Nicholas; Sabovčik, František; Magnus, Alessio; Haddad, Francois; Kuznetsova, Tatiana",ESC Heart Fail,248,17

Bioactive molecules in tick saliva facilitate prolonged blood-feeding and transmission of tick-borne pathogens to the vertebrate host. Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a newly reported food allergy, is believed to be induced by saliva proteins decorated with a sugar molecule, the oligosaccharide galactose-⍺-1,3-galactose (α-gal). This syndrome is characterized by an IgE antibody-directed hypersensitivity against α-gal. The α-gal antigen was discovered in the salivary glands and saliva of various tick species including, the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). The underlying immune mechanisms linking tick bites with α-gal-specific IgE production are poorly understood and are crucial to identify and establish novel treatments for this disease.

How monocytes alter their functions to convey immune tolerance in the context of lower respiratory tract infections in humans is not well understood. Here, we sought to identify epigenetic and transcriptomic features of cytokine production capacity in circulating monocytes during community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: Circulating CD14+ monocytes were obtained from the blood of CAP patients included in a longitudinal, observational cohort study, on hospitalization (acute stage, n=75), and from the same patients after a 1-month follow-up (recovery stage, n=56). Age and sex-matched non-infectious participants were included as controls (n=41). Ex vivo cytokine production after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure was assessed by multiplex assay. Transcriptomes of circulating monocytes were generated by RNA-sequencing, and DNA methylation levels in the same monocytes were measured by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Data were integrated by fitting projection-to-latent-structure models, and signatures derived by partial least squares discrimination. RESULTS: Monocytes captured during the acute stage exhibited impaired TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 production after ex vivo stimulation with LPS, relative to controls. IL-6 production was not resolved in recovery monocytes. Multivariate analysis of RNA-sequencing data identified 2938 significantly altered RNA transcripts in acute-stage monocytes (fold expression ≤−1.5 or ≥1.5; adjusted p ≤ 0.01), relative to controls. Comparing DNA methylation levels in circulating monocytes of CAP patients to controls revealed minimal differences, specifically in DNAse hypersensitive sites (HS) of acute-stage monocytes. Data integration identified a cholesterol biosynthesis gene signature and DNAse HS axis of IL-1β and IL-10 production (R(2) =0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating monocytes obtained from CAP patients during the acute stage exhibited impaired cytokine production capacities, indicative of reprogramming to a state of immune tolerance, which was not fully resolved after 1 month. Our split-sample study showed that 51% of the immune tolerance phenotype can be explained, at least in part, by coordinated shifts in cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression and DNAse HS methylation levels. A multi-scale model identified an epigenetic and transcriptomic signature of immune tolerance in monocytes, with implications for future interventions in immunosuppression.

While required for protective immunity, infection-induced inflammation can be detrimental if it is not properly controlled, causing collateral body damage and potentially leading to death. It is in this context that the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) is required to dampen the pro-inflammatory immune response that hallmarks trypanosomosis. Effective control of this infection requires not just the action of antibodies specific for the parasite's variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat antigens, but also a pro-inflammatory immune response mediated mainly by IFNγ, TNF, and NO. However, strict control of inflammation is mandatory, as IL-10-deficient mice succumb from an unrestrained cytokine storm within 10 days of a Trypanosome brucei infection. The relevant cellular source of IL-10 and the associated molecular mechanisms implicated in its trypanosomosis associated production are poorly understood. Using an IL-10 reporter mouse strain (Vert-X), we demonstrate here that NK cells, CD8(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells as well as B cells and plasma cells constitute potential cellular sources of IL-10 within the spleen and liver during acute infection. The IL-10 wave follows peak pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which accompanied the control of peak parasitemia. Similar results were observed following conventional experimental needle infection and physiological infections via T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Our results show that conditional T cell-specific ablation of the IL-10 regulating Prdm1 gene (encoding for the Blimp-1 transcription factor), leads to an uncontrolled trypanosome-induced pro-inflammatory syndrome like the one observed in infected IL-10-deficient mice. This result indicates that the biological role of IL-10-derived from non-T cells, including NK cells, is of minor importance when considering host survival. The cytokine IL-27 that is also considered to be an IL-10 regulator, did not affect IL-10 production during infection. Together, these data suggest that T. brucei activates a Blimp-1-dependent IL-10 regulatory pathway in T cells that acts as a critical anti-inflammatory rheostat, mandatory for host survival during the acute phase of parasitemia.","De Trez, Carl; Stijlemans, Benoit; Bockstal, Viki; Cnops, Jennifer; Korf, Hannelie; Van Snick, Jacques; Caljon, Guy; Muraille, Eric; Humphreys, Ian R.; Boon, Louis; Van Ginderachter, Jo A.; Magez, Stefan",Front Immunol,248,0

In a time where we are only beginning to witness artificial intelligence’s disruption of work and the economy, these learning outcomes are crucial to personal and professional success. This paper begins by tracing the role of the Discussion Method within the liberal arts tradition, and by extension the Confucian tradition. Second, this paper examines how the Discussion Method lost its value in higher education as a consequence of the employability problem. In this section, the employability problem is defined as a two-fold misunderstanding among students and parents regarding the purpose of education and how to prepare for the workplace. Third, this paper reframes the purpose of the Discussion Method in an integrated curriculum for preparing students to achieve personal and professional success. Also, in the third section, student generated data serve as evidence to support the argument that (1) discussion-based classes are an important missing element in undergraduate management education and (2) discussion-based classes are superior to large lectures. This paper concludes that a discussion-based business pedagogy anchored by the liberal arts and sciences leads to eight major learning outcomes: (1) how to reconcile opposing arguments; (2) how to think on one’s own two feet; (3) how to formulate cohesive arguments to reach a consensus; (4) how to mitigate fear of sharing individual opinions by building relationship among classmates; (5) how to allow students to learn better by motivating them to prepare more for class; (6) how to enable students to remain engaged during and after class; (7) how to embraces nuance; and (8) how to integrate new ideas from disparate perspectives and disciplines.","Ying, Jonathan",Humanist Manag J,248,0

Recent publications have alluded to increased disease activity during pregnancy, and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in patients with NMOSD. Our objective was to systematically review published literature to help counsel and manage women with NMOSD contemplating pregnancy. Methods: We searched five databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE, for English-language publications describing pregnancies in women with NMOSD. Article selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment using Joanna Briggs' critical appraisal tool for case reports and case series, were performed in duplicate. Pooled incidences were calculated where possible, and a narrative summary was provided. Results: Of 2,118 identified titles, 22 case reports and seven case series, representing 595 pregnancies in 389 women, were included. The mean maternal age was 28.12 ± 5.19 years. At least 20% of cases were first diagnosed during pregnancy. There were no maternal deaths. Pooled estimates for clinical outcomes could not be obtained due to inadequate reporting. NMOSD-related disability and relapses increased considerably during pregnancy and especially in the immediate postpartum period. Although a high proportion of early pregnancy losses were reported, an association with disease activity or therapeutic interventions could not be established. Apart from one publication which reported an increased risk of preeclampsia, there was no increase in adverse obstetric outcomes including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction or congenital malformations. Initial attacks and relapses were successfully managed with oral or intravenous corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and refractory cases with immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption. Conclusion: Increased NMOSD-related disability and relapses during pregnancy the postpartum period may respond to aggressive management with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, which are safely administered during pregnancy and lactation. Emerging safety data on monoclonal antibodies during pregnancy, make these attractive options, while intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption can be safely used to treat severe relapses. The complex interplay between NMOSD and pregnancy outcomes would be best understood through prospective analysis of data collected through an international registry.

Global personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages necessitate further studies looking at the correlation between PPE use and transmission of COVID-19 to healthcare workers (HCW). This study aims to provide data on test positivity rates of HCW wearing different PPE. METHODS: Retrospective Case Series. During the study period from Mar-Apr 2020, HCW were tested for SARS-CoV-2 if they 1) were exposed to COVID-19 case OR 2) had symptoms of potential COVID-19 disease per CDC criteria. Respirator masks defined as N95 or higher were used in high risk departments (Emergency and Urgent Care (ERUC), Medical/Surgical (MSU), and Intensive Care (ICU) units). Medical masks defined as surgical or procedural masks were used in low risk, outpatient departments. All departments used gowns, gloves, eye protection, and appropriate masks. RESULTS: In low risk departments, 124/1578 (7.9%) of HCW tested positive, compared to 118/1499 (7.9%) of HCW who worked in high risk departments (p=0.9886). In high risk departments, 55/626 of HCW who worked in MSU, 37/459 of HCW who worked in ERUC, and 26/414 who worked in ICU tested positive. In a logistic regression model comparing tested individuals in high risk departments to those in ambulatory settings, a slightly lower risk of a positive test among ICU employees (OR=0.786, CI=0.508–1.217) was found, and a similar risk among ERUC employees (OR=1.028, CI=0.701–1.508) and MSU employees (OR=1.129, CI=0.810–1.574) was found, but the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.5364). CONCLUSION: HCW in ambulatory settings who used medical masks did not test positive at a higher rate than providers in high risk departments using respirators. The slightly lower positive rate in ICU providers may suggest respirator masks are beneficial in settings with higher risk of aerosolizing generating procedures, or it maybe related to training and familiarity with infection control procedures. The level of mask used was equally appropriate across all risk level care settings, providing evidence for local strategies to optimize PPE stewardship based on department assignments while protecting HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some studies have reported an association where less than 800 CD4 + T cells are negatively related to the survival of seriously ill patients with COVID -19. METHODS: We included 19 patients admitted to our hospital (ABC Medical Center) from May 7 to 15, 2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and were randomized into 2 groups according to the severity of the presentation (severe or critical) A determination of CD4 + T cells was made at admission, we also reported the need for invasive mechanical ventilation at some point of the hospitalization for each group, all patients were followed until their hospital discharge. One patient was excluded because he was still admitted at the time of the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients included, 9 (50%) fulfilled criteria of severe and 9 (50%) of critical. The mean of CD4 + T cell was 455 (256–697) for the severe and 285.44 (145–430) for the critical (CI 95% P 0.46), the determination of CD8+ T cell was 212 (88–392) for the severe and 201 (59–534) for the critical (CI 95% P 1.19), of the critical patients 8 (88.9%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and only one non-invasive mechanical ventilation, while the severe patients only required support with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula (9 (100%)).The mean lenght of hospitalization was 12.73 days (3–34) and all the patients survived until they were discharged home. CONCLUSION: As it has been reported in some studies, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is associated with a reduction and functional exhaustion of T cells in patients with COVID-19.In this study we presume that lower levels of CD4+T cells can be associated with critical forms of COVID 19 as the majority of critical patients in our report had < 300 CD4 +T cell count, while we need further studies with a greater number of patients and follow-up to establish reliable determinations, we propose than the levels of CD4+T cell count could be use as a good predictor of severity in COVID-19 DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","Gomez-Gomez, Brenda; Espinosa-Aguilar, Luis; Garcia-Guerrero, Javier; Hoyo-Ulloa, Irma; Mendoza-Aguilar, Raquel; Moreno-Sanchez, Francisco; Acosta, Benjamin Valente; Ontañon-Zurita, Diego",Open Forum Infect Dis,248,0

During the course of a novel pandemic, multiple interventions are rapidly implemented to improve patient outcomes. When evaluating efficacy of individual interventions, one should account for the simultaneous improvements in knowledge and experience of healthcare providers (HCP), known as the maturation effect. We hypothesized that multiple processes rapidly implemented, along with the maturation effect would result in improved survival of COVID-19 patients hospitalized over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study was done at Henry Ford Hospital (HFH), a 900-bed tertiary care facility in Detroit, Michigan. The first COVID-19 patient was hospitalized on March 10, 2020 followed by a rapid surge of cases. We evaluated the trends of in-hospital case fatality rate of COVID-19 PCR positive patients through April 28, 2020. Time-points of sequential implementation of key measures for the management of COVID-19 patients were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1023 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized during the study period with 165 deaths (16 %). Case fatality rate during week one was 42% and down trended over time (Figure 1). Key measures were sequentially implemented over the course of the study period as shown in Figure 1. These included development and implementation of in-house PCR testing, dedicated infectious diseases COVID-19 rounding teams, treatment guidelines and algorithms, and early steroid use in hypoxic patients. Figure 2 demonstrates that despite the surge of COVID-19 admissions, mortality continued to improve over time. Figure 1. Trend line of all-cause in-house morality over time [Image: see text] Figure 2. Mortality by admission date over time [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Maturation effect takes into consideration that regardless of individual interventions, HCP improve their knowledge of the disease process and treatment over time leading to better outcomes. Our study shows the possibility of the maturation effect leading to improved survival in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The maturation effect should be accounted for when evaluating the effect of specific interventions for COVID-19.

These patients are thus predisposed to blood stream infections which can worsen outcomes. This risk may be aggravated by adjunctive therapies. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all adults admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital, NY, from March 1 to April 15, 2020 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (requiring high-ﬂow O(2)). Patients who received MV or died within 24h were excluded. Patients were followed until death or hospital discharge. We reviewed positive blood cultures (PBC) for pathogenic microorganisms, and calculated the incidence of bacteremia, rates of infective endocarditis (IE), and impact on mortality. Microbes isolated only once and belonging to groups defined as commensal skin microbiota were labelled as contaminants. We also examined the impact of adjunctive therapies with immunosuppressive potential (steroids and tocilizumab), on bacteremia. RESULTS: A total of 469 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included (Table 1). Of these, 199 (42.4%) required IC and 172 (36.7%) MV. Median length of stay was 13 days (8–22) and 94 (20.0%) had PBC. Of these, 43 were considered true pathogens (bacteremia), with predominance of E. faecalis and S. epidermidis, and 51 were considered contaminants (Table 2). The incidence of bacteremia (43/469, 9.2%) was 5.1 per 1000 patient-days (95%CI 3.8–6.4). An echocardiogram was performed in 21 patients, 1 had an aortic valve vegetation (IE) by methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Bacteremia rates were nonsignificantly higher with steroids (5.9 vs 3.7 per 1000 patient-days; P=0.057). Use of tocilizumab was not associated with bacteremia (5.8 vs 4.8 per 1000 patient-days; P=0.28). Mortality was nonsignificantly higher in patients with (15/43, 34.9%) vs. without (108/426, 25.4%) bacteremia (P=0.20). Length of stay was the strongest predictor of bacteremia, with risk increasing by 7% (95%CI 6%-9%, P< 0.001) per additional day. Cohort Characteristics of Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia on High-Flow O2 (N= 469) [Image: see text] All Microorganisms Isolated from Blood Cultures [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The incidence of bacteremia was relatively low and IE was uncommon in this study of severe COVID-19 patients. Risk of bacteremia increased with longer hospital stay and with steroids use, but not with tocilizumab.

In the United States, this transition occurred during the spring of 2020, and the compulsory shift to online learning led to frustrations from students and instructors alike. I studied student participation during the online portion of a university‐level soil physics course taught in Spring 2020. Participation was quantified using the number of student posts in weekly discussion boards, the number of student views of asynchronous videos, and the number of video views during each week of online instruction. Relationships between video length and number of student views and between student participation and final exam grades were also examined. My findings show that student views of mini‐lecture videos were low and decreased throughout the online learning period. Conversely, views of example problem videos and the number of posts on graded discussion boards were high and remained high throughout the online learning period, suggesting that students were more engaged with online material that affected their grades. I also found that the level of student engagement in online material was positively correlated with higher final exam scores. The findings presented here may be used to improve the development and delivery of online coursework in natural science disciplines, both during current and future emergencies.","Wyatt, Briana",,248,0

In contrast to keypoints, part segmentations provide information about part localizations on the level of individual pixels. Capturing both locations and semantics, they are an attractive target for supervised learning approaches. However, large annotation costs limit the scalability of supervised algorithms to other object categories than humans. Unsupervised approaches potentially allow to use much more data at a lower cost. Most existing unsupervised approaches focus on learning abstract representations to be refined with supervision into the final representation. Our approach leverages a generative model consisting of two disentangled representations for an object’s shape and appearance and a latent variable for the part segmentation. From a single image, the trained model infers a semantic part segmentation map. In experiments, we compare our approach to previous state-of-the-art approaches and observe significant gains in segmentation accuracy and shape consistency (Code available at https://compvis.github.io/unsupervised-part-segmentation). Our work demonstrates the feasibility to discover semantic part segmentations without supervision.

A nutritional intervention was carried out by supplementing high protein foods to the midday meal to study its impact on stunting and wasting parameters. METHODS: In January 2020, anthropometric measurements of 60 students from a rural school located in Neral, Maharashtra were taken. The age, height (cm), and weight (kg) of 60 students were recorded and analyzed. In addition to the midday meal, 2 eggs were supplied every day to every student from 1st-5th grade and one egg to students from 6th-8th grade. It was made compulsory that any student who was stunted or wasted, independent of their age/grade, had to have two eggs a day. This was continued routinely from Monday through Saturday and at the end of three months, the same data was collected. RESULTS: The anthropometric measurements of all the students were taken in the month of January 2020 and the beginning of April 2020 (the school was prematurely shut down due to COVID-19 lockdown). In January, after assessing the anthropometric it was concluded that out of 60 children, 19 students were underweight, 9 were stunted, and 14 were wasted. Additionally, 3 were overweight/obese. In April, it was observed that only 12 students were underweight, a 37% decrease in number of underweight students. The was a significant decline in the number of stunted students which went down to 2 students, a 78% decrease. The number of wasted students fell to 11, showing a 21% decrease. The number of obese students fell by 50%, causing the number of overweight students to rise. CONCLUSIONS: The three-month data is considerably encouraging as it shows a significant decrease in the number of wasted undernourished and stunted students in a short period of time. This implies that the high protein diet can be helpful in significantly alter the stunting prevalent in rural school children. Although this study was conducted on a smaller scale, the significant decrease in stunted students consuming two eggs a day shows the effectiveness of protein supplementation.

METHODS: The USAID Advancing Nutrition Project is conducting an impact evaluation in Kyrgyz Republic to determine the effect of project interventions on nutrition behaviors. Municipalities in Batken and Jalalabad regions were randomly assigned to intervention or comparison areas.The stepped wedge design includes baseline, midpoint, and endline surveys, carried out at 12-month intervals. The baseline survey was completed in late 2020. Difference in differences analysis and analysis of project exposure variables will be used to determine impact. Due to COVID-19, all interviews were carried out using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). RESULTS: We interviewed 2,091 women with children under two years of age, with phone numbers obtained from health facilities in survey areas. The response rate (11.6% completed interviews) was similar or higher than typical phone surveys. Interviews included complex questions related to 11 nutrition practices, including women's and children's dietary recall. Average interview length was 31 minutes. 4% of respondents dropped before completing the call. Advantages of phone interviews included reduced travel costs, improved quality control, and real-time data review. Disadvantages included high non-response, inability to observe items such as handwashing stations, and potential biases related to phone ownership. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that it is possible to carry out a complex, population-based nutrition survey using CATI. Response rates may be improved by building rapport at the start of the call. Interview length can be reduced using block randomization. Baseline levels of most indicators were similar to previous in-person surveys in Kyrgyzstan, suggesting CATI survey results can potentially provide accurate estimates of nutrition behaviors.

METHODS: College students (n = 1015 (75.5% Female); 59 freshmen, 139 sophomores, 264 juniors, 245 seniors, 289 graduate) participated in an online questionnaire from colleges/universities within the United States during the Spring 2020 academic semester. Participants were asked about their fluid intake over the previous 30 days using the BEVQ-15. The questionnaire consisted of demographic and living status questions as well as 16 questions detailing type (e.g., water, milk, etc.), frequency (“how often”), and volume of fluids for each consumption (“how much each time”). Kruskal-Wallis analyses (test statistic reported as chi-square, χ(2)) were used to compare the total fluid intake, frequency of plain water intake, and volume with each consumption between those with and without a change in living situation and by academic standing. Data reported as (median [interquartile range]). RESULTS: A change in living status was reported by 426/1015 (42%) participants. Median fluid intake was 1848 mL ([1295, 2532] mL) for all participants. Total fluid intake [χ(2)(1) = 18.07, P < 0.001] was different between those with (1709 [1199, 2366] mL) and without (1940 [1378, 2644] mL) a change in living situation. However, the volume of plain water intake was not different between those with (710 [473, 1420] mL) and without (1065 [591, 1420] mL) a change in living situation [χ(2)(1) = 2.81, P = 0.09]. Frequency [χ(2)(1) = 3.10, P = 0.08] and the volume with each consumption [χ(2)(1) = 1.16, P = 0.28] of plain water were also not different based on a change in living situation.

This contribution examines what the growing army of recent heterodox scholars in economics and business have to say on what one could call ‘inclusive capitalism’. This concerns both the flaws in current capitalist systems and the behavioral assumptions that underpin it, as well as the possible institutional fixes they propose. I first sketch the background of the crisis surrounding capitalism, delve into its conceptual foundations and offer a working definition. I subsequently examine what social and environmental inclusion refer to and use Kate Raworth’s conceptualization of the doughnut economy as a point of departure to explore what ‘inclusive capitalism’ may imply. I also identify requirements for its implementation in institutional practices. It appears that ‘purpose’ rather than utility maximization or profit maximization is what novel economists and business scholars perceive as the key driver in ‘stakeholder-oriented capitalism’ or the ‘economics of mutuality’. Their claim is that at the end of the day this is not only a moral imperative for companies but also more beneficial for them in terms of long-term profitability. Moreover, they see a far more important role for government in shaping markets and leading the way into a more inclusive future than it is currently fulfilling. I argue that it is time for scholars in the field of public policy to take heed of these new theoretical developments in neighboring disciplines and respond to them.","de Jong, Martin",GPPG,248,0

RT delivered with curative or palliative intent can be administered alone or combined with chemotherapy or surgery. Advanced treatment planning and delivery techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, including volumetric modulated arc therapy, and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy allow for highly conformal radiation dose delivery leading to improved tumor control rates and less treatment toxicity. Quality on-board imaging that provides accurate visualization of target and surrounding organs at risk is a critical feature of these advanced techniques. As soft tissue contrast resolution is superior with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to other imaging modalities, MRI has been used increasingly to delineate tumor from adjacent soft tissues and organs at risk from initial diagnosis to tumor response evaluation. Gynecological cancers often have poor contrast resolution compared to the surrounding tissues on computed tomography scan, and consequently the benefit of MRI is high. One example is in management of locally advanced cervix cancer where adaptive MRI guidance has been broadly implemented for adaptive brachytherapy. The role of MRI for external beam RT is also steadily increasing. MRI information is being used for treatment planning, predicting, and monitoring position shifts and accounting for tissue deformation and target regression during treatment. The recent clinical introduction of online MRI-guided radiation therapy (oMRgRT) could be the next step in high-precision RT. This technology provides a tool to take full advantage of MRI not only at the time of initial treatment planning but as well as for daily position verification and online plan adaptation. Cervical, endometrial, vaginal, and oligometastatic ovarian cancers are being treated on MRI linear accelerator systems throughout the world. This review summarizes the current state, early experience, ongoing trials, and future directions of oMRgRT in the management of gynecological cancers.","Portelance, Lorraine; Corradini, Stefanie; Erickson, Beth; Lalondrelle, Susan; Padgett, Kyle; van der Leij, Femke; van Lier, Astrid; Jürgenliemk-Schulz, Ina",Front Oncol,248,24

In the structure of aid, the share of targeted transfers (subsidies and subventions) increased, so the possibility of maneuvering budget resources for regions has decreased. Regions are forced to spend additional aid mainly on top-prescribed goals, which has led to a further increase in centralization of management. The transparency of allocation of transfers to regions worsened, and the amount of additional aid did not depend on the reduction of own revenues of regional budgets. Before the pandemic, priority “geopolitical” regions had received special support; for 2020, it is much more difficult to explain the distribution of aid due to the uncoordinated allocation of transfers by different federal ministries for different purposes. In the past, budgetary federalism in Russia had manifested itself only in a certain freedom of choice by the regional authorities in spending priorities, but in 2020, this was even less. Health care and, almost everywhere, social security of the population became an overall priority, since transfers were significantly added for these purposes. Regarding other types of expenditures, the priorities of regions differed, but most of them subsidized fees for housing and communal services and increased spending on the national economy to meet the targets of the presidential decree. Hopes for decentralization of the Russian system of government during the pandemic were not realized; in interbudgetary relations, the degree of regional dependence on the federal authorities increased.","Zubarevich, N.

The demographics of schizophrenia in outpatients (both first-episode and follow-up) from January to March 2020 (36,624 records) and similar periods of 2017–2019 (114,141 records) were analyzed and compared to minimize seasonal influence. Limited personal information (age, gender, approximate residence) was investigated to find risk factors. After considering seasonal factors such as the Spring festival, the age of the first-episode schizophrenia was significantly increased in January (46.60 ± 15.14) and February (51.53 ± 14.74) but went back to normal in March 2020 (38.89 ± 14.59), compared with similar periods from 2017 to 2019 (Jan., 40.77 ± 15.26; Feb., 39.69 ± 15.10; Mar., 42.04 ± 15.83).

Macrophages play an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Accumulating evidence has suggested an upregulated rate of aerobic glycolysis as a key common feature of activated proinflammatory macrophages. Here, we identified a crucial role of myeloid 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (Pfkfb3), a glycolytic activator in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia in mice. Pfkfb3 expression is substantially increased in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated with LPS in vitro and in lung macrophages of mice challenged with LPS in vivo. Myeloid-specific knockout of Pfkfb3 in mice protects against LPS-induced lung edema, cardiac dysfunction and hypotension, which were associated with decreased expression of interleukin 1 beta (Il1b), interleukin 6 (Il6) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), as well as reduced infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in lung tissue. Pfkfb3 ablation in cultured macrophages attenuated LPS-induced glycolytic flux, resulting in a decrease in proinflammatory gene expression. Mechanistically, Pfkfb3 ablation or inhibition with a Pfkfb3 inhibitor AZ26 suppresses LPS-induced proinflammatory gene expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In summary, our study reveals the critical role of Pfkfb3 in LPS-induced sepsis via reprogramming macrophage metabolism and regulating proinflammatory gene expression. Therefore, PFKFB3 is a potential target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases such as sepsis.","Xu, Jiean; Wang, Lina; Yang, Qiuhua; Ma, Qian; Zhou, Yaqi; Cai, Yongfeng; Mao, Xiaoxiao; Da, Qingen; Lu, Tammy; Su, Yunchao; Bagi, Zsolt; Lucas, Rudolf; Liu, Zhiping; Hong, Mei; Ouyang, Kunfu; Huo, Yuqing",Front Cardiovasc Med,248,5

However, there is still a lack of an appropriate cell-based HTS specific for migratory cancer cells. In the study presented here, we created a novel assay (mHTS): a single-cell-level screening method targeting migratory cancer cells and can be applied in a high-throughput manner. This mHTS platform is based on microchannel devices (providing physical confinement during cell migration and limit migrating cells' proliferation rate) assembled 96-well plate (fitting to HTS manner). To determine the feasibility of this assay, we quantified the anti-migratory and anti-viability effects of several molecules (Cytochalasin D, Doxorubicin and AZD-6244) on migrating (creeping inside microchannel) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. After analyzing migration screening data that was collected on a single-cell-level, we were able to compare those drug's effects on cancer cells' migration velocity and uncovered the migration inhibiting potential of AZD (500nM and 1000nM). Viability data based on single-cell-level screening also allowed us to further understand the same drug's different lethality toward migrating and normal 2D cultured cancer cells. The Pre-classification of subpopulations enables us to study the heterogeneity of cancer and ensures our method's feasibility for a high-throughput manner. All these results proved our mHTS platform is suitable for single-cell-level anti-migration drug screening and has potential feasibility in promoting the development of anti-migratory-cancer-drug in a high-throughput manner.","Shen, Qionghua; Niederstrasser, Hanspeter; Barakat, Rami; Haddadin, Zaid Basem; Miller, Sandra Rose; Posner, Bruce; Kim, Young-Tae",Biofabrication,248,17

Electronic records were accessed to record clinical data of COVID-19 patients with candidemia. For statistical analysis, independent samples Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables.A total of 26 candidemia cases (four C.auris, 22 non-C.auris) in 2438 admitted COVID-19 (10.7 per 1000 admissions) and 59 candidemia cases (six C.auris, 53 non-C.auris) in admitted non-COVID patients (8.2 per 1000 admission) were identified. The proportion of C.auris candidemia in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients was 15.4% and 10% respectively. 4/26 of COVID-19 candidemia patients were aged ≤ 15 years (10 months-15 years).

This study investigates the occurrence of structural brain abnormalities in non-survivors of COVID-19 in a virtopsy framework. METHODS In this prospective, monocentric, case series study, consecutive patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria benefited from an early postmortem structural brain MRI: death <24 hours, SARS-CoV-2 detection on nasopharyngeal swab specimen, chest computerized tomographic (CT) scan suggestive of COVID-19, absence of known focal brain lesion, and MRI compatibility. RESULTS Among the 62 patients who died from COVID-19 from 31/03/2020 to 24/04/2020 at our institution, 19 decedents fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Parenchymal brain abnormalities were observed in 4 decedents: subcortical micro- and macro-bleeds (2 decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one decedent), and nonspecific deep white matter changes (one decedent). Asymmetric olfactory bulbs were found in 4 other decedents without downstream olfactory tract abnormalities. No brainstem MRI signal abnormality was observed. CONCLUSIONS Postmortem brain MRI demonstrates hemorrhagic and PRES-related brain lesions in non-survivors of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory impairment seems to be limited to olfactory bulbs.

Commonly, consumer wearable devices assessing HR are based on photoplethysmography (PPG), where HR is determined by absorption and reflection of emitted light by the blood. However, methodological differences and shortcomings in the validation process hamper the comparability of the validity of various wearable devices assessing HR. Towards Intelligent Health and Well-Being: Network of Physical Activity Assessment (INTERLIVE) is a joint European initiative of six universities and one industrial partner. The consortium was founded in 2019 and strives towards developing best-practice recommendations for evaluating the validity of consumer wearables and smartphones. This expert statement presents a best-practice validation protocol for consumer wearables assessing HR by PPG. The recommendations were developed through the following multi-stage process: (1) a systematic literature review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, (2) an unstructured review of the wider literature pertaining to factors that may introduce bias during the validation of these devices and (3) evidence-informed expert opinions of the INTERLIVE Network. A total of 44 articles were deemed eligible and retrieved through our systematic literature review. Based on these studies, a wider literature review and our evidence-informed expert opinions, we propose a validation framework with standardised recommendations using six domains: considerations for the target population, criterion measure, index measure, testing conditions, data processing and the statistical analysis. As such, this paper presents recommendations to standardise the validity testing and reporting of PPG-based HR wearables used by consumers. Moreover, checklists are provided to guide the validation protocol development and reporting. This will ensure that manufacturers, consumers, healthcare providers and researchers use wearables safely and to its full potential.","Mühlen, Jan M; Stang, Julie; Lykke Skovgaard, Esben; Judice, Pedro B; Molina-Garcia, Pablo; Johnston, William; Sardinha, Luís B; Ortega, Francisco B; Caulfield, Brian; Bloch, Wilhelm; Cheng, Sulin; Ekelund, Ulf; Brønd, Jan Christian; Grøntved, Anders; Schumann, Moritz",British journal of sports medicine,248,1

In vitro, the effect is correlated with the tonicity, viscosity, acidity, and ionic nature of contrast media. Less erythrocyte sickling is observed in vitro with second-generation low- and iso-osmolar contrast agents. Clinical impact of these newer intravenous contrast agents has not been investigated. PURPOSE To review adverse outcomes following contrast administration in a cohort of patients with sickle cell disease. METHODS Inpatients with sickle cell disease who received iodinated intravenous were identified. Medical records were reviewed for evidence of worsening crisis and occurrence of adverse events within 48 hours of contrast administration. Data points were further analyzed with the goal of identifying predictors of adverse outcome. RESULTS There were 132 imaging studies that met inclusion criteria in 79 patients, mostly with homozygous hemoglobin S. The low-osmolar contrast Optiray (Coviden Imaging Inc., Hazelwood, Mo) was used in 45%. Administration of fluids, Mucomyst (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY), oxygen, or blood transfusion preceded 58% of studies. Minor adverse events followed 16% of studies, with new or worsening pain being most common (12%). Contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 1.5%, resolving in all cases. Prehydration was associated with a decreased incidence of adverse events (P=.02). CONCLUSION Adverse events related to intravenous contrast occur in sickle cell disease patients at a rate similar to the general population, without an increase in contrast-induced nephropathy. Subjective reports of new or worsening pain crisis do not translate to objective findings. Beneficial diagnostic imaging can be performed without increased risk of serious complication in this population.","Campbell, Kimberly L; Hud, Laryssa M; Adams, Suzanne; Andrel, Jocelyn; Ballas, Samir K; Feldman, Arthur M; Axelrod, David",The American journal of medicine,248,1

Traditionally, patients with a colon perforation have been treated surgically. Although there are several case reports documenting the usefulness of endoscopic closure of colon perforations, there are few current data evaluating the feasibility of endoscopic closure for an iatrogenic perforation on consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy. OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence of colon perforations and the utility of immediate endoscopic closure during colonoscopy. DESIGN Retrospective, observational study. SETTING Tertiary-care academic medical center. PATIENTS All patients who underwent colonoscopy at 1 institution from June 2002 to December 2008 were identified. INTERVENTION An attempt at immediate colon perforation closure by endoscopic means. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Successful endoscopic closure of colon perforation. RESULTS During the study period, a total of 8601 colonoscopies were performed (2472 therapeutic interventions, 28.7%). A total of 12 iatrogenic colon perforations occurred, yielding a rate of 1.4/1000. Five (41.7%) occurred during a diagnostic colonoscopy (0.8/1000), and 7 perforations (58.3%) occurred as the result of a therapeutic intervention (2.8/1000).

In our model system, mice without or with growing tumors repeatedly received DOX treatment. Simultaneous injection of anti-IFN-γ antibody R46-A2 with DOX to block IFN-γ signal efficiently protected the cardiac function of DOX treated recipients. Importantly, a single late injection of R46-A2 after DOX exposure also ameliorated DOX induced cardiac dysfunction in tumor-bearing mice. The anti-IFN-γ treatment did not affect the DOX-mediated tumor suppression effect and it left the main cellular immune response intact. Therefore, temporary blockade of IFN-γ may represent a novel strategy to ameliorate established DOX induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) or prevent its development in tumor therapy.","Ma, Pan; Qin, Yue; Cao, Hong; Erben, Ulrike; Ni, Chen; Qin, Zhihai",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,248,1

In addition, the effects of the weight ratio of different PANI to BF@Hal on the microwave absorption properties of the materials were studied. The results show that when the weight ratio of PANI is 40%, the material has the best microwave absorption performance. The frequency bandwidth below -5 dB reached 9.60 GHz and the minimum absorption peak at 11.92 GHz was -14.77 dB. The combination of the PANI and BF@Hal nanosheets take advantage of the interfacial polarization, natural resonance, dielectric polarization and trapping of EM waves by internal reflection in PANI/BaFe12O19@Hal.

While vaccine candidates and therapeutics are currently undergoing clinical trials, there is yet to be a proven effective treatment or cure for COVID-19. In this study, we have presented a synergistic computational platform, including molecular dynamics simulations and immunoinformatics techniques, to rationally design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate for COVID-19. This platform combines epitopes across Linear B Lymphocytes (LBL), Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) derived from both mutant and wild-type spike glycoproteins from SARS-CoV-2 with diverse protein conformations. In addition, this vaccine construct also takes the considerable glycan shield of the spike glycoprotein into account, which protects it from immune response. We have identified a vaccine candidate (a 35.9 kDa protein), named COVCCF, which is composed of 5 LBL, 6 HTL, and 6 CTL epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Using multi-dose immune simulations, COVCCF induces elevated levels of immunoglobulin activity (IgM, IgG1, IgG2), and induces strong responses from B lymphocytes, CD4 T-helper lymphocytes, and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. COVCCF induces cytokines important to innate immunity, including IFN-γ, IL4, and IL10. Additionally, COVCCF has ideal pharmacokinetic properties and low immune-related toxicities. In summary, this study provides a powerful, computational vaccine design platform for rapid development of vaccine candidates (including COVCCF) for effective prevention of COVID-19.","Martin, William R; Cheng, Feixiong",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,248,1

METHODS Between January 2014 and October 2015, the prospective, randomized RANGER SFA study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02013193) enrolled 105 patients with symptomatic lower limb ischemia (Rutherford category 2-4) and stenotic lesions in the nonstented femoropopliteal segment at 10 European centers. Seventy-one patients (mean age 68±8 years; 53 men) were enrolled in the Ranger drug-coated balloon (DCB) arm and 34 patients (mean age 67±9 years; 23 men) were assigned to the control group. Six-month analysis included angiographic late lumen loss and safety and clinical outcomes assessments. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the DCB and control groups were similar, as were lesion lengths (68±46 vs 60±48 mm; p=0.731), severity of calcification (p=0.236), and the prevalence of occlusions (34% vs 34%; p>0.999). At 6 months, late lumen loss was significantly less for the DCB group vs controls (-0.16±0.99 vs 0.76±1.4; p=0.002). The DCB group had significantly greater freedom from binary restenosis (92% vs 64%; p=0.005) and primary patency rates (87% vs 60%; p=0.014). Target lesion revascularization rates were 5.6% in the DCB group and 12% in the control group (p=0.475). No target limb amputations or device-related deaths occurred in either group. CONCLUSION Six-month results suggest that Ranger DCB treatment effectively inhibited restenosis in symptomatic femoropopliteal disease, resulting in improved vessel patency and a low revascularization rate in the short term compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty.","Bausback, Yvonne; Willfort-Ehringer, Andrea; Sievert, Horst; Geist, Volker; Lichtenberg, Michael; Del Giudice, Costantino; Sauguet, Antoine; Diaz-Cartelle, Juan; Marx, Claudia; Ströbel, Armin; Schult, Ingolf; Scheinert, Dierk",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,248,0

Although several mechanisms have been proposed including oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism is still unknown. Few studies have investigated the mechanism linking PM2.5 and blood pressure (BP). In this study, we measured urinary metabolites and BP -related renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to investigate the associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and BP in healthy C57BL/6 mice. METHODS The C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambient concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 16 weeks. Systolic BP and diastolic BP were measured by noninvasive BP system. The urine metabolites were quantified using the untargeted metabolomics approach. The expression of RAAS-related proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang (1-7) and aldosterone (ALD) were measured using Western blot and ELISA kits. RESULTS The metabolomics analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure induced significant changes of some metabolites in urine, including stress hormones, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. Furthermore, there was an elevation of BP, increase of serous Ang II and ALD, along with the decrease of ACE2 and Ang (1-7) in kidney in the PM2.5-exposed mice compared with FA-exposed mice. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure-induced BP elevation might be associated with RAAS activation. Meanwhile, PM2.5 exposure-induced changes of stress hormone and lipid metabolism might mediate the activation of RAAS. The results suggested that the systemic stress hormone and lipid metabolism was associated with the development of hypertension.","Du, Xihao; Zeng, Xuejiao; Zhang, Jia; Pan, Kun; Song, Liying; Zhou, Ji; Zhou, Li; Xie, Yuquan; Sun, Qinghua; Ge, Wenzhen; Chen, Renjie; Zhao, Jinzhuo; Kan, Haidong",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,248,24

RESULTS Postprandial GLP-1 and PYY responses were similar, whereas glucose, insulin, and GIP levels differed markedly after oral versus intraduodenal feeding. Intraduodenal feeding prompted an intermediate appetite response (i.e., between oral and intragastric). For postprandial glucose, insulin, and GIP levels, the intraduodenal route was more similar to the intragastric than the oral route. Intragastric administration did not evoke changes in appetite, glucose, or insulin; however, it slightly increased GLP-1 and PYY and moderately increased GIP.

DESIGN Observational, population-based registry study. SETTING Data from the nationwide Swedish Hernia Registry. PATIENTS All 82 015 Lichtenstein inguinal hernioplasties with sutured mesh fixation in adolescents and adults (15 years or older) from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2009, at surgical units enrolled in the Swedish Hernia Registry. INTERVENTIONS Mesh fixation with nonabsorbable, long-term absorbable, or short-term absorbable sutures. Main Outcome Measure Relative risk (RR) for reoperation due to recurrence of a hernia in the same groin during the study period, based on cumulative reoperation rates adjusted for time and confounding variables. RESULTS For each study group, RR was calculated with multiregression analysis. There was no significant difference in risk for reoperation after mesh fixation with standard nonabsorbable sutures (RR, 1) or with long-term absorbable sutures (RR, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.55; P = .49). Short-term absorbable sutures, however, more than doubled that risk (RR, 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.99; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS With regard to recurrence risk, long-term absorbable sutures are an excellent alternative to permanent sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein inguinal hernioplasty. Short-term absorbable sutures entail an independent risk factor for recurrence and should therefore be avoided.","Novik, Bengt; Nordin, Pär; Skullman, Stefan; Dalenbäck, Jan; Enochsson, Lars",Archives of surgery,248,27

Methods The clinical data of 53 cases of LSPDP and 44 cases of OSPDP performed between January 2008 and August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical outcomes between the two groups were compared. Results There was no significant difference in preoperative data between the two groups. However, the LSPDP group had statistically significant shorter operative time (145.3±55.9 versus 184.7±33.5, P=0.03) and lesser intraoperative blood loss (150.6±180.8 versus 253.5±76.2, P=0.03) than that of the OSPDP group. Moreover, the LSPDP group also had statistically significant earlier passing of first flatus (2.2±1.4 versus 3.1±1.9, P=0.01), earlier diet intake (2.3±1.8 versus 3.4±2.0, P=0.01), and shorter hospital stay (6.2±7.2 versus 8.8±9.3, 0.04) than that of the OSPDP group. However, postoperative pancreatic fistula (P=0.64) and total postoperative complications (P=0.59) were not significantly different between the groups.

Autosomal recessive disorder of the Zellweger spectrum (ZSD) is a major subset of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) that can be caused by mutations in any of the 14 PEX genes. Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the foremost common and severe phenotype within the heterogeneous ZSD. However, missense mutations encode proteins with residual functions, which are associated with phenotypes that are milder than ZS. Mutations in the PEX1 gene are among the most prevalent. PEX1 and PEX6 proteins, belonging to the AAA family of ATPases, form a hexameric complex, which is associated with peroxisome membranes and essential for peroxisome biology. In this study, a two-month-old Iranian boy with hypotonia, poor feeding, and difficulty in breathing was diagnosed with Zellweger syndrome. The parents of the patient were second cousins and healthy and no similar cases were observed in the parents' family. The PEX1 gene was sequenced in the patient and his parents. The compound heterozygous mutations, p. Arg949Trp and p. Gly970Ala, were identified in the patient, while the parents were heterozygous for these alleles. Sequence analysis of the mutant PEX1 D2 domain revealed that mutation p. Arg949Trp precisely occurred in a conserved arginine residue (P4 Arg), which hinders the substrate processing of the complex. Several database records have reported mutation p. Arg949Trp(R949W) but its clinical significance is given as uncertain. We report here a novel mutation, p. Gly970Ala, which is not recorded before and may prevent proper interaction of PEX1 and PEX6 proteins. In summary, the clinical findings and peroxisome profile of the patient suggested that compound heterozygosity for these two missense mutations resulted in a nonfunctional PEX1/PEX6 complex causing the severe ZS phenotype.","Alamatsaz, Marzieh; Jalalypour, Farzaneh; Hashemi, Motahare-Sadat; Shafeghati, Yousef; Nasr-Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein; Ghaedi, Kamran",Journal of cellular biochemistry,248,1

Integrated multi-omics analysis of data from these levels is necessary to understand the aberrant cellular functions accountable for cancer and its development. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have become a useful tool in integrated multi-omics analysis of cancer data. However, high dimensional multi-omics data are generally imbalanced with too many molecular features and relatively few patient samples. This imbalance makes a DL based integrated multi-omics analysis difficult. DL-based dimensionality reduction technique, including variational autoencoder (VAE), is a potential solution to balance high dimensional multi-omics data. However, there are few VAE-based integrated multi-omics analyses, and they are limited to pancancer. In this work, we did an integrated multi-omics analysis of ovarian cancer using the compressed features learned through VAE and an improved version of VAE, namely Maximum Mean Discrepancy VAE (MMD-VAE). First, we designed and developed a DL architecture for VAE and MMD-VAE. Then we used the architecture for mono-omics, integrated di-omics and tri-omics data analysis of ovarian cancer through cancer samples identification, molecular subtypes clustering and classification, and survival analysis. The results show that MMD-VAE and VAE-based compressed features can respectively classify the transcriptional subtypes of the TCGA datasets with an accuracy in the range of 93.2-95.5% and 87.1-95.7%. Also, survival analysis results show that VAE and MMD-VAE based compressed representation of omics data can be used in cancer prognosis. Based on the results, we can conclude that (i) VAE and MMD-VAE outperform existing dimensionality reduction techniques, (ii) integrated multi-omics analyses perform better or similar compared to their mono-omics counterparts, and (iii) MMD-VAE performs better than VAE in most omics dataset.","Hira, Muta Tah; Razzaque, M A; Angione, Claudio; Scrivens, James; Sawan, Saladin; Sarkar, Mosharraf",Scientific reports,248,1

In mice infected with gliatropic demyelinating coronavirus, B7-H1 expression on oligodendroglia delays virus control, but also dampens clinical disease. To define the mechanisms by which B7-H1 alters pathogenic outcome, virus-infected B7-H1-deficient (B7-H1(-/-)) mice were analyzed for altered peripheral and CNS immune responses. B7-H1 deficiency did not affect peripheral T or B cell activation or alter the magnitude or composition of CNS-infiltrating cells. However, higher levels of IFN-γ mRNA in CNS-infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T cells as well as CD4 T cells contributed to elevated IFN-γ protein in the B7-H1(-/-) CNS. Increased effector function at the single-cell level was also evident by elevated granzyme B expression specifically in virus-specific CNS CD8 T cells. Although enhanced T cell activity accelerated virus control, 50% of mice succumbed to infection. Despite enhanced clinical recovery, surviving B7-H1(-/-) mice still harbored persisting viral mRNA, albeit at reduced levels compared with wild-type mice. B7-H1(-/-) mice exhibited extensive loss of axonal integrity, although demyelination, a hallmark of virus-induced tissue damage, was not increased. The results suggest that B7-H1 hinders viral control in B7-H1 expressing glia cells, but does not mediate resistance to CD8 T cell-mediated cytolysis. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that B7-H1-mediated protection from viral-induced immune pathology associated with encephalomyelitis resides in limiting T cell-mediated axonal bystander damage rather than direct elimination of infected myelinating cells.","Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Atkinson, Roscoe; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of immunology,248,31

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe patient characteristics associated with successful transition from in-person to virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from all patients with ambulatory visits from 1 October 2019-30 September 2020 in a large integrated health system in the Northeast USA. The outcome of interest was receipt of virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. We matched home addresses with census-tract level area social vulnerability index (SVI) and Internet access. Among ambulatory care patients, we used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with virtual participation. Among virtual participants, we identified characteristics associated with video vs audio-only visits. RESULTS Among 1,241,313 patients, 528,542 (42.6%) were virtual participants. Relative to in-person only, virtual participants were older, more often English-proficient and with activated patient portal. Characteristics associated with virtual participation included patients with: only behavioural health visits, COVID patients, highest quartile of visit frequency, and multiple visit types. Characteristics associated with video participation (relative to audio-only) included being younger and patients with: only behavioural health visits, highest quartile of visit frequency, non-Hispanic black race, limited English proficiency and inactivated portal account. DISCUSSION In our regional healthcare system, the transition to virtual care during COVID was vital for continued access to care, but substantial inequity remained. Without audio-only visits, access to care would have been even more limited for our most vulnerable patients.","Zachrison, Kori S; Yan, Zhiyu; Sequist, Thomas; Licurse, Adam; Tan-McGrory, Aswita; Erskine, Alistair; Schwamm, Lee H",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,248,1

The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.","San Román, José Alberto; Vilacosta, Isidre; Antunes, Manuel J; Iung, Bernard; Lopez, Javier; Schäfers, Hans-Joachim",Heart,248,19

Therefore, understanding the subcellular localization and interactions of a specific protein is crucial to uncover its biological function. The advent of proximity labeling (PL) has reshaped cellular proteomics in infection biology. PL utilizes a genetically modified enzyme that generates a ""labeling cloud"" by covalently labeling proteins in close proximity to the enzyme. Fusion of a PL enzyme to a specific antibody or a ""bait"" protein of interest in combination with affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) enables the isolation and identification of the cellular proximity proteome, or proxisome. This powerful methodology has been paramount for the mapping of membrane or membraneless organelles as well as for the understanding of hard-to-purify protein complexes, such as those of transmembrane proteins. Unsurprisingly, more and more infection biology research groups have recognized the potential of PL for the identification of host-pathogen interactions. In this chapter, we introduce the enzymes commonly used for PL labeling as well as recent promising advancements and summarize the major achievements in organelle mapping and nucleic acid PL. Moreover, we comprehensively describe the research on host-pathogen interactions using PL, giving special attention to studies in the field of virology.","Zapatero-Belinchón, Francisco José; Carriquí-Madroñal, Belén; Gerold, Gisa",Advances in virus research,248,1

Vpu is responsible for the amplification of viral release from the host cell. The mode of action includes (i) heteroassembly with host factors and (ii) the formation of homo-oligomers, which are able to conduct ions across the lipid membrane. Two different routes of assembling short sequences of the N terminus, including the TMD of Vpu, Vpu1-32, and Vpu8-26, are presented by using a combination of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with a docking approach. The rim of alanines (Ala-8, -11, -15, and -19) resembles an interlocking motif for the sequential assembly into a dimer and trimer. Simultaneous assembly results in oligomeric bundles (trimers to pentamers) with either tryptophans (Trp-23) or purely hydrophobic residues facing the center. Bundles, with serines facing the pore (Ser-24), are energetically not the lowest structures. For pentameric bundles with Ser-24 facing the pore, no water column develops during a short 25 ns MD simulation.","Li, Li-Hua; Hsu, Hao-Jen; Fischer, Wolfgang B",Biopolymers,248,29

A case-control study was conducted to describe the relationship between premorbid allergic diseases and AMD using Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. Eligibility criteria for inclusion of new adult AMD cases from 2000 to 2013 were set up. We defined the year of diagnosis as the index year. Age-, gender-, index year- matched controls who were drawn from the same database. The case control ratio was 1:4. For all participants, all premorbid conditions staring 1996 to index year were documented. Binary logistic regression was used to describe factors related to AMD occurrence. The AMD group consisted of 10,911 patients, and the comparison group consisted of 43,644 individuals. Patients with AMD showed significant associations with premorbid allergic diseases (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.47-1.61), specifically with allergic conjunctivitis (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.94-2.20), allergic rhinitis (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.25-1.39), asthma (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.06), and atopic dermatitis (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94-1.17). Further analyses indicated that patients with more concurrent allergic diseases have higher associations with AMD than those with fewer concurrent diseases. Patients with more annual medical visits for their allergic diseases also showed higher associations with AMD than those with fewer visits. AMD is significantly associated with premorbid allergic diseases.

From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on Google® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.","De Sio, S; Buomprisco, G; La Torre, G; Lapteva, E; Perri, R; Greco, E; Mucci, N; Cedrone, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,248,16

However, current evidence suggests no significant clinical benefit of prophylactic drain placement following colorectal surgery. This is reflected in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines recommending against their routine use. The Ileus Management International (IMAGINE) study found more than one third of participating centres across the world routinely used drains in the majority of colorectal resections. This study aims to audit international compliance with ERAS guidelines regarding the use of postoperative drains in colorectal surgery. METHODS This prospective, multicentre audit will be conducted via the student- and trainee-led EuroSurg Collaborative network across Europe, South Africa and Australasia. Data will be collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective and emergency colorectal surgery with 30-day follow-up. This will include any colorectal resection, formation of colostomy/ileostomy and reversal of stoma. The primary endpoint will be adherence to ERAS guidelines for intra-abdominal drain placement. Secondary outcomes will include: time-to-diagnosis of intra-abdominal postoperative collections; output and time-to-removal of drains; and 30-day postoperative complications defined by Clavien-Dindo Classification. DISCUSSION This protocol describes the methodology of the first international audit of intra-abdominal drain placement after colorectal surgery. This study will be conducted across a large collaborative network with quality assurance and data validation strategies. This will provide a clear understanding of current practice, and novel evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of intra-abdominal drain placement in colorectal surgical patients.","Blanco-Colino, Ruth",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,248,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS From May 2013 to April 2014, percutaneous needle biopsy was performed immediately after RFA for 3 patients (2 men and 1 woman, aged 57-76 years) who had lung tumors measuring 1.3-2.6 cm in diameter. All patients had prior history of malignancy, and all tumors were radiologically diagnosed as malignant. Obtained specimens were pathologically classified using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS We completed three planned sessions of RFA followed by percutaneous needle biopsy, all of which obtained tumor tissue that could be pathologically diagnosed. Two tumors were metastatic from renal clear cell carcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, respectively; one tumor was primary lung adenocarcinoma. There was no death or major complication related to the procedures. Although pneumothorax occurred in two patients, these resolved without the need for aspiration or chest tube placement. Tumor seeding was not observed, but 21 months after the procedure, one case developed local tumor progression that was treated by additional RFA. CONCLUSION Pathologic diagnosis was possible by needle biopsy immediately after RFA for lung tumors. This technique may reduce the risks and efforts of performing biopsy and RFA on separate occasions.","Hasegawa, Takaaki; Kondo, Chiaki; Sato, Yozo; Inaba, Yoshitaka; Yamaura, Hidekazu; Kato, Mina; Murata, Shinichi; Onoda, Yui; Kuroda, Hiroaki; Sakao, Yukinori; Yatabe, Yasushi",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,248,14

Classical DC (cDC) include two major subsets distinguished in the mouse by the expression of CD8alpha. Here we describe a subset of CD8alpha(+) DC in lymphoid organs of naïve mice characterized by expression of the CX(3)CR1 chemokine receptor. CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC lack hallmarks of classical CD8alpha(+) DC, including IL-12 secretion, the capacity to cross-present antigen, and their developmental dependence on the transcriptional factor BatF3. Gene-expression profiling showed that CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC resemble CD8alpha(-) cDC. The microarray analysis further revealed a unique plasmacytoid DC (PDC) gene signature of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC. A PDC relationship of the cells is supported further by the fact that they harbor characteristic D-J Ig gene rearrangements and that development of CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC requires E2-2, the critical transcriptional regulator of PDC. Thus, CX(3)CR1(+) CD8alpha(+) DC represent a unique DC subset, related to but distinct from PDC. Collectively, the expression-profiling data of this study refine the resolution of previous DC definitions, sharpen the border of classical CD8alpha(+) and CD8alpha(-) DC, and should assist the identification of human counterparts of murine DC subsets.","Bar-On, Liat; Birnberg, Tal; Lewis, Kanako L; Edelson, Brian T; Bruder, Dunja; Hildner, Kai; Buer, Jan; Murphy, Kenneth M; Reizis, Boris; Jung, Steffen",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,248,17

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of islatravir and doravirine coadministration in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, fixed-sequence study. METHODS Adult participants without HIV infection were administered oral doravirine 100 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 4) once daily (QD) for 5 days, immediately followed by oral islatravir 2.25 mg (n = 10) or placebo QD (n = 4) for 14 days; islatravir 2.25 mg and doravirine 100 mg QD, or placebo QD, were then coadministered for 5 days. Pharmacokinetic and safety data were collected. RESULTS Doravirine geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% confidence intervals (CIs)) of (doravirine + islatravir)/doravirine for the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC0-24h), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and plasma concentration at 24 h post-dose (C24h) were not meaningfully impacted. Islatravir geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% CI) of (islatravir + doravirine)/islatravir for AUC0-24h and Cmax were both close to unity, 1.06 (1.01, 1.12) and 1.08 (0.91, 1.27), respectively. All study regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION These results indicate that coadministration of islatravir and doravirine had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug, and support further clinical investigation of islatravir in combination with doravirine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","Matthews, Randolph P; Jackson Rudd, Deanne; Fillgrove, Kerry L; Zhang, Saijuan; Tomek, Charles; Stoch, S Aubrey; Iwamoto, Marian",Clinical drug investigation,248,1

Accordingly, the development of window air filters to effectively intercept PM from outdoor air under natural ventilation conditions is an important research topic. However, most existing filters inevitably suffer from the compromise among filtration capability, transparency, and air permeability. In this study, we fabricate a high-performance transparent air filter to improve IAQ via natural ventilation. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) superfine nanofibers of size 20-35 nm are prepared using extremely dilute solution electrospinning; a multi-scale nanofiber structure is then designed. By adjusting the ratio of PVDF superfine nanofibers (SNs) to PVDF coarse fibers (CNs), we balance the structure-performance relationship. Benefiting from the multiscale structural features that include a small pore size (0.72 μm) and high porosity (92.22%), the resulting filters exhibit excellent performance including high interception efficiency (99.92%) for PM0.3, low air resistance (69 Pa), high transparency (∼80%) and stable filtration after 100 h of UV irradiation. This work describes a new strategy for the fabrication of nanofibers with true-nanoscale diameters and the design of high-performance air filters.","Xiong, Junpeng; Shao, Weili; Wang, Ling; Cui, Chen; Gao, Yanfei; Jin, Yurui; Yu, Hongqin; Han, Pengju; Liu, Fan; He, Jianxin",Journal of colloid and interface science,248,1

PURPOSE To report midterm clinical outcomes of MAT and the rate of return to sport in a physically active population. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS The study included all physically active patients who underwent arthroscopic MAT without bone plugs and had a minimum of 2 years of follow-up at a single institution. Clinical evaluation was performed with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner activity scale, and a 0- to 100-point subjective scale for knee function and satisfaction. Outcomes evaluated included ability to return to sport, time to return to sport, level of sport activity upon return compared with preinjury level, and level of decrease in sport participation or reasons for not returning to sport participation. Comparisons were made between patients who did or did not return to sport and between patients who returned to the same level or a decreased level. Regression analysis was performed to determine the variables affecting the outcomes. RESULTS Eighty-nine patients, whose mean ± SD age at surgery was 38.5 ± 11.2 years, were evaluated to a mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 1.9 years. Total KOOS improved from a mean ± SD of 39.5 ± 18.5 preoperatively to 84.7 ± 14.8 at the latest follow-up (P < .001). The Tegner score improved significantly from a median of 2 (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) preoperatively to a median of 4 (IQR, 3-6) at the latest follow-up (P < .001), although it did not reach the preinjury level of 6 (IQR, 5-7) (P < .001). Older age at surgery was correlated with the worst clinical results. Sixty-six patients (74%) were able to return to sport after 8.6 ± 4.1 months. Forty-four (49%) returned to the same level as preinjury. Patients who did not return to sport activity and those who reduced their activity level at follow-up had inferior subjective outcomes compared with those who returned to sport and those who returned to their preinjury levels, respectively. Only 11 patients (12%) underwent a surgical procedure during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Arthroscopic MAT without bone plugs improved knee function and reduced pain, allowing sport resumption in 74% of patients and return to the preinjury activity level in 49% of patients at midterm follow-up.

Cancers at these sites can differ anatomically and histologically and might have different causal factors, such as tobacco use, alcohol use, and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) (1). Incidence of combined oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers declined during the 1980s but began to increase around 1999 (2,3). Because tobacco use has declined in the United States, accompanied by a decrease in incidence of many tobacco-related cancers, researchers have suggested that the increase in oral cavity and pharynx cancers might be attributed to anatomic sites with specific cell types in which HPV DNA is often found (4,5). U.S. Cancer Statistics† data were analyzed to examine trends in incidence of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx by anatomic site, sex, race/ethnicity, and age group. During 2007-2016, incidence rates increased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined, base of tongue, anterior tongue, gum, tonsil, oropharynx, and other oral cavity and pharynx. Incidence rates declined for cancers of the lip, floor of mouth, soft palate and uvula, hard palate, hypopharynx, and nasopharynx, and were stable for cancers of the cheek and other mouth and salivary gland. Ongoing implementation of proven population-based strategies to prevent tobacco use initiation, promote smoking cessation, reduce excessive alcohol use, and increase HPV vaccination rates might help prevent cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx.","Ellington, Taylor D; Henley, S Jane; Senkomago, Virginia; O'Neil, Mary Elizabeth; Wilson, Reda J; Singh, Simple; Thomas, Cheryll C; Wu, Manxia; Richardson, Lisa C",MMWR.

A 74-year-old woman who was a hepatitis B virus carrier was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal screening result during a routine health checkup. Abdominal computed tomography and an endocrinologic workup revealed a 2-cm left adrenal tumor with primary aldosteronism. We prioritized the safety of the SILA adrenalectomy by choosing a left lower abdominal approach. A SILS port was inserted through a 2.5-cm incision. An ultrasonic coagulator was the main tool used during the surgical procedure. The duration of the surgery was 105 min and the blood loss was 1 ml. This result was comparable to that of a conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Based on our experience, an SILA adrenalectomy is thus considered to be feasible and safe, with better cosmetic results and a greater overall patient satisfaction than that of a conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. However, further studies will be necessary before the universal adoption of this new technique can be considered.","Shimabuku, Masamori; Sasaki, Akira; Higa, Moritake; Kakazu, Masanori; Asato, Masaya; Shiroma, Hiroshi",Surgery today,248,27

METHODS To obtain health-related data, including the participants' awareness of avian influenza, their recognition of potential infection, and their risk image, or their level of fear and understanding an anonymous self-reported questionnaire was administered. We measured the risk image on a 7-point scale, with 1 representing the lowest and 7 representing the highest risk image. Using their responses from 8 questions (4 per factor), We then calculated and averaged the scores to obtain the fear factor and unknown factor scores. RESULTS This questionnaire was completed by 310 of 1,000 (31.0%) members of the general population and 198 of 976 (20.3%) poultry farmers. The two groups differed significantly in terms of their overall awareness and understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome (odds ratio=0.49 P=.003), with the general population scoring significantly lower than the poultry farmers. The risk image scores showed significant differences in fear factor (β=-0.89, P<.001) and unknown factor (β=0.74, P<.001), with the risk image for the fear factor being lower and that of the unknown factor being higher in the general population when compared with the poultry famers.

Previous studies of community-wide disasters suggested people are fairly resilient and identified resources and strategies that promote that resilience. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic is in some ways unique, with high levels of uncertainty, evolving implications and restrictions, and varied and uneven impacts. How resilient were Americans as the pandemic progressed? What psychosocial resources and coping strategies facilitated adjustment as the country moved into a summer of uneven reopenings and reclosures? Data from a national sample of 674 Americans were gathered at the height of early lockdowns and peaking infections in mid-April, 2020, and again, 5 and 10 weeks later. The study aimed to determine levels and sources of distress and to identify the resources and coping efforts that promoted or impeded resilience. Early levels of distress diminished to some extent over subsequent months while levels of wellbeing were comparable with usual norms, suggesting a largely resilient response. COVID-19-related stress exposure also decreased gradually over time. Older age, higher levels of mindfulness and social support, and meaning focused coping predicted better adjustment, reflecting resilience, while avoidance coping was particularly unhelpful. In models predicting change over time, approach-oriented coping (i.e., active coping, meaning-focused coping, and seeking social support) was minimally predictive of subsequent adjustment. Given the unique and ongoing circumstances presented by COVID-19, specific interventions targeting psychosocial resources and coping identified here may help to promote resilience as the pandemic continues to unfold.

There was significantly low research intensity for paratyphoid fever and high intensity for influenza, HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis considering their disease burden. We identified the infectious diseases that have received the most attention from researchers and those that have been relatively disregarded. Interestingly, not all so-called neglected tropical diseases were subject to low burden-adjusted research intensity. Analysis of the intensity of infectious disease research at a country level revealed characteristic patterns.

Methods A total of 86 patients who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy due to symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse between January 2014 and January 2016 at İzmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic were retrospectively reviewed using the hospital information system. Patients were divided into two groups: those with and without prolonged length of hospital stay. They were evaluated in terms of gastrointestinal complications and risk factors. Results The reason for prolonged hospitalization was nausea and vomiting in 24 (88%) of 27 patients. The symptoms in these patients were recovered with hydration, stopping of oral intake, and administration of antiemetics. Nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition were required in three (11%) patients due to clinical and radiological evidence of ileus. The parameter that significantly prolonged the length of hospital stay was prior abdominal surgery (p < 0.05). Conclusion There were obvious gastrointestinal complications in three out of 27 patients with prolonged length of hospital stay.

Intra-operative monitoring of renal region tissue oxygenation (SrtO2) might be a useful tool to detect renal hypoxia and predict postoperative renal impairment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the ability of intra-operative SrtO2 to predict postoperative renal impairment, defined as an increase of serum creatinine concentrations of > 10% from individual baseline, and compare this with the predictive abilities of peripheral and cerebral tissue oxygenation (SptO2 and SctO2, respectively) and renal specific tissue deoxygenation. Forty-one patients undergoing elective CABG were included. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to measure renal region, peripheral (thenar muscle) and cerebral tissue oxygenation during surgery. Renal region specific tissue deoxygenation was defined as a proportionally larger decrease in SrtO2 than SptO2. ROC analyses were used to compare predictive abilities. We did not observe an association between tissue oxygenation measured in the renal region and cerebral oxygenation and postoperative renal impairment in this small retrospective study. In contrast, SptO2 decrease > 10% from baseline was a reasonable predictor with an AUROC of 0.767 (95%CI 0.619 to 0.14; p = 0.010). Tissue oxygenation of the renal region, although non-invasively and continuously available, cannot be used in adults to predict postoperative renal impairment after CABG. Instead, peripheral tissue deoxygenation was able to predict postoperative renal impairment, suggesting that SptO2 provides a better indication of 'general' tissue oxygenation status.Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01347827, first submitted April 27, 2011.","de Keijzer, Ilonka N; Poterman, Marieke; Absalom, Anthony R; Vos, Jaap Jan; Mariani, Massimo A; Scheeren, Thomas W L",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,248,27

This new strain of coronavirus is not completely understood and to date, there is no treatment of coronavirus. Traditional ayurvedic medicines mainly essential oils and Chinese herbs have always played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemics and pandemics. In the meantime, guidelines of the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoepathy) include a traditional medicinal treatment for flu and fever and also recommended to boost immunity to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It is not possible to find which essential oil will offer the best level of protection. However, it is likely to assume that some essential oils are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way they do with many other known viruses. METHODS Literature relevant to various essential oils having antiviral activity has been collected and compiled. Various nanocarriers of essential oils have also been stated. The database was collected using various search engines such as jgate, google scholar, scihub, pubmed, sciencedirect etc. Results: Essential oils contain active constituents such as phenolics compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, phenyl propanoids etc., which are responsible for their biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities and many more. But the use of essential oils has always been limited due to poor solubility, solvent toxicity, volatility and low solubility. Many nanotechnology based carriers especially, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and microemulsion etc. have been evidenced to overcome limitations associated with essential oils. CONCLUSION Several essential oils possess potent antiviral activity and are characterized by fewer side effects and are safe to human use. The nanocarrier systems of these oils have proved the potential to treat viral and bacterial infections.","Kaur, Malkiet; Devi, Gayatri; Nagpal, Manju; Singh, Manjinder; Dhingra, Gitika Arora; Aggarwal, Geeta",Pharmaceutical nanotechnology,248,19

Recoding sites, along with downstream recoding stimulatory elements (RSEs), have long been studied in reporter constructs, because these fragments alone mediate customary levels of recoding and are thus assumed to contain complete instructions for establishment of the proper ratio of termination to recoding. RSEs from the Tombusviridae and Luteoviridae are thought to be exceptions, since they contain a long-distance RNA-RNA connection with the 3' end. This interaction has been suggested to substitute for pseudoknots, thought to be missing in tombusvirid RSEs. We provide evidence that the phylogenetically conserved RSE of the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) adopts an alternative, smaller structure that extends an upstream conserved hairpin and that this alternative structure is the predominant form of the RSE within nascent viral RNA in plant cells and when RNA is synthesized in vitro The TCV RSE also contains an internal pseudoknot along with the long-distance interaction, and the pseudoknot is not compatible with the phylogenetically conserved structure. Conserved residues just past the recoding site are important for recoding, and these residues are also conserved in the RSEs of gammaretroviruses. Our data demonstrate the dynamic nature of the TCV RSE and suggest that studies using reporter constructs may not be effectively recapitulating RSE-mediated recoding within viral genomes. IMPORTANCE Ribosome recoding is used by RNA viruses to enable ribosomes to extend translation past termination codons for the synthesis of longer products. Recoding sites and a downstream recoding stimulatory element (RSE) mediate expected levels of recoding when excised and placed in reporter constructs and thus are assumed to contain complete instructions for the establishment of the proper ratio of termination to recoding. We provide evidence that most of the TCV RSE adopts an alternative structure that extends an upstream conserved hairpin and that this alternative structure, and not the phylogenetically conserved structure, is the predominant form of the RSE in RNA synthesized in vitro and in plant cells. The TCV RSE also contains an internal pseudoknot that is not compatible with the phylogenetically conserved structure and an RNA bridge to the 3' end. These data suggest that the TCV RSE is structurally dynamic and that multiple conformations are likely required to regulate ribosomal readthrough.","Kuhlmann, Micki M; Chattopadhyay, Maitreyi; Stupina, Vera A; Gao, Feng; Simon, Anne E",Journal of virology,248,19

Therefore, we analyzed the impact of social distancing and loneliness in suicidal ideation. METHODS We performed two waves of a snowball sample, web-based survey in Brazil (W1: from May 6th to June 6th, 2020; W2: from June 6th to July 6th, 2020). We assessed whether risk factors related to social relationships (loneliness, living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing) at W1 were associated with suicidal ideation at W1 and W2 using multiple regression models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, mental health, and lifestyle variables. RESULTS A total of 1,674 (18-75 years old; 86.5% females) were included in our longitudinal sample. Living alone (OR: 1.16; 95%CI = 1.03 - 1.30; p=0.015), number of days practicing social distancing (OR: 1.002; 95%CI = 1.000 - 1.004; p=0.027), and loneliness (OR: 1.49; 95%CI = 1.32 - 1.68; p<0.001) were associated with suicidal ideation in the cross-sectional analysis of W1. Only loneliness (OR= 2.12; 95%CI = 1.06 - 4.24; p = 0.033) remained significant as a risk factor to suicidal ideation in the longitudinal analysis between both waves. LIMITATION Snowball, convenience sample design limits outcome estimates. Assessments were not objectively performed. CONCLUSION Loneliness was consistently associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation, while other variables, such as living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing, were not. Measures to overcome loneliness are therefore necessary to reduce suicidal ideation during pandemics.","Antonelli-Salgado, Thyago; Monteiro, Gabriela Massaro Carneiro; Marcon, Grasiela; Roza, Thiago Henrique; Zimerman, Aline; Hoffmann, Maurício Scopel; Cao, Bo; Hauck, Simone; Brunoni, André Russowsky; Passos, Ives Cavalcante",Journal of affective disorders,248,1

The coexistence of these 2 rare entities is suggestive of a causal relationship between them, which may lead to further understanding of their pathogenesis. We present a series of 6 patients with epidural spinal arteriovenous fistulas associated with neural tube defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrieved cases of spinal vascular malformations associated with neural tube defects seen at our institution. The clinical presentation, MR imaging/MRA and angiographic imaging, treatment outcomes, and long-term neurologic outcomes were analyzed. Descriptive statistical analyses are reported. RESULTS Six patients with epidural arteriovenous fistulas and neural tube defects were included in this study. The mean age at presentation was 42 years, and the most common presenting symptoms were lower extremity weakness followed by sensory disturbances and bladder/bowel dysfunction. In most cases (5/6), the fistulas were located at the sacral level. All cases were fed by the lateral sacral artery (6/6). Four patients had prior spine surgery, but the fistula was in the operative bed in 2 cases. All fistulas were extradural with secondary intradural venous drainage. Five patients underwent transarterial embolization with Onyx, and 1 patient had a treatment-related complication. CONCLUSIONS It is conceivable that there is a pathophysiologic link between neural tube defects and development of spinal vascular malformations. Delayed neurologic deterioration or high conus signal in a patient with a neural tube defect should suggest the possibility of such an association.","Giordan, E; Bortolotti, C; Lanzino, G; Brinjikji, W",AJNR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In all, 74 pulmonary MDCT examinations in 37 consecutive hematopoietic stem celltransplantation patients with febrile neutropenia and clinically suspected IPA were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Diagnosis of IPA was based on Fungal Infections Cooperative Group, and National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases Mycoses Study Consensus Group criteria. In all, 0, 14, and 11 patients were diagnosed as proven,probable, and possible IPA, respectively. Among the 25 patients accepted as probable and possible IPA, all had pulmonaryMDCT findings consistent with IPA. The remaining 12 patients were accepted as having fever of unknown origin (FUO)and had patent vessels based on MDCT findings.In the patients with probable and possible IPA, 72 focal pulmonary lesions were observed; in 41 of the 72 (57%) lesionsvascular occlusion was noted and the CT halo sign was observed in 25 of these 41 (61%) lesions. Resolution of feveroccurred following antifungal therapy in 19 (76%) of the 25 patients with probable and possible IPA. In all, 6 (25%)of the patients diagnosed as IPA died during follow-up. Transplant-related mortality 100 d post transplant in patientswith IPA and FUO was 24% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION In conclusion, MDCT has a potential role in the early diagnosis of IPA via detection of vessel occlusion.","Ciledağ, Nazan; Arda, Kemal; Arıbaş, Bilgin Kadri; Tekgündüz, Ali Irfan Emre; Altuntaş, Fevzi",Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,248,1

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors unique to adult development. The present study examined how changes in life roles (educational, marital, and parental status) predicted disordered eating as participants transitioned from their 20s to their 50s. Participants (N = 624 women and N = 276 men) completed baseline assessments in college and at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up, with 72% of women and 67% of men completing 30-year follow-up. Multilevel models examined how changes in life roles predicted changes in disordered eating. For women, obtaining a graduate degree predicted decreased eating pathology initially but over time predicted subsequent increases in Drive for Thinness. Men's eating pathology was not affected by obtaining a graduate degree. Changes in marital status demonstrated no significant association with disordered eating for either gender. Becoming a parent predicted a significant decrease in Drive for Thinness at the subsequent assessment but no further declines with age, whereas those who never had children showed significant decreases in both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia with age. For both women and men, becoming a parent may decrease the importance of shape and weight as sources of self-evaluation. However, women obtaining advanced degrees and parents may experience shifts in eating pathology related to the ""Career-and-Care-Crunch"" according to Mehta and colleagues' (2020) recent conceptualization of adult developmental stages. Pending independent replication, future research might design interventions for those whose role transitions put them at greater risk for disordered eating during midlife.

The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of Immunoxel used as adjunct therapy with conventional anti-TB therapy for the treatment of pulmonary TB. METHODS Comprehensive search was conducted in different major databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus (Elsevier). We also searched Google Scholar along with trial registries and hand-searched the reference list of identified original research as well as review articles. Conference proceedings of relevant TB and lung disease annual conferences were also screened. Two independent authors extracted outcome data using a standardised extraction form. Relative risk (RR), mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as measures of effect. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS Six clinical trials, which met the criteria for the review, were identified, and these provided data for the review. Overall results from the six trials that compared antituberculosis treatment (ATT) alone versus ATT and Immunoxel, and ATT and placebo versus ATT and Immunoxel showed an increased number of patients becoming sputum-negative in the Immunoxel group (RR 3.19; 95% CI 2.44 to 4.17; 488 participants). There was also reduction in body temperature among patients receiving Immunoxel compared to ATT alone (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.18, 345 participants). However, there were no differences in body weight changes across all the studies (MD 5.65; 95% CI -0.80 to 12.11; 382 participants). CONCLUSION Current evidence indicates that the use of Immunoxel as an adjunctive treatment in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis has the potential to enhance the efficacy of antituberculosis treatment. However, well-designed, conducted and adequately powered clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of this adjunctive treatment.

The virus continues to evolve and mutate. In particular, the recently emerged ""UK"", ""South Africa"", and Delta variants show higher infectivity and spreading speed. Thus, the relationship between the mutations of certain amino acids and the spreading speed of the virus is a problem of great importance. In this respect, understanding the mutational mechanism is crucial for surveillance and prediction of future mutations as well as antibody/vaccine development. In this work, we used a coarse-grained model (that was used previously in predicting the importance of mutations of N501) to calculate the free energy change of various types of single-site or combined-site mutations. This was done for the UK, South Africa, and Delta mutants. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the binding affinity changes for mutations at different spike protein domains of SARS-CoV-2 and provided the energy basis for the resistance of the E484 mutant to the antibody m396. Other potential mutation sites were also predicted. Furthermore, the in silico predictions were assessed by functional experiments. The results establish that the faster spreading of recently observed mutants is strongly correlated with the binding-affinity enhancement between virus and human receptor as well as with the reduction of the binding to the m396 antibody. Significantly, the current approach offers a way to predict new variants and to assess the effectiveness of different antibodies toward such variants.","Bai, Chen; Wang, Junlin; Chen, Geng; Zhang, Honghui; An, Ke; Xu, Peiyi; Du, Yang; Ye, Richard D; Saha, Arjun; Zhang, Aoxuan; Warshel, Arieh",Journal of the American Chemical Society,248,17

Studies that have analysed the variations in hepatic profile in correlation with the inflammatory markers in SARS-CoV-2 are limited. METHODS We retrospectively analysed liver function tests and inflammatory markers of 170 admitted patients with conﬁrmed COVID-19 in the tertiary care centre, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), India, using Roche Cobas Autoanalyzer. RESULTS Number of patients with normal liver enzyme levels were 63 (41.5%), while with raised levels of any of the liver enzymes were 89 (58.5%), out of which 43 (48.31%) had liver injury which manifested as increased severity in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) requirement (p=0.0005). Significantly raised levels of liver enzymes and liver injury were observed with age (p<0.0001) and in males (p=0.004). Significantly decreased levels of albumin and total proteins and increased levels of total bilirubin (p<0.0001) were seen in patients with abnormal liver enzyme levels and liver injury as compared to patients with normal levels. Significant increase in the levels of alanine transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transferase was seen on the 7th day, CRP and ferritin (p<0.0001) peaks were observed on 2nd and 3rd day respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the levels of these inflammatory markers and liver function parameters. CONCLUSIONS More than half of patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection had an abnormal liver function which was found to be associated with raised levels of inflammatory markers. Signiﬁcantly higher proportions of patients with abnormal liver function were elderly and males and were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease.","Saini, Ram Krishan; Saini, Neha; Ram, Sant; Soni, Shiv Lal; Suri, Vikas; Malhotra, Pankaj; Kaur, Jyotdeep; Verma, Indu; Sharma, Sadhna; Zohmangaihi, Deepy",Postgraduate medical journal,248,12

We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and fluorescence spectral imaging. Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. This Vibrio was also the primary ASV found in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower abundance, as determined by qPCR, and was found only scattered in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer via imaging analysis. Treatment of animals with the commonly used antibiotic enrofloxacin led to a nearly 80% reduction of the dominant Vibrio ASV in the esophagus but did not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria overall between treated versus control animals. Data from the gills were dominated by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites. IMPORTANCE Microbes can play critical roles in the physiology of their animal hosts, as evidenced in cephalopods by the role of Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri in the light organ of the bobtail squid and the role of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the reproductive system and egg defense in a variety of cephalopods. We sampled the cuttlefish microbiome throughout the digestive tract, gills, and skin and found dense colonization of an unexpected site, the esophagus, by a microbe of the genus Vibrio, as well as colonization of gills by Piscirickettsiaceae. This finding expands the range of organisms and body sites known to be associated with Vibrio and is of potential significance for understanding host-symbiont associations, as well as for understanding and maintaining the health of cephalopods in mariculture.","Lutz, Holly L; Ramírez-Puebla, S Tabita; Abbo, Lisa; Durand, Amber; Schlundt, Cathleen; Gottel, Neil R; Sjaarda, Alexandra K; Hanlon, Roger T; Gilbert, Jack A; Mark Welch, Jessica L",mSystems,248,1

The nucleoproteins (NP) of arenaviruses are reported to antagonize the IFN response by inhibiting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Here, we demonstrate that the Z proteins of four New World (NW) arenaviruses, Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MAVC), and Sabia virus (SABV), bind to RIG-I, resulting in downregulation of the IFN-beta response. We show that expression of the four NW arenavirus Z proteins inhibits IFN-beta mRNA induction in A549 cells in response to RNA bearing 5' phosphates (5'pppRNA). NW arenavirus Z proteins interact with RIG-I in coimmunoprecipitation studies and colocalize with RIG-I. Furthermore, expression of Z proteins interferes with the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Z expression also impedes the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and IRF-3 activation. Our results indicate that NW arenavirus Z proteins, but not Z protein of the Old World (OW) arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Lassa virus, bind to RIG-I and inhibit downstream activation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, preventing the transcriptional induction of IFN-beta.","Fan, Lina; Briese, Thomas; Lipkin, W Ian",Journal of virology,248,31

However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology. Methods We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p = 0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, as may be seen in systemic illness, and in part associated with recent sedation (p = 0.022). Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","Ayub, Neishay; Cohen, Joseph; Jing, Jin; Jain, Aayushee; Tesh, Ryan; Mukerji, Shibani S; Zafar, Sahar F; Westover, M Brandon; Kimchi, Eyal Y",The Neurohospitalist,248,33

Guidelines concerning electrosurgery and active implants such as pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators have been published, but most describe interference between electrosurgery and the active implant rather than the risk of unintended tissue heating. Tissue heating in proximity to implants during electrosurgery may cause an increased risk of patient injury. Objective: To determine the temperature of tissue close to metal implants during electrosurgery in an in-vitro model. Design, Setting, and Participants: Thirty tissue samples (15 with a metal implant placed in center, 15 controls without implant) were placed in an in vitro measurement chamber. Electrosurgery was applied at 5-60 W with the active electrode at three defined distances from the implant while temperatures at four defined distances from the implant were measured using fiber-optic sensors. Main Outcomes and Measures: Tissue temperature increase at the four tissue sites was determined for all power levels and each of the electrode-to-implant distances. Based on a linear mixed effects model analysis, the primary outcomes were the difference in temperature increase between implant and control tissue, and the estimated temperature increase per watt per minute. Results: Tissues with an implant had higher temperature increases than controls at all power levels after 1 min of applied electrosurgery (mean difference of 0.16°C at 5 W, 0.50°C at 15 W, 1.11°C at 30 W, and 2.22°C at 60 W, all with p < 0.001). Temperature increase close to the implant was estimated to be 0.088°C/W/min (95% CI: 0.078-0.099°C/W/min; p < 0.001). Temperature could increase to above 43°C after 1 min of 60 W. Active electrode position had no significant effect on temperature increases for tissues with implant (p = 0.6).

One of the strategic approaches for effective surveillance, monitoring and control of infectious diseases compromising health in both humans and animals could be through a combination of multiple disciplines. The approach can be achieved through a joint effort from stakeholders comprising health professionals (medical and veterinary), social, economic, agricultural, environmental and other interested parties. With resource scarcity in terms of number of staff, skills and facility in low-income countries, participatory multi- sectoral and multidisciplinary approaches in limiting the burden of zoonotic diseases could be worthwhile.

To facilitate optimal occupational performance for children with SFAs, it is critical that clinicians understand child behaviour and caregiver strategy use to manage child behaviour during meals. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reliability of a novel coding scheme, the Behavioural Mealtime Coding System (BMCS) and identify associations among child acceptance of preferred and targeted foods, child food exploration and caregiver use of strategies to manage child behaviour. METHODS Twenty-one children (aged 18-60 months) with SFAs and their caregivers were recruited using a convenience sample. An observational video coding system was developed to code mealtime behaviour in 63 typical mealtime videos recorded by caregivers in the home environment. Inter-rater reliability, descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were calculated. RESULTS The BMCS demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = .95). Child bites of targeted foods were associated with mealtime duration (rs = .51, p = .02) and events of the child licking food (rs = .57, p = .007). Caregiver use of threats was positively associated with child age (rs = .48, p = .03) and negatively associated with caregiver education level (rs = -.49, p = .03). CONCLUSION For children with SFAs, increasing mealtime duration by embedding positive activities to encourage food exploration may improve acceptance of healthy targeted foods. Future research is needed to better understand the complex relationships among caregiver strategy use, mealtime duration and child mealtime behaviour.","Caldwell, Angela R; Krause, Elise K",Australian occupational therapy journal,248,1
121503,121503,121503,Fan therapy for cough: case report and literature review.,16.07869,10.070468,2020-07-06,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2, has created a global health, social, and economic crisis. As of mid-January 2021, there are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. The main protease (Mpro) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the Mpro has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the Mpro in complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, N3 and α-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. Our results indicate that the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the Mpro target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the Mpro than the α-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the Mpro-N3 covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the Mpro-α-ketoamide covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.","Awoonor-Williams, Ernest; Abu-Saleh, Abd Al-Aziz A",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,248,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 73 patients were treated from 2007 to 2017. Patients can be categorised into five stages: Stage I, involves only a phimotic band; Stage 2, required excision of diseased penile skin with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG); Stage 3, requires scrotal excision; Stage 4, requires escutcheonectomy; and Stage 5, requires panniculectomy. Successful treatment hinges on adequate excision of diseased skin and de-bulking followed by replacement of deficient skin with STSG. RESULTS In all, 36 of 73 (49%) patients had Stage 1-3 disease, whilst 37 of 73 (51%) were Stage 4-5. There were complications within the first 30 days in 44 of 73 (60%) patients. In all, 62 of 73 (85%) patients either had no complications or Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications and nine (12%) had complications beyond 30 days. Only five of 36 (14%) patients with Stage 1-3 disease had complications. One patient developed recurrent phimosis. CONCLUSION The buried penis is a challenging surgical entity where conservative treatment will most likely lead to failure. Surgery is the only means for a lasting cure in these patients and should be used as a first-line treatment. One should expect complications postoperatively, especially within the first 30 days; however, these are mostly limited to Clavien-Dindo grade I-II complications.","Jun, Min S; Gallegos, Maxx A; Santucci, Richard A",BJU international,248,16

Understanding hesitancy towards immunization is even more important nowadays, with the continuous threat of COVID-19 pandemic. Medical conspiracy beliefs, scientific skepticism, as well as low trust in governmental institutions, and evidence-based knowledge all have troubling effects on immunization. OBJECTIVE To examine how these factors cross-react to influence vaccine behavior against any vaccine preventable disease (VPD), we hypothesized a model consisting of the belief in conspiracy theories as the predictor, and as the mediators subjective and objective vaccine knowledge, and trust in the health care system and science. The model was tested by examining the vaccine intentions for the children and self for any VPD. METHODS Two separate studies were conducted on the representative samples of Serbian population; the first study investigated the intentions for child vaccination and the second study examined the vaccine intentions against any VPD, including adult vaccination. We used path analysis followed by logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS The results revealed high vaccine hesitancy motivated by the belief in the vaccine conspiracy theories, through its effect on reduced trust in medical science and institutions, and low objective vaccine knowledge. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study may be used to implement appropriate policy changes and implementation of the public health campaigns to promote immunization with a wide range of vaccines against common diseases, such as measles, human papillomaviruses, or pertussis, and novel diseases, such as COVID.","Milošević Đorđević, J; Mari, S; Vdović, M; Milošević, A",Social science & medicine,248,31

A rapid description based on the NIR technology is implemented to assess black tea tenderness and rankings. First, 700 standard samples from dianhong black tea of seven quality classes are scanned using a NIR system. The raw spectra acquired are preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering coupled with standard normal variate transformation (SNV). Then, the multi-variable selection algorithm (IGA-PSO) is applied to compare with the single method (the IGA and PSO) and search the optimal characteristic wavelengths. Finally, the identification models are developed using a decision tree (DT), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and support vector machine (SVM) based on different kernel functions combined with the effective features from the above variables screening paths for the discrimination of black tea quality. The results show that the IGA-PSO-SVM model with a radial basis function achieves the best predictive results with the correct discriminant rate (CDR) of 95.28% based on selected four characteristic variables in the prediction process. The overall results demonstrate that NIR combined with a multi-variable selection method can constitute a potential tool to understand the most important features involved in the evaluation of dianhong black tea quality helping the instrument manufacturers to achieve the development of low-cost and handheld NIR sensors.","Ren, Guangxin; Ning, Jingming; Zhang, Zhengzhu","Spectrochimica acta.

Preclinical and clinical studies reveal that consumption of the marine ω-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) might be used as a precision nutrition intervention to lessen lupus symptoms. The anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of ω-3 HUFAs are inextricably linked to their presence in membrane phospholipids. The ω-3 HUFA score, calculated as [100 × (ω-3 HUFAs/(ω-3 HUFAs + ω-6 HUFAs))] in red blood cells (RBCs), and the Omega-3 Index (O3I), calculated as [100 × ((DHA+EPA)/total fatty acids)] in RBCs, are two biomarkers potentially amenable to relating tissue HUFA balance to clinical outcomes in individuals with lupus. Using data from three prior preclinical DHA supplementation studies, we tested the hypothesis that the ω-3 HUFA score and the O3I inversely correlate with indicators of autoimmune pathogenesis in the cSiO2-triggered lupus flaring model. The three studies employed both low and high fat rodent diets, as well as more complex diets emulating the U.S. dietary pattern. The ω-3 HUFA scores in RBCs were comparatively more robust than the O3I at predicting HUFA balances in the kidney, liver, spleen, and lung. Importantly, increases in both the ω-3 HUFA score (>40%) and the O3I (>10%) were strongly associated with suppression of cSiO2-triggered (1) expression of interferon-regulated genes, proinflammatory cytokine production, leukocyte infiltration, and ectopic lymphoid structure development in the lung, (2) pulmonary and systemic autoantibody production, and (3) glomerulonephritis. Collectively, these findings identify achievable ω-3 HUFA scores and O3I thresholds that could be targeted in future human intervention studies querying how ω-3 HUFA consumption influences lupus and other autoimmune diseases.","Wierenga, Kathryn A; Strakovsky, Rita S; Benninghoff, Abby D; Rajasinghe, Lichchavi D; Lock, Adam L; Harkema, Jack R; Pestka, James J",Frontiers in immunology,248,1

This study compared the accuracy of the Dexcom G5 Mobile (Dexcom, San Diego, CA) transcutaneous sensor (DG5) and the first version of Eversense (Senseonics,Inc., Germantown, MD) implantable sensor (EVS). METHODS AND RESULTS Subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and using EVS wore simultaneously DG5 for seven days. At day 3, patients were admitted to a clinical research center (CRC) to receive breakfast with delayed and increased insulin bolus to induce glucose excursions. At CRC, venous glucose was monitored every 15 min (or 5 min during hypoglycemia) for 6 h by YSI 2300 STAT PLUS™ glucose and lactate analyzer. At home patients were requested to perform 4 fingerstick glucose measurements per day. Eleven patients (9 males, age 47.4 ± 11.3 years, M±SD) were enrolled. During home-stay the median [25th-75th percentile] absolute relative difference (ARD) over all CGM-fingerstick matched-pairs was 11.64% [5.38-20.65]% for the DG5 and 10.75% [5.15-19.74]% for the EVS (p-value = 0.58). At CRC, considering all the CGM-YSI matched-pairs, the DG5 showed overall smaller median ARD than EVS, 7.91% [4.14-14.30]% vs 11.4% [5.04-18.54]% (p-value<0.001). Considering accuracy during blood glucose swings, DG5 performed better than EVS when glucose rate-of-change was -0.5 to -1.5 mg/dL/min, with median ARD of 7.34% [3.71-12.76]% vs 13.59% [4.53-20.78]% (p-value<0.001), and for rate-of-change < -1.5 mg/dl/min, with median ARD of 5.23% [2.09-15.29]% vs 12.73% [4.14-20.82]% (p-value = 0.02).

Salvaging the blood in the portal hypertension-induced enlarged spleen becomes an issue of concern during devascularization surgery because an enlarged spleen accommodates a large red cell pool. We report 20 cases of laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection and present the advantages of the use of intraoperative splenic blood salvage during the procedure. METHODS A total of 20 cirrhotic patients with esophagogastric variceal bleeding refractory to treatment with β-blockers and endoscopic therapy were studied. Laparoscopic splenectomy with azygoportal disconnection was performed. During the procedure, an intraoperative autologous blood salvage device recovered the splenic blood. The perioperative data were recorded from various viewpoints. RESULTS The operative time was 3.1 ± 0.3 h and the blood loss was 70.5 ± 32.5 ml. The weight of the excised and morcellated spleen was 826.0 ± 155.1 g. The volume of autotransfused blood was 541.0 ± 150.4 ml. No patient received a perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion. There were no significant complications either intraoperatively or postoperatively. The hemoglobin value increased from 9.3 ± 0.8 to 11.5 ± 1.1 g/dl at postoperative day 1 (p < 0.01). During a postoperative follow-up period of 18.0 ± 9.0 months for 18 patients, neither esophageal variceal bleeding nor encephalopathy recurred. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic splenectomy with azygoportal disconnection is a feasible, effective, and safe surgical method for the treatment of bleeding portal hypertension. Intraoperative splenic blood salvage can avoid the risk associated with allogeneic transfusion during the procedure, with an advantage of significantly increased postoperative hemoglobin levels.","Wang, Yuedong; Ji, Yun; Zhu, Yangwen; Xie, Zhijie; Zhan, Xiaoli",Surgical endoscopy,248,1

This case highlights the need to be aware of improperly fitted face masks as a cause of artifact on standard automated perimetry (SAP). CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 32-year-old female underwent SAP with the 24-2 SITA Fast test of the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) wearing an ear-loop surgical face mask. At the end of testing it was noted that the mask had ridden up the patient's face. Small amounts of condensate were noted on the perimeter lens. CLINICAL FINDINGS SAP demonstrated good reliability indices but in both eyes there was a marked reduction in sensitivity inferiorly. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test was outside normal limits. It was ensured the upper border of mask was well sealed with the loops secured around the ears and nasal strip of the mask pinched down. Visual fields were repeated and were found to be normal. CONCLUSIONS Poorly fitting face masks represent a new cause of visual field artifact which may mimic pathological field defects. Without careful attention during testing, the cause of such artifacts may not be apparent, especially as reliability indices may be normal. Adjustments to the fit of face masks may help prevent fogging or mask slippage and increase test reliability.","Young, Su Ling; Smith, Margaret L; Tatham, Andrew J",Journal of glaucoma,248,5

It has been demonstrated that IL-3 plays an essential role in the processing of sepsis and the inhibition of IL-3 may alleviate sepsis progress. In our previous study, we selected a novel CD123 aptamer successfully which could inhibit the interaction of CD123 and IL-3. The aim of this study is to explore the protection ability of the first thioaptamer SS30 against sepsis in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rat model. Serum IL-3 level of sepsis patients was assessed by ELISA. CLP rat model was applied in all experimental groups. CD123 thioaptamer SS30 and CD123 antibody were used to block the recognition between IL-3 and CD123. Body weight, temperature, blood gas, MAP, and serum cytokines of four grouped rats were assessed. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate JAK2 and STAT5 proteins. After the administration of SS30 or CD123 antibody, the rats in SS30 and CD123 antibody group had lower cytokines values(lactate, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), whereas exhibited higher value of core temperature, MAP, PO2/FiO2, and ETCO2 than those in the CLP group. The expression level of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT5 was declined and the survival rate of rats was increased. In addition, the protection ability of SS30 was better than CD123 antibody. Therefore, CD123 thioaptamer SS30 could reduce mortality by down-regulating the phosphorylated JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway, and reduce serum cytokines which involving in sepsis development in CLP rat model.","Zhao, Jiangang; Wang, Meng; Yang, Ying; Wang, Guoxia; Che, Fengyu; Li, Qiao; Zhang, Liyu","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",248,1

Unfortunately, existing HumAb mice do not have fully functional immune systems, perhaps because of the manner in which their genetic humanization was carried out. Heretofore, HumAb mice have been generated by disrupting the endogenous mouse Ig genes and simultaneously introducing human Ig transgenes at a different and random location; KO-plus-transgenic humanization. As we describe in the companion paper, we attempted to make mice that more efficiently use human variable region segments in their humoral responses by precisely replacing 6 Mb of mouse Ig heavy and kappa light variable region germ-line gene segments with their human counterparts while leaving the mouse constant regions intact, using a unique in situ humanization approach. We reasoned the introduced human variable region gene segments would function indistinguishably in their new genetic location, whereas the retained mouse constant regions would allow for optimal interactions and selection of the resulting antibodies within the mouse environment. We show that these mice, termed VelocImmune mice because they were generated using VelociGene technology, efficiently produce human:mouse hybrid antibodies (that are rapidly convertible to fully human antibodies) and have fully functional humoral immune systems indistinguishable from those of WT mice. The efficiency of the VelocImmune approach is confirmed by the rapid progression of 10 different fully human antibodies into human clinical trials.","Murphy, Andrew J; Macdonald, Lynn E; Stevens, Sean; Karow, Margaret; Dore, Anthony T; Pobursky, Kevin; Huang, Tammy T; Poueymirou, William T; Esau, Lakeisha; Meola, Melissa; Mikulka, Warren; Krueger, Pamela; Fairhurst, Jeanette; Valenzuela, David M; Papadopoulos, Nicholas; Yancopoulos, George D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,248,1

The MSU may be particularly valuable for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, the most evidence-based effective emergency treatment for the most prevalent stroke diagnosis. OBJECTIVES To review existing data on prehospital stroke treatment, especially relevant to MSU technology, to identify gaps in our understanding of MSU feasibility, especially relevant to applying the MSU strategy in the United States, and to describe the Houston MSU program and clinical trial. EVIDENCE REVIEW Published data from English-language journals in PubMed from 1995 to present reviewing early treatment with tPA and prehospital stroke evaluation and treatment. FINDINGS The MSU may result in an overall shift toward earlier evaluation and treatment with tPA, particularly into the first hour after symptom onset, leading to substantially better outcomes. As a result of improved clinical outcomes owing to earlier treatment, the costs of an MSU program may be offset by a reduction in the costs of long-term stroke care and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years, thereby supporting more widespread use of this technology. To make MSU deployment more practical, the vascular neurologist aboard the MSU must be replaced by a remote vascular neurologist connected to the MSU by telemedicine, reducing manpower requirements and costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The MSU strategy could dramatically transform the way acute stroke is managed in the United States. A prospective study evaluating the logistics, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of this approach is needed and under way.","Rajan, Suja S; Baraniuk, Sarah; Parker, Stephanie; Wu, Tzu-Ching; Bowry, Ritvij; Grotta, James C",JAMA neurology,248,24

Bonded structures with artificial debonding defects in three different case studies have been investigated: debonding with release film inclusion, debonding with brass film-large, debonding with brass film-small. After completing preprocessing of the data for data fusion, the feature matrices, depending on the interface reflection peak-to-peak amplitude and the principal component analysis, have been extracted from ultrasonic and thermography inspection results, respectively. The obtained feature matrices have been used as the source in basic (average, difference, weighted average, Hadamard product) and statistical (Dempster-Shafer rule of combination) data fusion algorithms. The defect detection performances of advanced nondestructive testing techniques, in addition to data fusion algorithms have been evaluated quantitatively by receiver operating characteristics.

BACKGROUND Fully bioresorbable scaffolds are a novel approach to treatment for coronary narrowing that provides transient vessel support with drug delivery capability without the long-term limitations of metallic drug-eluting stents. However, a potential drawback of the bioresorbable scaffold is the potential for disruption of the strut network when overexpanded. Conversely, the structural discontinuity of the polymeric struts at a late stage is a biologically programmed fate of the scaffold during the course of bioresorption. METHODS The ABSORB cohort B trial is a multicenter single-arm trial assessing the safety and performance of the Absorb BVS in the treatment of 101 patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions. The current analysis included 51 patients with 143 OCT pullbacks who underwent OCT at baseline and follow-up. The presence of acute disruption or late discontinuities was diagnosed by the presence on OCT of stacked, overhung struts or isolated intraluminal struts disconnected from the expected circularity of the device. RESULTS Of 51 patients with OCT imaging post-procedure, acute scaffold disruption was observed in 2 patients (3.9%), which could be related to overexpansion of the scaffold at the time of implantation. One patient had a target lesion revascularization that was presumably related to the disruption. Of 49 patients without acute disruption, late discontinuities were observed in 21 patients. There were no major adverse cardiac events associated with this finding except for 1 patient who had a non-ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization. CONCLUSIONS Acute scaffold disruption is a rare iatrogenic phenomenon that has been anecdotally associated with anginal symptoms, whereas late strut discontinuity is observed in approximately 40% of patients and could be viewed as a serendipitous OCT finding of a normal bioresorption process without clinical implications.

However, it is widely acknowledged that the effects of focal cortical stimulation can vary substantially between participants and even from trial to trial within individuals. Recent work from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has suggested that spontaneous fluctuations in alertness over a testing session can modulate the neural dynamics of cortical processing, even when participants remain awake and responsive to the task at hand. Here we investigated the extent to which spontaneous fluctuations in alertness during wake-to-sleep transition can account for the variability in neurophysiological responses to TMS. We combined single-pulse TMS with neural recording via electroencephalography (EEG) to quantify changes in motor and cortical reactivity with fluctuating levels of alertness defined objectively on the basis of ongoing brain activity. We observed rapid, non-linear changes in TMS-evoked responses with decreasing levels of alertness, even while participants remained responsive in the behavioural task. Specifically, we found that the amplitude of motor evoked potentials peaked during periods of EEG flattening, whereas TMS-evoked potentials increased and remained stable during EEG flattening and the subsequent occurrence of theta ripples that indicate the onset of NREM stage 1 sleep. Our findings suggest a rapid and complex reorganization of active neural networks in response to spontaneous fluctuations of alertness over relatively short periods of behavioural testing during wake-to-sleep transition.","Noreika, Valdas; Kamke, Marc R; Canales-Johnson, Andrés; Chennu, Srivas; Bekinschtein, Tristan A; Mattingley, Jason B",NeuroImage,248,1

METHODS All ward patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated. After determining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study population was identified. The urine dipstick test and urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) measurements were performed. Patients with de novo NS findings, nasopharyngeal swab, and urine RT-PCR tests were performed simultaneously. RESULTS This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 21 patients with COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 42.2±8.8 years, and 71.4% of them were male. The mean duration of follow-up was 28.4±9.3 days. The urine RT-PCR test was positive in one patient (4.8%). Improvements were observed in hematuria by 71.4%, and proteinuria by 85.7% at the end of the follow-up. A significant decrease in the measured UPCR was found in comparison to the baseline(P=0.000). Also, improvements were recorded in the complete blood counts, inflammatory parameters, ferritin, and coagulation tests, compared to the baseline. There was a positive correlation between baseline UPCR and ferritin, and a negative correlation between baseline UPCR and sodium values. CONCLUSION COVID-19-induced de novo nephritic syndrome may occur mainly due to tubulointerstitial involvement and often results in spontaneous remission. However, why these findings were not present in all patients who had no comorbidities is not clear.","Dheir, Hamad; Sipahi, Savas; Yaylaci, Selcuk; Genc, Ahmed Cihad; Genc, Fevziye Turkoglu; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Guçlu, Ertugrul; Muratdagi, Gurkan; Toptan, Hande; Karabay, Oguz",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,248,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the modifying role of water intake in menstrual distress and severity of pain among young female adolescents. METHOD A semi-experimental study was conducted on a sample of undergraduate female students aged 18-30 years in Isfahan, Iran from 2016 to 2019. Volunteers who had history of suffering from primary dysmenorrhea and drank less than 1600 ml water per day were assigned into water intake (n = 70) and control (n = 70) groups. Participants could select the group in which they desired to be considered. The water intake group was asked to drink water regularly based on a protocol for two menstrual periods while the control group did not receive any form of intervention. Demographic information and menstrual characteristics and severity of menstrual pain (based on a visual analogue scale), were obtained using a short questionnaire. The data were compared between and within two groups before and after intervention using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, and the Friedman's analysis of variance. RESULTS The mean age (SD) of participants was 22.0 (2.7) years and 77 students reported normal duration of menstrual bleeding. The number of students who had normal duration of menstrual bleeding (4-6 days) in water intake group increased after intervention (39 vs. 49 after first and 46 after second cycles of menstruation). However, the interval of menstrual cycle did not change significantly in either groups. Considerable decrease in using pain killer was observed in water intake group (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between control and water intake groups before intervention in pain intensity (pain mean score 7.64 vs. 7.06), but within group comparison showed that pain intensity was significantly decreased among water intake group (p < 0.0001) while for control group only a significant decrease was observed for the first day of menstrual bleeding. CONCLUSION The findings suggest that water intake might have modifying role in reducing menstrual bleeding duration, pain killer utilization, and pain intensity during menstrual period.

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol. We therefore hypothesize that microtubules may direct the particle to a cellular location that is beneficial for establishing infection or aids in nucleocapsid uncoating.","Hoornweg, Tabitha E; Bouma, Ellen M; van de Pol, Denise P I; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A; Smit, Jolanda M",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,248,1

While most studies measure fatigue using subjective self-report, fewer have measured CF objectively. Given the negative impact of CF on quality-of-life, there is a need for targeted interventions. The objective of this review was to determine which procedural, behavioural and pharmacological treatments for objectively measured CF are available to people living with neurological conditions. METHODS In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches for randomized control trials (RCTs), case-controlled studies and case reports/series were conducted across the Ovid Medline, PsycInfo, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. English-language articles published between 1980 and February 2019 were considered for eligibility. Included were those that objectively measured CF in individuals with neurological disease/disorder/dysfunction between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Studies were reviewed using a modified Cochrane Data Extraction Template. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The review process was facilitated using Covidence software ( www.covidence.org ). Two authors reviewed articles independently, with a third resolving conflicts regarding article inclusion. RESULTS The search identified 450 records. After duplicates were removed and remaining titles/abstracts were screened for eligibility, 28 full-text articles were assessed, and two studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies were a priori divided into those with pharmacological, procedural or behavioural interventions. Two studies met eligibility criteria; both of these included participants with multiple sclerosis. One study utilized a procedural intervention (i.e. transcranial direct current stimulation), while the other utilized a pharmacological intervention (i.e. fampridine-SR). Studies were evaluated for risk of bias, and evidence from both eligible studies was discussed. CONCLUSION Despite the positive results of the procedural intervention, the paucity of eligible studies and the nascent nature of the field suggests that more studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the amenability of CF to treatment.

This study mainly aimed to (1) investigate behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination under various specific scenarios, and (2) associated factors of the afore-mentioned vaccination intentions. METHODS A random anonymous telephone survey interviewed 450 Chinese adults from September 16-30, 2020 in Hong Kong, China. Nine scenarios of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccinations were measured combining effectiveness (80% versus 50%), safety (rare versus common mild side effect), and cost (free versus HK$ 500). RESULTS The prevalence of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination under the 9 specific scenarios was very low and varied greatly (4.2% to 38.0%). The prospective countries of manufacture also influenced vaccination intention (eg, Japan: 55.8% vs China: 31.1%). Only 13.1% intended to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest upon its availability. The attributes of effectiveness and side effect influenced vaccination intention most. Positively associated factors of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination included trust/satisfaction toward the government, exposure to positive social media information about COVID-19 vaccines, descriptive norms, perceived impact on the pandemic, perceived duration of protectiveness, and life satisfaction. CONCLUSION Intention of COVID-19 vaccination was low in the Hong Kong general population, especially among younger people, females, and single people. Health promotion is warranted to enhance the intention. The significant factors identified in this study may be considered when designing such health promotion. Future research is required to confirm the findings in other countries. Such studies should pay attention to the specific context of cost, safety, and effectiveness, which would lead to different responses in the level of behavioral intention of COVID-19 vaccination (BICV).","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph T F; Lau, Mason M C; Wong, Martin C S; Chan, Paul K S",International journal of health policy and management,248,20

Therefore, early diagnosis of nCoV may be of importance for reducing the spread of disease in public. Methods for nCoV diagnosis involve smear dyeing inspection, culture identification, and real-time PCR detection, all of which are proved highly effective.

This presents a significant pain point for both the sufferers, and for healthcare systems, particularly in a post COVID-19 pandemic world. As such, it presents an opportunity for new technologies that can enable screening in both developing and developed countries. In this work, the performance of a non-contact OSA screener App that can run on both Apple and Android smartphones is presented. Methods The subtle breathing patterns of a person in bed can be measured via a smartphone using the ""Firefly"" app technology platform [and underpinning software development kit (SDK)], which utilizes advanced digital signal processing (DSP) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify detailed sleep stages, respiration rate, snoring, and OSA patterns. The smartphone is simply placed adjacent to the subject, such as on a bedside table, night stand or shelf, during the sleep session. The system was trained on a set of 128 overnights recorded at a sleep laboratory, where volunteers underwent simultaneous full polysomnography (PSG), and ""Firefly"" smartphone app analysis. A separate independent test set of 120 recordings was collected across a range of Apple iOS and Android smartphones, and withheld for performance evaluation by a different team. An operating point tuned for mid-sensitivity (i.e., balancing sensitivity and specificity) was chosen for the screener. Results The performance on the test set is comparable to ambulatory OSA screeners, and other smartphone screening apps, with a sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 80.0% [with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92], for a clinical threshold for the AHI of ≥15 events/hour of detected sleep time. Conclusions The ""Firefly"" app based sensing technology offers the potential to significantly lower the barrier of entry to OSA screening, as no hardware (other than the user's personal smartphone) is required. Additionally, multi-night analysis is possible in the home environment, without requiring the wearing of a portable PSG or other home sleep test (HST).","Tiron, Roxana; Lyon, Graeme; Kilroy, Hannah; Osman, Ahmed; Kelly, Nicola; O'Mahony, Niall; Lopes, Cesar; Coffey, Sam; McMahon, Stephen; Wren, Michael; Conway, Kieran; Fox, Niall; Costello, John; Shouldice, Redmond; Lederer, Katharina; Fietze, Ingo; Penzel, Thomas",Journal of thoracic disease,248,1

METHODS This is a retrospective case-control study. A single surgeon performed 43 SPA-LAVH (cases) between May 2008 and February 2009, and 43 conventional LAVH between September 2005 and April 2008 (controls). Data of the SPA-LAVH cases were collected prospectively into our data registry and we reviewed the data of controls on chart. RESULTS The demographic parameters, except a history of vaginal delivery, were comparable between the two groups. The SPA group was associated with a history of fewer vaginal deliveries (SPA, 63%; conventional, 84%; p = 0.03). The two groups were comparable with respect to indications for surgery, failed cases from planned procedures, cases requiring additional procedures, and cases needing transfusion. The operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), drop in hemoglobin preoperatively to postoperative day 1, and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between both groups. SPA-LAVH was associated with reduced postoperative pain. The VAS-based pain scores 24 h (SPA, 2.5 ± 0.7; conventional, 3.5 ± 0.8; p < 0.01) and 36 h after surgery (SPA, 1.7 ± 1.2; conventional, 2.9 ± 1.1; p < 0.01) were lower in the SPA group. There were no complications, including reoperation, adjacent organ damage, and any postoperative morbidity, in both groups. In addition, we have encountered no umbilical complications to date using SPA. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that SPA-LAVH has comparable operative outcomes to conventional LAVH and the postoperative pain was decreased significantly in the SPA group 24 and 36 h after surgery.","Kim, Tae-Joong; Lee, Yoo-Young; Cha, Hyun Hwa; Kim, Chul-Jung; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Bae, Duk-Soo; Lee, Je-Ho; Kim, Byoung-Gie",Surgical endoscopy,248,16

Methods We prospectively enrolled previously healthy term infants less than 1 year old hospitalized for bronchiolitis in an Italian university hospital over 12 epidemic seasons. In 312 nasopharyngeal washings positive for RSV, we sequenced the viral genotype and analyzed this according to patient data. Strain-specific RSV loads were quantified for 273 specimens. Results From 2005-2006 to 2011-2012, the RSV-A genotype NA1 predominated, and was replaced in 2012 by the novel ON1. All infants infected with RSV subtype B were genotype BA. Stratifying data according to genotypes NA1, ON1, and BA showed that NA1-infected infants were the youngest and had the most severe clinical course. Conversely, BA-infected infants had less severe symptoms and more frequently had eosinophilia and a family history of asthma. Infants with the ON1 genotype had a milder clinical course than those with NA1 and more risk factors for asthma, despite having the highest viral loads. Conclusion The disease course in infants hospitalized for acute RSV bronchiolitis may depend on the RSV genotype.","Midulla, Fabio; Nenna, Raffaella; Scagnolari, Carolina; Petrarca, Laura; Frassanito, Antonella; Viscido, Agnese; Arima, Serena; Antonelli, Guido; Pierangeli, Alessandra",The Journal of infectious diseases,248,29

In the avian species, genetic modification of the zygote is difficult because its unique reproductive system limits the accessibility of the zygote at the 1-cell stage. To date, only a few CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts have been reported using the chicken as a model among avian species, which requires 3 major processes: isolation and culture of primordial germ cells (PGCs), modification of the genome of PGCs in vitro, and injection of the PGCs into the extraembryonic blood vessel at the early embryonic stages when endogenous PGCs migrate through circulation to the genital ridge. In the present study, the adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 vector was directly injected into the quail blastoderm in newly laid eggs. The resulting chimeras generated offspring with targeted mutations in the melanophilin (MLPH) gene, which is involved in melanosome transportation and feather pigmentation. MLPH homozygous mutant quail exhibited gray plumage, whereas MLPH heterozygous mutants and wild-type quail exhibited dark brown plumage. In addition, the adenoviral vector was not integrated into the genome of knockout quail, and no mutations were detected in potential off-target regions. This method of generating genome-edited poultry is expected to accelerate avian research and has potential applications for developing superior genetic lines for poultry production in the industry.","Lee, Joonbum; Ma, Jisi; Lee, Kichoon",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,248,27

Caused by SARS-Cov-2, COVID-19 is characterized by high transmission rate that correlates with high viral load. The full clinical spectrum of the illness, the prevalence rates of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and the case fatality rates are still poorly understood, highlighting the importance of early preventive measures. Unfortunately, appropriate vaccination against SARS-Cov-2 is not yet available. Unless a target vaccine is developed, COVID-19 impacts will be devastating. ""Trained immunity"" (TI), which could be induced by live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), is a potential public health preventive approach to boost the host immune system. Trained innate immune cells demonstrated phenotypical and functional changes leading them to acquire immunological memory and amplify their responses against subsequent infections. This phenomenon could have important public health preventive implications by harnessing the early immune responses against COVID-19, restricting its progression, and suppressing its infectivity. Some LAVs have induced a broad, nonspecific, protection against unrelated pathogens and decreased mortality from conditions other than the targeted infectious diseases. This review summarizes the relevant literature and 1) emphasizes the role of available LAVs as potential stimulants for TI and 2) proposes this phenomenon as a potential preventive approach against COVID-19 that needs thoughtful consideration and further investigation. Clinical trials in this field are then urgently needed in line of vaccine and treatment unavailability. This is specifically true when considering two evolving scenarios; the virus spread may not diminish with warm weather, and that it will erupt a second-hit severe outbreak next winter.","Alsulaiman, Jomana W; Khasawneh, Ashraf I; Kheirallah, Khalid A",Journal of infection in developing countries,248,17

Indirect evidence from related conditions must therefore inform inferences regarding benefits and harms. To support a guideline for managing COVID-19, we conducted systematic reviews examining the impact of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and related severe acute respiratory illnesses. METHODS We searched standard international and Chinese biomedical literature databases and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). For acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we updated the most recent rigorous systematic review. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool relative risks and then used baseline risk in patients with COVID-19 to generate absolute effects. RESULTS In ARDS, according to 1 small cohort study in patients with COVID-19 and 7 RCTs in non-COVID-19 populations (risk ratio [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.93, mean difference 17.3% fewer; low-quality evidence), corticosteroids may reduce mortality. In patients with severe COVID-19 but without ARDS, direct evidence from 2 observational studies provided very low-quality evidence of an increase in mortality with corticosteroids (hazard ratio [HR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.29, mean difference 11.9% more), as did observational data from influenza studies. Observational data from SARS and MERS studies provided very low-quality evidence of a small or no reduction in mortality. Randomized controlled trials in CAP suggest that corticosteroids may reduce mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.98, 3.1% lower; very low-quality evidence), and may increase hyperglycemia. INTERPRETATION Corticosteroids may reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.

Therefore, there is a significant interest to vectorize novel adenoviral types that have low seroprevalence in the human population. Here, we describe the discovery and vectorization of a chimeric human adenovirus, which we call HAdV-20-42-42. Full genome sequencing revealed that this virus is closely related to human serotype 42, except for the penton-base which is derived from serotype 20. The HAdV-20-42-42 vector could be propagated stably to high titers on existing E1-complementing packaging cell lines. Receptor binding studies revealed that the vector utilized both CAR and CD46 as receptors for cell entry. Furthermore, the HAdV-20-42-42 vector was potent in transducing human and murine cardiovascular cells and tissues, irrespective of the presence of blood coagulation factor X. In addition, the vector did not sequester in the liver upon intravenous administration in rodents. Finally, we demonstrate that potent T-cell responses against vector-delivered antigens could be induced upon vaccination. In summary, from the data obtained we conclude that HAdV-20-42-42 provides a valuable addition to the portfolio of adenoviral vectors available to develop safe and efficacious products in the fields of gene therapy and vaccination. IMPORTANCE Adenoviral vectors are currently under investigation for a broad range of therapeutic indications in diverse fields, such as oncology and gene therapy, as well as for vaccination both for human and veterinary use. A wealth of data shows that pre-existing immune responses may limit the use of a vector. Particularly in the current climate of global pandemic, there is a need to expand the toolbox with novel adenoviral vectors for vaccine development. Our data demonstrates that we have successfully vectorized a novel adenovirus serotype with low seroprevalence. The cell transduction data and antigen-specific immune responses induced in vivo demonstrate that this vector is highly promising for the development of gene therapy and vaccine products.","Ballmann, Mónika Z.; Raus, Svjetlana; Engelhart, Ruben; Kaján, Győző L.; van der Zalm, Chantal; Papp, Tibor; John, Lijo; Khan, Selina; Custers, Jerome; Bakker, Wilfried A.M.; van der Schaar, Hilde M.; Arnberg, Niklas; Lemckert, Angelique A.C.; Havenga, Menzo; Baker, Andrew H.",bioRxiv,248,1

Data collection occurred between 18 June and 15 July 2020. Data from 679 respondents (57.9% females and 42.1% males;67.7% Kuwaiti nationals and 32.3% non-Kuwaiti nationals) were analyzed. Symptoms of depression were reported among 59.8% of females and 51.0% of males, and extremely severe depression among 20.4% of females and 13.6% of males. Approximately 42.0% of females and 37.8% of males were under psychological distress, with 15.1% of females and 9.1% of males experiencing severe or extremely severe psychological distress. Over a third of females (34.9%) reported experiencing tensions or violent behaviors from family members, and 22.1% reported verbal or physical abuse. Among males, 26.4% reported experiencing tensions or violent behaviors, and 12.2% reported verbal or physical abuse. Extremely severe depression was associated with being female (2.00 times), aged 21–29 (4.56 times), experiencing tensions or violent behaviors from family members (4.56 times), being physically inactive (1.64 times), smoking cigarettes (3.02 times), and having poor or very poor quality of sleep (1.75 times). Severe or extremely severe psychological distress was associated with being female (3.09 times), aged 21–49 (3.68 times), having ill-health conditions or diseases (1.83 times), experiencing tension or violent behaviors from family members (3.56 times), smoking cigarettes (3.06 times), and having poor or very poor quality of sleep (2.20 times).

In order to connect with clients, most independent sex workers use adult service websites (ASWs), whose services range from simple advertising websites to platforms with both direct and indirect governance of workers. Although ASWs do not employ sex workers, their response to the pandemic has a large impact on sex workers’ financial and physical wellbeing. This effect is even stronger among migrant workers, who are less likely to qualify for, or be aware they qualify for, government support. This study reviews the response to COVID-19 of 45 of the leading ASWs in Britain, and triangulates the data with seven sex worker-led organisations. It shows a large variation in the responses of ASWs: the majority had no public response to the pandemic at all, a minority took intentional steps to support workers or donated to hardship funds for sex workers, and at least one ASW reduced their safety features during the pandemic. These findings illustrate that while most ASWs do not acknowledge the influence they have over the working practices of their service users and the shift of economic risk to them, some recognised the potential that their platforms have to support sex workers during crises.","Brouwers, Lilith Herrmann Tess",Social Sciences,248,26

Though there has been advent of improvements in medical sciences and novel technological innovations therein, yet the reach of the same to the masses is questionable. Statistics indicate that there has been an increase in the people falling at a higher age bracket, all throughout the world. In India, the rural population embracing almost 6,40,000 villages have an unfortunate tale to narrate with more than 11% having no admittance to any sort of healthcare facilities. With the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent need for far reaching screening to contain the same, there are new challenges of outreach constraints in densely populated countries like India. What further poses grave concern is the rural urban divide in the availability of healthcare amenities. All this calls for a progressive transformation and integration of medical sciences with information technology. The divide can be lessened with the aid of telehealth monitoring systems using IOT. In countries like India, where there is little access to doctors and medical infrastructure, such system would be an apt solution for interaction between the patients and the medical practitioners. Most of the villages in India are deprived of even rudimentary Public Health Centers, thus making it difficult for the resident villagers to receive even preliminary treatment. The telehealth monitoring system comes to rescue in such apathetic situations where it facilitates monitoring and measuring the physical vitals like pulse, levels of oxygen in the blood, rate of breath, glucose levels, temperature, lung capacity, ECG, and so on. The information so collected is stored in the cloud database which is then evaluated by the doctors and would eventually lead to generating prescriptions for the same and any other intervention as may be needed including emergency and EMRI services.

We combined high-throughput laboratory automation with machine learning to build a multi-phenotype aging profile that models the dysfunctional immune response to viral infection in older adults. From a single well, our multi-phenotype aging profile can capture changes in cell composition, physical cell-to-cell interaction, organelle structure, cytokines, and other hidden complexities contributing to age-related dysfunction. This system allows for rapid identification of new potential compounds to rejuvenate older adults’ immune response. We used our technology to screen thousands of compounds for their ability to make old immune cells respond to viral infection like young immune cells. We observed beneficial effects of multiple compounds, of which two of the most promising were disulfiram and triptonide. Our findings indicate that disulfiram could be considered as a treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 and other inflammatory infections.","White, Brandon; Komalo, Ben; Nicolaisen, Lauren; Donne, Matt; Marsh, Charlie; DeVay, Rachel M.; Nguyen, An M.; Cousin, Wendy; Heinrich, Jarred; Van Trump, William J.; Plott, Tempest; Fuller, Colin J.; Nguyen, Dat; Chen, Daniel; Bucher, Delia; Tyrra, Sabine; Haynes, Laura; Kuchel, George; Goronzy, Jorg; Larbi, Anis; Fulop, Tamas; Heiser, Diane; Schwandner, Ralf; Elabd, Christian; Kamens, Ben",bioRxiv,248,28

In this research, we firstly present an overview of the main forecasting models to predict the new cases of COVID-19. In this context, we focus on univariate time series models to analyze the dynamic change of this pandemic through time. We also introduce multivariate time series forecasting using weather and daily tests data, to study the impact of exogenous features on the progression of COVID-19. Finally, we present an ensemble learning model based on LSTM and GRU and evaluate the results using the MAE, RMSE and MAPE. The results show that the ensemble approach performs well in comparison to other models. In addition, this research provides an outcome regarding the dynamic correlation between temperature, humidity and daily test data and its impact on the new reported cases of contamination. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Khennou, F.; Akhloufi, M.

Current tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction can be low-throughput and labor intensive. An ultra-fast and accurate mode of detecting COVID-19 infection is crucial for healthcare workers to make informed decisions in fast-paced clinical settings. The high-dimensional, feature-rich components of Raman spectra and validated predictive power for identifying human disease, cancer, as well as bacterial and viral infections pose the potential to train a supervised classification machine learning algorithm on Raman spectra of patient serum samples to detect COVID-19 infection. We developed a novel stacked subsemble classifier model coupled with an iteratively validated and automated feature selection and engineering workflow to predict COVID-19 infection status from Raman spectra of 250 human serum samples, with a 10-fold cross-validated classification accuracy of 98.0% (98.6% precision and 98.5% recall). Furthermore, we benchmarked nine machine learning and artificial neural network models when evaluated using eight standalone performance metrics to assess whether ensemble methods offered any improvement from baseline machine learning models. Using a rank-normalized scores derived from the performance metrics, the stacked subsemble model ranked higher than the Multi-layer Perceptron, which in turn ranked higher than the eight other machine learning models. This study serves as a proof of concept that stacked ensemble machine learning models are a powerful predictive tool for COVID-19 diagnostics.

The study explores how an emerging markets firm has contributed to global supply chain mobility and vaccine distribution in the pandemic – keeping cargo moving – drawing on vision, values and vigilance, including attention to the innovation momentum of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: The article concentrates on an exemplar firm, leader and management team to illustrate challenges of helmsmanship during the pandemic for an emerging markets firm, Agility, that operates worldwide in numerous developed and developing economy markets. The article develops a case study analyzing how Agility has met the simultaneous challenges for innovation and transformation in the digital revolution and navigation through the crisis times of the global pandemic. The analysis derives from direct management communications, corporate documents and media sources. Findings: The vision, values and vigilance of the leadership, with emphasis on digital innovations and disruptions, digital supply chains, humanitarian partnerships, focusing both globally and on emerging markets, and nurturing smaller as well as larger businesses, have enabled the firm to thrive. Given the importance of global supply chains during COVID-19, Agility is a pivotal example of partnering with governments and pharmaceutical companies worldwide in delivering the new array of vaccines, as well as personal protective equipment and other medical supplies, in the battle against the pandemic. Agility in addition illustrates the strategic value of partnering with other logistics firms in humanitarian collaborations as well as in business strategy transactions. Research limitations/implications: The article contributes to the emergent research stream on leadership, innovation and internationalization in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council and Middle East North Africa (GCC/MENA) region and more generally on the strengths and proficiencies of emerging market firms and leaders. Future research could examine additional firms, industries or regions of the world during the pandemic or other crisis contexts. Further data sources and analyses can be used in validating and extending the findings. Practical implications: Digital supply chains, humanitarian partnerships and an emphasis on digital communications, storage and transportation innovations can benefit firms from all regions of the world during the global pandemic and other crises, as well as in normal operations. Social implications: Emerging markets represent the majority of global population and economic growth, as well as of pandemic cases and mortality risk, signifying the importance of leadership, collaboration and innovation around issues such as vaccine delivery into emerging markets regions of the world. Originality/value: The article takes a revelatory case perspective in the pandemic crisis context from a unique foundation of immersive field research and data access in the GCC/MENA) region. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Park, K.

To that end, we sought to determine the racial impact on PCa surgery during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: After receiving institutional review board approval, the Pennsylvania Urologic Regional Collaborative (PURC) database was queried to evaluate practice patterns for Black and White patients with untreated non-metastatic PCa during the initial lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) compared to prior (March-May 2019). PURC is a prospective collaborative, which includes private practice and academic institutions within both urban and rural settings including regional safety-net hospitals. As data entry was likely impacted by the pandemic, we limited our search to only practices that had data entered through June 1, 2020 (5 practice sites). We compared patient and disease characteristics by race using Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square to compare categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum to evaluate continuous covariates. Patients were stratified by risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection as described by the CDC. We determined the covariate-adjusted impact of year and race on surgery, using logistic regression models with a race∗year interaction term. Results: 647 men with untreated nonmetastatic PCa were identified, 269 during the pandemic and 378 from the year prior. During the pandemic, Black men were significantly less likely to undergo prostatectomy compared to White patients (1.3% v 25.9%;p < 0.001), despite similar COVID-19 risk-factors, biopsy Gleason grade group, and comparable surgery rates prior (17.7% vs. 19.1%;p = 0.75). White men had lower pre-biopsy PSA (7.2 vs. 8.8 vs. p = 0.04) and were older (24.4% vs. 38.2% < 60yr;p = 0.09). The regression model demonstrated an 94% decline in odds of surgery(OR = 0.06 95%CI 0.007-0.43;p = 0.006) for Black patients and increase odds of surgery for White patients (OR = 1.41 95%CI 0.89-2.21;p = 0.142), after adjusting for covariates. Changes in surgical volume varied by site (33% increase to complete shutdown), with sites that experienced the largest reduction in cancer surgery, caring for a greater proportion of Black patients. Conclusions: In a large multi-institutional regional collaborative, odds of PCa surgery declined only among Black patients during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. While localized prostate cancer does not require immediate treatment, the lessons from this study illuminate systemic inequities within healthcare, likely applicable across oncology. Public health efforts are needed to fully recognize the unintended consequence of diversion of cancer resources to the pandemic in order to develop balanced mitigation strategies as viral rates continue to fluctuate.","Bernstein, A.; Talwar, R.; Handorf, E.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated smartphone camera-based techniques for measuring heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) for consumer wellness use. HR was measured by placing the finger over the rear-facing camera, while RR was measured via a video of the participants sitting still in front of the front-facing camera. In the HR study of 95 participants (with a protocol that included both measurements at rest and post exercise), the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) {+/-} standard deviation of the measurement was 1.6% {+/-} 4.3%, which was significantly lower than the pre-specified goal of 5%. No significant differences in the MAPE were present across colorimeter-measured skin-tone subgroups: 1.8% {+/-} 4.5% for very light to intermediate, 1.3% {+/-} 3.3% for tan and brown, and 1.8% {+/-} 4.9% for dark. In the RR study of 50 participants, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.78 {+/-} 0.61 breaths/min, which was significantly lower than the pre-specified goal of 3 breath/min. The MAE was low in both healthy participants (0.70 {+/-} 0.67 breaths/min), and participants with chronic respiratory conditions (0.80 {+/-} 0.60 breaths/min).

In this paper, we examine the factors contributing to the cross-cultural variation in vaccine attitudes, measured by levels of 1) general vaccine hesitancy, 2) trust in vaccines, and 3) COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Methods: We examined the relative effect of conspiracy mentality, belief in COVID-19 conspiracies, and belief in science on the above-mentioned vaccine attitudes in the UK (n= 1533), US (n= 1550), and Turkey (n= 1567) through a quota-sampled online survey to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, and education level. Results: We found that belief in COVID-19 conspiracies and conspiracy mentality were the strongest predictors of general vaccine hesitancy across all three countries. Belief in science had the largest positive effect on general vaccine trust and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Although participants in Turkey demonstrated the lowest level of vaccine trust, their belief in science score was significantly higher than participants in the US, suggesting that belief in science cannot explain the cross-cultural variation in vaccine trust. The mean levels of conspiracy mentality and agreement with COVID-19 conspiracies were consistent with the country-level differences in general and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Demographic variables did not predict vaccine attitudes as much as belief in conspiracies and science. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cross-cultural variation in vaccine hesitancy, vaccine trust, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates are mainly driven by differences in the prevalence of conspiratorial thinking across countries.","Salali, G.

To this end, the proposed research work presents the Video Social Distancing issue, characterized as the programmed assessment of the between close to home good ways from a picture, and the portrayal of related individuals' conglomerations.

We sought to determine the direct, indirect, and total effects of influenza vaccine in the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) cohort. Methods: Using longitudinal data from the HIVE cohort from 2010-11 through 2017-18, we estimated direct, indirect, and total influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and the incidence rate ratio of influenza virus infection using adjusted mixed-effect Poisson regression models. Total effectiveness was determined through comparison of vaccinated members of full or partially vaccinated households to unvaccinated individuals in completely unvaccinated households. Results: The pooled, direct VE against any influenza was 30.2% (14.0-43.4). Direct VE was higher for influenza A/H1N1 43.9% (3.9 to 63.5) and B 46.7% (17.2 to 57.5) than A/H3N2 31.7% (10.5 to 47.8); and was higher for young children 42.4% (10.1 to 63.0) than adults 18.6% (-6.3 to 37.7). Influenza incidence was highest in completely unvaccinated households (10.6 per 100 person-seasons) and lower at all other levels of household vaccine coverage. We found little evidence of indirect VE after adjusting for potential confounders. Total VET was 56.4% (30.1-72.9) in low coverage, 43.2% (19.5-59.9) in moderate coverage, and 33.0% (12.1 to 49.0) in fully vaccinated households. Conclusion: Influenza vaccines may have a benefit above and beyond the direct effect but that effect in this study was small. While there may be exceptions, the goal of global vaccine recommendations should remain focused on provision of documented, direct protection to those vaccinated.","Malosh, R. E.; Petrie, J.

171683,171683,171683,Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the course of covid-19 disease: A case report and review of the literature,16.30878,10.036769,2021,"Introduction: The standard approach for relapsed or refractory (RR) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) following front-line treatment failure is second line therapy (SLT) aimed to achieve complete response (CR), followed by consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HDT/AHCT). No one standard SLT exists and options include regimens containing platinum, gemcitabine, and more recently brentuximab vedotin (BV). Complete response rates associated with these regimens range from 50-70%. Due to the increasing use of BV in the front-line setting, development of SLT regimens that are both highly effective and BV-sparing are needed. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are highly active in RR cHL and have the potential to enhance the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Here we report the results of our phase II study evaluating a novel anti-PD-1-based regimen, pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and liposomal doxorubicin (pembrolizumab-GVD), as SLT for RR cHL. Methods: Transplant eligible patients (pts) with RR cHL following failure of 1-line of therapy were eligible. Treatment consisted of 2 to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab (200mg IV, day 1), gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8), vinorelbine (20mg/m2 IV, days 1 and 8) and liposomal doxorubicin (15mg/m2, days 1 and 8), given on 21-day cycles. Pts who achieved CR by PET (Deauville ≤3) after 2 or 4 cycles proceeded to HDT/AHCT. HDT/AHCT was carried out according to institutional standards and BV maintenance was allowed following HDT/AHCT. The primary endpoint was CR rate after 2 or 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD. Enrollment occurred according to a Simon 2-stage design with sample size based upon a projected CR rate of 70%. In stage 1, 23 pts enrolled and 12 or more CRs were required to proceed to stage II;in stage II, an additional 16 pts enrolled. Out of a total of 39 pts, 24 CRs were required to declare this regimen promising. Results: Among 39 patients enrolled, 37 are evaluable for toxicity (2 pts have not yet started treatment) and 34 are evaluable for response (4 pts too early, 1 pt found to have composite lymphoma after enrollment). Of 37 treated pts, median age is 36 (range 21-71), 43% are male, 23 (62%) had advanced stage disease, and 15 (41%) had primary refractory disease. With regard to RR cHL risk factors (B-symptoms, extranodal disease, and relapse/refractory disease within 1 year of initial treatment), 4(11%) had no risk factors (RFs), 21 (57%) had 1 RF, 9 (24%) had 2 RFs, and 3 (8%) had all 3 RFs. Treatment was well tolerated with most adverse events being grade 1 or 2 (see figure 1). Grade 3 AEs included rash (n=1), elevated AST/ALT (n=3), oral mucositis (n=2), and neutropenia (n=3). Figure 2 shows the outcome for all 37 treated pts. Among 34 evaluable pts, 31 (91%) achieved CR after 2 cycles and 3 achieved partial response. An additional 1 pt achieved CR after 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD, therefore in total, 32 of 34 (94%) achieved CR following pembrolizumab-GVD. 4 pts with CR after 2 cycles received an additional 2 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD in order to delay HDT/AHCT during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (n=3) or due to refusing HDT/ASCT (n=1). To date, 32 have undergone HDT/AHCT following 2 (n=27) or 4 (n=5) cycles of treatment. 1 pt is awaiting HDT/AHCT;1 pt refused HDT/ASCT and received pembrolizumab maintenance instead. 2 pts received involved site radiation therapy to initial area of relapsed disease prior to planned HDT/AHCT and 10 pts received post-HDT/ASCT maintenance with BV. Median follow-up post-HDT/AHCT is 9 mos (range 0.03-20.9 mos) and all pts remain in remission to date. Conclusion: Second-line therapy with pembrolizumab-GVD is a highly effective and well-tolerated regimen that can efficiently bridge pts with RR cHL to HDT/AHCT. Updated results including all 39 enrolled pts will be presented at the meeting. Given the high CR rate observed with pembrolizumab-GVD, an expansion cohort evaluating 8 cycles of pembrolizumab maintenance (instead of HDT/AHCT) for patients who achieve CR af er 4 cycles of pembrolizumab-GVD is planned.

For this purpose, in working together, language teachers' gender, year of birth, branch, seniority, the education level they teach, the province where they work, their education status, whether they have done any work on graphics, whether they have attended a course on graphic development, m-learning experience and distance were examined in terms of how often it included visual elements while creating their lessons in education and which tool was mostly used when teaching in mobile education. The sample of the study consists of 307 language teachers, selected by the snowball sampling method, working in schools in different provinces. The data of the study were obtained using the Information Form, Self Efficacy Scale for Graphic Development and Mobile Education Attitude Scale. Arithmetic mean, percentage, frequency, reliability analysis, normality test and Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient analyses were used in the analysis of the data obtained. The mobile education attitude level of language teachers is 'I am undecided' and the level of self-efficacy is 'I can do less'. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that there is a low-level, positively significant relationship between the self-efficacy of language teachers in developing graphical elements and their mobile learning attitudes during the pandemic period.","Oz, C.

The synthetic test aerosol particles had diameters similar to that of viral particles, in the nanometer size range of genetic fragments. Thus, the test aerosol provided a realistic representation of SARS-CoV-2 viral particle transmission. The study results, which are still being analyzed carefully at the present, suggest that in a door-closed single room setting, the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can facilitate aerosol transmission, and 10 measuring points in a single room report the normalized concentration ranged from 0.45 to 0.66. Additionally, at a measuring point 6 feet away from the source, the aerosol concentration can reach a plateau normalized concentration of about 0.6 within 30 minutes. When interior doors were closed, aerosol particle transmission into adjacent rooms occurred through the building HVAC system, at a lower rate compared to the open-door scenario. If the interior doors were open, however, then the transmission into adjacent rooms depends on building indoor air movement and distance from the source. The building HVAC system provided an approximately less than 10% aerosol transmission rate, while transmission through a door opening can add up to 40% of transmission into adjacent rooms from the source location.","Chien, C.-H.; Cheng, M.; Im, P.; Nawaz, K.; Fricke, B.; Armstrong, A.",,248,1

Yet, this approach is challenged by continuously emerging variants and by time limitations of vaccine preparation techniques. This work describes the design and evaluation of an anti-IBV vaccine comprised of E. coli expressing and secreting viral spike 1 subunit (S1) and nucleocapsid N-terminus and C-terminus polypeptides fused to heat-labile enterotoxin B (LTB) (LS1, LNN, LNC, respectively). Following chicken oral vaccination, anti-IBV IgY levels and cellular-mediated immunity as well as protection against virulent IBV challenge, were evaluated 14 days following the booster dose. Oral vaccination induced IgY levels that exceeded those measured following vaccination with each component separately. Following exposure to inactivated IBV, splenocytes isolated from chicks orally vaccinated with LNN or LNC -expressing bacteria, showed a higher percentage of CD8+ cells as compared to splenocytes isolated from chicks vaccinated with wild type or LTB-secreting E. coli and to chicks subcutaneously vaccinated. Significant reduction in viral load and percent of shedders in the vaccinated chicks was evident starting 3 days following challenge with 107.5 EID50/ml virulent IBV. Taken together, orally delivered LTB-fused IBV polypeptide-expressing bacteria induced virus-specific IgY antibody production and was associated with significantly shorter viral shedding on challenge with a live IBV. The proposed vaccine design and delivery route promise an effective and rapidly adaptable means of protecting poultry farms from devastating IB outbreaks. Highlights Mucosal vaccination was shown particularly beneficial against respiratory viruses. An anti-IBV vaccine composed of three IBV polypeptides fused to LTB was designed. Vaccine composed of bacteria secreting polypeptides was orally delivered.

The dominant interaction mode are hydrogen bonds but Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions are relevant as well. Statement of Significance Glycosylation of the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the ACE2 receptor leads to stronger and longer ranged binding interactions between the proteins. Particularly, at shorter distances the interactions are between residues of the proteins themselves whereas at larger distances these interactions are mediated by the glycans.","Huang, Yihan; Harris, Bradley S.; Minami, Shiaki A.; Jung, Seongwon; Shah, Priya S.; Nandi, Somen; McDonald, Karen A.; Faller, Roland",bioRxiv,248,1

Real world data have demonstrated the vaccines to be highly effective against COVID-19, severe disease and death. Here, we estimate vaccine effectiveness over time since the second dose of Comirnaty, Vaxzevria and Spikevax in England. Methods We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, hospitalisation and mortality by age, comorbidity status and over time after the second dose to investigate waning separately for Alpha and Delta variants. Results Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease peaked in the early weeks after the second dose and then fell to 47.3 (95% CI 45 to 49.6) and 69.7 (95% CI 68.7 to 70.5) by 20+ weeks against the Delta variant for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty, respectively. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was greater for 65+ year-olds compared to 40-64 year-olds. Vaccine effectiveness fell less against hospitalisations to 77.0 (70.3 to 82.3) and 92.7 (90.3 to 94.6) beyond 20 weeks post-vaccination and 78.7 (95% CI 52.7 to 90.4) and 90.4 (95% CI 85.1 to 93.8) against death for Vaxzevria and Comirnaty, respectively. Greater waning was observed among 65+ year-olds in a clinically extremely vulnerable group and 40-64-year olds with underlying medical conditions compared to healthy adults. Conclusions We observed limited waning in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death more than 20 weeks post-vaccination with Vaxzevria or Comirnaty. Waning was greater in older adults and those in a clinical risk group, suggesting that these individuals should be prioritised for booster doses.","Andrews, N.; Tessier, E.; Stowe, J.; Gower, C.; Kirsebom, F.; Simmons, R.; Gallagher, E.; Chand, M.; Brown, K.; Ladhani, S.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.",,248,13

We demonstrate that these anomalies arise because of the multi-community structure of the network. We identify the communities in the air transportation network and show that the community structure cannot be explained solely based on geographical constraints, and that geo-political considerations have to be taken into account.

The proposed taxonomy groups businesses into three clusters, labelled as vulnerable to business to people (B2P), vulnerable to business networking, and vulnerable to external factors. The differing vulnerability of businesses to the recent pandemic raises a fundamental question about how best to build resilience to reduce vulnerabilities. Built on the vulnerability characteristics identified in the taxonomy, this article suggests factors that contribute to the resilience of businesses in each cluster.

These models are usually equipped with tightly parametrized prior distributions which favor a small and gradual change in parameters. Do such prior distributions suppress some degree of time variation in the VAR coefficients? We address this question by proposing a flexible global-local prior, namely the horseshoe prior. It turns out that conventional priors may suppress economically relevant patterns of time variation. Using the global-local prior, we observe that parameter change and changes in systematic monetary policy can be abrupt rather than smooth. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of the horseshoe prior with a range of plausible alternatives. Finally, we find that a VAR with a stochastic volatility specification using the horseshoe prior is well suited to modelling the extreme observations due to Covid-19. In contrast the conventional prior (spuriously) picks up an increase of volatilities even before the Covid crisis.","Prüser, Jan",Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,248,1

First, the Kantian roots of emancipation understood as the capacity of rational beings to act according to self-chosen ends are explained. It is shown that this conception of emancipation sets the realm of autonomous beings humans over the realm of heteronomous beings. Accounts of the ?humanisation of nature? are analysed as incomplete attempts to overcome this dualism. It is argued that the root of this incompleteness lies in the application of analytical rather than dialectical reason to the human?nature interaction. The Anthropocene is presented as the geological?historical moment when at the same time as nature is being humanised, humans are being made aware of themselves as animal. This gives way to a conception of Anthropocene emancipation which will be described in a fourth section. The article concludes with reflections on COVID-19 as a ?disease of the Anthropocene? and as an opportunity reflexively, and at unprecedented scale, to internalise our heteronomy and to live an emancipation fit for a terraforming species.","Dobson, Andrew",European Journal of Social Theory,248,20

Objectives: We aimed to: (i) identify the best Transfer To Utility (TTU) algorithms and predictors for an adolescent specific Multi-Attribute Utility Instrument - the Assessment of Quality of Life - six dimensions (AQoL-6D) and (ii) assess ability of TTU algorithms to predict longitudinal change. Methods: We recruited 1107 young people attending Australian primary mental health services, collecting data at two time points, three months apart. Five linear and three generalised linear models were explored to identify the best TTU algorithm. Forest models were used to explore predictive ability of six candidate measures of psychological distress, depression and anxiety and linear / generalised linear mixed effect models were used to construct longitudinal predictive models for AQoL-6D change. Results: A depression measure (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was the strongest independent predictor of health utility. Linear regression models with complementary log-log transformation of utility score were the best preforming models. Between-person associations were slightly larger than within-person associations for most of the predictors. Conclusions: Adolescent AQoL-6D utility can be derived from a range of psychological distress, depression and anxiety measures.

Nspl serves as a host shutoff factor by blocking ribosome assembly on host mRNAs, thereby suppressing host gene expression. Recently, cryo-electron microscope structure of both 40S and 80S ribosome purified in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nspl revealed the presence of the C-terminal region of nspl in the mRNA binding site of the 40S ribosome. This structure gives the first insight into the molecular mechanism of nspl-mediated suppression of host protein translation. In this study we have utilized the most recent emerging partial structures of nspl bound to 40S ribosome as the reference point of implementing a Targeted Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the entire nspl bound to the 40S complex. Our final bound structure of nspl exhibits the previously reported helix-turn-helix conformation of the C-terminal region of nspl and satisfies all the previously reported proximity restraints. Finally, we have established the interaction and stability of this final bound state of the full nspl and 40S. The observation that C-terminal region of nspl folds into a helix-turn-helix structure to occupy the mRNA binding site in the 40S ribosome enables further inquiry into the understanding of the entire nspl structure bound to the 40S ribosome to reveal relative positioning of the two termini when nspl is bound to ribosome. © 2021 ACM.","Boateng, L.; Nag, A.; Valafar, H.","12th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, BCB 2021",248,1

A midcoronal section of the femoral head was divided into 3 pillars (medial, central, and lateral) on a T1-weighted image. According to the site of necrosis on the lateral pillar, the necrosis was divided into 3 types: I, the necrosis occupies the central and medial pillars, and the lateral pillar is preserved; II, the necrosis partially occupies the lateral pillar; and III, the necrosis totally occupies the lateral pillar. One group of 87 patients (127 hips) with Association for Research on Osseous Circulation (ARCO) stage I ONFH underwent nonoperative treatment and were followed for 3 to 8 years (average, 6.2 years). Another group of 42 patients (72 hips) with ARCO stage I ONFH underwent debridement and impacted bone graft and were followed for 5 to 9 years (average, 7.1 years). In both groups, the more preserved the lateral pillar, the less collapse occurred. The authors concluded that whether ONFH progressed to collapse is determined by preservation of the lateral pillar.

We described the epidemiological picture emerged from syndromic and virological surveillance during the post-pandemic season in Liguria, Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS An Emergency Department Syndrome surveillance system, based on data collected at ""San Martino"" and IRCCS ""G. Gaslini"" Liguria Regional Reference University Hospitals for adults and children is active since July 2007. Monitored syndromes include ""Influenza-Like Illness"" (ILl) and ""Low Respiratory Tract Infections"" (LRTI). The Ligurian Regional Reference laboratory for Influenza virological surveillance and diagnosis offers rapid detection of influenza viruses by real-time and block RT-PCR, viral culture and genetic characterization by entire sequence analysis of haemagglutinin- and neuraminidase-coding regions in accordance with the international standards established by the global laboratory network. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The integration of syndromic surveillance system and laboratory surveillance for rapid detection and characterization of the disease responsible agent represented a specific and sensitive tool for influenza surveillance. The post-pandemic season was characterized by early onset and by the heaviest impacts for ILI and LRTI among the recent epidemic seasons. In contrast to the picture observed during the pandemic season, the 2010/11 winter was characterized by the intensive circulation of pandemic AH1N1v coupled with sustained activity due to influenza B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Antigenic and molecular characterization of influenza strains confirmed the good matching between circulating and 2010/11 vaccine viruses.","De Florentiis, D; Parodi, V; Orsi, A; Rossi, A; Altomonte, F; Canepa, P; Ceravolo, A; Valle, L; Zancolli, M; Piccotti, E; Renna, S; Macrina, G; Martini, M; Durando, P; Padrone, D; Moscatelli, P; Orengo, G; Icardi, G; Ansaldi, F",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,248,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six databases (Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, WHO, and google scholar) were searched and screened by the authors for having appropriate information about covid-19. Finally, 72 studies were identified, summarized and reviewed. RESULT: The most specific manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 patients is pulmonary distress, and several patients admitted to intensive care units were not able to breathe spontaneously. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has a significant effect on nervous systems and may even lead to serious neurological damage. The neuroinvasive pathobiology is still not fully elucidated and thus the effect of CoV infections on the nervous system needs to be explored. The spike protein of the virus and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) lead to the presence of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the cells and, subsequently, decreased ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic possibilities of ACE2 antibody, ACE2-derived peptides, and small molecule blockers of ACE2 include a receptor-binding domain blocking approach. Hence, future studies of ACE2 may be very helpful in discovering a therapy for SARS-CoV-2.","Parsamanesh, Negin; Pezeshgi, Aiyoub; Hemmati, Mina; Jameshorani, Maryam; Saboory, Ehsan",Int J Neurosci,248,16

L'objectif était d'identifier des facteurs prédictifs d'EP chez des patients atteints de COVID-19 sévères hospitalisés hors réanimation. Au cours d'une étude rétrospective multicentrique nationale française, nous avons inclus entre le 6 et le 28 avril 2020, les patients atteints de COVID-19 confirmée par RT-PCR, hospitalisés en service de Médecine Interne ou de Pneumologie, avec un angioscanner thoracique réalisé au Service d'Accueil des Urgences pour suspicion d'EP. Les données de base, les traitements et l'évolution ont été recueillies lors de l'admission et au dernier suivi disponible. Des modèles de régression uni et multivariés ont été utilisés pour identifier les facteurs prédictifs associés au diagnostic d'EP confirmée. Au total, 88 patients (âge médian [interquartile range IQR] de 68 ans [60-78]) ont été analysés. Sur la base de l'angioscanner thoracique, une EP a été confirmée chez 47 (53,4 %) patients, et réfutée chez 41 autres. Un taux de D-dimères ≥ 3000 ng/mL (Odds ratio OR = 8,2 [intervalle de confiance à 95 %] 1,3-74,2, sensibilité (Se) 0,84, spécificité (Sp) 0,78, p = 0,03), un taux de leucocytes ≥ 12 G/L (OR = 29,5 [2,3-1221,2], Se 0,47, Sp 0,92, p = 0,02) et une ferritinémie ≥ 480 μg/L (OR = 17,0 [1,7-553,3], Se 0,96, Sp 0,44, p = 0,03) étaient associés au diagnostic d'EP de manière indépendante. L'association d'un taux de D-dimères ≥ 3000 ng/mL et d'un taux de leucocytes ≥ 12 G/L était très associés au diagnostic d'EP (OR = 21,4 [4,0-397,9], p = 0,004). Le taux de leucocytes, de D-dimères et la ferritinémie sont des biomarqueurs simples et facilement disponibles à l'admission pour prédire le diagnostic d'embolie pulmonaire chez des patients atteints de COVID-19 hospitalisés hors réanimation. Ces biomarqueurs pourraient intégrer la démarche diagnostique d'embolie pulmonaire et à l'initiation rapide d'une anticoagulation curative au cours de la COVID-19, et pourraient inversement réduire le nombre d'angioscanner thoracique non nécessaire.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outbreak si mulations for the COVID-19 pandemic are performed, using stochastic equations under the following assumptions: a pre-quarantine population R0 of 2.7 or 3.5, a post-quarantine R0 of 1.5, 2 or 2.7, 18% or 40%, of asymptomatic positives and a maximum response capacity of 50 or 150 patients in the intensive care units. The success of isolation and contact tracing is evaluated, no other mitigation measures are included. RESULTS: In the pre-quarantine stage, success in controlling more than 80% of the simulations occurred only if the isolation of positive cases was implemented from the first case, after which there was less than 40% probability of success. In post-quarantine, with 60 positive cases it is necessary to isolate them early, track all of their contacts and decrease the R0 to 1.5 for outbreak control to be successful in more than 80% of cases. Other scenarios have a low probability of success. CONCLUSIONS: The control of the outbreak in Peru during pre-quarantine stage demanded requirements that were difficult to comply with, therefore quarantine was necessary; to successfully suspend it would require a significant reduction in the spread of the disease, early isolation of positives and follow-up of all contacts of positive patients.","Huamaní, Charles; Timaná-Ruiz, Raúl; Pinedo, Jairo; Pérez, Jhelly; Vásquez, Luis",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,248,26

Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO 2. 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff &#8805;15 s, H A: Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. RESULTS: Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -&#8734; to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -&#8734; to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in patients with normal airway exam, scheduled for elective surgeries, our barrier box did not cause any clinically significant delay in TTI when airway manipulation is performed by well-trained providers. The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04411056) on May 27, 2020.","Madabhushi, Praneeth; Kinthala, Sudhakar; Ankam, Abistanand; Chopra, Nitin; Porter, Burdett R",BMC Anesthesiol,248,26

HCV elimination is facilitated by well-tolerated, highly effective HCV treatment that requires essentially no on-treatment monitoring in most patients, as highlighted by the MINMON (Minimal Monitoring Study or A5360) study, and that should be increasingly available to children with new data supporting feasible treatment in younger patients. Challenges to HCV elimination include HCV reinfection via sexual exposure in men who have sex with men (MSM) and continued barriers to diagnosis and access to HCV treatment. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression may take years in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. This may have important consequences as the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma was associated in a dose-dependent manner with HBV viral load and was lowest in those with sustained undetectable HBV, highlighting the need for HBV DNA monitoring during therapy. Public health programs should prioritize improving hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination in at-risk populations, including people with HIV, as vaccinations rates for these preventable diseases continue to be suboptimal in many settings. Fatty liver disease, heavy alcohol use, antiretroviral therapy, and COVID-19 infection were also examined as drivers of hepatic disease in HIV infection.","Luetkemeyer, A. F.; Wyles, D.

However, no agents have been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections to date, underscoring the great need for effective and practical therapies for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We reported that a focused screen of OA saponins identified 3-O-ß-chacotriosyl OA benzyl ester 2 as a novel small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, via binding to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein (S). We performed structure-activity relationship profiling of 2 and discovered C-17-COOH of OA was an important modification site that improved both inhibitor potency toward SARS-CoV-2 and selectivity index. Then optimization from hit to lead resulted in a potent fusion inhibitor 12f displaying strong inhibition against infectious SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of 0.97 µM in vitro. Mechanism studies confirmed that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry of 12f was mediated by the direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit to block membrane fusion. These 3-O-ß-chacotriosyl OA amide saponins are suitable for further optimization as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors with the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.","Li, Hui; Cheng, Chen; Li, Sumei; Wu, Yan; Liu, Zhihao; Liu, Mingjian; Chen, Jianxin; Zhong, Qiuyu; Zhang, Xuesha; Liu, Shuwen; Song, Gaopeng",Eur J Med Chem,248,1

It is postulated to investigate the factors limiting the development of the indicated adverse effects. One of the psychological resources that may have a significant, pro-health character in relation to mental functioning is ego-resiliency (ER). It is described as a personality trait associated with a high ability to adequately regulate self-control, depending on the conditions. There are studies providing information about the prohealth, adaptive nature of ER during the COVID­19 period. The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between ER and anxiety, the tendency to use alcohol and aggression in the group of Polish people in the initial lockdown period in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 538 adult Polish people participated in the study. The Ego-Resiliency Scale referred to as ER89-R12, according to Block's concept, was used to measure ER. The other scales used were the General Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the multiple regression procedure, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank ANOVA. Cronbach's &#945; coefficients were also assessed. RESULTS: Statistically significant negative relationships between ER and the severity of anxiety symptoms and generalized aggression were found. There was a weak positive relationship between ER and the tendency to use alcohol. Among the surveyed Polish people, higher ER was characteristic of the older respondents (aged >29 years) and people with higher education. CONCLUSIONS: Ego-resiliency in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can counteract the development of anxiety and aggression. Optimal regulation seems to play an important role in this relationship. The relationship between resiliency and the tendency to use alcohol requires further observation.","Debski, Pawel; Florek, Szymon; Piegza, Magdalena; Pudlo, Robert; Gorczyca, Piotr Waclaw",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,248,0

This led oncologists to radical changes in patient management, facing the unprecedent issue whether treatments in oncology could be postponed without compromising their efficacy. Purpose: To discuss legal implications in oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perspective: Treatment delay is not always feasible in oncology where the timing often plays a key role and may impact significantly in prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the oncologists were found between the anvil and the hammer, on the one hand the need to treat cancer patients aiming to improve clinical benefits, and on the other hand the goal to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection avoiding or delaying immunosuppressive treatments and hospital exposure. Therefore, two rising scenarios with possible implications in both criminal and civil law are emerging. Firstly, oncologists may be ""accused"" of having delayed or omitted the diagnosis and/or treatments with consequent worsening of patients' outcome. Secondly, oncologists can be blamed for having exposed patients to hospital environment considered at risk for COVID-19 transmission. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical decision making should be well-balanced through a careful examination between clinical performance status, age, comorbidities, aim of the treatment, and the potential risk of COVID-19 infection in order to avoid the risk of suboptimal cancer care with potential legal repercussion. Moreover, all cases should be discussed in the oncology team or in the tumor board in order to share the best strategy to adopt case by case.","Barranco, Rosario; Messina, Carlo; Bonsignore, Alessandro; Cattrini, Carlo; Ventura, Francesco",Front Public Health,248,16

In that regard, wearable biosensing technologies, capable of tracking drug pharmacokinetics in noninvasively retrievable biofluids (e.g., sweat), play a critical role, because they can be deployed at a large scale to monitor the individuals' drug transcourse profiles (semi)continuously and longitudinally. To this end, voltammetry-based sensing modalities are suitable, as in principle they can detect and quantify electroactive drugs on the basis of the target's redox signature. However, the target's redox signature in complex biofluid matrices can be confounded by the immediate biofouling effects and distorted/buried by the interfering voltammetric responses of endogenous electroactive species. Here, we devise a wearable voltammetric sensor development strategy-centering on engineering the molecule-surface interactions-to simultaneously mitigate biofouling and create an ""undistorted potential window"" within which the target drug's voltammetric response is dominant and interference is eliminated. To inform its clinical utility, our strategy was adopted to track the temporal profile of circulating acetaminophen (a widely used analgesic and antipyretic) in saliva and sweat, using a surface-modified boron-doped diamond sensing interface (cross-validated with laboratory-based assays, R 2 â¼ 0.94). Through integration of the engineered sensing interface within a custom-developed smartwatch, and augmentation with a dedicated analytical framework (for redox peak extraction), we realized a wearable solution to seamlessly render drug readouts with minute-level temporal resolution. Leveraging this solution, we demonstrated the pharmacokinetic correlation and significance of sweat readings.","Lin, Shuyu; Yu, Wenzhuo; Wang, Bo; Zhao, Yichao; En, Ke; Zhu, Jialun; Cheng, Xuanbing; Zhou, Crystal; Lin, Haisong; Wang, Zhaoqing; Hojaiji, Hannaneh; Yeung, Christopher; Milla, Carlos; Davis, Ronald W; Emaminejad, Sam",Proc.

This effect could be amplified by other concomitant factors (e.g., combination with other drugs affecting the QT, and/or electrolyte abnormalities, such as especially hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypocalcemia). Usually, this condition results in higher risk of torsade de point and other life-threatening arrhythmias, related to unrecognized unpaired cardiac ventricular repolarization reserve (VRR). Being VRR a dynamic phenomenon, QT prolongation might often not be identified during the 10-s standard 12-lead ECG recording at rest, leaving the patient at increased risk for life-threatening event. We report the case of a 49-year woman, undergoing tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer, which alteration of ventricular repolarization reserve, persisting also after correction of concomitant recurrent hypokalemia, was evidenced only after manual measurements of the corrected QT (QTc) interval from selected intervals of the 12-lead ECG Holter monitoring. This otherwise missed finding was fundamental to drive the discontinuation of tamoxifen, shifting to another ""safer"" therapeutic option, and to avoid the use of potentially arrhythmogenic antibiotics when treating a bilateral pneumonia in recent COVID-19.","Brisinda, Donatella; Merico, Barbara; Fenici, Peter; Fenici, Riccardo",Cardiovasc Toxicol,248,1

To evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period, when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level. The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance (UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9% in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero, and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural disasters).","Martin, Amory; Markhvida, Maryia; Hallegatte, St'ephane; Walsh, Brian",,248,2

Diverse measures to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as social distancing and increased telecommuting in Korea and the stringent lockdown measures of China, may reduce domestic emissions and levels of transported pollutants, respectively. In addition, wearing a particulate-filtering respirator may have decreased the absolute PM2.5 exposure level for individuals. Therefore, this study estimated the acute health benefits of PM2.5 reduction and changes in public behavior during the COVID-19 crisis in Seoul, Korea. To calculate the mortality burden attributable to PM2.5, we obtained residents' registration data, mortality data, and air pollution monitoring data for Seoul from publicly available databases. Relative risks were derived from previous time-series studies. We used the attributable fraction to estimate the number of excessive deaths attributable to acute PM2.5 exposure during January to April, yearly, from 2016 to 2020, and the number of mortalities avoided from PM2.5 reduction and respirator use observed in 2020. The average PM2.5 concentration from January to April in 2020 (25.6 µg/m3) was the lowest in the last 5 years. At least -4.1 µg/m3 (95% CI: -7.2, -0.9) change in ambient PM2.5 in Seoul was observed in 2020 compared to the previous 4 years. Overall, 37.6 (95% CI: 32.6, 42.5) non-accidental; 7.0 (95% CI: 5.7, 8.4) cardiovascular; and 4.7 (95% CI: 3.4, 6.1) respiratory mortalities were avoided due to PM2.5 reduction in 2020. By considering the effects of particulate respirator, decreases of 102.5 (95% CI: 89.0, 115.9) non-accidental; 19.1 (95% CI: 15.6, 22.9) cardiovascular; and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.2, 16.5) respiratory mortalities were estimated. We estimated that 37 lives were saved due to the PM2.5 reduction related to COVID-19 in Seoul, Korea. The health benefit may be greater due to the popular use of particulate-filtering respirators during the COVID-19 crisis. Future studies with daily mortality data are needed to verify our study estimates.","Han, Changwoo; Hong, Yun-Chul",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),248,24

High levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education and provision of non-Covid-19 healthcare. METHODS: Weekly and monthly officially published data for 2020/21 were used to estimate the influence of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 by age group, on the economy and on healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. The model was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. RESULTS: The results show vaccinations as significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57 000 life-years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next several months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around £0.4 million/life-year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting the spread of the virus give significantly different trade-offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing. Disruption of non-Covid-19 Healthcare provision also increases in times of higher levels of social restrictions. CONCLUSION: In most cases, the results favour a somewhat faster easing of restrictions in England than current policy implies.","Miles, David K; Heald, Adrian H; Stedman, Michael",Int J Clin Pract,248,16

We collected recorded daily ""respiratory"" medications given along with dosing information through 40-week postmenstrual age or neonatal intensive care unit discharge if earlier. RESULTS: PROP participants were exposed to a wide range of respiratory medications, often at doses beyond published recommendations. Nearly 50% received caffeine and furosemide beyond published recommendations for cumulative dose. Those who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were more likely to receive treatment with respiratory medications. However, more than 30% of PROP subjects that did not develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia also were treated with diuretics, systemic steroids, and other respiratory medications.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 in hemodialyzed (HD) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort, retrospective, multicenter study on incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in HD patients compared to the adult general population from the beginning of the pandemic until the commencement of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study population included all prevalent HD patients in 14 dialysis units of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland on December 31, 2019 and all new subjects starting long-term hemodialysis between January 01, 2020 and January 31, 2021, 1567 patients in total. General population data was obtained from health authorities reports. RESULTS: The absolute cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.4% in HD patients and after age standardization was 3.98 times higher compared to the controls (P<0.001). The epidemic trajectory of both groups ran in parallel, but the increase and the decline in the number of new cases occurred earlier in HD patients. Fatality rate of COVID-19 was 30.4% in HD patients. It was highest among the oldest patients reaching 43.81% among subjects from the age 75 years (P=0.003). Age standardized fatality and mortality rates in HD patients were 5.5 and 10.9 times higher than in controls (both: P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the extremely high mortality of COVID-19 in HD patients during the first and second wave of the epidemic in the Pomeranian Voivodeship before the vaccination era.","Puchalska-Reglinska, Ewelina; Debska-Slizien, Alicja; Biedunkiewicz, Bogdan; Tylicki, Piotr; Polewska, Karolina; Jagodzinski, Piotr; Rutkowski, Boleslaw; Gellert, Ryszard; Tylicki, Leszek",Pol.

Several vaccines have been approved worldwide, and in particular, three have been so far authorized for use in the EU. Vaccination can be, in fact, an efficient way to mitigate the devastating effect of the pandemic and offer protection to some vulnerable strata of the population (i.e., the elderly) and reduce the social and economic burden of the current crisis. Regardless, a question is still open: after vaccination availability for the public, will vaccination campaigns be effective in reaching all the strata and a sufficient number of people in order to guarantee herd immunity? In other words: after we have it, will we be able to use it? Following the trends in vaccine hesitancy in recent years, there is a growing distrust of COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, the online context and competition between pro- and anti-vaxxers show a trend in which anti-vaccination movements tend to capture the attention of those who are hesitant. Describing this context and analyzing its possible causes, what interventions or strategies could be effective to reduce COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy? Will social media trend analysis be helpful in trying to solve this complex issue? Are there perspectives for an efficient implementation of COVID-19 vaccination coverage as well as for all the other vaccinations?","Gori, Davide; Reno, Chiara; Remondini, Daniel; Durazzi, Francesco; Fantini, Maria Pia",,248,16

We define exposure density as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in non-residential and outdoor land uses. We utilize this approach to capture inflows/outflows of people as a result of the pandemic and changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. First, we develop a generalizable method for assessing neighborhood activity levels by land use type using smartphone geolocation data over a three-month period covering more than 12 million unique users within the Greater New York area. Second, we measure and analyze disparities in community social distancing by identifying patterns in neighborhood activity levels and characteristics before and after the stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effect of social distancing in neighborhoods on COVID-19 infection rates and outcomes associated with localized demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure characteristics in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings provide insight into the timely evaluation of the effectiveness of social distancing for individual neighborhoods and support a more equitable allocation of resources to support vulnerable and at-risk communities. Our findings demonstrate distinct patterns of activity pre- and post-COVID across neighborhoods.

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched up to 26 November 2020. All retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, and randomized controlled trial studies that investigated the relation between 25(OH)D and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 severity were included. Thirty-nine studies were included in the current systematic review. In studies that were adjusted (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.53; I2: 44.2%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.13; I2: 33.0%) there was a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vitamin D deficiency (VDD) group. Fifteen studies evaluated associations between VDD and composite severity. In the studies that were adjusted (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.65, 4.01; I2 = 0.0%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 10.61; 95% CI: 2.07, 54.23; I2 = 90.8%) there was a higher severity in the VDD group. Analysis of studies with crude OR (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.13, 6.05; I2: 47.9%), and adjusted studies that used the Cox survival method (HR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.52; I2: 84%) indicated a significant association of VDD with mortality, while in adjusted studies that used logistic regression, no relation was observed (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.75; I2: 76.6%). The results of studies that examined relations between VDD and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, pulmonary complications, hospitalization, and inflammation were inconsistent. In conclusion, although studies were heterogeneous in methodological and statistical approach, most of them indicated a significant relation between 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 composite severity, and mortality. With regard to infection, caution should be taken in interpreting the results, due to inherent study limitations. For ICU admission, inflammation, hospitalization, and pulmonary involvement, the evidence is currently inconsistent and insufficient.","Kazemi, Asma; Mohammadi, Vida; Aghababaee, Sahar Keshtkar; Golzarand, Mahdieh; Clark, Cain C T; Babajafari, Siavash","Adv. nutr.

But while biology played a crucial role in triggering the pandemic, the resulting crisis developed through a social process. In this paper, I argue that the coronavirus pandemic in Britain was successfully framed as a crisis, but that the ritualization of solidarity normally generated by this meaning was compromised. Through an analysis of media coverage and official statements from the government, I trace the discursive construction of the crisis through the deployment of battle metaphors. Building on this discourse analysis, I show how the symbolic alignment of the pandemic and the Second World War revived symbols and tropes that informed the cultural construction of pandemic heroes. To explain why the intensity of the crisis framing was not matched in ritual performance, I consider how the government's ambiguous policies and erratic social performance produced a state of indefinite liminality, subverting solidarity processes in lockdown. The paper offers insight into the experience of anomie during the pandemic and contributes to the strong program in cultural sociology by incorporating the crisis approach in disaster studies into the social drama framework.","McCormick, Lisa",Am J Cult Sociol,248,1

The Dutch fight against the water would have stimulated perseverance, ingenuity, cooperation and an egalitarian and democratic society. Despite the long water management history of the Netherlands, water became an important part of the self-images of the nation only in the eighteenth Century. In the 1780s the idea that the Dutch had wrung their country from the sea became popular. Initially, this idea was especially popular among the (proto-)liberal opposition, who emphasised the importance of the nation and its achievements. By the end of the nineteenth Century, water had become a national symbol for orthodox Calvinists, Roman Catholics and Socialists too, despite their different views on the nation. Whenever there was fast social change, political turmoil or external threats, as in the late eighteenth Century, the 1930s and 1940s and since the 1990s, the link between water and the Netherlands was used to promote national pride and unity and stimulate action.

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of ß-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles. Altogether, these results highlight how E and M proteins may influence the properties of S proteins and promote the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","Boson, Bertrand; Legros, Vincent; Zhou, Bingjie; Siret, Eglantine; Mathieu, Cyrille; Cosset, François-Loïc; Lavillette, Dimitri; Denolly, Solène",,248,20

Considering the huge number of morbidity and mortality worldwide, the World Health Organization declared, on 11th March 2020, the pandemic as an unprecedented public health crisis. The virus is a member of plus sense RNA viruses that can show a high rate of mutations. The ongoing multiple mutations in the structural proteins of coronavirus drive viral evolution, enabling them to evade the host immunity and rapidly acquire drug resistance. In the present study, we focused mainly on the prevalence of mutations in the four types of structural proteins- S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid)that are required for the assembly of a complete virion particle. Further, we estimated the antigenicity and allergenicity of these structural proteins to design and develop a potentially good candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In the present in silico study, envelope protein was found to be highly antigenic, followed by the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Results: In this study, we detected 987 mutations from 729 sequences from Asia in October 2020, and compared them with China's first Wuhan isolate sequence as a reference. Spike protein showed the highest mutations with 807 point mutations among the four structural proteins, followed by nucleocapsid with 151 mutations, while envelope showed 19 mutations and membrane only 10 point mutations. Conclusion: Taken together, our study revealed that variations occurring in the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 might be altering the viral structure and function, and that the envelope protein appears to be a promising vaccine candidate to curb coronavirus infections.","Jha, D.

To date, there has been a lack of data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination coverage in China since the vaccine has become available. METHODS: We designed and implemented a cross-sectional, population-based online survey to evaluate the willingness, hesitancy, and coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine among the Chinese population. 8742 valid samples were recruited and classified as the vaccine-priority group (n = 3902; 44.6%) and the non-priority group (n = 4840; 55.4%). RESULTS: The proportion of people's trust in the vaccine, delivery system, and government were 69.0%, 78.0% and 81.3%, respectively. 67.1% of the participants were reportedly willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, while 9.0% refused it. 834 (35.5%) reported vaccine hesitancy, including acceptors with doubts (48.8%), refusers (39.4%), and delayers (11.8%).

The predicted rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 64.9%, 68.9% and 81.1% based on the rates of vaccine hesitancy, willingness, and refusal, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccine rate is far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity, which will require more flexible and comprehensive efforts to improve the population's confidence and willingness to vaccinate.

RESULTS: V-CACS cut off value of 3 (82.67% sensitivity and 54.55% specificity; AUC 0.75) and CT-SS with a cut off value of 21.5 (95.7% sensitivity and 63.6% specificity; AUC 0.87) are independent predictors for clinical severity and also the need for ICU admission or assisted ventilation. The pooling of both CT-SS and V-CACS (82.67% sensitivity and 86.4% specificity; AUC 0.92) are more reliable in terms of predicting the primary outcome of COVID-19 patients. On regression analysis, V-CACS and CT-SS are individual independent predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 (Odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.99-2.98; p = 0.05 and Odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39; p = 0.001 respectively). The area under the curve (AUC) for pooled V-CACS and CT-SS was 0.96 (95% CI 0.84-0.98) which correctly predicted 82.1% cases. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression model using pooled Visual-Coronary artery calcification score and CT Chest severity score in non-cardiac gated CT can predict clinical severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Nair, Anirudh Venugopalan; Kumar, Devendra; Yadav, Santosh Kumar; Nepal, Pankaj; Jacob, Bamil; Al-Heidous, Mahmoud",Clin Imaging,248,1

However, what determines whether early metastasis of choriocarcinoma has occurred is unknown. The emerging role of miRNA in regulating cancer development and progression has been recognized. miR-373 has been shown to play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, whether miR-373 functions to promote choriocarcinoma metastasis is not clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the function of miR-373-3p in the progression of this cancer. METHODS: In this study, we first compared epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, which were inversely correlated with miR-373-3p expression in trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cell lines. Using PCR and Western blot, upregulation of miR-373-3p was observed to inhibit EMT progression. Similarly, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that ectopic miR-373-3p overexpression inhibited the migration by transwell methods of choriocarcinoma cells. RESULTS: Our results revealed that miR-373-3p acted as an EMT inhibitor in JEG-3 and JAR cells; this was due to its mediation of the transforming growth factor-ß (TGFß) signaling pathway, which was responsible for EMT. miRNA microarray analysis demonstrated that miR-373-3p interacted with the 3' untranslated region of TGFßR2 mRNA, and then Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays verified this interaction. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that miR-373-3p upregulation partly accounts for TGFßR2 downregulation and leads to a restraint of EMT and migration. miR-373-3p may therefore serve as a valuable potential target in the treatment of choriocarcinoma.","Lu, Yanjie; Li, Xiaoru; Zuo, Yanzhen; Xu, Qian; Liu, Lei; Wu, Haiying; Chen, Long; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Ying; Li, Yuhong",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,248,20

Over a million cases have been confirmed in the United States. As of May 5, 2020, New York State has had over 300,000 cases and 24,000 deaths with more than half of the cases and deaths occurring in New York City (NYC). Little is known, however, of how this virus impacts pregnancy. Given this lack of data and the risk for severe disease in this relatively immunocompromised population, further understanding of the obstetrical management of COVID-19, as well as hospital level preparation for its control, is crucial. Guidance has come from expert opinion, professional societies and public health agencies, but to date, there is no report on how obstetrical practices have adapted these recommendations to their local situations. We therefore developed an internet-based survey to elucidate the practices put into place to guide the care of obstetrical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed obstetrical leaders in four academic medical centers in NYC who were implementing and testing protocols at the height of the pandemic. We found that all sites made changes to their practices, and that there appeared to be agreement with screening and testing for COVID-19, as well as labor and delivery protocols, for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. We found less consensus with respect to inpatient antepartum fetal surveillance. We hope that this experience is useful to other centers as they formulate their plans to face this pandemic.

However, it is not suitable as a monitoring tool for pregnant women because of the risk of ionizing radiation damage to the fetus as well as the possible infection of others. In this study, we explored the value of bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) as an alternative to CT for the detection and monitoring of lung involvement in pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical and LUS data of 39 pregnant women with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. All LUS and CT images were analyzed to summarize the findings and calculate LUS scores and CT scores for each patient. LUS findings were compared with CT, and correlation between LUS scores and CT scores was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 39 pregnant women, there were 6 mild-type cases, 29 common-type cases, 4 severe-type cases, and no critical-type cases. The most common LUS findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were various grades of multiple B-lines (84.6%), thickened and irregular pleural lines (71.8%), pleural effusion (61.5%) and small multifocal consolidation limited to the subpleural space (35.9%). The mean LUS score at admission was 0 points in mild-type cases, 10.6 points in common-type cases and 15.3 points in severe-type cases (P < 0.01). The correlation between LUS scores and CT was 0.793. All patients were clinically cured and each underwent an average of three LUS follow-ups during hospitalization. The mean LUS score at discharge was 5.6 points lower than that at admission. The consistency of LUS and chest CT during follow-up was 0.652. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative LUS scoring can effectively instead of CT for detecting and monitoring of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women and protect fetuses from the risk of ionizing radiation.","Deng, Qing; Cao, Sheng; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Yao; Chen, Liao; Yang, Zhaohui; Peng, Zhoufeng; Zhou, Qing",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,248,1

However, a wide variety of dosing schemes has been applied in the clinical practice and tested in clinical studies. An extended literature survey was performed investigating the pharmacokinetics, the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 treatment. Population pharmacokinetic models were retrieved from the literature and after evaluation and assessment one was selected in order to perform simulations. The most commonly applied dosing schemes were explored for patients with different weights and different levels of HCQ clearance impairment. Model-based simulations of HCQ concentrations revealed that high initial doses followed by low and sparse doses may offer significant benefits to patients by decreasing the viral load without reaching levels considered to produce adverse effects. For instance, the dosing scheme proposed for a 70 kg adult with moderate COVID-19 symptoms would be 600 mg upon diagnosis, 400 mg after 12 h, 300 mg after 24 h, 200 mg after 36 h, followed by 200 mg BID for 4 d, followed by 200 mg OD for 5 d. Based on the results from simulations performed and the currently published knowledge regarding HCQ in COVID-19 treatment, this study provides evidence that a high loading dose followed by sparse doses could offer significant benefits to the patients.","Karatza, Eleni; Ismailos, George; Marangos, Markos; Karalis, Vangelis",Xenobiotica,248,1

Our first aim was to determine both the infection status and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers. Our second aim was to evaluate the occupational and demographic predictors of seropositivity to inform the country's infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We invited 713 staff members at 24 out of 35 health facilities in the City of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Compliance to testing was defined as the willingness to uptake COVID-19 testing by answering a questionnaire and providing samples for both antibody testing and PCR testing. SARS-COV-2 antibodies were detected using a rapid diagnostic test kit and SAR-COV-2 infection was determined by real-time (RT)-PCR. Of the 713 participants, 635(89%) consented to answering the questionnaire and providing blood sample for antibody testing while 560 (78.5%) agreed to provide nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 635 people (aged 18-73) providing a blood sample 39.1% reported a history of past COVID-19 symptoms while 14.2% reported having current symptoms of COVID-19. The most-prevalent co-morbidity among this group was hypertension (22.0%) followed by asthma (7.0%) and diabetes (6.0%). The SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence was 8.9%. Of the 560 participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 participants (0.36%) were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. None of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive people were positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection by PCR testing. CONCLUSION AND INTERPRETATION: In addition to clinical staff, several patient-facing health workers were characterised within Zimbabwe's health system and the seroprevalence data indicated that previous exposure to SAR-CoV-2 had occurred across the full spectrum of patient-facing staff with nurses and nurse aides having the highest seroprevalence. Our results highlight the need for including the various health workers in IPC strategies in health centres to ensure effective biosecurity and biosafety.","Rusakaniko, Simbarashe; Sibanda, Elopy Nemele; Mduluza, Takafira; Tagwireyi, Paradzayi; Dhlamini, Zephaniah; Ndhlovu, Chiratidzo Ellen; Chandiwana, Precious; Chiwambutsa, Shingirai; Lim, Rivka May; Scott, Fiona; Sibanda, Lindiwe Majele; Mutapi, Francisca",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,248,1

METHODS: The proposed treatment schemes, favoring hypofractionated schedules, and COVID-19 management strategies regarding irradiation are presented. Attendance after two months of implementation of these policies was measured and compared with that during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A 10% reduction in the number of treated patients and a 26% reduction in the number of sessions was observed. The main impact was a decrease in the treatment of benign diseases and gastrointestinal tumors, with a general increase in breast cancer treatments. Eighteen (1.7%) patients were confirmed as having COVID-19 during radiotherapy in April and May 2020, three of whom were hospitalized, and one patient died because of COVID-19. Among the 18 patients, 12 had their treatments interrupted for at least 15 days from symptom appearance. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of treated patients in our radiotherapy department, with a greater decrease in the total number of sessions.

At the early onset of the pandemic, it is imperative to measure the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among healthy individuals to better understand the causes, transmission, and preventive measures. Purpose: This study aimed to identify the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in a healthy Filipino population during the early onset of the pandemic outbreak. Methods: This cross-sectional rapid online and web-based survey was conducted among healthy Filipino population. A total of 1634 subjects participated via the Google survey link. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the respondents' profile characteristics and KAP scores. The One-Way ANOVA or independent sample t-test was used to measure KAP scores' differences when grouped according to respondents' profile characteristics. Pearson correlation was used to measure the relationship among the KAP scores. The data were all analyzed using the SPSS version 26.0. Results: The overall knowledge scores revealed 67.7%. Filipinos believed COVID-19 would finally be successfully controlled and confident that the Philippines can win the battle against the virus through preventive practices. KAP scores showed significant differences with age, sex (p&lt;0.000), and place of residence (p&lt;0.000), occupation (p&lt;0.000), and marital status (p&lt;0.000).

We posit current infection control guidelines generally protect HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare setting. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we use viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States between 25 March - 27 December, 2020. We obtain limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combine epidemiological information with healthcare-associated viral sequences and with viral sequences collected in the broader community to infer the most likely source of infection in HCP. RESULTS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 95 HCP and 137 possible patient contact sequences. The majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker (55/95; 57.9%) and were genetically similar to viruses circulating concurrently in the community. We found 10.5% of infections could be traced to a coworker (10/95). Strikingly, only 4.2% of HCP infections could be traced to a patient source (4/95). CONCLUSIONS: Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients, HCP, and communities at risk. We found no evidence for healthcare-associated transmission in the majority of HCP infections evaluated here. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic healthcare-associated transmission, it appears that HCP most commonly becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure. This emphasizes the ongoing importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs, and rapid distribution of vaccines.","Braun, Katarina M; Moreno, Gage K; Buys, Ashley; Somsen, Elizabeth D; Bobholz, Max; Accola, Molly A; Anderson, Laura; Rehrauer, William M; Baker, David A; Safdar, Nasia; Lepak, Alexander J; O039,; Connor, David H; Friedrich, Thomas C",Clin. infect. dis,248,16

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: â¢ in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; â¢ in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Special precautions should be taken and procedures followed when performing invasive medical procedures in endoscopic laboratories in patients with specific or clinically probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To date, no meta-analysis summarized evidence on the relative benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for FGR prevention. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NetMA), searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until November 2019. We included clinical trials and observational studies on singleton gestating women evaluating antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or other treatments, compared between each other or to control (placebo or no treatment), and considering the pregnancy outcome FGR (primary outcome of the NetMA). Secondary efficacy outcomes included preterm birth, placental abruption, and fetal or neonatal death. Safety outcomes included bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Network meta-analyses using a frequentist framework were conducted to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 18780 citations, we included 30 studies on 4326 patients. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), alone or associated with low-dose aspirin (LDA), appeared more efficacious than control in preventing FGR [OR 2.00 (1.27 - 3.16) and 2.67 (1.21 - 5.89) for control vs LMWH and LDA+LMWH, respectively]. No difference between active treatments emerged in terms of FGR prevention, but estimates for treatments other than LMWH+/- LDA were imprecise. Only the confidence in the evidence regarding LMWH vs control was judged as moderate, according to the CINeMA framework. No treatment was associated with an increased risk of bleeding, although estimates were precise enough only for LMWH. These results should inform clinicians on the benefits of active pharmacological prophylaxis for FGR prevention.","Bettiol, Alessandra; Avagliano, Laura; Lombardi, Niccolò; Crescioli, Giada; Emmi, Giacomo; Letizia Urban, Maria; Virgili, Gianni; Ravaldi, Claudia; Vannacci, Alfredo",Clin. pharmacol. ther,248,16

Some low- and middle-income countries have highlighted the challenges with COVID-19 testing, such as inadequate capacity, untrained laboratory personnel, and inadequate funding. This article describes the components and implementation of a healthcare worker surveillance programme in a designated COVID-19 teaching hospital in Malaysia. In addition, the distribution and characteristics of healthcare workers placed under surveillance are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A COVID-19 healthcare worker surveillance programme was implemented in University Malaya Medical Centre. The programme involved four teams: contact tracing, risk assessment, surveillance and outbreak investigation. Daily symptom surveillance was conducted over fourteen days for healthcare workers who were assessed to have low-, moderate- and high-risk of contracting COVID-19. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for data collected over 24 weeks, from the 6th of March 2020 to the 20th of August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,174 healthcare workers were placed under surveillance. The majority were females (71.6%), aged between 25 and 34 years old (64.7%), were nursing staff (46.9%) and had no comorbidities (88.8%). A total of 70.9% were categorised as low-risk, 25.7% were moderate-risk, and 3.4% were at high risk of contracting COVID-19. One-third (35.2%) were symptomatic, with the sore throat (23.6%), cough (19.8%) and fever (5.0%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. A total of 17 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19, with a prevalence of 0.3% among all the healthcare workers. Risk category and presence of symptoms were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (p<0.001). Fever (p<0.001), cough (p = 0.003), shortness of breath (p = 0.015) and sore throat (p = 0.002) were associated with case positivity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 symptom surveillance and risk-based assessment have merits to be included in a healthcare worker surveillance programme to safeguard the health of the workforce.","Wan, Kim Sui; Tok, Peter Seah Keng; Yoga Ratnam, Kishwen Kanna; Aziz, Nuraini; Isahak, Marzuki; Ahmad Zaki, Rafdzah; Nik Farid, Nik Daliana; Hairi, Noran Naqiah; Rampal, Sanjay; Ng, Chiu-Wan; Samsudin, Mohd Fauzy; Venugopal, Vinura; Asyraf, Mohammad; Damanhuri, Narisa Hatun; Doraimuthu, Sanpagavalli; Arumugam, Catherine Thamarai; Marthammuthu, Thaneswaran; Nawawi, Fathhullah Azmie; Baharudin, Faiz; Chong, Diane Woei Quan; Jayaraj, Vivek Jason; Magarita, Venna; Ponnampalavanar, Sasheela; Hasnan, Nazirah; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Said, Mas Ayu",PLoS One,248,1

In this context, there has been little mention of the immediate importance of K-12 schooling for the rest of the economy. Eliminating in-person schooling reduces the amount of labour time parents of school-aged children have available to work, and therefore reduces income to those workers and the economy as a whole. We discuss two measures of economic importance, and how they can be modified to better reflect the vital role played by K-12 education. The first is its size, as captured by the fraction of GDP that is produced by that sector. The second is its centrality, reflecting how essential a sector is to the network of economic activity. Using data from Canada's Census of Population and Symmetric Input-Output Tables, we show how accounting for this role dramatically increases the importance of K-12 schooling.","Green, D.

We identified risk factors, comorbidities, and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with or without acute ischemic stroke and compared with patients without COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We analyzed the data from 54 health care facilities using the Cerner deidentified COVID-19 dataset. The dataset included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated to suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 103 (1.3%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 8163 patients with COVID-19. Among all patients with COVID-19, the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure was significantly higher among those with acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.6-2.4]; P<0.0001) after adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 199 (1.0%) patients developed acute ischemic stroke among 19 513 patients without COVID-19. Among all ischemic stroke patients, COVID-19 was associated with discharge to destination other than home or death (relative risk, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3]; P=0.03) after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ischemic stroke was infrequent in patients with COVID-19 and usually occurs in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.

METHOD: A systematic review was conducted using the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-Cov-2"" and ""second wave"". No relevant citations were found to inform on recommendations the plan. Therefore, an expert panel of the European Hip Society and the European Knee Associates was formed to provide the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, the recommendations consider three phases; review of the first wave, preparation for the next wave, and during the next wave. International and national policies will drive most of the management. The recommendations focus on the preparation phase and, in particular, the actions that the individual surgeon needs to undertake to continue with, and practice, elective arthroplasty during the next wave, as well as planning their personal and their family's lives. The recommendations expect rigorous data collection during the next wave, so that a cycle of continuous improvement is created to take account of any future waves. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations for planning to continue elective hip and knee arthroplasty during a new phase of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic provide a framework to reduce the risk of a complete shutdown of elective surgery. This involves engaging with hospital managers and other specialities in the planning process. Individuals have responsibilities to themselves, their colleagues, and their families, beyond the actual delivery of elective arthroplasty.","Donell, Simon T; Thaler, Martin; Budhiparama, Nicolaas C; Buttaro, Martin A; Chen, Antonia F; Diaz-Ledezma, Claudio; Gomberg, Bruce; Hirschmann, Michael T; Karachalios, Theofilos; Karpukhin, Alexey; Sandiford, Nemandra Amir; Shao, Hongyi; Tandogan, Reha; Violante, Bruno; Zagra, Luigi; Kort, Nanne P",Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,248,32

NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations. Results: Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78â674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72â179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40â406 (56·2%) of 71â915 were men, 31â509 (43·8%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (5·8%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 0·95, 95% CI 0·84-1·07; p=0·35), critical care admission (1·01, 0·87-1·17; p=0·89), requirement for invasive ventilation (0·96, 0·80-1·17; p=0·69), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (1·12, 0·96-1·32; p=0·14), requirement for oxygen (1·00, 0·89-1·12; p=0·97), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (1·08, 0·92-1·26; p=0·33). Interpretation: NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. Policy makers should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and COVID-19 severity.

It is argued that Solnica et al's analysis of Rabbi Waldenberg's text and their conclusion that healthcare workers are obligated to endanger themselves while treating patient who suffer from contagious illness during epidemics according to Jewish law suffer from various shortcomings. Indeed, Jewish law looks favourably on healthcare workers who take a reasonable risk in treating their patients in the context of epidemics. However, it is considered a voluntary supererogatory act-not obligatory. Solnica et al may express a legitimate ethical viewpoint.

The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon &#945;-2b and supportive therapy. OUTCOMES: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020. LESSONS: Strengthening infants' virus screening in families with infected kins is important for early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment when symptoms are atypical.

We aimed to perform a comparative analysis of psychological symptoms in community-dwelling older adults with and without a history of a Covid-19 infection.Methods: In this study, we utilized a geriatric care unit's outpatient registry to prospectively enroll older adults with and without a history of Covid-19. An interviewer administered generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2), patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), six-item cognitive impairment (6-CIT), and post-traumatic stress disorder-5 (PTSD-5) tests over the phone. Correlation and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations.Results: The study included 120 older subjects, 46 (38.3%) reported past Covid-19 infection. Anxiety and depression were both significantly more prevalent among subjects without a history of Covid-19. Having no history of Covid-19, female gender, and psychoactive medication use showed independent associations with the risk of depression symptoms among all subjects, and female gender was additionally associated with anxiety symptoms.Conclusion: This study showed that the risk of depression symptoms was higher in a sample of older adults who were not infected with Covid-19 compared to those recovering from the disease.Clinical implications: The impact of ""fear of transmission"" on the mental health of the elderly may be a significant issue to deal with.

Indeed, we theoretically prove that nodes of high-degree are disproportionately in the Removed state after a first wave of infection, which has very positive consequences. In particular, powerlaw graphs do not retain their structure after a few waves of infection, which implies second and third waves may be of much smaller amplitude than the first wave.

We sought to characterize the changes in testing accessibility at UCCs between March and August 2020 on the basis of testing availability (including rapid antigen testing), wait time for test results, cost of visits, and cost of tests. METHODS: Data were collected using a secret shopper methodology. Researchers contacted 250 UCCs in 10 states. Investigators used a standardized script to survey centers on their COVID-19 testing availability and policies. UCCs were initially contacted in March and re-called in August. T-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify differences between March and August data and differences by center classification. RESULTS: Our results indicate that both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect COVID-19 genetic material and rapid antigen COVID-19 tests have increased in availability. However, wait times for PCR test results have significantly increased to an average of 5.79 days. Additionally, a high proportion of UCCs continue to charge for tests and visits and no significant decrease was found in the proportion of UCCs that charge for COVID-19 testing from March to August. Further, no state reported a majority of UCCs with rapid testing available, indicating an overall lack of rapid testing. CONCLUSIONS: From March to August, COVID-19 testing availability gradually improved. However, many barriers lie in access to COVID-19 testing, including testing costs, visit costs, and overall lack of availability of rapid testing in the majority of UCCs. Despite the passage of the CARES Act, these results suggest that there is room for additional policy to improve accessibility to testing, specifically rapid testing.","Yousman, Laurie C; Khunte, Akshay; Hsiang, Walter; Jain, Siddharth; Forman, Howard; Wiznia, Daniel",BMC Health Serv Res,248,21

METHODS: A systematic literature review of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and medRxiv/bioRxiv preprint servers to 11 May 2020 identified published and unpublished papers on COVID-19 transmission by children. RESULTS: We identified 700 scientific papers and letters and 47 full texts were studied in detail. Children accounted for a small fraction of COVID-19 cases and mostly had social contacts with peers or parents, rather than older people at risk of severe disease. Data on viral loads were scarce, but indicated that children may have lower levels than adults, partly because they often have fewer symptoms, and this should decrease the transmission risk. Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks. However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads. CONCLUSION: Children are unlikely to be the main drivers of the pandemic. Opening up schools and kindergartens is unlikely to impact COVID-19 mortality rates in older people.","Ludvigsson, Jonas F",Acta Paediatr,248,1

However, the health literacy of urban and rural populations in China has been little known. Thus, this study aims to assess the status of health literacy and explore the differences of its possible determinants (e.g., socio-economic factors) among urban and rural populations in Henan, China. A cross-sectional study, 78,646 participants were recruited from a populous province in central China with a multi-stage random sampling design. The Chinese Resident Health Literacy Scale was adopted to measure the health literacy of the respondents. In the participants, the level of health literacy (10.21%) in central China was significantly lower than the national average, and a big gap was identified between urban and rural populations (16.92% vs. 8.09%). A noticeable difference was reported in different aspects and health issues of health literacy between urban and rural populations. The health literacy level was lower in those with lower levels of education, and a significant difference was identified in the level of health literacy among people of different ages and occupations in both urban and rural areas. Note that in rural areas, as long as residents educated, they all had higher odds to exhibit basic health literacy than those uneducated; in rural areas, compared with those aged 15 to 24 years, residents aged 45 to 54 years (OR = 0.846,95% CI (0.730, 0.981)), 55 to 64 years (OR = 0.716,95% CI (0.614, 0.836)) and above 65 years (OR = 0.679, 95% CI (0.567, 0.812)) were 84.6%, 71.6%, and 67.9%, respectively, less likely to exhibit basic health literacy. Considering the lower health literacy among rural residents compared with their urban counterparts, a reorientation of the health policy-making for Chinese rural areas is recommended. This study suggests that urban-rural disparity about health literacy risk factors should be considered when implementing health literacy promotion intervention.","Wang, Wenna; Zhang, Yulin; Lin, Beilei; Mei, Yongxia; Ping, Zhiguang; Zhang, Zhenxiang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),248,1

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a extend literature review on CSR, BT and BL studies, the authors evaluate the impact of those construct on SMEs’ performance in an emerging market. The paper follows a quantitative approach. In total, 247 responses were collected from 300 samples. The Smart Partial Least Squares SEM (version) was used to analyze the data of the SMEs of Vietnam in the year 2020. Findings: The findings revealed significant and positive relationships among the variables in the model, such as CSR and firm performance (FP), CSR and BT, CSR and BL, as well as the mediating effect of BT and BL between CSR and firm performance. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample was composed of small business from different segments, thus the respondents' perspective about CSR can differ according the impact of the business on society. Therefore, future studies could address businesses from a single segment to get a deeper understanding of their knowledge and involvement with CSR. Second, a cross-cultural study in emerging countries can be a rich venue for future research. Third, this study was developed through a quantitative approach;thus, the future research can apply qualitative approach or mixed methods to extend the study findings. Practical implications: Managerial level of firm should prioritize noneconomic-related CSR;however, those will ultimately drive financial indicators of FP. The result is reasonable because firm simultaneously keeps committed with its stakeholders by delivering the committed qualification, transparency in operation and consistency in communication, environment respect, employee development and social welfare integrated directly into business activities. Those will result in creating love, trust and admiration from stakeholder, customers for brand and firms will get their engagement and support in many ways. This implication suggests that firm should incorporate CSR strategy into their core business activities and practice properly toward its stakeholders. Social implications: This study contributes to the CSR literature in emerging context by shedding light on the roles of CSR in FP with the mediation roles of BT and BL. Most CSR studies focused on Western context as developed economy, thus less attention has been paid for emerging economy. While there is increasing interest CSR in Vietnam, traditional culture and its distinctive economic and political structure has had a great influence on CSR in Vietnam. Thus, this study is important and meaningful for business practitioners, investors, shareholders and policymakers toward sustainable development for firms and Vietnam as a whole. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that explores the mediating role of BT and BL between CSR and FP for SMEs. The findings of this study may be of great implications to entrepreneurs, top management with respect to strategic perspectives to drive their businesses and to improve their FP in a sustainable direction in contexts of emerging markets. In addition, this finding may be of great interest to motive SMEs' managers to engage with CSR actions where those businesses are situated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By that understanding, Government may consider for policy reforms/innovation/groundbreaking to leverage businesses to promote their strengths toward sustainable development in the new economic settings. The findings of this study may be of significant contribution to SMEs in Vietnam and in others in emerging economies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Le Thanh, T.; Ngo, H.

Viruses are classically considered to exert their pathologic actions through acute or chronic infection followed by the host response. This host response causes the release of cytokines leading to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. However, viruses may employ an alternative pathway to soluble cytokine-induced pathologies-by initiating the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. The best-understood example of this alternative pathway is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-elicited EVs and their propensity to harm vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, an HIV-encoded accessory protein called the ""negative factor"" (Nef) was demonstrated in EVs from the body fluids of HIV patients on successful combined antiretroviral therapy (ART); it was also demonstrated to be sufficient in inducing endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction. This review will highlight HIV-Nef as an example of how HIV can produce EVs loaded with proinflammatory cargo to disseminate cardiovascular pathologies. It will further discuss whether EV production can explain SARS-CoV-2-mediated pulmonary and cardiovascular pathologies.","Clauss, Matthias; Chelvanambi, Sarvesh; Cook, Christine; ElMergawy, Rabab; Dhillon, Navneet",Viruses,248,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional, case-control study aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 T-cell response by two different technologies, the analysis of IFN-Î³+ CD8+ /CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry and the quantification of IFN-Î³ release by ELISA-related assay (without cell discrimination), both after SARS-CoV-2 stimulation among uninfected and convalescent HCWs. RESULTS: A high proportion of uninfected HCWs (53.8%) had pre-existing IFN-Î³+ CD8 T-cell response after stimulation with at least one of the structural viral proteins S, M or N, while 35.9% had pre-existing IFN-Î³+ CD4 T-cell response. This proportion was nearly or greater than 90% among convalescent HCWs. Interestingly, the magnitude of the response in uninfected was lower compared to that found in convalescent HCWs, using both methods. The concordance, quantifying the specific cellular response in convalescent HCWs, between both methods was 94.1% comparing CD8 T-cell response and 89.7% comparing CD4 T-cell response. This concordance was lower but still high in uninfected HCWs (76.5%) comparing CD8 T-cell response and 71.8% comparing CD4 T-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: The good concordance between the proportion of individuals with IFN-Î³ release after SARS-COV-2 stimulation with the proportion of individuals with specific IFN-Î³+ CD8/CD4 T cells found in this study drives IFN-Î³ release assays to be a simple and easy way to determine the protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a wide population.","Vallejo, Alejandro; Vizcarra, Pilar; Quereda, Carmen; Moreno, Ana; Casado, José Luis",Eur J Clin Invest,248,1

Smoking cessation digital platforms transcend pandemic-driven social distancing and lockdown measures in terms of assisting smokers in their quit attempts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine trends in the number of visitors, followers, and subscribers on smoking cessation digital platforms from January to April 2020 and to compare these traffic data to those observed during the same 4-month period in 2019. The examination of prepandemic and postpandemic trends in smoking cessation digital platform traffic can reveal whether interest in smoking cessation among smokers is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained cross-sectional data from daily visitors on the SmokeFree website; the followers of six SmokeFree social media accounts; and subscribers to the SmokeFree SMS text messaging and mobile app interventions of the National Cancer Institute's SmokeFree.gov initiative platforms, which are publicly available to US smokers. Average daily percentage changes (ADPCs) were used to measure trends for the entire 2020 and 2019 study periods, whereas daily percentage changes (DPCs) were used to measure trends for each time segment of change within each 4-month period. Data analysis was conducted in May and June 2020. RESULTS: The number of new daily visitors on the SmokeFree website (between days 39 and 44: DPC=18.79%; 95% CI 5.16% to 34.19%) and subscribers to the adult-focused interventions QuitGuide (between days 11 and 62: DPC=1.11%; 95% CI 0.80% to 1.43%) and SmokeFreeTXT (between days 11 and 89: DPC=0.23%; 95% CI 0.004% to 0.47%) increased, but this was followed by declines in traffic. No comparable peaks were observed in 2019. The number of new daily subscribers to quitSTART (ie, the teen-focused intervention) trended downward in 2020 (ADPC=-1.02%; 95% CI -1.88% to -0.15%), whereas the overall trend in the number of subscribers in 2019 was insignificant (P=.07). The number of SmokeFree social media account followers steadily increased by <0.1% over the 4-month study periods in 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Peaks in traffic on the SmokeFree website and adult-focused intervention platforms in 2020 could be attributed to an increased interest in smoking cessation among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coordinated campaigns, especially those for adolescents, should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise awareness of digital smoking cessation platforms to capitalize on smokers' heightened interest during the pandemic.","El-Toukhy, Sherine",J Med Internet Res,248,16

Electrical function is preserved but atrial contraction is absent. Standard 2D transthoracic echocardiography evaluates isolated left atrial standstill by analyzing pulsed-wave Doppler imaging of mitral valve (MV) inflows and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) at MV annulus. Case report: In a 65-year old patient with arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia electrical conversion of persistent atrial flutter to sinus rhythm was achieved. The patient has had atrial flutter for about a year. He also suffered from COVID-19 pneumonia infection 2 months before being admitted to the hospital. In spite of sinus rhythm after the electrical conversion that was seen on twelve-lead electrocardiography, 48 hours after conversion no mechanical left atrial activity was restored. MV inflow demonstrated normal E wave (passive filling in early diastole) but absent A wave (atrial contraction during late diastole). TDI at the MV annulus also confirmed isolated mechanical LA standstill. There was absence of a’ at the MV annulus. Conclusion: Atrial standstill is condition that may involve impairment of electrical function (electrical silence or an inability to pace or capture), or mechanical function (based on imaging).1,2 The pathophysiologic mechanism can be the underlying presence of atrial fibrosis, myopathy or it may include interatrial block.3 The absence of mechanical LA contraction has potential hemodynamic consequences, also there could be the possibility for the thrombus formation within the atria leading to thromboembolism.

Purpose To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for lung fibrotic-like changes on six-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods 114 patients (80[70%] men; mean age, 54±12 years) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained on 17±11 days and 175±20 days respectively after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0-5; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: group#1 presence and group#2 absence of CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) based on their six-month follow-up CT. Between-group differences were assessed by Fisher's exact test, two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. Results On follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40/114 (35%) of patients (group#1), while the remaining 74/114 (65%) patients (group#2) showed either complete radiological resolution (43/114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31/114, 27%). Multivariable analysis identified age >50 years (odds ratio [OR]:8.5, 95%CI:1.9-38, p=.01), heart rate >100bpm at admission (OR:5.6, 95%CI:1.1-29, p=.04), duration of in-hospital stay &#8805;17 days (OR:5.5, 95%CI:1.5-21, p=.01), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR:13, 95%CI:3.3-55, p<.001), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR:6.3, 95%CI:1.3-30, p=.02) and total CT score &#8805;18 (OR:4.2, 95%CI:1.2-14, p=.02) on initial CT as independent predictors for lung fibrotic-like changes at 6 months. Conclusions Six-month follow-up CT showed lung fibrotic-like changes in more than one-third of patients who survived severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes were associated with an older age, acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer in-hospital stays, tachycardia, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and higher initial chest CT score.

Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of ""open-label placebos"" (OLPs) have remained subject of debate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis (N = 54) over the course of two weeks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service). To investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter). RESULTS: The results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider. Participants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU. Participants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand. When controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction. The study raises questions for future research about the potential and challenges of remote placebo studies and virtual clinical encounters. The study has been registered as a clinical trial at ISRCTN (record number: 39018).","Kube, Tobias; Hofmann, Verena E; Glombiewski, Julia A; Kirsch, Irving",PLoS One,248,1

Sixteen additional studies have been included in this update. The objective of this report is to identify comparative observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing forward transmission from vaccinated people, and studies examining the biological plausibility of vaccination-induced transmission reduction. MethodA search of databases, MEDLINE, Embase, L-OVE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted to identify RCTs or comparative observational studies evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in the prevention of transmission, asymptomatic infections and transmissibility of COVID-19 among vaccinated persons. An additional search of grey literature was conducted. This search is current to May 4th, 2021. ResultsIn this update, 16 additional studies, including 9 human and 7 animal studies, were included. Therefore, this review examines a total of 33 included studies: 21 human studies and 12 preclinical animal studies. Evidence from two large household surveillance studies from the UK suggests that a single or full dose of AstraZeneca (AZ) and Pfizer-BioNtech (PfBnT) vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination by up to 54%. The AZ vaccine trials in the general population suggest that an initial low dose followed by a standard dose may provide up to 59% protection against asymptomatic or unknown infection, although efficacy against these outcomes was not demonstrated following two standard doses. PfBnT vaccine observational studies in the general population suggest up to 90% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection after seven or more days of full dose vaccination. Up to 75% effectiveness against asymptomatic infection was reported after full- dose in healthcare workers. Across RCTs examining asymptomatic infection in the general population, one dose of Moderna was shown to provide an efficacy of 61.4% against asymptomatic infection 21 days after the first dose; in another trial, the J&J vaccine had an efficacy of 74% 28 days after the first dose. Lastly, seven of eight studies found significantly increased cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load, in PfBnT or AZ vaccinated individuals compared with those who were unvaccinated. ConclusionThe AZ and PfBnT vaccines may prevent household transmission of COVID-19 after 14 days of vaccination. More studies have found the vaccines to significantly reduce the risk of asymptomatic infection and significantly increase cycle threshold, suggestive of lower viral load. Further research is needed to evaluate post-vaccination infectivity and transmission of both the wild type COVID-19 virus and the variants of concern from other jurisdictions.","Egunsola, Oluwaseun; Mastikhina, Liza; Dowsett, Laura; Farkas, Brenlea; Hofmeister, Mark; Saxinger, Lynora; Clement, Fiona",,248,24

Among the 32, 14 (25%) individuals reported mild symptoms and 18 (32.1%) were asymptomatic. It is suggested that mandatory diagnostic testing prior to release and the symptom-based surveillance after the 14-day quarantine may help control delayed or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.","Jung, Jaehun; Jang, Hanaram; Kim, Hye Kyung; Kim, Jieun; Kim, Arim; Ko, Kwang Pil",J Korean Med Sci,248,16

In this piece, we argue that these changes invite researchers to consider the short and longer-term consequences in terms of continuities and changes to the practices and symbolism of alcohol consumption both within and beyond domestic spaces. We do this by drawing on illustrations from our emergent qualitative research involving internet-mediated semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 20 participants from the UK (aged 26-65) concerning experiences of drinking in and beyond 'lockdown'. In sharing these early findings, we hope to highlight themes relevant to understanding drinking behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and to stimulate dialogue for immediate research priorities in this area. Key topic areas in our data appear to concern; variability in heavy/moderate/light/non-drinking practices while drinking at home, lockdown as an opportunity to reassess relationships with alcohol, and the symbolic role of alcohol in internet-mediated communications and interactions. Longstanding policymaker and practitioner concerns with managing public drinking and public order may have been unsettled by a growth in home-based drinking, although, as we argue, such changes were in motion before the global pandemic. We propose that a greater understanding of the challenges and opportunities the pandemic presents for (re)negotiating relationships with alcohol may offer wider lessons around how individuals and communities might be supported via innovative policy measures to change their relationships with alcohol both during and beyond lockdown.","Nicholls, Emily; Conroy, Dominic",Int J Drug Policy,248,33

Two case reports with severe course,16.238043,9.474269,2020,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients present with a hypercoagulable state with high rates of macrovascular and microvascular thrombosis, for which hypofibrinolysis might be an important contributing factor. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital whose coagulation function was tested with ClotPro® and compared with that of 60 healthy individuals at Augsburg University Clinic. ClotPro is a viscoelastic whole blood coagulation testing device. It includes the TPA test, which uses tissue factor (TF)-activated whole blood with added recombinant tissue-derived plasminogen activator (r-tPA) to induce fibrinolysis. For this purpose, the lysis time (LT) is measured as the time from when maximum clot firmness (MCF) is reached until MCF falls by 50%. We compared COVID-19 patients with prolonged LT in the TPA test and those with normal LT. RESULTS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients showed hypercoagulability in ClotPro assays. MCF was higher in the EX test (TF-activated assay), IN test (ellagic acid-activated assay), and FIB test (functional fibrinogen assay) with decreased maximum lysis (ML) in the EX test (hypofibrinolysis) and highly prolonged TPA test LT (decreased fibrinolytic response), as compared with healthy persons. COVID-19 patients with decreased fibrinolytic response showed higher fibrinogen levels, higher thrombocyte count, higher C-reactive protein levels, and decreased ML in the EX test and IN test. CONCLUSION: Critically ill COVID-19 patients have impaired fibrinolysis. This hypofibrinolytic state could be at least partially dependent on a decreased fibrinolytic response.","Bachler, Mirjam; Bösch, Johannes; Stürzel, Daniel P; Hell, Tobias; Giebl, Andreas; Ströhle, Mathias; Klein, Sebastian J; Schäfer, Volker; Lehner, Georg F; Joannidis, Michael; Thomé, Claudius; Fries, Dietmar",Br. j. anaesth,248,15

This paper presents first insights in current and potential future effects of the virus and the Dutch government's ‘intelligent lockdown’ on people's activities and travel behaviour. Findings are based on a representative sample of about 2500 respondents from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN). We show that approximately 80% of people reduced their activities outdoors, with a stronger decrease for older people. 44% of workers started or increased the amount of hours working from home and 30% have more remote meetings. Most of these workers report positive experiences. Students and school pupils, however, are mostly not happy with following education from home. Furthermore, the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55% and 68% respectively when compared to the fall of 2019. So-called ‘roundtrips’ (e.g. a walking or cycling tour) gained in popularity. People are currently more positive towards the car and far more negative towards public transport. Changes in outdoor activities seem to be temporal, with over 90% of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities not expecting to continue this behaviour in the future after corona. However, 27% of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future. In addition, 20% of people expect to cycle and walk more and 20% expect to fly less in the future. These findings show that the coronavirus crisis might result in structural behavioural changes, although future longitudinal analyses are needed to observe these possible structural effects.","de Haas, Mathijs; Faber, Roel; Hamersma, Marije",Transp.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 seen from 3 March to 29 October 2020. We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%). Among all patients, Hispanics (adjusted 1.60, 95% CI (1.08, 2.37)), blacks (1.43 (1.13, 1.83)), age in years (1.03 (1.02, 1.04)) and living in a zip code with high unemployment (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.59 (1.67, 4.02)), chronic heart failure (1.79 (1.31, 2.45)), immunocompromised (1.77 (1.16, 2.70)), with glycated haemoglobin >8% (1.68 (1.19, 2.38)), depression (1.60 (1.24, 2.06)), hypertension (1.5 (1.21, 1.87)) and physical inactivity (1.25 (1.03, 1.51)) had higher odds of hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic KPGA patients were at higher odds of hospitalisation, but not mortality, compared with other race groups. Beyond previously reported sociodemographics and comorbidities, factors such as quality of care, lifestyle behaviours and SDOH indicators should be considered when designing and implementing interventions to reduce COVID-19 racial disparities.","Lobelo, Felipe; Bienvenida, Alan; Leung, Serena; Mbanya, Armand; Leslie, Elizabeth; Koplan, Kate; Shin, Sangmin Ryan",BMJ Open,248,2

Current diagnostic techniques essentially rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which provide the required sensitivity and specificity. However, its relatively long time-to-result, including sample transport to a specialized laboratory, delays massive detection. Rapid lateral flow tests (both antigen and serological tests) are a remarkable alternative for rapid point-of-care diagnostics, but they exhibit critical limitations as they do not always achieve the required sensitivity for reliable diagnostics and surveillance. Next-generation diagnostic tools capable of overcoming all the above limitations are in demand, and optical biosensors are an excellent option to surpass such critical issues. Label-free nanophotonic biosensors offer high sensitivity and operational robustness with an enormous potential for integration in compact autonomous devices to be delivered out-of-the-lab at the point-of-care (POC). Taking the current COVID-19 pandemic as a critical case scenario, we provide an overview of the diagnostic techniques for respiratory viruses and analyze how nanophotonic biosensors can contribute to improving such diagnostics. We review the ongoing published work using this biosensor technology for intact virus detection, nucleic acid detection or serological tests, and the key factors for bringing nanophotonic POC biosensors to accurate and effective COVID-19 diagnosis on the short term.","Soler, Maria; Estevez, Maria Carmen; Cardenosa-Rubio, Maria; Astua, Alejandro; Lechuga, Laura M",ACS Sens,248,12

FXa has also been linked to inflammation via protease-activated receptors. Together, coagulopathy and inflammation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, including the current coronavirus pandemic. Direct FXa inhibitors have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects, in addition to their established anticoagulant activity.

METHODS: All 124 items of the English source PRO-CTCAE item library were translated into Simplified Chinese using internationally established translation procedures. Two rounds of cognitive interviews were conducted with 96 cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment to determine if the translations adequately captured the PRO-CTCAE source concepts, and to evaluate comprehension, clarity and ease of judgement. Interview probes addressed the 78 PRO-CTCAE symptom terms (e.g. fatigue), as well as the attributes (e.g. severity), response choices, and phrasing of 'at its worst'. Items that met the a priori threshold of &#8805;20% of participants with comprehension difficulties were considered for rephrasing and retesting. Items where < 20% of the sample experienced comprehension difficulties were also considered for rephrasing if better phrasing options were available. RESULTS: A majority of PRO-CTCAE-Simplified Chinese items were well comprehended by participants in Round 1. One item posed difficulties in &#8805;20% and was revised. Two items presented difficulties in < 20% but were revised as there were preferred alternative phrasings. Twenty-four items presented difficulties in < 10% of respondents. Of these, eleven items were revised to an alternative preferred phrasing, four items were revised to include synonyms. Revised items were tested in Round 2 and demonstrated satisfactory comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: PRO-CTCAE-Simplified Chinese has been successfully developed and linguistically validated in a sample of cancer patients residing in Singapore.","Kkf, Cheng; Mitchell, S A; Chan, N; Ang, E; Tam, W; Kanesvaran, R",BMC Cancer,248,1

Herein, a novel magnetic adsorbent, DTPA-modiï¬ed chitosan-coated magnetic silica nanoparticle (FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA), was successfully prepared and used to enhance the Pb(II) selective adsorption from multi-metal wastewater based on anion-synergism. In the competitive experiment conducted in a multi-ion solution, the type of selective adsorption of metals was changed by the adsorbents before and after amidation, in which FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA exhibited an excellent selectively for capturing Pb(II), while FFO@Sil@Chi demonstrated highly selective adsorption of silver. More importantly, the selective adsorption of Pb(II)S by FFO@Sil@Chi-DTPA was enhanced from 111.71 to 268.01 mg g-1 when the coexisting MB concentrations ranged from 0 to 100 mg L-1 at pH 6.0. In the Pb(II)-MB binary system, Pb(II) and MB exhibited a synergistic eï¬ect, in which the presence of MB strengthened the adsorption effect of Pb(II) due to the sulfonic acid groups in MB molecules that create new specific sites for Pb(II) adsorption, while MB adsorption was also enhanced by the presence of Pb(II). This work provides a new strategy for exploring novel adsorbents that can enhance the selective removal of heavy metal in complex wastewater based on anion-synergism.","Huang, Yaoyao; Zheng, Huaili; Hu, Xuebin; Wu, Yuyang; Tang, Xiaohui; He, Qiang; Peng, Shangyu",J Hazard Mater,248,18

The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to suppress overactive immune responses as well as bring about tissue regeneration and repair.

So far, the only approved drug for these disorders is the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) falls short of being curative. The efficacy of HU in the management of thalassemia and SCD is generally attributed to its limited ability to boost the levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F,α2?2), which decreases sickling by interfering with the polymerization of hemoglobin in patients with SCD and can partially correct the globin chain imbalance in ?-thalassemia patients, while at the same time facilitating O2 transport to myoglobin in peripheral tissues. The naturally occurring dietary polyphenol resveratrol (trans-3?5'4-trihydroxystilbene, RV), has also been postulated to induce Hb F production via a biochemical mechanism like HU. Preclinical studies using the human erythroleukemic K562 cell line suggested RV can induce Hb F production in a more robust manner than HU. However, clinical studies on the efficacy and effectiveness of RV are limited and conflicting. This study sought to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of RV in managing SCD compared to HU. A systematic literature review was conducted in peer-reviewed, published full-text articles investigating RV in the management of SCD. Eligible studies were required to report explicitly, including participants diagnosed with ?-thalassemia or SCD anemia or cultured cells with the SCD or thalassemia disease and where HU was included as a control. The analysis included thalassemia, RV type, RV dosage, duration of treatment, and outcome, Hb F induction and antioxidant activity. Additionally, a pilot study of RV in the management of adults with SCD who received treatment at National Hospital Abuja, Nigeria, was attempted but discontinued due to the COVID 19 pandemic. A case study of a single 23-year-old female SCD patient who had been taking RV [1000mg daily p.o.] for more than 6 years was included. Outcome variables evaluated include number of hospitalization episodes of pain crisis, need for blood transfusion, possible side effects and RBC indices. The early results of this metanalysis show that RV was as effective as HU in inducing production of Hb F in adult SCD patients and reducing hospital treatment days post RV treatment. Four primary treatment and curative therapies that have shown great potential and are currently used to prevent and treat acute and chronic complications in SCD, HU and blood transfusions, are the most well-established disease-modifying therapies used to prevent and treat complications associated with SCD. Other lesser used therapies include stem cell transplantation or the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and the investigational gene therapy is the only known curative therapy that exists regarding SCD. The results of this study indicate that RV is an effective inducer of Hb F production in adults and shows promise as a cost effective and useful adjunct for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies including SCD and thalassemia.","Nwokorie, Uzoamaka Einstein George Tulp Orien",The FASEB Journal,248,1

Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. METHODS: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with ""off-label"" use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 103 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (86%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%). There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7%), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them ""serious"" (64%), 48 of which proved &#8805; 500ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%). Six reports derived from automedication. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: ""Off-label"" use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable. Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection. Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.","Gérard, Alexandre; Romani, Serena; Fresse, Audrey; Viard, Delphine; Parassol, Nadège; Granvuillemin, Aurélie; Chouchana, Laurent; Rocher, Fanny; Drici, Milou-Daniel",Therapie,248,16

This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of $n$ and $t$ underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position $T_{1/2}^{c}$ obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position $T_{1/2}^{d}$ predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift $\tau \equiv T_{1/2}^{c} - T_{1/2}^{d}<0$ is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate $\kappa$. For a broad range of $\kappa$ values deduced from COVID-19 data at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we found a rather robust estimate $\tau \simeq -2.65\,\mbox{day}^{-1}$. Being obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real system.","Baldea, Ioan",,248,16

Elderly people were isolated and lost the opportunity to attend medical facilities. As a result, many emerging issues are left without due attention. In addition, many older people experience memory problems.

COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is thought to spread via close contact through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Owing to specific characteristics of dental care such as aerosol generation as well as close proximity to patients, dentistry is thought to be associated with the nosocomial spread of infection. The risk of bidirectional spread of infection between patient and dental care providers makes it critical to take additional precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. It is essential to understand that the guidelines for providing dental treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic will vary across the globe, and dental practices should be in compliance with their regional guidelines. This chapter aims to present an overview of the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission and its impact on dentistry and discuss measures to provide dental care during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak effectively.","Tonkaboni, Arghavan; Amirzade-Iranaq, Mohammad Hosein; Ziaei, Heliya; Ather, Amber",Adv Exp Med Biol,248,6

There is thus a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies to provide more broad and long-lasting protection. By using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we developed Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing Spike-1, Nucleocapsid and RdRp antigens and evaluated them following single-dose intramuscular or intranasal immunization in murine models. We show that respiratory mucosal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the three-arm immunity, consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells, and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that single-dose intranasal immunization provides robust protection against not only the ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, but also two emerging VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that single-dose respiratory mucosal delivery of an Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy against current and future VOC. This strategy has great potential to be used not only to boost first-generation vaccine-induced immunity but also to expand the breadth of protective T cell immunity at the respiratory mucosa.","Afkhami, Sam; Zhang, Ali; Stacey, Hannah D.; Marzok, Art; Kang, Alisha; Singh, Ramandeep; Bavananthasivam, Jegarubee; Ye, Gluke; Luo, Xiangqian; Wang, Fuan; Ang, Jann C.; Zganiacz, Anna; Sankar, Uma; Kazhdan, Natallia; Koenig, Joshua F.E.; Phelps, Allyssa; Jordana, Manel; Wan, Yonghong; Mossman, Karen L.; Jeyanathan, Mangalakumari; Gillgrass, Amy; Medina, Maria Fe C.; Smaill, Fiona; Lichty, Brian D.; Miller, Matthew S.; Xing, Zhou",,248,26

The CNN architecture that was used is called DenseNet121 and the optimization algorithm that was used is called the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The GSA is adapted to determine the best values for the hyperparameters of the DenseNet121 architecture, and to achieve a high level of accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 disease through chest x-ray image analysis. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was able to correctly classify 98% of the test set. To test the efficacy of the GSA in setting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of DenseNet121, it was compared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver (SSD). The comparison results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 and its ability to better diagnose COVID-19 disease than the SSD-DenseNet121 as the second was able to diagnose only 94% of the test set.

Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection. By contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals on days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.","Kumari, Pratima; Rothan, Hussin A; Natekar, Janhavi P; Stone, Shannon; Pathak, Heather; Strate, Philip G; Arora, Komal; Brinton, Margo A; Kumar, Mukesh",Viruses,248,14

Protective ventilation strategies, by decreasing ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), have reduced mortality in patients with ARDS. However, the role of respiratory rate (RR), a central determinant of the energy applied to the lung parenchyma remains uncertain. Objective: To evaluate the role of respiratory rate on systemic pro-inflammatory mediators, as markers of VILI, in patients with Covid-19-associated ARDS (CARDS) Methods: Prospective, randomized crossover trial in patients with CARDS, PaO2:FIO2 ratio less than 200 mmHg, and requiring deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade. All patients were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg IBW, and PEEP and FiO2 according to the ARDSNet table. If PaO2:FIO2 ratio was less than 150 mmHg, patients were positioned in the prone position.Two 12 hours periods with a low RR and a high RR, randomly selected, was conducted. Low RR and high RR periods were set to obtain an 8-10 breaths/min difference between groups while maintaining pH and PaCO2 within recommended limits. I:E ratio was held constant during the study.Hemodynamic and respiratory mechanics were registered, and arterial blood samples drawn for gas exchange and quantification of inflammatory biomarkers at baseline and repeated at 12 and 24 hours. Results: We enrolled 11 patients (10 males, median age 54 [51-66] years, PaO2:FIO2 108 [86-132]), and all of them were in prone position. The low RR (20 [16-23]) vs the high RR (28 [26-32]) was associated with a significantly lower energy applied to the lung (16 [12-19] vs 23 [20-32] J / min, respectively). PaCO2 and pH were kept within the recommended limits (pH 7.30 [7.25-7.35] vs 7.46 [7.43-7.50];PaCO2 48 (45-63) vs 36 (32-38) mmHg for low and high RR, respectively). There were no significant changes in any of the respiratory mechanics parameters.The change in RR did not induce differences in any inflammatory marker (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-R1) or in the markers of epithelial (receptor for advanced glycation end products, s-RAGE;Surfactant protein D, SP-D), endothelial damage (Angiopoietin-2) or the marker of profibrotic activity (transforming growth factor β, TGF-β) (table 1). Conclusion: These preliminary results reveal that a decrease in respiratory rate, tolerating moderate hypercapnia, does not modify the biomarkers of lung damage compared to a strategy of high respiratory rate in patients with CARDS.","Damiani, F.; Oviedo, V.; Alegría, L.; Basoalto, R.; Bachmann, M.; Jalil, Y.; Bruhn, A.; Retamal Montes, J.

However, many scientists disagree, and it is essential to understand that several factors and variables can cause a false-negative test. In this context, cycle threshold (Ct) values are being utilized to diagnose or predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. This practice has a significant clinical utility as Ct values can be correlated with the viral load. In addition, Ct values have a strong correlation with multiple haematological and biochemical markers. However, it is essential to consider that Ct values might be affected by pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytical variables such as collection technique, specimen type, sampling time, viral kinetics, transport and storage conditions, nucleic acid extraction, viral RNA load, primer designing, real-time PCR efficiency, and Ct value determination method. Therefore, understanding the interpretation of Ct values and other influential factors could play a crucial role in interpreting viral load and disease severity. In several clinical studies consisting of small or large sample sizes, several discrepancies exist regarding a significant positive correlation between the Ct value and disease severity in COVID-19. In this context, a revised review of the literature has been conducted to fill the knowledge gaps regarding the correlations between Ct values and severity/fatality rates of patients with COVID-19. Various databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched up to April 2021 by using keywords including “RT-PCR or viral load”, “SARS-CoV-2 and RT-PCR”, “Ct value and viral load”, “Ct value or COVID-19”. Research articles were extracted and selected independently by the authors and included in the present review based on their relevance to the study.

Free flap and VTE thromboprophylaxis may coincide but tend to vary from surgeon to surgeon. This study identifies VTE prophylaxis patterns and perceptions among H&N microsurgeons in the United States. METHODS: An online survey on VTE prophylaxis practice patterns and perceptions was emailed to 172 H&N microsurgeons in the United States using an anonymous link. RESULTS: There were 74 respondents (43% response rate). These surgeons completed residencies in otolaryngology (59%), plastic surgery (31%), and oral maxillofacial surgery (7%). Most underwent fellowship training (95%) and have practiced at an academic center (97%) for at least 6 years (58%), performing an average of 42 ± 31 H&N free flap cases per year (range = 1-190). Most adhered to general VTE prophylaxis guidelines (69%) while 11% did not and 20% were unsure. Nearly all surgeons (99%) would provide prophylactic anticoagulation, mostly in the form of subcutaneous heparin (51%) or enoxaparin (44%); 64% additionally used aspirin, while 4% used aspirin alone. The majority of surgeons (68%) reported having postoperative VTE complications, with six surgeons (8%) reporting patient deaths due to pulmonary embolism. A third of the surgeons have encountered VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events, but most still believe that chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention (92%). While 35% of surgeons were satisfied with their current practice, most would find it helpful to have official prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines specific to H&N free flap cases. CONCLUSION: The majority of microsurgeons experienced postoperative VTE complications after H&N free flap reconstruction despite the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Though bleeding events are a concern, most surgeons believe chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention and would welcome official guidelines specific to this high-risk population.","Venkatesh, Kaushik P; Ambani, Shoshana W; Arakelians, Aris R L; Johnson, Jonas T; Solari, Mario G",J. reconstr. microsurg,248,16

The complication rates did not show statistical differences between the two groups within the first 30 days postoperatively (P=0.263). For the long-term complications, the incidence of abdomen bulge or incisional hernia in the CRT group was less than that in the standard group (P<0.001). Conclusion: The CRT technique, which combines both the advantages of retroperitoneal and transperitoneal approaches, is a more minimally invasive, simplified and effective way to perform the LNU.","Song, Liming; Wang, Wenkuan; Zhao, Qinxin; Wen, Yuhong; Zhou, Xiaoguang; Han, Hu; Zhang, Xiaodong",Cancer Manag Res,248,10

One-quarter of this decline is causally attributable to SHOs, with wide demographic differences in compliance, most notably by political affiliation. Likely Trump voters reduce movement by 9% following a local SHO, compared to a 21% reduction among their Clinton-voting neighbors, who face similar exposure risks and identical government orders.

As the department that is responsible for emergency medicine teaching, we adapted the program to continue the courses and maintain the learning progress. Our objective is to evaluate the number of courses conducted and report the methods used. Methods: Teaching was measured as credit hours per week (CHW) in accordance with the university's prospectus. One CHW represents 15 academic hours (45 min) in one semester. Webinars were conducted using the CISCO Webex Events®, Webex Training, and ZOOM®. The Moodle® was utilized for resuscitation courses. Results: Courses and clerkships equivalent to 80.2 out of 101.4 CHW (79.1%) could be held during the ongoing crisis in the summer semester. Courses in the winter semester were all completed. In the human medicine curriculum, 73.7 out of 94.9 CHW (77.7%) could be conducted. In the case of emergency lectures for the dentistry curriculum, all courses were conducted through webinars (6.5 CHW, 100%). After calculating the exact number of students in each class, it has been determined that courses and clerkships equivalent to 78.7% could be conducted. Conclusion: Despite the challenge of preparing for the treatment of numerous patients during the ongoing pandemic, we could shoulder a majority of our teaching responsibilities. Although sufficient skill training could not be imparted under these circumstances, we could provide sufficient theoretical knowledge to allow students to continue studies.","Mueller, Matthias; Schriefl, Christoph; Holzer, Michael; Roeggla, Martin; Laggner, Anton N; Ettl, Florian",Front Public Health,248,13

The reported prevalence of neonatal ankyloglossia varies between less than 1 and 12.1% depending upon the study population and criteria used to define and grade ankyloglossia. Our hypothesis was that ankyloglossia had a higher prevalence among our newborn population than previously reported. We conducted an observational, transversal cross-sectional study which included all neonates born in our center between January 1 and December 31, 2018, and actively assessed for tongue-tie. We considered ""clinically significant"" or ""symptomatic"" ankyloglossia using the Hazelbaker tool for appearance and function when the mother experienced nipple pain or bruises, or when the neonate had difficulty latching onto the breast. A total of 1392 neonates were born at our center in 2018. Tongue-tie was identified in 645 infants (46.3%), of which 453 were symptomatic (70.2%). Thus, clinically significant ankyloglossia was present in 32.5% of the neonates born in 2018. Their distribution according to Coryllos's types were as follows: 45 type 1 (7.0%), 230 type 2 (35.6%), 321 type 3 (49.8%), and 42 type 4 (6.5%).Conclusion: The prevalence of symptomatic ankyloglossia in our population is higher (32.5%) than studies have reported to date. Actively assessing for tongue-tie increases its diagnosis. What is Known: â¢ There are four types of tongue-tie according to Coryllos (1, 2, 3, and 4), of which the two anterior types (1 and 2) are the most apparent and easy to diagnose. â¢ The reported prevalence of ankyloglossia generally varies from < 1 to 12.1%, although some recent studies report a higher prevalence.

Production of proinflammatory neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been suggested to be a key factor in inducing a hyperinflammatory signaling cascade, allegedly causing both pulmonary tissue damage and peripheral inflammation. Accordingly, therapeutic blockage of neutrophil activation and NETosis, the cell death pathway accompanying NET formation, could limit respiratory damage and death from severe COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycopolymers that activate signaling of the neutrophil checkpoint receptor Siglec-9 suppress NETosis induced by agonists of viral toll-like receptors (TLRs) and plasma from patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, Siglec-9 agonism is a promising therapeutic strategy to curb neutrophilic hyperinflammation in COVID-19. ©","Delaveris, C. S.; Wilk, A. J.; Riley, N. M.; Stark, J. C.; Yang, S. S.; Rogers, A.

In total, the country has more than 19.2 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, including over 533,509 fatalities. A set of emerging variants arose in the country, some of them posing new challenges for COVID-19 control. The goal of this study was to describe mutational events across samples from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sequences openly publicly obtainable on the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data-EpiCoV (GISAID-EpiCoV) platform and generate an index of new mutant by each genome. A total of 16,953 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained and are not proportionally representative of the five Brazilian geographical regions. A comparative sequence analysis was conducted to identify common mutations located at 42 positions of the genome (38 were in coding regions whereas two in 5 and two in 3 UTR). Moreover, 11 were synonymous and 27 missense variants, and more than 44.4% were located in the spike gene. Across the total of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified, 32 were found in genomes obtained from all five Brazilian regions. While a high genomic diversity is reported in Europe given the large number of sequenced genomes, Africa is emerging as a hotspot for new variants. In South America, Brazil and Chile, rates are similar to those found in South Africa and India, giving enough space to generate new viral mutations. Genomic surveillance is the central key to identifying the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and has shown that the country is one of the ""hotspots"" in the generation of new variants.","Souza, Ueric Jose Borges de; Santos, Raissa Nunes dos; Campos, Fabricio Souza; Lourenco, Karina Lima; Fonseca, Flavio Guimaraes da; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Network, - Corona-omica.BR MCTI",,248,1

Overall, children appear to be less frequently infected by, and affected by, SARS-CoV-2 virus and the clinical disease COVID-19. Large epidemiological studies have revealed children represent less than 2% of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom the majority experience minimal or mild disease that do not require hospitalisation. Children do not appear to be major drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with minimal secondary virus transmission demonstrated within families, schools and community settings. There are several postulated theories regarding the relatively low SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality seen in children, which largely relate to differences in immune responses compared to adults, as well as differences in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 distribution that potentially limits viral entry and subsequent inflammation, hypoxia and tissue injury. The recent emergence of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome bearing temporal and serological plausibility for an immune-mediated SARS-CoV-2-related disease entity is currently under investigation. This article summarises the current available data regarding SARS-CoV-2 and the paediatric population, including the spectrum of disease in children, the role of children in virus transmission, and host-virus factors that underpin the unique aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in children.","Williams, Phoebe C M; Howard-Jones, Annaleise R; Hsu, Peter; Palasanthiran, Pamela; Gray, Paul E; McMullan, Brendan J; Britton, Philip N; Bartlett, Adam W",Pathology,248,7

In this study, we developed a paper device integrated with power-free DNA detection strategy realized by polydopamine aggregation. In the presence of DNA amplicons, the polymerization of dopamine into aggregated polydopamine was hindered, while in the absence of DNA amplicons, polydopamine aggregation is facilitated. The porosity of the paper enabled the capillary flow of dispersed polydopamine for positive sample, while aggregated polydopamine remained at the bottom of the paper strip due to large size of the aggregates for negative sample. Based on this mechanism, we fabricated a slidable paper device integrating LAMP with dopamine polymerization for the naked-eye detection, operated in a seamless manner.

The fusion peptide region of the S protein S2 domain provides SARS-CoV-2 with the biological machinery needed for direct fusion to the host lipid membrane. In our present study, computer-aided drug design strategies were used for the identification of FDA-approved small molecules using the optimal structure of the S2 domain, which exhibits optimal interaction ratios, structural features, and energy variables, which were evaluated based on their performances in molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized Born model and solvent accessibility binding free energy calculations of molecular dynamics trajectories, and statistical inferences. Among the 2,625 FDA-approved small molecules, chloramphenicol succinate, imipenem, and imidurea turned out to be the molecules that bound the best at the fusion peptide hydrophobic pocket. The principal interactions of the selected molecules suggest that the potential binding site at the fusion peptide region is centralized amid the Lys790, Thr791, Lys795, Asp808, and Gln872 residues.IMPORTANCE The present study provides the structural identification of the viable binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 S2 fusion peptide region, which holds prime importance in the virus's host cell fusion and entry mechanism. The classical molecular mechanics simulations were set on values that mimic physiological standards for a good approximation of the dynamic behavior of selected drugs in biological systems. The drug molecules screened and analyzed here have relevant antiviral properties, which are reported here and which might hint toward their utilization in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic owing to their attributes of binding to the fusion protein binding region shown in this study.","Shekhar, Nishant; Sarma, Phulen; Prajapat, Manisha; Avti, Pramod; Kaur, Hardeep; Raja, Anupam; Singh, Harvinder; Bhattacharya, Anusuya; Sharma, Saurabh; Kumar, Subodh; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",,248,6

METHODS: We performed routine laboratory tests suitable to identify tissue damage and inflammatory status in 123 consecutive CoVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the hospital of Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy). The results were correlated with patients' respiratory function evaluated by the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2). RESULTS: The most common laboratory abnormalities were lymphocytopenia and elevated values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) were also increased. The respiratory performance (PaO2/FiO2) showed a strong inverse correlation with LDH (r = 0.62, r2 0.38, p value < 0.0001) and CRP (r = 0.55, r2 0.31, p value < 0.0001). PaO2/FiO2 values also showed a significant inverse correlation with age (r = -0.37, p < 0.0001), AST (r = -0.31, p < 0.01), WBC (r = -0.49, p < 0.0001), neutrophils count (r = -0.5, p < 0.001). ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the CRP cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: LDH and CRP may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of respiratory failure in CoVID-19 patients. LDH and CRP should be considered a useful test for the early identification of patients who require closer respiratory monitoring and more aggressive supportive therapies to avoid poor prognosis.","Poggiali, Erika; Zaino, Domenica; Immovilli, Paolo; Rovero, Luca; Losi, Giulia; Dacrema, Alessandro; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Vadacca, Giovanni Battista; Guidetti, Donata; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea; Bernardini, Sergio; Terracciano, Chiara",Clin Chim Acta,248,16

Training activities, conferences, lectures, face-to-face workshops were suspended until the Health Situation was over. Alternatives to face-to-face training were needed to guarantee the continuity of these activities. Online training, teaching and evaluation emerged as a relatively fast, simple, operational and flexible solution. Universities and faculties promoted online teaching through virtual classes. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy supported this initiative by signing an agreement with the Board of Deans and Chancellors of Pharmacy to make it possible for undergraduate students to continue their studies and supervised practices in hospital pharmacy departments. Specialized training was affected. Pharmacy residency programs were significantly modified by hospital pharmacies to be able to provide the new clinical and research activities required, everyday, by the pandemic situation. Postgraduate and residency training were also negatively affected. Again, online activities made up for restrictions to face-to-face teaching and training.

The goal of this study was to predict the potential of 25 small molecule drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 to cause clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which could lead to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with the use of concomitant medications. We focused on 11 transporters, which are targets for DDIs. In vitro potency studies in membrane vesicles or HEK293 cells expressing the transporters coupled with DDI risk assessment methods revealed that 20 of the 25 drugs met the criteria from regulatory authorities to trigger consideration of a DDI clinical trial. Analyses of real-world data from electronic health records, including a database representing nearly 120,000 patients with COVID-19, were consistent with several of the drugs causing transporter-mediated DDIs (e.g., sildenafil, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine). This study suggests that patients with COVID-19, who are often older and on various concomitant medications, should be carefully monitored for ADRs. Future clinical studies are needed to determine whether the drugs that are predicted to inhibit transporters at clinically relevant concentrations, actually result in DDIs.","Yee, Sook Wah; Vora, Bianca; Oskotsky, Tomiko; Zou, Ling; Jakobsen, Sebastian; Enogieru, Osatohanmwen J; Koleske, Megan L; Kosti, Idit; Rödin, Mattias; Sirota, Marina; Giacomini, Kathleen M",Clin Pharmacol Ther,248,13

These tests, called FKWC tests, are based on functional data depth ranks. These tests work well even when the data is heavy tailed, which is shown both in simulation and theoretically. These tests offer several other benefits, they have a simple distribution under the null hypothesis, they are computationally cheap and they possess transformation invariance properties. We show that under general alternative hypotheses these tests are consistent under mild, nonparametric assumptions. As a result of this work, we introduce a new functional depth function called L2-root depth which works well for the purposes of detecting differences in magnitude between covariance kernels. We present an analysis of the FKWC test using L2-root depth under local alternatives. In simulation, when the true covariance kernels have strictly positive eigenvalues, we show that these tests have higher power than their competitors, while still maintaining their nominal size.

Novel antiviral therapies are urgently needed to overcome this pandemic. Given the significant role of the main protease of Covid-19 for virus replication, we performed a drug-repurposing study using the recently deposited main protease structure, 6LU7. For instance, pharmacophore- and e-pharmacophore-based hypotheses such as AARRH and AARR, respectively, were developed using available small molecule inhibitors and utilized in the screening of the DrugBank repository. Further, a hierarchical docking protocol was implemented with the support of the Glide algorithm. The resultant compounds were then examined for their binding free energy against the main protease of Covid-19 by means of the Prime-MM/GBSA algorithm. Most importantly, the machine learning-based AutoQSAR algorithm was used to predict the antiviral activities of resultant compounds. The hit molecules were also examined for their drug-likeness and toxicity parameters through the QikProp algorithm. Finally, the hit compounds activity against the main protease was validated using molecular dynamics simulation studies. Overall, the present analysis yielded two potential inhibitors (DB02986 and DB08573) that are predicted to bind with the main protease of Covid-19 better than currently used drug molecules such as N3 (cocrystallized native ligand), lopinavir, and ritonavir.","T, Muthu Kumar; K, Rohini; James, Nivya; V, Shanthi; K, Ramanathan",Biotechnol. appl. biochem,248,25

The increase in daily confirmed cases accelerated significantly from ~ 5 additional new cases (ANC)/day during early March up to ~ 249 ANC/day during early June. An abrupt change in this temporal pattern was noticed during mid-April, from which can be inferred a much reduced impact of the nationwide lockdown in India. Daily maximum (T Max), minimum (T Min), mean (T Mean) and dew point temperature (T Dew), wind speed (WS), relative humidity, and diurnal range in temperature and relative humidity during March 01 to June 04, 2020 over 9 major affected cities are analyzed to look into the impact of daily weather on COVID-19 infections on that day and 7, 10, 12, 14, 16 days before those cases were detected (i.e., on the likely transmission days). Spearman’s correlation exhibits significantly lower association with WS, T Max, T Min, T Mean, T Dew, but is comparatively better with a lag of 14 days. Support Vector regression successfully estimated the count of confirmed cases (R 2&gt; 0.8) at a lag of 12–16 days, thus reflecting a probable incubation period of 14 ± 02 days in India. Approximately 75% of total cases were registered when T Max, T Mean, T Min, T Dew, and WS at 12–16 days previously were varying within the range of 33.6–41.3 °C, 29.8–36.5 °C, 24.8–30.4 °C, 18.7–23.6 °C, and 4.2–5.75 m/s, respectively. Thus, we conclude that coronavirus transmission is not well correlated (linearly) with any individual weather parameter; rather, transmission is susceptible to a certain weather pattern.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. Methods: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals' websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger's regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. Results: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","Khan, Md Mostaured Ali; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman; Mustagir, Md Golam; Rana, Juwel; Islam, Md Saiful; Kabir, Md Iqbal",J Glob Health,248,0

The plant kingdom has demonstrated to be an important source of new molecules with antiviral potential. Purpose The present study aims to utilize various computational tools to identify the most eligible drug candidate that have capabilities to halt the replication of SARS-COV-2 virus by inhibiting Main protease (Mpro) enzyme Methods We have selected plants whose extracts have inhibitory potential against previously discovered coronaviruses. Their phytoconstituents were surveyed and a library of 100 molecules was prepared. Then, computational tools such as molecular docking, ADMET and molecular dynamic simulations were utilized to screen the compounds and evaluate them against Mpro enzyme. Results All the phytoconstituents showed good binding affinities towards Mpro enzyme. Among them laurolitsine possesses the highest binding affinity i.e. -294.1533 kcal/mol. On ADMET analysis of best three ligands were simulated for 1.2 ns, then the stable ligand among them was further simulated for 20 ns. Results revealed that no conformational changes were observed in the laurolitsine w.r.t. protein residues and low RMSD value suggested that the Laurolitsine-protein complex was stable for 20ns. Conclusion Laurolitsine, an active constituent of roots of Lindera aggregata, was found to be having good ADMET profile and have capabilities to halt the activity of the enzyme. Therefore, this makes laurolitsine a good drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.","Kumar, Nitish Singh Atamjit Gulati Harmandeep Kaur Bhagat Kavita Kaur Komalpreet Kaur Jaspreet dudhal Shilpa Duggal Amit Gulati Puja Singh Harbinder Singh Jatinder Vir Bedi Preet Mohinder Singh",Phytomedicine Plus,248,1

METHOD: All patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed within 10 days of symptom onset between March 1st and April 15th 2020 were retrospectively identified from two tertiary care hospitals. 12 CT features, their distribution in the lung and the global extent of opacifications were evaluated. For analysis of prognosis two compound outcomes were defined: positive outcome was defined as either discharge or regular ward care; negative outcome was defined as need for mechanical ventilation, treatment on intensive care unit, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or death. Follow-up was performed until June 19th. For statistical analysis uni- und multivariable logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: 64 patients were included in the study. By univariable analysis the following parameters predicted a negative outcome: consolidation (pâ¯=â¯0.034), crazy paving (pâ¯=â¯0.004), geographic shape of opacification (pâ¯=â¯0.022), dilatation of bronchi (pâ¯=â¯0.002), air bronchogram (pâ¯=â¯0.013), vessel enlargement (pâ¯=â¯0.014), pleural effusion (pâ¯=â¯0.05), bilateral disease (pâ¯=â¯0.004), involvement of the upper lobes (pâ¯=â¯0.004, pâ¯=â¯0.015) or the right middle lobe (pâ¯<â¯0.001) and severe extent of opacifications (pâ¯=â¯0.002). Multivariable analysis revealed crazy paving and severe extent of parenchymal involvement to be independently predictive for a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Easy to assess CT features in the early phase of disease independently predicted an adverse outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Meiler, Stefanie; Schaible, Jan; Poschenrieder, Florian; Scharf, Gregor; Zeman, Florian; Rennert, Janine; Pregler, Benedikt; Kleine, Henning; Stroszczynski, Christian; Zorger, Niels; Hamer, Okka W",Eur J Radiol,248,20

As a concept for responding to such disruption, organizational resilience has recently received great attention. In the organizational context, the overriding question is how companies can become more resilient. This study aims to contribute to answering this question by identifying, categorizing, and providing specific business model patterns for achieving resilience on the corporate level. For this purpose, a review of publications by major consulting firms was conducted. Patterns were extracted from publications until a convergence criterion indicated that no new pattern could be identified considering further publications. The 110 extracted unique patterns were clustered into 13 objectives, and additionally categorized according to resilience phases, as well as business model elements, to support the application in practice. The final catalog of patterns was validated through expert interviews and thus provides organizations, such as those in the electrical industry, with an overview and specific approaches on how to tackle industrial resilience through the adaption of their business model.","Neumann, Konstantin van Erp Tim Steinhöfel Erik Sieckmann Felix Kohl Holger",Sustainability,248,6

Therefore, it is clear that the food industry needs to know the perceptions of sensory attributes to know the acceptability of a product. There exist procedures that systematically allows measurement of these property perceptions that are performed by professional panels. However, systematic evaluations of attributes by these tasting panels, which avoid the subjective character for an individual taster, have a high economic, temporal and organizational cost. The process is only applied in a sampled way so that its result cannot be used on a sound and complete quality system. In this paper, we present a method that allows making use of a non-destructive measurement of physical-chemical properties of the target product to obtain an estimation of the sensory description given by QDA-based procedure. More concisely, we propose that through Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), we will obtain a reliable prediction that will relate the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of a complete set of cheese samples with a complete image of the sensory attributes that describe taste, texture, aspect, smell and other relevant sensations.","Curto, Belén; Moreno, Vidal; García-Esteban, Juan Alberto; Blanco, Francisco Javier; González, Inmaculada; Vivar, Ana; Revilla, Isabel",,248,6

Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 originated through pangolin-coronavirus (Pan-CoVs) from the SARS-CoV-related-bat-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs) rather than from SARS-CoV-2-related-bat-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs), in contrast to the previous thought. Further, our analyses strongly suggest that the Pan-CoVs evolved from the SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs without recombination. Further, our results suggest that the SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs perhaps jumped into the pangolin, which forced the viruses to mutate and adapt to the new host, and resulted in the origin of Pan-CoVs. Surprisingly, the Pan-CoVs formed an evolutionary intermediate between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs at the spike gene. Our findings also suggest that the Pan-CoV/GX and Pan-CoV/Guangdong lineages recombined to form the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene. We also found evidence that the SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoVs spike gene evolved via recombination between Pan-CoV/Guangdong and SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs. Overall, our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 emerged from SARS-CoV-1-rB-CoVs through host jumping.","Desingu, Perumal Arumugam; Nagarajan, K.",,248,16

In this context, the air quality changes in the highly populated and trafficked Brazilian states of São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) were addressed using a combination of satellite and ground-based daily data analysis. We explored nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) daily levels for the month of May from 2015–2020. Daily measurements of NO2 column concentrations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard NASA’s Aura satellite were analyzed and decreases of 42% and 49.6% were found for SP and RJ, respectively, during the year 2020 compared to the 2015–2019 average. Besides NO2 column retrievals, ground-based data measured by the Brazilian States Environmental Institutions were analyzed and correlated with satellite retrievals. Correlation coefficients between year-to-year changes in satellite column and ground-based concentrations were 77% and 53% in SP and RJ, respectively. Ground-based data showed 13.3% and 18.8% decrease in NO2 levels for SP and RJ, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. In SP, no significant change in PM2.5 was observed in 2020 compared to 2019. To further isolate the effect of emissions reduction due to the lockdown, meteorological data and number of wildfire hotspots were analyzed. NO2 concentrations showed negative and positive correlations with wind speed and temperature, respectively. PM2.5 concentration distributions suggested an influence by the wildfires in the southeast region of the country. Synergistic analyses of satellite retrievals, surface level concentrations, and weather data provide a more complete picture of changes to pollutant levels.","Brandao, Rayssa Foroutan Hosein",Atmosphere,248,29

Veritably, we see that the pandemic may even be an excuse for pushing through already-aspired to policies. This includes the securitised agenda behind the sudden building of a border fence to close off Zimbabwe and the xenophobic-rhetorical clout behind the lockdown rules about which shops are allowed to remain open.

This article proposes a fast and accurate method, TVMAGI (Time-Varying MAnifold-constrained Gaussian process Inference), to estimate both time-constant and time-varying parameters in the ODE using noisy and sparse observation data. TVMAGI imposes a Gaussian process model over the time series of system components as well as time-varying parameters, and restricts the derivative process to satisfy ODE conditions. Consequently, TVMAGI completely bypasses numerical integration and achieves substantial savings in computation time. By incorporating the ODE structures through manifold constraints, TVMAGI enjoys a principled statistical construction under the Bayesian paradigm, which further enables it to handle systems with missing data or unobserved components. The Gaussian process prior also alleviates the identifiability issue often associated with the time-varying parameters in ODE. Unlike existing approaches, TVMAGI assumes no specific linearity of the ODE structure, and can be applied to general nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our method through three simulation examples, including an infectious disease compartmental model.","Sun, Yan; Yang, Shihao",,248,16

Unadjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing study/control period for the number of admissions/ procedures were calculated through Poisson regression. Case fatality rate (%) for cardiovascular diseases in the examined periods was assessed Results: 5908 patients were hospitalized in the first quarter of 2020 (52.9% women mean age 59.2±24.9 years, 64.9 mean daily admissions). In the same period in 2019, 6852 patients were hospitalized (51.8% women, mean age 60.1±24.6 years;76.1 mean daily admissions).

SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) was used to virtually screen 1697 clinical FDA-approved drugs. Among the top results expected to bind with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro strongly were three cell protectives and antioxidants (NAD+, quercitrin, and oxiglutatione), three antivirals (ritonavir, moroxydine, and zanamivir), two antimicrobials (doripenem and sulfaguanidine), two anticancer drugs, three benzimidazole anthelmintics, one antacid (famotidine), three anti-hypertensive ACE receptor blockers (candesartan, losartan, and valsartan) and other miscellaneous systemically or topically acting drugs. The binding patterns of these drugs were superior to the previously identified SARS CoV PLpro inhibitor, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), suggesting a potential for repurposing these drugs to treat COVID-19. The objective of drug repurposing is the rapid relocation of safe and approved drugs by bypassing the lengthy pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and preclinical phases. The ten drugs with the highest estimated docking scores with favorable pharmacokinetics were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations. Phenformin, quercetin, and ritonavir all demonstrated prospective binding affinities for COVID-19 PLpro over 50 ns MD simulations, with binding energy values of -56.6, -40.9, and -37.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Energetic and structural analyses showed phenformin was more stable than quercetin and ritonavir. The list of the drugs provided herein constitutes a primer for clinical application in COVID-19 patients and guidance for further antiviral studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

DESIGN: Observational cohort study of patients admitted from March 6, 2020, to April 17, 2020. SETTING: Six coronavirus disease 2019 designated ICUs at three hospitals within an academic health center network in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. PATIENTS: Adults greater than or equal to 18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 disease who were admitted to an ICU during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 217 critically ill patients, mortality for those who required mechanical ventilation was 35.7% (59/165), with 4.8% of patients (8/165) still on the ventilator at the time of this report. Overall mortality to date in this critically ill cohort is 30.9% (67/217) and 60.4% (131/217) patients have survived to hospital discharge. Mortality was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, chronic renal disease, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, higher D-dimer, higher C-reactive protein, and receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, or vasodilator therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite multiple reports of mortality rates exceeding 50% among critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, our early experience indicates that many patients survive their critical illness.","Auld, Sara C; Caridi-Scheible, Mark; Blum, James M; Robichaux, Chad; Kraft, Colleen; Jacob, Jesse T; Jabaley, Craig S; Carpenter, David; Kaplow, Roberta; Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Adelman, Max W; Martin, Greg S; Coopersmith, Craig M; Murphy, David J",Crit Care Med,248,16

The enzyme that carries out the process of transcription of mRNAs is RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is a multi-subunit enzyme in eukaryotes. This protein biopolymer starts the transcription from specific sites and is positioned by transcription factors, which form a preinitiation complex (PIC) on gene promoters. To recognize and position the RNAPII and the transcription factors on the gene promoters are needed specific DNA sequences in the gene promoters, which are named promoter elements. Those gene promoter elements can vary and therefore several kinds of promoters exist, however, it appears that all promoters can use a similar pathway for PIC formation. Those pathways are discussed in this review. The in vitro transcribed mRNA can be used as vaccines to fight infectious diseases, e.g., in immunotherapy against cancer and in nanotechnology to deliver mRNA for a missing protein into the cell. We have outlined a procedure to produce an mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the causing agent of the big pandemic, COVID-19, affecting human beings all over the world. The potential advantages of using eukaryotic RNAPII to synthetize large transcripts are outlined and discussed. In addition, we suggest a method to cap the mRNA at the 5' terminus by using enzymes, which might be more effective than cap analogs. Finally, we suggest the construction of a future multi-talented RNAPII, which would be able to synthetize large mRNA and cap them in the test tube.","Urbina, Fabiola; Morales-Pison, Sebastián; Maldonado, Edio",Polym.,248,1

Objective: Managing existential terror calls for being mature about mortality, something with which palliative care providers are familiar and in need of greater understanding. Methods: Using a case to illustrate, we describe existential terror, terror management, and existential maturity and go on to outline how existential maturity is important for not only the dying and the grieving but for also those facing risk of acquiring COVID-19. Results: Next, we describe how essential components in attaining existential maturity come together. (1) Because people experience absent attachment to important people as very similar to dying, attending to those experiences of relationship is essential. (2) That entails an internal working through of important relationships, knowing their incompleteness, until able to ""hold them inside,"" and invest in these and other connections. (3) And what allows that is making a meaningful connection with someone around the experience of absence or death. (4) We also describe the crucial nature of a holding environment in which all of these can wobble into place. Discussion: Finally, we consider how fostering existential maturity would help populations face up to the diverse challenges that the pandemic brings up for people everywhere.","Emanuel, Linda; Solomon, Sheldon; Fitchett, George; Chochinov, Harvey; Handzo, George; Schoppee, Tasha; Wilkie, Diana",J. palliat. med,248,4

Numerous genetic and environmental risk factors have been suggested to contribute to the development of ASD. However, no one factor can adequately explain either the frequency of the disorder or the male bias in its prevalence. Gonadal, thyroid, and glucocorticoid hormones all contribute to normal development of the brain, hence perturbations in either their patterns of secretion or their actions may constitute risk factors for ASD. Environmental factors may contribute to ASD etiology by influencing the development of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems during early life. Emerging evidence suggests that the placenta may be particularly important as a mediator of the actions of environmental and endocrine risk factors on the developing brain, with the male being particularly sensitive to these effects. Understanding how various risk factors integrate to influence neural development may facilitate a clearer understanding of the etiology of ASD.","Wilson, Hayley A; Creighton, Carolyn; Scharfman, Helen; Choleris, Elena; MacLusky, Neil J",Neuroscientist,248,1

A 52 years old Caucasian man, affected by SARS CoV-2 infection, was admitted to the Emergency department of Arcispedale Sant’Anna of Ferrara for epigastralgia followed by syncopal episode, vomiting and diarrhea with bloody stools. The next day the patient underwent colonoscopy, which detected an ulceration proximally to the ileocecal valve without active bleeding. Subsequently an initial non-operative management and two pharyngeal swabs negative, for another rectorrhagia and hypotensive episode, underwent emerging surgery and an Open Abdomen was performed. The patient was discharged in 12th post-surgery day without complications. The IHC analysis with anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-protein revealed the presence of viral protein expression in epithelial cell of ulcerated intestinal mucosa. In this case report, we showed the presence of viral inclusion in small intestinal wall after two negative pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We can also say that the largest amount of viral inclusions was in the tissue of ulceration of the last ileal loop. This case report showed that SARS-CoV-2 can be unseen also after clinical healing. It's probably can be expelled with stools and rectal swabs search for SARS-Cov-2 RNA after pharyngeal swabs could be mandatory for declare heled a patient. Moreover, damage control surgery and Open Abdomen as a surgical technique can be a valid alternative in case of uncertainty of the bleeding source and when a second surgical look is necessary.","Lacavalla, D.; Santandrea, G.; Andreotti, D.; Stano, R.; Occhionorelli, S.",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,248,9

Although Calu-3, a human lung cell line which endogenously expresses ACE2, supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, they are significantly less permissive to infection than other models. Furthermore, ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract is low and emerging evidence suggests the utilization of alternative host cell receptors and attachment factors may compensate for low ACE2 expression levels in the lung. We identified human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of ACE2. Methods: A panel of 10 cell lines, with variable expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020. Viral replication was monitored through assessment of cell-associated and cell-free viral RNA (vRNA) by QRT-PCR as well as N staining by FACS and in situ hybridization. Effect of blocking S protein by neutralizing antibodies and an ACE2-Fc decoy peptide, ACE2 blocking by a specific antibody, and ACE2 knockout by CRISPR on SARS-CoV-2 replication was determined by Q-RT-PCR for vRNAs. Various viral entry inhibitors were used to pathway of SARS-CoV-2 entry in H522 cells. RNA sequencing and proteomics was used to study the cell and innate immune responses in infected H522 cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown was utilized to further characterize the pathway of immune sensing. Results: Infection of H522 cells required the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, though in contrast to ACE2-dependent models, spike alone was not sufficient for H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5- dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling. Focused chemical screens point to important roles for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal cathepsins in SARS-CoV-2 infection of H522 cells. Conclusion: These findings imply the utilization of an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.","Puray-Chavez, M.

In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. In pooled sample testing, multiple samples are combined (or pooled) together and tested as a single unit. If the pool is positive, the individual samples can then be individually tested to identify the positive case(s). Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the limit of detection of this assay was comparable to laboratory-developed reverse-transcription quantitative PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, with observed detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert® Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were pooled in groups of six. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted based on public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or the pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care testing site and can be determined by the positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.","Becker, Michael G; Taylor, Tracy; Kiazyk, Sandra; Cabiles, Dana R; Meyers, Adrienne F A; Sandstrom, Paul A",PLoS One,248,6

To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. METHODS: This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). RESULTS: The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0 cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25-0.5 µm and 0.5-1.0 µm, the count decreased at 50 cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0-2.5 µm and &#8805; 2.5 µm, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (r = 0.490, P = 0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (r = - 0.675, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols with < 1.0-µm diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","Hao, Weiting; Wu, Jianhui; Zhao, Xinheng; Liang, Danni; Yu, Xingchen; Cao, Huazheng; Wang, Yan",Adv. ther,248,16

We discuss the role of hydrodynamic interactions for three different systems: i) the deformation and orientation of sedimenting semiflexible polymers, ii) the propulsion and force-rectification with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and iii) the deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flows. In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible. The common theme is the interaction between elasticity of soft matter and hydrodynamics, which can lead to qualitatively new effects.","Manghi, Manoel; Schlagberger, Xaver; Kim, Yong-Woon; Netz, Roland R.",,248,26

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual RE approach that does not require any human annotation in a target language or any cross-lingual resources. Building upon unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning frameworks, we develop several deep Transformer based RE models with a novel encoding scheme that can effectively encode both entity location and entity type information. Our RE models, when trained with English data, outperform several deep neural network based English RE models. More importantly, our models can be applied to perform zero-shot cross-lingual RE, achieving the state-of-the-art cross-lingual RE performance on two datasets (68-89% of the accuracy of the supervised target-language RE model). The high cross-lingual transfer efficiency without requiring additional training data or cross-lingual resources shows that our RE models are especially useful for low-resource languages.","Ni, Jian; Moon, Taesun; Awasthy, Parul; Florian, Radu",,248,20

There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems. METHODS: A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions. RESULTS: Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1-88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0-31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days. CONCLUSION: Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic subpopulations. The model was implemented prospectively and successfully produced meaningful estimates of risk within minutes of admission.","Major, Vincent J; Aphinyanaphongs, Yindalon",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,248,24

Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women. We present a case of placental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in a woman with mild COVID-19 disease, then review the literature. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. A 29-year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias 2 days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate maternal vascular malperfusion, with no fetal vascular malperfusion, as well as SARS-CoV-2 virus in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and also rarely in trophoblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental SARS-CoV-2 despite mild COVID-19 disease (no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy complications) and possible vertical transmission-especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. This raises important questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, Albert L; Guan, Minhui; Johannesen, Eric; Stephens, Amanda J; Khaleel, Nabila; Kagan, Nikki; Tuhlei, Breanna C; Wan, Xiu-Feng",J. med. virol,248,23

People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many ""invisible"" symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.","Davis, Bryan E; Lakin, Lynsey; Binns, Cherie C; Currie, Keisha M; Rensel, Mary R",Neurol Ther,248,16

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub-acute care in 2020, 236 COVID-19 patients (median age 77 years - interquartile range 68-83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0-20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score. Patients with no comorbidities (14%) exhibited low frailty (BRASS: median 5.5, interquartile range 3.0-12.0). Age &#8805;65 years, presence of comorbidities, cognitive deficit and SPPB % predicted <50% were significant predictors of high frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 survivors exhibit substantial frailty and require continuing care after discharge from acute care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The BRASS index is a valuable tool for nurses to identify those patients most at risk of frailty, who require a programme of rehabilitation and community reintegration.","Mandora, Elena; Comini, Laura; Olivares, Adriana; Fracassi, Michela; Cadei, Maria Grazia; Paneroni, Mara; Marchina, Lucia; Suruniuc, Adrian; Luisa, Alberto; Scalvini, Simonetta; Corica, Giacomo; Vitacca, Michele",J. clin. nurs,248,6

We design Bayesian active learning algorithms to iteratively query the simulator, gather more data, and continuously improve the model.

PROPOSE: This study commits to providing a digital solution for precise bone augmentation in the field of oral implantology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After collecting the data of patients' intraoral scanning and DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine), the implant position is digitally designed, and the alveolar bone is digitally augmented around the ideal implant position. On the premise of ensuring that the thickness of labial bone is 2 mm, and there is sufficient alveolar bone 3 to 4 mm apically from the ideal gingival margin for implant placing, we carry out excessive augmentation of 0.5 and 1 mm on the labial bone and alveolar crest, respectively, to compensate for possible bone resorption after 6 months. After 3D printing the reconstructed alveolar bone model, the titanium mesh is trimmed and preformed on the alveolar bone model. Outcomes are reported in terms of mean values (5%-95% percentile values). RESULTS: Thirty implant sites have accepted this novel virtually designed alveolar bone augmentation. Before the second-stage surgery, the average vertical bone gain was 2.48 mm (0.29-6.32), the average horizontal bone gain was 4.11 mm (1.19-8.74), the average height of the residual alveolar bone above the implant platform was 1.44 mm (0.59-2.92), the average thickness of the labial bone width at the implant platform was 2.00 mm (0.93-3.64), the average thickness of the labial bone width at 2 mm apically from the implant platform was 2.74 mm (1.40-5.46). The virtual augmentation of each tooth position was 349.41 mm3 (165.70-482.70), while the actual augmentation of each tooth position was 352.94 mm3 (159.24-501.78), the accuracy of the final actual augmentation reached 95.82% (range from 88.53% to 99.15%). CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that a virtually digital guided bone regeneration (GBR) workflow is precise and controllable. The practicality, safety and effectiveness of this procedure needs to be compared to other bone augmentation procedures in randomized controlled trials.","Li, Songhang; Zhang, Tianxu; Zhou, Mi; Zhang, Xiaolin; Gao, Yang; Cai, Xiaoxiao",Clin. implant. dent. relat. res,248,6

Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to summarize the prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients and to identify the clinical presentations and outcomes in this patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Up to 10/27/2020, Medline, Embase, cochrane and google scholar databases were searched for original studies investigating the association between COVID-19 and T1DM. A manual search was conducted to identify missing studies. The quality of included studies was analyzed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) risk of bias tool. Outcomes included length of hospital stay, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe hypoglycemia, and death. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Included studies reported data of both adult and pediatric patients. The prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.15% to 28.98%, while the rate of COVID-19 in patients with T1DM ranged from 0% to 16.67%. Dry cough, nausea, vomiting, fever and elevated blood glucose levels were the most commonly reported presentations. The investigated outcomes varied widely among studied populations.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The retrospective cohort study included adult HCWs in a single healthcare system from March 9 to June 3, 2020. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results and demographics of the study participants were deidentified and extracted from an established occupational health, COVID-19 database at the healthcare system. HCWs from each particular job grouping had been categorized into frontline or nonfrontline workers. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare subgroups after excluding HCWs involved in early infection clusters before universal masking began. A sensitivity analysis was performed comparing jobs with the greatest potential occupational risks with others. RESULTS: Of 5,177 HCWs, 152 (2.94%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Affected HCWs resided in areas with higher community attack rates (median, 1,755.2 vs 1,412.4 cases per 100,000; P < .001; multivariate-adjusted IRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.03-3.44 comparing fifth to first quintile of community rates). After multivariate adjustment, African-American and Hispanic HCWs had higher incidence of COVID-19 than non-Hispanic white HCWs (IRR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.78-4.33; and IRR, 2.41, 95% CI, 1.42-4.07, respectively). After adjusting for race and residential rates, frontline HCWs had a higher IRR (1.73, 95% CI, 1.16-2.54) than nonfrontline HCWs overall, but not within specific job categories nor when comparing the highest risk jobs to others. CONCLUSIONS: After universal masking was instituted, the strongest risk factors associated with HCW COVID-19 infection were residential community infection rate and race.","Lan, Fan-Yun; Filler, Robert; Mathew, Soni; Buley, Jane; Iliaki, Eirini; Bruno-Murtha, Lou Ann; Osgood, Rebecca; Christophi, Costas A; Fernandez-Montero, Alejandro; Kales, Stefanos N",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,248,22

To cope with this shortage, the government introduced a severity scoring system for patients with COVID-19 and designed a new type of quarantine facility for treating and isolating patients with mild symptoms out of the hospital, namely, the Residential Treatment Center (RTC). A patient with mild symptoms was immediately isolated in the RTC and continuously monitored to detect changes in symptoms. If the symptoms aggravate, the patient was transferred to a hospital. RTCs were designed by creating a quarantine environment in existing lodging facilities capable of accommodating > 100 individuals. The facilities were entirely divided into a clean zone (working area) and contaminated zone (patient zone), separating the space, air, and movement routes, and the staff wore level D personal protective equipment (PPE) in the contaminated zone. The staffs consisted of medical personnel, police officers, soldiers, and operation personnel, and worked in two or three shifts per day. Their duty was mainly to monitor the health conditions of quarantined patients, provide accommodations, and regularly collect specimens to determine if they can be released. For the past two months, RTCs secured approximately 4,000 isolation rooms and treated approximately 3,000 patients with mild symptoms and operated stably without additional spread of the disease in and out of the centers. Based on these experience, we would like to suggest the utilization of RTCs as strategic quarantine facilities in pandemic situations.","Yang, Yuseon; Kim, Hyejung; Hwang, Jieun",J Korean Med Sci,248,4

Although its influence on cell's response is deeply investigated, the role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the widest group of transmembrane proteins in animals, which regulate specific cell processes through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active receptors –in full agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels– and how the latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell interaction.","Carotenuto, Angelo R.; Lunghi, Laura; Piccolo, Valentina; Babaei, Mahnoush; Dayal, Kaushik; Pugno, Nicola; Zingales, Massimiliano; Deseri, Luca; Fraldi, Massimiliano",J Mech Phys Solids,248,1

METHODS: Death data of registered residents of Suzhou from 2014 to 2020 were collected and the weekly mortality rates due to respiratory disease and all deaths were analyzed. The differences in mortality rates during the pandemic and the same period in previous years were compared. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, the crude mortality rate (CMR) and standardized mortality rate (SMR) of Suzhou residents including respiratory disease, were not much different from those in previous years. During the emergency period, the CMR of Suzhou residents was 180.2/100,000 and the SMR was 85.5/100,000, decreasing by 9.1% and 14.6%, respectively; the CMR of respiratory disease was 16.4/100,000 and the SMR was 6.8/100,000, down 41.4% and 44.9%, respectively. Regardless of the mortality rates of all deaths or respiratory disease, the rates were higher in males than in females, although males had aslightly greater decrease in all deaths during the emergency period compared with females, and the opposite was true for respiratory disease. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, the death rate of residents decreased, especially that due to respiratory disease.","Huang, Chunyan; Lu, Yan; Wang, Linchi; Hua, Yujie; Xu, Jianrong; Wei, Xiaolin; Zhang, Zhengji; Zhang, Jun",Expert Rev Respir Med,248,1

While attaching a HEPA filter to the endotracheal tube will protect the anesthesia machine and the gas sampling line from contamination, this contributionto the dead space makes ventilation of these small patients challenging. Direct filtration of the gas sampling line eliminates this problem;however, appropriate filters are not readily available. AIMS: Identify a small filter capable of filtering outparticles of a size similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the gas sampling line. METHODS: We used fluorescence microspheres suspended in a solution for a challenge test to determine the filtration efficiency of various filters. The microspheres varied in diameter (0.02 µm, 0.042 µm, 0.109 µm and 0.989 µm). A fluorescence plate reader was used to evaluate the degree of fluorescence intensity in the flow-through from various filters and referenced to the fluorescence intensity of the input. RESULTS: AHEPA filter,as recommended as an anti-viral filter, effectively filtered all the particles tested. The B. Braun PERIFIX Flat Epidural Filter was the second most effective filter, filtering particleslarger than 0.042 µm.Other filters tested did not filter fluorescence microspheres equivalent in size to a single coronavirus particle (0.07 µm). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the Flat Epidural Filter for use as an anesthesia machine gas filter, our simple challenge test suggests that it could be used to effectively filter the anesthesia gas sampling line.","Brustowicz, Robert M; Yuki, Koichi",Paediatr. anaesth,248,30

Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, all information is provided (as possible) on risk factors and potential solutions in indigenous communities in the hope of providing solutions to this pandemic and providing a reference for future studies.","Díaz de León-Martínez, Lorena; de la Sierra-de la Vega, Luz; Palacios-Ramírez, Andrés; Rodriguez-Aguilar, Maribel; Flores-Ramírez, Rogelio",Sci Total Environ,248,1

This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. METHODS: The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. RESULTS: The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. CONCLUSION: Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.","Korobelnik, Jean-François; Loewenstein, Anat; Eldem, Bora; Joussen, Antonia M; Koh, Adrian; Lambrou, George N; Lanzetta, Paolo; Li, Xiaoxin; Lövestam-Adrian, Monica; Navarro, Rafael; Okada, Annabelle A; Pearce, Ian; Rodríguez, Francisco J; Wong, David T; Wu, Lihteh",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,248,26

However, research is lacking on the relationship between ACP and hope. We sought to investigate the potential association between ACP and hope in advanced cancer. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a primary palliative care intervention trial. All patients had advanced solid cancers. Three domains of ACP were measured using validated questions to assess discussion with oncologists about end-of-life (EOL) planning, selection of a surrogate decision maker, and completion of an advance directive. Hope was measured using the Hearth Hope Index (HHI). Multivariable regression was performed, adjusting for variables associated with hope or ACP. RESULTS: A total of 672 patients were included in this analysis. The mean age was 69.3 ± 10.2 years; 54% were female, and 94% were White. Twenty percent of patients (132 of 661) reported having a discussion about EOL planning, 51% (342 of 668) reported completing an advance directive, and 85% (565 of 666) had chosen a surrogate. There was no difference in hope between patients who had and had not had an EOL discussion (adjusted mean difference in HHI, 0.55; P = .181 for adjusted regression), chosen a surrogate (adjusted HHI difference, 0.31; P = .512), or completed an advance directive (adjusted HHI difference, 0.11; P = .752). CONCLUSION: In this study, hope was equivalent among patients who had or had not completed 3 important domains of ACP. These findings do not support concerns that ACP is associated with decreased hope for patients with advanced cancer.","Cohen, Michael G; Althouse, Andrew D; Arnold, Robert M; Bulls, Hailey W; White, Douglas; Chu, Edward; Rosenzweig, Margaret; Smith, Kenneth; Schenker, Yael",JCO Oncol Pract,248,20

The aim was to explore symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults over 5 years' follow-up after undergoing MBS. METHODS: Beck Depression Inventory-2 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were used to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in 62 patients 1, 2, and 5 years after having Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at 13-18 years of age. Mental health, eating-related problems, and weight outcomes were tested for association with suicidal ideation at the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: At the 5-year follow-up, the mean score for depression was 11.4 (± 12.4), indicating minimal symptoms of depression. The mean score for anxiety was 12.82 (± 11.50), indicating mild anxiety symptoms. Still, several participants reported moderate or severe symptoms of depression (26%) and anxiety (32%). Women reported more symptoms than men (P = 0.03 and 0.04). No significant changes were found in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety between the 1-year and the 5-year follow-up (P = 0.367 and 0.934). Suicidal ideation was reported by 16% at the 5-year follow-up. Participants reporting suicidal ideation had lost significantly less excess weight than participants without suicidal ideation (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Five years after adolescent MBS, a substantial minority still struggles with mental health issues, and women are more burdened than men. Our results indicate an association between less optimal weight loss and suicidal ideation 5 years after MBS. The findings emphasize the importance of offering long-term follow-up and mental health treatment several years after MBS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, cohort study.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-two patients (72 eyes) with glaucoma. METHODS: Before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after anterior chamber BGI insertion, we evaluated the central corneal ECD (CCECD) and peripheral corneal ECD (PCECD) in the area of the tube; anterior chamber (AC) flare; tube insertion entry site position relative to Schwalbe's line (SL), defined as all of the entry site behind SL (tube insertion position 1), less than 50% of entry site anterior to SL (tube insertion position 2), more than 50% but less than 100% of entry site anterior to SL (tube insertion position 3 [TIP3]), and all of the entry site in front of SL (tube insertion position 4 [TIP4]); anterior segment (AS) OCT tube parameters, including posterior cornea-to-tube tip distance, tube angle-to-posterior corneal surface distance, tube tip-to-anterior iris distance, tube length (TL), and tube angle-to-anterior iris distance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were CCECD and PCECD loss at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included prognostic factors for ECD loss: tube insertion entry site position relative to SL, AS OCT tube parameters, AC flare, and clinical factors including IOP. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (64 eyes) completed the study. The mean percentage CCECD and PCECD losses at 5 years were 36.8% and 50.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis at 5 years, a lower CCECD was associated with TIP3. Tube angle-to-anterior iris distance, TL, and TIP3 were associated with lower PCECD at 5 years. Multiple regression analysis revealed TIP3 to be associated with both lower CCECD (standardized ß coefficient, -0.27; P = 0.015) and PCECD (standardized ß coefficient, -0.23; P = 0.028). A short TL (standardized ß coefficient, 0.26; P = 0.016) also was associated with lower PCECD. The fastest rate of cell loss was associated with TIP3 for CCECD and TIP4 for PCECD. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior chamber BGI insertion is associated with ECD loss greatest close to the tube. Tube insertion in the vicinity of, or anterior to SL, and short TL were associated with significant ECD loss with time.","Hau, Scott; Bunce, Catey; Barton, Keith",,248,24

The model is a Poisson autoregression of the daily new observed cases and dynamically adapt its estimates to explain the evolution of contagion in terms of a short-term and long-term dependence of case counts, allowing for a comparative evaluation of health policy measures. We have applied the model to 2020 data from the countries most hit by the virus. Our empirical findings show that the proposed model describes the evolution of contagion dynamics and determines whether contagion growth can be affected by health policies. Based on our findings, we can draw two health policy conclusions that can be useful for all countries in the world. First, policy measures aimed at reducing contagion are very useful when contagion is at its peak to reduce the reproduction rate. Second, the contagion curve should be accurately monitored over time to apply policy measures that are cost-effective.","Agosto, Arianna; Campmas, Alexandra; Giudici, Paolo; Renda, Andrea",Stat. med,248,16

Colchicine was considered for this purpose based on well-recognised anti-inflammatory effects and potential antiviral properties. In the present study, colchicine was proposed to patients with COVID-19, and its effects compared with 'standard-of-care' (SoC). METHODS: In the public hospital of Esine, northern Italy, 140 consecutive inpatients, with virologically and radiographically confirmed COVID-19 admitted in the period 5-19 March 2020, were treated with 'SoC' (hydroxychloroquine and/or intravenous dexamethasone; and/or lopinavir/ritonavir). They were compared with 122 consecutive inpatients, admitted between 19 March and 5 April 2020, treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) and SoC (antiviral drugs were stopped before colchicine, due to potential interaction). RESULTS: Patients treated with colchicine had a better survival rate as compared with SoC at 21 days of follow-up (84.2% (SE=3.3%) vs 63.6% (SE=4.1%), p=0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis showed that a lower risk of death was independently associated with colchicine treatment (HR=0.151 (95% CI 0.062 to 0.368), p<0.0001), whereas older age, worse PaO2/FiO2, and higher serum levels of ferritin at entry were associated with a higher risk. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study may support the rationale of use of colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19. Efficacy and safety must be determined in controlled clinical trials.","Scarsi, Mirko; Piantoni, Silvia; Colombo, Enrico; Airó, Paolo; Richini, Donata; Miclini, Marco; Bertasi, Valeria; Bianchi, Marta; Bottone, Damiano; Civelli, Patrizia; Cotelli, Maria-Sofia; Damiolini, Ezio; Galbassini, Gloria; Gatta, Diego; Ghirardelli, Maria-Laura; Magri, Roberto; Malamani, Paola; Mendeni, Monia; Molinari, Stefano; Morotti, Andrea; Salada, Luisa; Turla, Marinella; Vender, Angiola; Tincani, Angela; Brucato, Antonio; Franceschini, Franco; Furloni, Roberto; Andreoli, Laura",Ann Rheum Dis,248,24

The assumption has been that wider scientific reproducibility terminology and definitions are not applicable to NLP/ML, with the result that many different terms and definitions have been proposed, some diametrically opposed. In this paper, we test this assumption, by taking the standard terminology and definitions from metrology and applying them directly to NLP/ML. We find that we are able to straightforwardly derive a practical framework for assessing reproducibility which has the desirable property of yielding a quantified degree of reproducibility that is comparable across different reproduction studies.","Belz, Anya",,248,1

Based on the figures, now well known, of the lethality of covid-19 according to age classes, I suggest that a gradual release of the containment be instituted, which will keep retirees in isolation (the 65+ age class), whose risk is maximal and the impact on economic production the lowest.

Antiviral innate immune responses can be triggered by multiple cellular receptors sensing viral components. The activated innate immune system produces interferons (IFNs) and cytokines that perform antiviral functions to eliminate invading viruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have a broad range of animal hosts. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple means to evade host antiviral immune responses. Successful immune evasion by coronaviruses may enable the viruses to adapt to multiple species of host organisms. Coronavirus transmission from zoonotic hosts to humans has caused serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), resulting in global health and economic crises. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying host sensing of and innate immune responses against coronavirus invasion, as well as host immune evasion strategies of coronaviruses.","Kasuga, Yusuke; Zhu, Baohui; Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Yoo, Ji-Seung",Exp Mol Med,248,16

Here, we assess lung autopsy findings in COVID-19 inpatients and untreated, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive individuals who died in the community to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we investigate if COVID-19 represents a unique histologic variant of DAD by comparing the pathologic findings to uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included 4 COVID-19 inpatients, 4 cases with post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses who died in the community, and 8 SARS-CoV-2-negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organization, and ""acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia""-like intraalveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, hemorrhage, and capillaritis were not features of COVID-19-related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histologic manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients who die both in the hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxemic mechanical ventilation to the histologic changes. There are no distinctive morphologic features to confidently differentiate COVID-19-related DAD from DAD due to other causes.","Konopka, Kristine E; Nguyen, Teresa; Jentzen, Jeffrey M; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J; Wilson, Allecia M; Farver, Carol F; Myers, Jeffrey L",Histopathology,248,23

The cellular receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby implicating a link between cardiovascular diseases and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Aortic stenosis (AS) represents a chronic inflammatory state with severe cardiovascular complications in the elderly, a prime condition for COVID-19 mortality. The circulating ACE2 levels were measured in 111 patients with severe AS and compared to patients with hypertension and healthy individuals. About 4 times higher circulating ACE2 activity was found in patients with severe AS than in hypertensives or healthy individuals (88.3 ± 61.6., n = 111, 20.6 ± 13.4, n = 540, and 16.1 ± 7.4 mU/L, n = 46, respectively). Patients with severe AS were older than patients with hypertension (80 ± 6 years vs. 60 ± 15 years, P < 0.05). Serum ACE2 activity correlated negatively with the left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic root area, TAPSE, and positively with the right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiac diameters in patients with AS. In contrast, circulating ACE2 activity was independent of the blood pressure, peak flow velocity at the aortic root, kidney function (GFR), and inflammatory state (CRP). We found no effect of RAAS inhibitory drugs on the serum ACE2 activity in this group of patients. Our results illustrate circulating ACE2 as a potential interface between chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 susceptibility. Elderly patients with AS have markedly elevated ACE2 levels together with altered left and right ventricular functions, which may pose higher risks during COVID-19. Our clinical data do not support a role for RAAS inhibitors in regulating circulating ACE2 levels.","Fagyas, Miklós; Kertész, Attila; Siket, Ivetta Mányiné; Bánhegyi, Viktor; Kracskó, Bertalan; Szegedi, Andrea; Szokol, Miklós; Vajda, Gusztáv; Rácz, Ildikó; Gulyás, Hajnalka; Szkibák, Noémi; Rácz, Vivienn; Csanádi, Zoltán; Papp, Zoltán; Tóth, Attila; Sipka, Sándor",Geroscience,248,26

Although necessary to deter the spread of the virus, these measures may also have had adverse health repercussions by increasing social isolation. Using a national longitudinal study from Canada, in which respondents were surveyed in March 2020 at the beginning of stay-at-home orders and again two months later in May, we show that, at baseline, loneliness was inversely associated with perceptions of self-rated health, and there was a beneficial indirect association between respondents? number of social network confidants and perceived health through lower levels of loneliness. Between March and May, social network confidants decreased and loneliness increased;these changes were independent of each other and contributed to declines in self-rated health. Greater loneliness at baseline was also associated with declines in self-rated health. Our observations suggest that social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic impaired social connectedness, thereby resulting in declines in perceptions of health. We conclude by discussing several policy-related implications of our findings.","Bierman, Alex Upenieks Laura Schieman Scott",Social Currents,248,1

However, a confirmation of the food safety aspects of sake based on scientific evidence is important for establishing consumer confidence, in part because consumer concerns regarding food safety have increased. The presence of Bacillus cereus spores in refined rice wine has been reported, and in light of consumers' growing concern over food safety, the establishment of food and beverage safety is important for consumers' reassurance. Herein, to confirm the microbiological safety of sake, we investigated the content and growth of B. cereus. We conducted a spore addition test to determine whether B. cereus spores grow during sake production, and we observed no growth or germination of B. cereus spores during the manufacturing process. We also observed that processes such as solid-liquid separation and filtration help remove the risk posed by B. cereus. We then conducted a survey to assess the density of B. cereus in various commercial sake products. We analyzed 162 samples of commercial sake and observed that 11 of the products had &#8805;1 CFU of living cells in 1 mL of sake (detection rate: 6.8%). There was no product in which &#8805;100 CFU/mL-sake of living cells was detected. Our findings confirmed that the density of these bacteria in sake is lower than that in other foods, and the probability of infection is very low. The emetic toxin produced by B. cereus was not detected in any of the sake samples. This is the first study based on experimental data demonstrating that B. cereus is not able to grow in sake or during the sake manufacturing process. We thus conclude that the safety risk of B. cereus in sake is negligible. Our findings indicate that Bacillus cereus is not a significant hazard in the sake brewing process, and they will contribute to the food hygiene management based on scientific evidence in sake breweries.","Takahashi, Masayuki; Kita, Yasuko; Minakami, Rui; Mukai, Nobuhiko",J. foof prot,248,20

The racial distribution of Oklahoma County closely mirrors that of the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate VTE incidence and mortality, including demographic and racial subgroups. DESIGN: Population-based prospective study. SETTING: We conducted VTE surveillance at all relevant tertiary care facilities and outpatient clinics in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma during 2012 to 2014, using both active and passive methods. Active surveillance involved reviewing all imaging reports used to diagnose VTE. Passive surveillance entailed identifying VTE events from hospital discharge data and death certificate records. MEASUREMENTS: We used Poisson regression to calculate crude, age-stratified, and age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates per 1,000 population per year and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The incidence rate of all VTE was 3.02 (2.92-3.12) for those age &#8805;18 years and 0.05 (0.04-0.08) for those <18 years. The age-adjusted incidence rates of all VTE, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism were 2.47 (95% CI: 2.39-2.55), 1.47 (1.41-1.54), and 0.99 (0.93-1.04), respectively.

We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected.

Here, we evaluated the ability of PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes. RESULTS: We first assembled an epitope dataset consisting of 844 unique virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes and their source proteins. We then analyzed cleavage predictions by PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model on this dataset and compared them with those provided by a related method implemented by NetChop web server. PCPS was clearly superior to NetChop in term of sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.79) but somewhat inferior with regard to specificity (0.55 vs. 0.60). Judging by the Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, PCPS predictions were overall superior to those provided by NetChop (0.46 vs. 0.39). We next analyzed the power of C-terminal cleavage predictions provided by the same PCPS model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes, finding that they could be discriminated from random peptides with an accuracy of 0.74. Following these results, we tuned the PCPS web server to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes and predicted the entire SARS-CoV-2 epitope space. CONCLUSIONS: We report an improved version of PCPS named iPCPS for predicting proteasome cleavage sites and peptides with CD8+ T cell epitope features. iPCPS is available for free public use at https://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/pcps/ .","Gomez-Perosanz, Marta; Ras-Carmona, Alvaro; Lafuente, Esther M; Reche, Pedro A",BMC Bioinformatics,248,21

This study aims to provide the current data to allow adequate consent regarding the risks of post-surgery COVID-19 infection and subsequent COVID-19-related mortality. Methods: All orthopaedic trauma cases at the Wrightington Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust from 'lockdown' (23 March 2020) to date (15 June 2020) were collated and split into three groups. Adult ambulatory trauma surgeries (upper limb trauma, ankle fracture, tibial plateau fracture) and regional-specific referrals (periprosthetic hip fracture) were performed at a stand-alone elective site that accepted COVID-19-negative patients. Neck of femur fractures (NOFF) and all remaining non-NOFF (paediatric trauma, long bone injury) surgeries were performed at an acute site hospital (mixed green/blue site). Patients were swabbed for COVID-19 before surgery on both sites. Age, sex, nature of surgery, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade, associated comorbidity, length of stay, development of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, and post-surgical COVID-19-related deaths were collected. Results: At the elective site, 225 patients underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery; two became COVID-19-positive (0.9%) in the immediate perioperative period, neither of which was fatal. At the acute site, 93 patients underwent non-NOFF trauma surgery, of whom six became COVID-19-positive (6.5%) and three died. A further 84 patients underwent NOFF surgery, seven becoming COVID-19 positive (8.3%) and five died. Conclusion: At the elective site, the rate of COVID-19 infection following orthopaedic trauma surgery was low, at 0.9%. At the acute mixed site (typical district general hospital), for non-NOFF surgery there was a 6.5% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection (seven-fold higher risk) with 50% COVID-19 mortality; for NOFF surgery, there was an 8.3% incidence of post-surgical COVID-19 infection, with 71% COVID-19 mortality.

In addition, biclustering is used to globally analyze the patient-drug dataset, extracting segments of patients. We highlight the validity of the classifiers developed to predict the mortality, reaching an appreciable accuracy. Finally, interpretable decision rules for estimating the risk of mortality of patients can be obtained from the decision tree, which can be crucial in the prioritization of medical care and resources.","Sánchez-Montañés, Manuel; Rodríguez-Belenguer, Pablo; Serrano-López, Antonio J; Soria-Olivas, Emilio; Alakhdar-Mohmara, Yasser",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),248,22

This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS: We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS: No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0â10.8% vs. 33.8â75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.","Moroni-Zentgraf, Petra C; Keller, Christoph; Mahmoudi, Mazyar; Kallsen, Kimberley; Eschenfelder, Christoph C; Sigmund, Ralf; Müller, Hanns Walter; Baum, Patrick; Boos, Bertram; Schneider, Michael; Mundt, Egbert",Curr Med Res Opin,248,26

The prevention of the first variceal bleed is, therefore, an important clinical goal. Little is known about patients' experience of treatments geared towards this, or of their perceptions of treatments prior to being exposed to them. AIMS: To explore the factors impacting patient preference for, and actual experience of carvedilol and variceal band ligation. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 patients from across the UK at baseline, prior to random allocation to either carvedilol or variceal band ligation. Twenty patients were interviewed a second time at 6-month follow-up. Five patients who declined the trial were also interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There was no clear preference for either treatment pathway at baseline. Key factors reported by patients to influence their treatment preference included: negative experiences with key treatment processes; how long-term or short-term treatment was perceived to be; treatment misconceptions; concerns around polypharmacy and worries around treatment adherence. Patient treatment experience was influenced by their perceptions of treatment effectiveness; clinical surveillance; clinician interaction and communication, or lack thereof. Carvedilol-specific experience was also influenced by the manifestation of side effects and patient dosage routine. Variceal band ligation-specific experience was positively influenced by the use of sedation, and negatively influenced by the procedure recovery period. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support a view that the patient experience of beta-blockade for prevention of variceal bleeds is likely to be superior to variceal band ligation.","Poyner, Chris; Tripathi, Dhiraj; Mathers, Jonathan",,248,16

The average score of 119.7 points (±28.9; range: 38-175) of maximum 275 points revealed medium level of stress. Eighteen respondents had a high level of stress (>135 points). The most prominent and the only stressor with high stress scores was pressure at work, paperwork and multitasking items in particular. After having grouped the SOHs into three groups by type of organisation in which they work, our results singled out SOHs working in public institutions as having the highest levels of stress (average of 143 points). They reported high pressure at work, work overload, and poor relationship with superiors (in terms of communication and support). SOHs working in healthcare centres and private outpatient clinics also reported higher pressure at work, but the latter had no problems with relationship with superiors, while healthcare centre SOHs complained of work underload and advancement constraints. Differences in relationship with superiors, disagreement/conflicts at work and advancement constraints reflect different organisation of work, which was confirmed by later analysis of subgroups. The findings of this pilot study could be of value for SOHs who are engaged in training programmes as examiners and educators, yet they call for further improvement of the questionnaire and for continued investigation that could give a better insight into the role of various stressors in work efficiency and satisfaction among SOHs.","Radulovic, Azra Hursidic; Varosanec, Ana Marija",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,248,21

The motivation behind the research is to develop such a robot that is capable of performing disinfection tasks without the use of harmful sprays and chemicals that can leave residues and require airing the room afterward for a long time. UltraBot technology has the potential to offer the most optimal autonomous disinfection performance along with taking care of people, keeping them from getting under the UV-C radiation. The paper highlights UltraBot's mechanical and electrical design as well as disinfection performance. The conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of robot disinfection ability and actual disinfection area per each side with UV-C lamp array. The disinfection effectiveness results show actual performance for the multi-pass technique that provides 1-log reduction with combined direct UV-C exposure and ozone-based air purification after two robot passes at a speed of 0.14 m/s. This technique has the same performance as ten minutes static disinfection.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a carboxypeptidase that degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, has been identified as a potent receptor for SARSCoV-2. In the last decades, ACE inhibition has assumed a central role in reducing cardiovascular and renal events. However, with the advent of COVID-19, attention has been turned to ACE-2 as a possible target to reduce virus binding to different human cells. This review aims to discuss recent developments related to medicinal properties of natural compounds as ACE/ACE-2 inhibitors, which should be highlighted in the future development of studies looking for modulators in SARSCoV-2 infection. Data show that bioactive compounds isolated from several natural products act by inhibiting ACE/ACE2, which changes the entire axis of this system. Of the compounds addressed in this review, 7 phenolic compounds, including quercetin, curcumin, naringenin, luteolin, hesperidin, mangiferin, and gallic acid showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico, and 1, esculetin, decreased ACE-2 expression in vivo. Regarding terpenoids and alkaloids, nimbin, withaferin A, andrographolide, zingiberene and, berberine, piperine and thebaine, respectively, showed binding affinity with molecular ACE-2 target in silico. These findings reinforce the need for future preclinical and clinical studies on these compounds and specific inhibitory effects on ACE-2 of all the other compounds described herein only as nonspecific ACE inhibitors. It is important to mention that some natural compounds such as magnolol, resveratrol, rosmarinic acid, tanshinone IIA, and nicotine have also demonstrated the potential to increase the activity or expression of ACE-2, and could therefore aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Junior, Arquimedes Gasparotto; Tolouei, Sara Emília Lima; Dos Reis Lívero, Francislaine Aparecida; Gasparotto, Francielli; Boeing, Thaise; de Souza, Priscila",Curr. pharm. des,248,26

Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation. In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP. The second stage of labor can last up to 4 hours. During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage. We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients.

COVID-19 primarily targets the human respiratory epithelium but also has neuro-invasive potential. Indeed, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as fatigue, febrile seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and delirium, are consistently observed in COVID-19. The neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric COVID-19 symptoms is not fully understood. However, previous evidence about systemic viral infections pointed to an ongoing neuroinflammatory response to viral antigens and proinflammatory mediators/immune cells from the periphery. Microglia cells mediate the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and damage signals, culminating with neurotoxic consequences. Semi-synthetic second-generation tetracyclines, including minocycline (MINO) and doxycycline (DOXY), are safe bacteriostatic agents that have remarkable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using tetracyclines for major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. Tetracyclines can inhibit microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling, cyclooxygenase 2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This drug class also has a broad profile of activity against bacteria associated with community-based pneumonia, including atypical agents. COVID-19 patients are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, especially those on invasive ventilation. Therefore, we suggest tetracyclines’ repurposing as a potential treatment for COVID-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations. These drugs can represent a valuable multi-modal treatment for COVID-19-associated neuroinflammatory alterations based on their broad antimicrobial profile and neuroinflammation control.","Chaves Filho Adriano José, Maia Gonçalves Franciane Mottin Melina Andrade Carolina Horta Fonseca Silvia Nunes Szente Macedo Danielle S.",Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology,248,17

AIMS: A rapid review was conducted to provide educators, allied health practitioners and policymakers with a synthesis of valid, relevant and actionable evidence relating to telepractice delivery of instructional reading and spelling procedures. The aim was to investigate the nature and outcomes of studies examining instructional reading and spelling procedures delivered via telepractice to school-aged students. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A rapid review was undertaken in accordance with the eight-step process published by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group. Medline (all databases), Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest Central were systematically searched with predefined search terms organized across four key concepts relating to the research questions. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this rapid review. Reading and spelling instruction and intervention using telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice assessment for reading and spelling can be equally effective as onsite assessment. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The evidence base for telepractice delivery of reading and spelling procedures is in its infancy in terms of both the quantity and the quality of the evidence. Insufficient evidence exists to draw clear conclusions about its efficacy, and therefore practitioners should proceed cautiously. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject For onsite delivery, evidence-based reading and spelling assessment, instruction and interventions delivered by educators and allied health practitioners have been shown to accelerate students' skills; less is known about the efficacy of instructional reading and spelling procedures in a telepractice model, which have rapidly become the new norm in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of telepractice include improved access to services, increased service availability, convenience, time efficiency, caseload management efficiency and removal of logistical barriers relating to cost and geographical location. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telepractice has facilitated continued access to services. What this study adds to existing knowledge Reading and spelling instruction and intervention delivered via telepractice can be feasible and engaging. Telepractice is a viable mode to deliver reading and spelling assessments with strong agreement between telepractice and onsite scores. Given their low methodological quality, the studies in this review provide valuable information around the how of telepractice reading and spelling procedures and highlight the factors that may contribute to positive outcomes with this service delivery model. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Educators and allied health practitioners need a thorough understanding of the student's telepractice environment and require adequate training and support to engage in telepractice service delivery. Educators and allied health practitioners should consider students for telepractice on a case-by-case basis. Practitioners should proceed cautiously with telepractice reading and spelling assessment, intervention and instruction, with the knowledge that the current available evidence is of limited quality.","Furlong, Lisa; Serry, Tanya; Bridgman, Kate; Erickson, Shane",Int J Lang Commun Disord,248,33

METHODS: Seventy-four COVID-19 patients admitted between March 16th and June 3rd 2020 to the Asklepios Lung Clinic Munich-Gauting, Germany, were included in the study. Patients were categorized in a non-severe group including patients hospitalized on general wards only and in a severe group including patients requiring intensive care treatment. Fully automated quantification of CT scans was performed via IMBIO CT Lung Texture analysis&#8482; software. Predictive biomarkers were assessed with receiver-operator-curve and likelihood analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (44% female) presented with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 patients (32% female) with severe disease. Five fatalities were reported in the severe group. Accurate automated CT analysis was possible with 61 CTs (82%). Disease severity was linked to lower residual normal lung (72.5% vs 87%, p = 0.003), increased ground glass opacities (GGO) (8% vs 5%, p = 0.031) and increased reticular pattern (8% vs 2%, p = 0.025). Disease severity was associated with advanced age (76 vs 59 years, p = 0.001) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 92.2 vs 36.3 mg/L, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 485 vs 268 IU/L, p < 0.001) and oxygen supplementation (p < 0.001) upon admission. Predictive risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were oxygen supplementation, LDH >313 IU/L, CRP >71 mg/L, <70% normal lung texture, >12.5% GGO and >4.5% reticular pattern. CONCLUSION: Automated low dose CT analysis upon admission might be a useful tool to predict COVID-19 severity in patients.","Stoleriu, Mircea Gabriel; Gerckens, Michael; Obereisenbuchner, Florian; Zaimova, Iva; Hetrodt, Justin; Mavi, Sarah-Christin; Schmidt, Felicitas; Schoenlebe, Anna Auguste; Heinig-Menhard, Katharina; Koch, Ina; Jörres, Rudolf A; Spiro, Judith; Nowak, Lorenz; Hatz, Rudolf; Behr, Jürgen; Gesierich, Wolfgang; Heiß-Neumann, Marion; Dinkel, Julien",Clin Imaging,248,16

We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.","Guzik, Tomasz J; Mohiddin, Saidi A; Dimarco, Anthony; Patel, Vimal; Savvatis, Kostas; Marelli-Berg, Federica M; Madhur, Meena S; Tomaszewski, Maciej; Maffia, Pasquale; D039,; Acquisto, Fulvio; Nicklin, Stuart A; Marian, Ali J; Nosalski, Ryszard; Murray, Eleanor C; Guzik, Bartlomiej; Berry, Colin; Touyz, Rhian M; Kreutz, Reinhold; Wang, Dao Wen; Bhella, David; Sagliocco, Orlando; Crea, Filippo; Thomson, Emma C; McInnes, Iain B",Cardiovasc Res,248,13

The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. On the basis of the genotyping of 75775 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation (i.e., L37F at nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6)). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Artificial intelligence, sequence alignment, and network analysis are applied to show that NSP6 mutation L37F may have compromised the virus's ability to undermine the innate cellular defense against viral infection via autophagy regulation. This assessment is in good agreement with our genotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.","Wang, Rui; Chen, Jiahui; Hozumi, Yuta; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",J Phys Chem Lett,248,22

The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. DATA SOURCES: Literature review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a ""one-size-fits-all"" manner. The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment. Although data from the literature regarding the previous coronavirus infections can give some insights, more studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms of acute kidney injury occurring as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.","Redant, Sébastien; De Bels, David; Honoré, Patrick M",Crit. care med,248,29

In particular, we collected 9 million Twitter messages from 1.5 million users and constructed the retweet networks. We identified communities with explicit political orientation and topics of discussion associated to them which provide the topological representation of the political map on Twitter in the analyzed periods. With that data, we present a machine learning framework for social media users classification which efficiently detects""shifting users""(i.e. users that may change their affiliation over time). Moreover, this machine learning framework allows us to identify not only which topics are more persuasive (using low dimensional topic embedding), but also which individuals are more likely to change their affiliation given their topological properties in a Twitter graph.","Albanese, Federico; Lombardi, Leandro; Feuerstein, Esteban; Balenzuela, Pablo",,248,24

Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic. METHODS: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability. RESULTS: Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues.","Rehani, Bhavya; Rodriguez, Jose A; Nguyen, Jeffers K; Patel, Mauli M; Ammanuel, Simon G; Winford, Elliott; Dillon, William P",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,248,1

However, it would hardly be justified to argue that teachers and students were well-prepared for such a swift change. Accordingly, this transformation has resulted in many difficulties for teachers and students along with educational institutions. One of the primary challenges teachers have experienced throughout the process is creating a positive online classroom climate. Thus, the main purpose of the present study is to reveal the online learning climate perceptions of pre-service teachers by adapting and using the Online Learning Climate Scale (OLCS) in Turkish context. In a similar vein, such variables as gender, department or grade level, which may have an influence on the perceptions of pre-service teachers, are also aimed to be disclosed within the study. The research has been conducted with a study group of 348 pre-service teachers. It has been observed that the pre-service teachers' perceptions on online learning climate are at less than moderate level;therefore, far from satisfactory. Additionally, it has been noted that variables such as the department, grade level and level of digital literacy have an influence on the OLCS perceptions of the pre-service teachers. Finally, the overall results of the study suggest that the skill of creating a positive online learning climate needs to be improved for pre-service teachers via integrating courses into the curriculum of teacher training institutions and organizing subject-specific trainings.","Önal, Ahmet Özdemir Atilla",Journal of Educational Technology and Online Learning,248,10

The possibility of developing an effective vaccine for a novel pandemic virus is not assured. However, as we have seen with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, with sufficient resources and global focus, successful outcomes can be achieved in a relatively short period. However even when vaccine is available it will initially be scarce. When one becomes available, how should it be distributed? In this paper we explicate how ethical thinking that is carefully attuned to context is essential to decisions about how we should conduct vaccination in a pandemic where demand exceeds supply. We focus on two key issues. First, setting the aims for a pandemic vaccination programme. Second, thinking about the means of delivering a chosen aim. We outline how pandemic vaccine distribution strategies can be implemented with distinct aims, e.g. protecting groups at greater risk of harm, saving the most lives, or ensuring societal benefit. Each aim will result in a focus on a different priority population and each strategy will have a different benefit-harm profile. Once we have decided our aim, we still have choices to make about delivery. We may achieve at least some ends via direct or indirect strategies. Such policy decisions are not merely technical, but necessarily involve ethics. One important general issue is that such planning decisions about distribution will always be made under conditions of uncertainty about vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, planning how to distribute vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is even harder because we understand relatively little about the virus, transmission, and its immunological impact in the short and long term.","Williams, Jane; Degeling, Chris; McVernon, Jodie; Dawson, Angus",Vaccine,248,1

This Rostrum examines the actual risk of in-person learning among children with asthma during novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the discrepancy between perceived and actual risk, the contributing factors to this discrepancy, and possible solutions to narrow this divide. Overall, the evidence does not support that children with asthma are at an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality compared with children without asthma. Asthma medications do not appear to contribute to incidence or severity of COVID-19 disease. However, there is a high perceived risk of in-person learning that is partially related to how it is portrayed in the media. There is little guidance regarding transitioning asthmatic children back to school and how to properly counsel on mediation of risk. There are differences regionally and locally around school reopening, exemptions, and their implementation.

People experiencing disability due to COVID-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. The aim of this article is to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19. The first rapid ""living"" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search in PubMed, Pedro, and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: ""COVID-19,"" ""Coronavirus,"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"" ""rehabilitation,"" ""physical therapy modalities,"" ""exercise,"" ""occupational therapy,"" and ""late complications."" Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, nine were included in the present review. Four of them are ""calls for action"", three provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, two address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and one provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with COVID-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in COVID-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.","Ceravolo, Maria G; de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Negrini, Stefano",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,248,24

We suggest, however, that N95s may be just as important for the care of patients without suspected Covid-19 when community incidence rates are high. This is because SARS-CoV-2 is most contagious before symptom onset. Ironically, by the time patients are sick enough to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 they tend to be less contagious. The greatest threat of transmission in healthcare facilities may therefore be patients and healthcare workers with early occult infection. N95s' superior fit and filtration provide superior exposure protection for healthcare providers seeing patients with early undiagnosed infection and superior source control to protect patients from healthcare workers with early undiagnosed infection. The probability of occult infection in patients and healthcare workers is greatest when community incidence rates are high. Universal use of N95s may help decrease nosocomial transmission at such times.","Klompas, Michael; Rhee, Chanu; Baker, Meghan",Clin. infect. dis,248,10

The purpose of this study was to explore early childhood educators' perspectives on how COVID-19 guidelines have impacted the nutrition and physical activity practices within their ECEC environment. A qualitative description approach was used to explore a purposive sample of 17 educators working full time in ECEC centres during the pandemic between July and August 2020. Semi-structured, individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a thematic analysis. Educators identified environmental changes in their environments noting a reduction in the quality food available for children juxtaposed with increased outdoor opportunities and a perceived increase in physical activity time. Teaching practices were also identified as being impacted by the COVID-19 guidelines. Curriculum, life skills, and social connectedness around healthy eating education was disrupted. Promoting physical activity education was challenged due to equipment, space, and curriculum enrichment opportunities losses. These findings demonstrate pronounced negative effects of COVID guidelines on nutrition and physical activity best practices within the ECEC environment.

Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (N = 6,172 unique participants; N = 28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modeled the interaction of time by COVID-19 burden, defined as whether the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster than those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002).

Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience. OBJECTIVE: To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. METHODS: We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS: Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients. CONCLUSION: Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow. In addition, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these nurses created a new strategy in virtual health care to be implemented during a crisis.","Arneson, Sandy L; Tucker, Sara J; Mercier, Marie; Singh, Jaspal",Crit Care Nurse,248,16

This retrospective study investigated the implications of changes in blood coagulation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Records were reviewed for patients admitted with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. A total of 85 patients were included, of whom 12 died in the hospital. The admission prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and levels of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors, while the reverse was true for prothrombin time activity (PT-act) and PaO2/FiO2. Multivariate logistic regression showed that PT-act < 75% was independently associated with mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for PT-act, D-dimer, and FDP at admission could significantly predict mortality. The AUCs for PT-act were larger than those for D-dimer and FDP; however, there was no significant difference. After 2 weeks of treatment, the coagulation parameters of the surviving patients improved. COVID-19 is often accompanied by abnormal coagulation. PT-act at admission is able to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 as can D-dimer and FDP levels. PT-act < 75% is independently associated with mortality.","Luo, Hong-Chun; You, Cheng-Yan; Lu, Si-Wei; Fu, Yue-Qiang",Ann Hematol,248,16

514765,514765,514765,A case report of simultaneous autoimmune and COVID-19 encephalitis,16.069704,9.891983,2021,"COVID-19 has spread to all countries around the world after it was first discovered in Wuhan of China at the end of 2019. It is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with much semblance to SARS-CoV including the sequence homology and disease symptoms. It is reported to be more infectious than SARS-CoV due to higher binding affinities between its spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on cell surface. Despite this, its case fatality rate is much lower compared with that of SARS-CoV although it varies in different countries. However, the case fatality rate increases steadily with age and it is reported to be the highest in aged COVID-19 male patients in almost all countries. Consistent with these, females have higher antiviral immune responses. Males and females are different in inflammatory response and aberrantly hyperactive cytokines are the main lethal causes of COVID-19. Interestingly, the gene encoding the ACE2 receptor protein and some genes encoding the immune regulatory proteins such as TLR7 are located on X chromosome which is subject to X chromosome inactivation and sex hormone regulation. These may account for some sex-dependent immune responses and lethality observed in COVID-19 patients. In general, children are less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only less than 1% of pediatric COVID-19 patients may die of COVID-19. However, the most severe pediatric cases become multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is similar to Kawasiki disease with features of viral infection. Since most infected kids were boys in China, there may be sex-dependent immune response in pediatric COVID-19 cases as well.","Li, Albert Jiarui; Li, Xiajun",Stem Cell Res,248,4

However, DNA methylations in the peripheral blood tissues are usually measured at the bulk level based on a heterogeneous population of white blood cells. Using the bulk level DNA methylation data in mediation analysis might cause confounding bias and reduce study power. Therefore, it is crucial to get fine-grained results by detecting mediation CpG sites in a cell-type-specific way. However, there is a lack of methods and software to achieve this goal. We propose a novel method (Mediation In a Cell-type-Specific fashion, MICS) to identify cell-type-specific mediation effects in genome-wide epigenetic studies using only the bulk-level DNA methylation data. MICS follows the standard mediation analysis paradigm and consists of three key steps. In step1, we assess the exposure-mediator association for each cell type; in step 2, we assess the mediator-outcome association for each cell type; in step 3, we combine the cell-type-specific exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations using a multiple testing procedure named MultiMed [Sampson JN, Boca SM, Moore SC, et al. FWER and FDR control when testing multiple mediators. Bioinformatics 2018;34:2418-24] to identify significant CpGs with cell-type-specific mediation effects. We conduct simulation studies to demonstrate that our method has correct FDR control. We also apply the MICS procedure to the Normative Aging Study and identify nine DNA methylation CpG sites in the lymphocytes that might mediate the effect of cigarette smoking on the lung function.","Luo, Xiangyu; Schwartz, Joel; Baccarelli, Andrea; Liu, Zhonghua",Brief. bioinform,248,1

This study aimed to calculate the transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to control the disease in Jilin Province, China. METHODS: The data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected, including imported and local cases from Jilin Province as of March 14, 2019. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered/Removed (SEIAR) model was developed to fit the data, and the effective reproduction number (Reff) was calculated at different stages in the province. Finally, the effectiveness of the measures was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 97 COVID-19 infections were reported in Jilin Province, among which 45 were imported infections (including one asymptomatic infection) and 52 were local infections (including three asymptomatic infections). The model fit the reported data well (R2 = 0.593, P < 0.001). The Reff of COVID-19 before and after February 1, 2020 was 1.64 and 0.05, respectively. Without the intervention taken on February 1, 2020, the predicted cases would have reached a peak of 177,011 on October 22, 2020 (284 days from the first case). The projected number of cases until the end of the outbreak (on October 9, 2021) would have been 17,129,367, with a total attack rate of 63.66%. Based on the comparison between the predicted incidence of the model and the actual incidence, the comprehensive intervention measures implemented in Jilin Province on February 1 reduced the incidence of cases by 99.99%. Therefore, according to the current measures and implementation efforts, Jilin Province can achieve good control of the virus's spread.

In the first 20 weeks, 1310 individuals were screened for eligibility by phone contact. Contact rate was 89% (contacted participants/20w), preliminary screening success 28% (participants underwent screening/20w), and recruitment rate 1.0 participants/week (eligible participants/20w). The recruitment rate was less than the ideal rate of 5 participants/week. The adherence to the exercises programme was 77%, and the dropout was 11% and 9% for the IG and CG, respectively. In the IG, participants' median level of satisfaction was 4 (IQR: 4-5) and perceived safety was 3 (IQR: 3-5). IG significantly decreased the DPN severity (p = 0.020), increased hallux relative to forefoot (first metatarsal) range of motion (ROM) (p < 0.001) and decreased maximum forefoot relative to hindfoot (midfoot motion) dorsiflexion during gait (p = 0.029). The home-based programme was feasible, satisfactory, safe and showed preliminary positive changes in DPN severity and foot motion during gait.Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04008745.

In this consecutive study, we analysed RB and optic nerve biopsies (ONBs) in deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 assessing viral RNA load, possible virus replication and infectivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case series, 14 eyes of 14 deceased patients with COVID-19 were enucleated during autopsy. RB and ONB were subjected to molecular detection of viral RNA, virus cultivation and immunohistochemistry. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the respective throat swabs, vitreous humour and blood samples. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7/14 RBs and in 10/13 ONBs. While virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) was detectable (40% RB; 60% ONB). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in RB and ONB of patients with COVID-19. Presence of sgRNA could point to a SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuronal tissue, but as virus isolation failed and immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was negative, an active infection seems unlikely.","Casagrande, Maria; Fitzek, Antonia; Spitzer, Martin; Püschel, Klaus; Glatzel, Markus; Krasemann, Susanne; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Nörz, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Schultheiss, Maximilian",Br J Ophthalmol,248,1

For any TTI strategy, however, mitigation is challenged by pre- and asymptomatic transmission, TTI-avoiders, and undetected spreaders, which strongly contribute to ”hidden"" infection chains. Here, we study a semi-analytical model and identify two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread: (1) the behavior-driven reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the hidden chains becomes too large to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of new infections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-accelerating spread. We investigate how these tipping points depend on challenges like limited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our results suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwise unhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures like social distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary.","Contreras, Sebastian; Dehning, Jonas; Loidolt, Matthias; Zierenberg, Johannes; Spitzner, F.

The viruses are genetically close to the classical U.S. H1N1 and triple-reassortant H1N2 and H3N2 viruses, respectively. Comparative pathogenesis caused by Korean H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 SIV was evaluated in this study. FINDINGS: The H3N2 infected pigs had severe scores of gross and histopathological lesions at post-inoculation days (PID) 2, and this then progressively decreased. Both the H1N1 and H1N2 infected pigs lacked gross lesions at PID 2, but they showed moderate to severe pneumonia on PID 4, 7 and 14. The pigs infected with H1N1 had significant scores of gross and histopathological lesions when compared with the other pigs infected with H1N2, H3N2, and mock at PID 14. Mean SIV antigen-positive scores were rarely detected for pigs infected with H1N2 and H3N2 from PID 7, whereas a significantly increased amount of viral antigens were found in the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium of the H1N1infected pigs at PID 14. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that Korean SIV subtypes had different pulmonary pathologic patterns. The Korean H3N2 rapidly induced acute lung lesions such as broncho-interstitial pneumonia, while the Korean H1N1 showed longer course of infection as compared to other strains.","Lyoo, Kwang-Soo; Kim, Jeong-Ki; Jung, Kwonil; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Song, Daesub",Virol J,248,20

Maternity services, including antenatal care, labour and delivery as well as postnatal care have been affected directly and indirectly by the pandemic and resultant control interventions, with delays introduced at several points across the continuum of care. Unfortunately, maternity conditions are time-sensitive, and delays can negatively impact feto-maternal outcomes, with increased maternal, fetal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. An audit at central hospitals revealed reduced utilisation of maternity services and a trend towards an increase in maternal mortality. A formal evaluation is required; however, mitigating public health interventions are required, especially as the burden of COVID-19 in the country has considerably come down. The World Health Organisation offers useful technical guidance for maintaining essential health services in pandemic times in low-resources settings, and rationalising the use of personal protective equipment, which can be contextualised and adopted to restore and maintain essential health services. Restoration of essential maternity services is urgently required in an environment that protects healthcare workers and their clients, minimising their risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst optimising fetomaternal outcomes. Thus, the various stakeholders involved in maternity care must urgently come together and find ways of achieving this goal.","Murewanhema, Grant; Nyakanda, Munyaradzi Innocent; Madziyire, Mugove Gerald",Pan Afr Med J,248,24

Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1- and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K(B) = (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10(5) M(−1)). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application.","Veiga, Salomé; Yuan, Yunyun; Li, Xuqin; Santos, Nuno C.; Liu, Gang; Castanho, Miguel A.R.B.",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,248,1

A total of 401 fitness professionals answered the online questionnaire Job Satisfaction Scale, which has 16 factors rated on a Likert scale with seven levels. The statistical analysis comprises descriptive and statistical tests to compare the results of two (t-test) or more (ANOVA) groups. Overall, the results demonstrated that fitness professionals were moderately satisfied with their work. The lower degrees of job satisfaction were concerning salary, opportunities for promotion, and stability at work. The highest levels of job satisfaction were related to the freedom to choose their work method, their work colleagues, the physical conditions of their workplace, and the opportunity to use their competencies. There were no differences in job satisfaction in terms of gender and a few differences between professional title and between educational levels. Regarding age and professional experience, the results showed significant differences in almost all factors, suggesting that, as fitness professionals get older and more experienced, their job satisfaction is greater. The results of this study suggest that even though fitness professionals are, in general, moderately satisfied with their work, some aspects can be improved by employers to increase their satisfaction levels. Such findings would assist employers in guiding the job satisfaction of their employees with consequent enhancements in the services provided by fitness professionals, which can increase participants’ retention in exercise fitness activities.","Ramos, Liliana Ricardo; Esteves, Dulce; Vieira, Isabel; Franco, Susana; Simões, Vera",Front Psychol,248,28

A broad differential should be considered for every single patient who is currently ill (eg, all patients with respiratory illnesses); without it, there will likely be an increase of misdiagnosis, unnecessary patient suffering, and an influx of patients to the emergency department. The COVID-19 response has forced many of these basic medical values aside, like providing differential diagnosis or practicing bedside manner through social interaction, while physicians struggle to continue care for patients. As a result, newly formed hospital and clinical policies may have dangerously traded everyday diagnosis and treatment of patients for the pandemic and quarantine recommendations. This type of assumptive medicine is based on a singular differential that can be detrimental to patients, who are more likely affected with more common illnesses, like bronchitis or pneumonia—or perhaps, even more threatening illnesses, like a pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure and even lung cancer. Although these new policies and reactions to COVID-19 are proactive, these actions could be at the cost of providing quality patient care for people who have not contracted COVID-19.","Zolnikov, Tessa; Zolnikov, Tara Rava",J Prim Care Community Health,248,20

Higher NFL serum concentrations were associated with worse clinical outcomes. In 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, a trend toward lower NFL serum concentrations was observed.

Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic. We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries. Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases. Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only. Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August. We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection.

There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people’s accounts on their behaviours in a sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (May 1–31, 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (August 5 –September 21, 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken.681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual’s control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was reported by interviewees as, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, environmental constraints, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence was statistically associated with and reported as lack of trust in Government, support from friends, and lack of knowledge about rules. In addition, interviewees reported individual risk assessment and decision making on the extent to following the rules, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area. Our findings indicate that unintentional and intentional non-adherence should be improved by Government partnerships with local communities to build trust in social distancing measures; tailored messaging to young adults emphasising the need of protecting others whilst clarifying the risk of transmission; and ensuring COVID-secured environments by working with environmental health officers.","Eraso, Yolanda; Hills, Stephen",PLoS One,248,16

The coronaviral entry requires the spike (S)-protein for attachment to the host cell surface, and employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S-protein priming. Although coronaviruses undergo evolution by mutating themselves, it is also essential to know the host genetic factors. Here, we describe the single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in human ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: The genetic variants derived from five population-sequencing projects were classified by variant type, allele frequency (AF), ethnic group and estimated pathogenicity. The SNVs in SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues were investigated. The genetic variability was normalised using non-linear regression and the total number of SNVs was estimated by the derived formulas. RESULTS: We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. The vast majority (>97%) of the SNVs were very rare (AF <0.1%) and population-specific, and were computationally estimated to be more frequently deleterious than the SNVs with high AF. These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1×10(3) and 1.5×10(3), respectively, for a population of one million people. CONCLUSION: The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.","Fujikura, Kohei; Uesaka, Kazuma",J Clin Pathol,248,22

It presents with a highly variable disease course ranging from a large proportion of asymptomatic cases to severe respiratory failure in 17-29% of cases even in the absence of apparent comorbidities 1, 2. This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The immunological characteristics underlying these divergent disease courses, however, still remain elusive. While insights into abrogations of innate immunity begin to emerge, adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 are poorly investigated, although they serve as immune signatures of protection and vaccine responses. We therefore set out to characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity. Methods: We performed high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent COVID-19 patients who we stratified according to their disease severity by a physician-assisted questionnaire based assessment of COVID-19 symptoms. Results: Surprisingly, we did not observe any difference in the relative proportions of any major immune cell type in convalescent patients presenting with different severity of COVID-19 disease except for a reduction in monocytes. The frequency of Tnaive T cells was significantly reduced in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whereas other T cell differentiations states (TCM, TEM, TEMRA) remained relatively unaffected by COVID-19 severity as assessed approximately two weeks after infection. Conclusions In our COVID-19 patient cohort, which is characterized by absence of comorbidities and therapeutic interventions other than symptomatic antipyretics, the immunophenotype is similar irrespective of a highly variable disease severity. Convalescence is therefore associated with a rather uniform immune signature. Abrogations, which were previously identified in the innate and adaptive immune compartment of COVID-19 patients should be scrutinized for direct associations with a preconditioned immune system shaped and made vulnerable for SARS-CoV-2 by preexisting comorbidities.","Chu, C.-F.; Sabath, F.; Sun, S.; Chao, Y.-Y.; Zielinski, C.

However, its expression within tumors has been linked with poor prognosis in both humans and dogs. Accordingly, several reports have demonstrated the beneficial effects of blocking CSF-1R in model systems of cancer. In this study, we generated a monoclonal antibody that could block CSF-1R in dogs as the first step to develop an anticancer drug for this species. Initially, an antibody was raised by the hybridoma methodology against the fragment responsible for receptor dimerization. mAb3.1, one of the resulting hybridoma clones, was able to bind macrophages in fixed tissues and was shown to inhibit cells of the mononuclear phagocytic line. Nevertheless, mAb 3.1 could not bind to some glycoforms of the receptor in its native form, while also demonstrating cross-reactivity with other proteins. To enhance binding properties of the mAb, five amino acids of the complementarity-determining region 2 of the variable heavy chain of mAb3.1 were mutated by PCR, and the variant scFv clones were screened by phage display. The selected scFv clones demonstrated improved binding to the native receptor as well as increased anti-macrophage activity. The resulting scFv antibody fragment presented here has the potential for use in cancer patients and in inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the use of such restricted mutations in antibody engineering.","Beirão, Breno C B; Raposo, Teresa P; Imamura, Louise M; Ingberman, Max; Hupp, Ted; Vojtěšek, Bořivoj; Argyle, David J",Antib Ther,248,1

Results: We discovered two types of challenges to teamwork: material barriers related to wearing masks, gowns, and powered air purifying respirators, and spatial barriers implemented to conserve PPE and limit coronavirus exposure. Both material and spatial barriers resulted in disrupted communication, roles, and interpersonal relationships, but did so in unique ways. Material barriers muffled information flow, impeded team member recognition and role/task division, and reduced belonging and cohesion while increasing interpersonal strain. Spatial barriers resulted in mediated communication, and added physical and emotional distance between teammates and patients.

Even though some of these new digital interventions are ostensibly designed to be temporary ones to address the needs of the immediate crisis, we argue that the resultant extensions of state power experienced during COVID-19 are likely to have profound long-term effects because they fundamentally affect sociopolitical contexts, institutional capabilities, and digital cultures.

Though the COVID-19 virus outbreak has changed the daily lives of children and youth, it is unknown to what extent related restrictions may compromise the ability to play and meet movement behaviour recommendations. This secondary data analysis examined the immediate impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on movement and play behaviours in children and youth. METHODS: A national sample of Canadian parents (n = 1472) of children (5–11 years) or youth (12–17 years) (54% girls) completed an online survey that assessed immediate changes in child movement and play behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak. Behaviours included PA and play, SB, and sleep. Family demographics and parental factors that may influence movement behaviours were assessed. Correlations between behaviours and demographic and parental factors were determined. For open-ended questions, word frequency distributions were reported. RESULTS: Only 4.8% (2.8% girls, 6.5% boys) of children and 0.6% (0.8% girls, 0.5% boys) of youth were meeting combined movement behaviour guidelines during COVID-19 restrictions. Children and youth had lower PA levels, less outside time, higher SB (including leisure screen time), and more sleep during the outbreak. Parental encouragement and support, parental engagement in PA, and family dog ownership were positively associated with healthy movement behaviours. Although families spent less time in PA and more time in SB, several parents reported adopting new hobbies or accessing new resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of immediate collateral consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, demonstrating an adverse impact on the movement and play behaviours of Canadian children and youth. These findings can guide efforts to preserve and promote child health during the COVID-19 outbreak and crisis recovery period, and to inform strategies to mitigate potential harm during future pandemics.","Moore, Sarah A.; Faulkner, Guy; Rhodes, Ryan E.; Brussoni, Mariana; Chulak-Bozzer, Tala; Ferguson, Leah J.; Mitra, Raktim; O’Reilly, Norm; Spence, John C.; Vanderloo, Leigh M.; Tremblay, Mark S.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,248,20

One cause for skepticism is that biological correlates of the administrative and clinical data used in these systems have not been rigorously assessed. This study measures the value of respiratory data currently used in syndromic surveillance systems to detect respiratory infections by comparing it against criterion standard viral testing within a pediatric population. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study with prospective validation in the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care children’s hospital. Children aged 7 years or younger who presented with a respiratory syndrome or who were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, or enterovirus between January 1993 and June 2004 were included. We assessed the predictive ability of the viral tests by fitting generalized linear models to respiratory syndrome counts. RESULTS: Of 582,635 patient visits, 89,432 (15.4%) were for respiratory syndromes, and of these, 7,206 (8.1%) patients were tested for the viruses of interest. RSV was significantly related to respiratory syndrome counts (adjusted rate ratio [RR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.71). In multivariate models including all viruses tested, influenza virus was also a significant predictor of respiratory syndrome counts (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.10). This model accounted for 81.6% of the observed variability in respiratory syndrome counts. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syndromic surveillance data strongly correlate with virologic test results in a pediatric population, providing evidence of the biologic validity of such surveillance systems. Real-time outbreak detection systems relying on syndromic data may be an important adjunct to the current set of public health systems for the detection and surveillance of respiratory infections.","Bourgeois, Florence T.; Olson, Karen L.; Brownstein, John S.; McAdam, Alexander J.; Mandl, Kenneth D.",Ann Emerg Med,248,16

This study investigates whether there were any changes in the water quality of the Lower Min River (China) during the lockdown period. The time-series remote sensing images from November 2019 to April 2020 was used to examine the dynamics of the river’s total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the period. A new remote sensing-based prototype was developed to recalibrate an existing algorithm for retrieving TSS concentrations in the river. The Nechad and the Novoa algorithms were used to validate the recalibrated algorithm. The results show that the recalibrated algorithm is highly consistent with the two algorithms. All of the three algorithms indicate significant fluctuation in TSS concentrations in the Lower Min River during the study period. February (COVID-19 lockdown period) has witnessed a 48% fall in TSS concentration. The TSS in March–April showed a progressive and recovery back to normal levels of pre-COVID-19. The spatiotemporal change of TSS has worked as a good indicator of human activities, which revealed that the decline of TSS in the lockdown period was due largely to the substantially-reduced discharges from industrial estates, densely-populated city center, and river’s shipping. Remote sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal changes of TSS helps understand important contributors to the water-quality changes in the river and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on river systems.","Xu, Hanqiu; Xu, Guangzhi; Wen, Xiaole; Hu, Xiujuan; Wang, Yifan",International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,248,1

Research relating to COVID-19 aims to determine the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations who are at high risk of developing negative health or psychosocial outcomes. Having an ongoing medical condition during a pandemic may lead to greater psychological distress. Increased psychological distress may be due to preventative public health measures (e.g. lockdown), having an ongoing medical condition, or a combination of these factors. METHODS: This study analyses data from an online cross-sectional national survey of adults in Ireland and investigates the relationship between comorbidity and psychological distress. Those with a medical condition (n = 128) were compared to a control group without a medical condition (n = 128) and matched according to age, gender, annual income, education, and work status during COVID-19. Participants and data were obtained during the first public lockdown in Ireland (27 March 2020–8 June 2020). RESULTS: Individuals with existing medical conditions reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p < .01) and felt less gratitude (p ≤ .001). Exploratory analysis indicated that anxiety levels were significantly associated with illness perceptions specific to COVID-19. Post hoc analysis revealed that psychological well-being was not significantly related to condition type (e.g. respiratory disorders). CONCLUSION: This research supports individualised supports for people with ongoing medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has implications for the consideration of follow-up care specifically for mental health. Findings may also inform future public health policies and post-vaccine support strategies for vulnerable populations.","Stafford, Owen; Berry, Anna; Taylor, Laura K; Wearen, Sinead; Prendergast, Cian; Murphy, Eddie; Shevlin, Mark; McHugh, Louise; Carr, Alan; Burke, Tom",Irish journal of psychological medicine,248,7

There is an emerging need for IPE in Korea in the context of developing strategies for continuous quality control and improvement of medical services in hospitals and especially avoidance of patient safety. However, despite its importance and necessity, IPE in Korea appears to remain in its starting stage. The aim of this study is to introduce “CHA IPE Bridge”, a center for IPE that was established CHA University in Korea in 2018. METHODS: According to the subject and purpose of this study, I have to conduct a “case study” with “literature search” as a basic research method. After conducting a literature (books and articles) & websites search on the history and trends of IPE in the world and the current status of IPE in Korea, I intend to examine the status and meaning of the CHA IPE Bridge based on those backgrounds. RESULTS: According to Harden’s 11 steps of IPE, IPE courses and programs developed CHA IPE Bridge have reached the level of “multidisciplinary'” belonging to the ninth step. In fact, few cases in Korea have achieved that level of IPE. Furthermore, CHA IPE Bridge develops IPE courses that go beyond the range of doctors and nurses to other occupations related to the field of health care. In view of such differences, the introduction of CHA IPE Bridge is expected to provide a positive stimulus to other universities in Korea. CONCLUSION: The greatest achievement of this study is that the CHA IPE Bridge’s status in the field of domestic and international medical education and its positive impact has been revealed. Although this case only shows examples of the development and operation of IPE programs at the undergraduate level, it can be seen that even in Korea, if the operation strategy is well established, the application of IPE is never impossible.","Choi, Jaijeong",Korean J Med Educ,248,20

For improving the physical functions affected by a neurological disorder, rehabilitation procedures are mandatory, and they must be performed regularly. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation procedures have disadvantages in terms of costs, accessibility and a lack of therapists. This paper presents Immersive Neurorehabilitation Exercises Using Virtual Reality (INREX-VR), our innovative immersive neurorehabilitation system using virtual reality. The system is based on a thorough research methodology and is able to capture real-time user movements and evaluate joint mobility for both upper and lower limbs, record training sessions and save electromyography data. The use of the first-person perspective increases immersion, and the joint range of motion is calculated with the help of both the HTC Vive system and inverse kinematics principles applied on skeleton rigs. Tutorial exercises are demonstrated by a virtual therapist, as they were recorded with real-life physicians, and sessions can be monitored and configured through tele-medicine. Complex movements are practiced in gamified settings, encouraging self-improvement and competition. Finally, we proposed a training plan and preliminary tests which show promising results in terms of accuracy and user feedback. As future developments, we plan to improve the system’s accuracy and investigate a wireless alternative based on neural networks.","Stanica, Iulia-Cristina; Moldoveanu, Florica; Portelli, Giovanni-Paul; Dascalu, Maria-Iuliana; Moldoveanu, Alin; Ristea, Mariana Georgiana",Sensors (Basel),248,18

The viral infected cells exhibit a complicated cross-talking between autophagy and virus. It has been shown that autophagy interacts with both adaptive and innate immunity. For adaptive immunity, viral antigens can be processed in autophagosomes by acidic proteases before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation. For innate immunity, autophagy may assist in the delivery of viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs and also functions as a part of the TLR-or-PKR-downstream responses. Autophagy was also reported to suppress the magnitude of host innate antiviral immunity in certain cases. On the other hand, viruses has evolved many strategies to combat or utilize the host autophagy for their own benefit. In this review we discussed recent advances toward clarifying the cross-talking between autophagy and viral infection in mammalian cells.","Han, Hongya; Zhang, Lishu; Dai, Xinxian; Zheng, Yanpeng",Front Biol (Beijing),248,19

Mean wind flow around each building model and wind-induced flow inside re-entrant bays are computed. To determine the ventilation efficiency of the bay, the computed flow field is used to disperse a scalar pollutant initially occupying the entire bay at a uniform concentration. The subsequent time decay of pollutant concentration inside the bay is studied and the ventilation efficiency is quantified by the retention time. The results show that wind-induced flow inside the bay, especially on the building side face, is complex and highly three-dimensional. Air exchange rates through the roof opening and vertical side opening are analyzed for each bay and their relationship to the ventilation efficiency is discussed. The bays on the building side faces are much worse ventilated than those on the windward or leeward building face. The deeper the side bay, the worse is the air exchange and ventilation. The building height is found to have a governing effect on the ventilation of the windward and leeward re-entrant bays.","Cheng, C.K.C.; Lam, K. M.; Leung, Y.T.A.; Yang, K.; Li Danny, H.

SARS‐CoV‐2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic‐structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS‐CoV‐2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS‐CoV‐2 (AS‐SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS‐SCoV2 located in the acidic‐domain of papain‐like protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 and bat‐SL‐CoV‐RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat‐SL‐CoV‐RaTG13.

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.

The system requires only 3.12 W of power for the fans, and the average relative cooling coefficient in summer and the average relative heating coefficient can reach 50.6 and 57.9, respectively. The optimal operating current and voltage of TE modules and photovoltaic system is analyzed, and then the number and types of electrical connections for the TE modules in SDEATHP system are discussed. The SDEATHP system provides a new method for building energy recovery and fresh air supply.","Liu, Zhongbing; Li, Weijiao; Zhang, Ling; Wu, Zhenghong; Luo, Yongqiang",Energy Build,248,1

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was suspected by the presence of blister cells on peripheral smear and was confirmed by a low enzyme activity assay. Our patient reported playing football, along with upper respiratory infection symptoms, prior to presentation. Extensive infectious and toxicology workup was negative; however, several inflammatory proteins were markedly elevated. We hypothesized the large inflammatory burden led to an increased reactive oxygen radical burden that overwhelmed muscle and erythrocyte reducing power. Severe rhabdomyolysis in G6PD deficiency is not a common presentation because skeletal muscles are more resistant to oxidative damage compared to red blood cells. Our case adds to the few existing reports of myolysis in the setting of G6PD deficiency.","Eziokwu, Akaolisa S; Angelini, Dana",Cureus,248,20

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive antiviral target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the viral polypeptide. In this study, we performed an in silico structure-based screening of a large chemical library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors. Among 8,820 compounds in the library, our screening identified trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor and an antifungal compound, as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) activity and replication. The half maximal effective concentration of trichostatin A against SARS-CoV-2 replication was 1.5 to 2.7µM, which was markedly below its 50% effective cytotoxic concentration (75.7µM) and peak serum concentration (132µM).

The objective of the study was to determine the acceptability of contact management, home care of simple cases of COVID-19, and its associated factors. Method: This was a sequential mixed-method study. We collected data from June 11, 2020, to July 10, 2020, for the quantitative survey (N=813) and from August 24 to September 16, 2020, for the qualitative survey (N=30). We carried out a sampling strategy using marginal quotas at the national level. We collected data using a structured questionnaire in a telephone interview for the quantitative survey and using an interview guide formulated from the initial results of the quantitative survey for the qualitative data. We assessed acceptability using binomial logistic regression combined with content analysis. Results: The care of simple cases of COVID-19 at home was well accepted (78.5%). This result was justified for some (saturation of the health system) but not for others (risk of contamination). The use of home contact management was less accepted (51.4%), with risk limitation as the main reason given. The acceptability of home-based care for simple cases was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.55 [95%CI: 1.04,2.28]), regular research into COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.12 [95%CI: 1.45,3.12]), belief in the existence of treatment (ORaj: 1.82 [95%CI: 1.19,2.83]), and confidence in institutional information (ORaj: 2.10 [95%CI: 1.43,3.10]). The acceptability of home-based contact management was positively associated with knowledge of the modes of transmission of the virus (ORaj: 1.77 [95%CI: 1.27,2.48]), regular research for information on COVID-19 (ORaj: 2.39 [95%CI: 1.76,3.26]), and confidence in the government in the fight against the epidemic (ORaj: 1.51 [95%CI: 1.10,2.08]). Conclusion: Regular information on the disease, knowledge of its mode of transmission and trust in institutions are factors in accepting COVID-19 management at the community level. Authorities should take these factors into account for better communication to improve the acceptability of home-based care.

As elective surgeries become essential, we propose to evaluate our approach and outcomes of surgical procedures performed during the initial period of COVID-19 pandemic so as to provide a road-map for safer approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients who underwent essential elective and emergency surgeries during the 5-week period between April 18, 2020 and May 28, 2020. All patients were screened at the front desk on their arrival to identify possible exposure to SARS- CoV-2. Nasopharyngeal swab of patients requiring hospital admission was tested for COVID-19 by quantitative RT-PCR. Patients needing essential elective surgery were taken up for surgery if they tested negative for COVID-19. Emergency procedures were undertaken in a demarcated theatre for COVID after taking level-3 protection without delay. The clinical data was reviewed and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 764 surgical procedures were conducted, of which 70.7% were elective essential surgeries, with 95.4% of these patients being discharged in stable healthy condition. Approximately 23% of the elective and 26% of the emergency surgeries was categorised in the surgical difficulty category III and majority of these were performed under general anesthesia. Postoperative mortality was 1.04%, but the overall mortality rate was approximately 2.5%. Only two patients (0.3%) tested positive for COVID-19 in our series. CONCLUSION: A robust preoperative screening and testing can enable safe scheduling of essential elective surgeries.","Gupta, Rama; Mohan, Bishav; Garg, Kamakshi; Taneja, Ashima; Virk, Satpal S.; Grewal, Anju; Mahajan, Rajesh",J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol,248,16

LAB can stimulate the innate antiviral immune defence system in their host, produce antiviral peptides, and release metabolites that prevent either viral replication or adhesion to cell surfaces. The SARS-CoV (COVID-19) pandemic shifted the world’s interest towards the development of vaccines against viral infections. It is hypothesised that the adherence of SARS-CoV spike proteins to the surface of Bifidobacterium breve could elicit an immune response in its host and trigger the production of antibodies. The question now remains as to whether probiotic LAB could be genetically modified to synthesize viral antigens and serve as vaccines—this concept and the role that LAB play in viral infection are explored in this review.","Dicks, Leon M.

In the absence of the right vaccine strain and sufficient antiviral stockpiles on hand, nonpharmaceutical interventions have become valuable public health tools at the early stages of the pandemic and they are employed by many countries across the globe. These interventions are designed to increase social distancing between individuals to reduce the transmission of the virus and eventually dampen the burden on the healthcare system. The virus transmissibility is a function of the average number of contacts individuals have in their communities and it is highly dependent on population density and daily mobility patterns, along with other social factors. These show significant variation across the United States. In this article, we study the effectiveness of social distancing measures in communities with different population density. Specifically, first we show how the empirical estimation of reproduction number differs for two completely different states, thus the experience of the COVID-19 outbreak is drastically different, suggesting different outbreak growth rates in practice. Second, we develop an age-structured compartmental model for simulating the disease spread to demonstrate the variation in the observed outbreak characteristics. We find that early trigger and late trigger options present a trade-off between the peak magnitude and the overall death toll of the outbreak which may also vary across different populations.","Ertem, Z.; Araz, O.; Cruz-Aponte, M.",,248,16

We used data on COVID-19 cases in the city of Wuhan to compare epidemiological characteristics between HCWs and non-HCWs and explored the risk factors for infection and deterioration among HCWs based on hospital settings. The attack rate (AR) of HCWs in the hospital can reach up to 11.9% in Wuhan. The time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis in HCWs and non-HCWs dropped rapidly over time. From mid-January, the median time interval of HCW cases was significantly shorter than in non-HCW cases. Cases of HCWs and non-HCWs both clustered in northwestern urban districts rather than in rural districts. HCWs working in county-level hospitals in high-risk areas were more vulnerable to COVID-19. HCW cases working in general, ophthalmology, and respiratory departments were prone to deteriorate compared with cases working in the infection department. The AR of COVID-19 in HCWs are higher than in non-HCWs. Multiple factors in hospital settings may play important roles in the transmission of COVID-19.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid pulses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods A quasi-experimental study, before and after, was performed in a tertiary referral hospital, including admitted patients showing COVID-19-associated pneumonia. The standard treatment protocol included targeted COVID-19 antiviral therapy from 23th March 2020, and additionally pulses of methylprednisolone from 30th March 2020. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint combining oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) and death within 7 days. Results A total of 24 patients were included. Standard of care (SOC) (before intervention) was prescribed in 14 patients, while 10 received SOC plus pulses of methylprednisolone (after intervention). The median age of patients was 64.5 years and 83.3% of the patients were men. The primary composite endpoint occurred in 13 patients (92.9%) who received SOC vs. 2 patients (20%) that received pulses of methylprednisolone (odds ratio, 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.001 to 0.25; P=0.019).

We investigated how different programs approached these challenges to determine best practices. METHODS: Surveys to solicit perspectives of program directors, program coordinators and chief residents regarding virtual interviews were designed through an iterative process by two child neurology residency program directors. Surveys were distributed by email in May 2021. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Responses were received from 35 program directors and 34 program coordinators from 76 programs contacted. Compared to the 2019-2020 recruitment season, in 2020-2021, 14 of 35 programs received >10% more applications and most programs interviewed ≥12 applicants per position. Interview days were typically 5-6 hours long and were often coordinated with Pediatrics interviews. Most programs (13/15) utilized virtual social events with residents, but these often did not allow residents to provide quality feedback about applicants. Program directors could adequately assess most applicant qualities but felt that virtual interviews limited their ability to assess applicants’ interpersonal communication skills and to showcase special features of their programs. Most respondents felt that a combination of virtual and in-person interviewing should be utilized in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Residency program directors perceived some negative impacts of virtual interviewing on their recruitment efforts but in general felt that virtual interviews adequately replaced in person interviews for assessing applicants. Most programs felt that virtual interviewing should be utilized in the future.","Ream, Margie A.; Stone, Robert",Pediatr Neurol,248,16

The objective of this study was to investigate the droplet and splatter contamination from common otologic procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation series. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. METHODS: Two cadaver heads were prepped via bilateral middle cranial fossa approaches to the tegmen (n = 4). Fluorescein was instilled through a 4-mm burr hole drilled into the middle cranial fossa floor, and presence in the middle ear was confirmed via microscopic ear examination. Myringotomy with ventilation tube placement and mastoidectomy were performed, and the distribution and distance of resulting droplet splatter patterns were systematically evaluated. RESULTS: There were no fluorescein droplets or splatter contamination observed in the measured surgical field in any direction after myringotomy and insertion of ventilation tube. Gross contamination from the surgical site to 6 ft was noted after complete mastoidectomy, though, when performed in standard fashion. CONCLUSION: Our results show that there is no droplet generation during myringotomy with ventilation tube placement in an operating room setting.

Certain guidelines issued by National Health Commission of the People's Repubilic of China recommend intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for adjuvant treatment of COVID-19. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of IVIG. METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 in the Respiratory and Critical Care Unit of Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Center, China. Patient information, including demographic data, laboratory indicators, the use of glucocorticoids and IVIG, hospital mortality, the application of mechanical ventilation, and the length of hospital stay was collected. The primary outcome was the composite end point, including death and the use of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 285 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 113 severely ill patients were included in this study. Compared to the non-IVIG group, more patients in the IVIG group reached the composite end point [12 (25.5%) vs 5 (7.6%), P = 0.008] and had longer hospital stay periods [23.0 (19.0–31.0) vs 16.0 (13.8–22.0), P < 0.001]. After adjusting for confounding factors, differences in primary outcomes between the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.167), however, patients in the IVIG group had longer hospital stay periods (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapy with IVIG did not improve in-hospital mortality rates or the need for mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19 patients. Our study does not support the use of immunoglobulin in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Xiao; Tian, Li; Zhou, Lei; Jia, Xinhua; Kong, Li; Xue, Yitao; Hao, Hao; Meng, Xianqing; Zhang, Feihu; Dong, Xiaobin",Virol J,248,16

This study aimed to test the model triggered by physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection, in which the need for health information and perceived impact of the pandemic mediated the path sequentially, leading to adverse mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional research design with chain mediation model involving 4612 participants from participating 8 countries selected via a respondent-driven sampling strategy was used. Participants completed online questionnaires on physical symptoms, the need for health information, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The results showed that Poland and the Philippines were the two countries with the highest levels of anxiety, depression and stress; conversely, Vietnam had the lowest mean scores in these areas. Chain mediation model showed the need for health information, and the perceived impact of the pandemic were sequential mediators between physical symptoms resembling COVID-19 infection (predictor) and consequent mental health status (outcome). Excessive and contradictory health information might increase the perceived impact of the pandemic. Rapid COVID-19 testing should be implemented to minimize the psychological burden associated with physical symptoms, whilst public mental health interventions could target adverse mental outcomes associated with the pandemic.","Wang, Cuiyan; Chudzicka-Czupała, Agata; Tee, Michael L.; Núñez, María Inmaculada López; Tripp, Connor; Fardin, Mohammad A.; Habib, Hina A.; Tran, Bach X.; Adamus, Katarzyna; Anlacan, Joseph; García, Marta E.

Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health care systems worldwide. As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 (‘BhAVI-23’) was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in-vitro anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (∼64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of α-pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein. CONCLUSION: This ‘BhAVI-23’ infusion displayed prominent in-vitro anti-viral and anti-diabetic potential in different model systems. These attributes have relevance as diabetic patients are more prone to COVID-19 morbidity. ‘BhAVI-23’ opens the avenue for its potential inclusion as a supportive health care system upon due regulatory approval during the current pandemic.","Saxena, Sudhanshu; Kumar, Sanjeev; Hajare, Sachin N.; Gupta, Sumit; Gautam, Satyendra; Ghosh, Sunil K.",J Ayurveda Integr Med,248,25

However, scientific review evaluating the anticancer, antiplatelet, gastroprotective and hepatoprotective effects of camel urine is still scarce. Thus, this scoping review aimed to provide scientific evidence on the therapeutic potentials of camel urine. Three databases were searched to identify relevant articles (Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus) up to September 2020. Original articles published in English that investigated the effects of camel urine in various diseases were included. The literature search identified six potential articles that met all the inclusion criteria. Three articles showed that camel urine possesses cytotoxic activities against different types of cancer cells. Two studies revealed camel urine’s protective effects against liver toxicity and gastric ulcers, whilst another study showed the role of camel urine as an antiplatelet agent. All studies demonstrated significant positive effects with different effective dosages. Thus, camel urine shows promising therapeutic potential in treating human diseases, especially cancer. However, the standardised dosage and potential side effects should be determined before camel urine could be offered as an alternative treatment.","Salamt, Norizam; Idrus, Ruszymah Binti Haji; Kashim, Mohd Izhar Ariff Mohd; Mokhtar, Mohd Helmy",Saudi Pharm J,248,10

However, parameter optimization in hierarchical models, which includes finding an appropriate number of topics at each level of hierarchy, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Renyi entropy as a partial solution to the above problem. First, we introduce a Renyi entropy-based metric of quality for hierarchical models. Second, we propose a practical approach to obtaining the “correct” number of topics in hierarchical topic models and show how model hyperparameters should be tuned for that purpose. We test this approach on the datasets with the known number of topics, as determined by the human mark-up, three of these datasets being in the English language and one in Russian. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models: hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model (hLDA), hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM). We demonstrate that the hLDA model possesses a significant level of instability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far from the true numbers for the labeled datasets. For the hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach allows determining only one level of the data structure. For hARTM model, the proposed approach allows us to estimate the number of topics for two levels of hierarchy.","Koltcov, Sergei; Ignatenko, Vera; Terpilovskii, Maxim; Rosso, Paolo",PeerJ Comput Sci,248,20

Therefore, it is important that they possess or acquire optimal levels of self-efficacy, since it is related to less stress during competition, also guaranteeing sports performance and prevent sports abandonment. The objectives of this study were to characterize the profile, in terms of self-efficacy, of SRs depending on their category, age, and experience and to determine the relationship of these factors on SR self-efficacy. Two-hundred fifty-six Spanish referees participated in this study and Referee Self-Efficacy Scale was administered and completed. The results indicated that the SRs older than 25 years, of national category, and with experience greater than or equal to 8 years, have higher levels of self-efficacy than those with the least (p < .01). Likewise, moderate positive correlations were also observed between global self-efficacy and the category, age, and experience of the SRs. In conclusion, age, category and experience factors relate the self-efficacy of the SR, which can explain up to 17% of the variance, affecting decision-making and other decisive behaviors in the competition. These findings are of interest to delegations and referee committees seeking to implement psychological intervention programs to prevent burnout and abandonment of sports practice due to the consequences of low self-efficacy.","López Aguilar, José; Castillo-Rodriguez, Alfonso; Chinchilla-Minguet, José L.; Onetti-Onetti, Wanesa",PeerJ,248,26

Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Methods We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results We projected a declining trend of the COVID-19 epidemic if the current quarantine strategy continues, and Wuhan would record the last new confirmed cases in late April 2020. At the end of the epidemic, 65,733 (45,722-99,015) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,166 (11,238-24,603, 24.6%) were through public contacts, 45,996 (31,892-69,565, 69.7%) through household contact, and 3,571 (2,521-5,879, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 778 (553-1,154) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,786 (1,969-4,791) medical staff). A total of 2,821 (1,634-6,361) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. Early quarantine lifting on 21st March is viable only if Wuhan residents sustain a high facial mask usage of ≥85% and a pre-quarantine level public contact rate. Delaying city resumption to mid/late April would relax the requirement of facial mask usage to ≥75% at the same contact rate. Conclusions The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","Zhang, Lei; Shen, Mingwang; Ma, Xiaomeng; Su, Shu; Gong, Wenfeng; Wang, Jing; Tao, Yusha; Zou, Zhuoru; Zhao, Rui; Lau, Joseph T.F.; Li, Wei; Liu, Feng; Ye, Kai; Wang, Youfa; Zhuang, Guihua; Fairley, Christopher K.",The Innovation,248,20

With the US now being the prevalent nation affected, we aimed to identify factors that were relevant to survival and hematological events in COVID patients. Our group had primarily been assessing COVID-19 confirmed patients as per PCR at Ochsner Medical Center in Louisiana; we primarily studied patients who were admitted between January 2020 to May 2020. Our main events that are currently being studied include factors such as mortality, length of stay, and bleeding or thrombotic events. Secondary endpoints included factors such as influence on blood type and also amount of transfusions required by these patients. Our overall analysis of 1773 patients yielded a number of 60 patients who were able to identify as having an active cancer diagnosis. This disproportionate number of patients may be related to factors such as reluctance to visit the hospital among cancer patients, a phenomenon noted similarly in Cardiology where the number of admissions for cardiac causes had declined suddenly during this pandemic timeline. Our half of our population was African American and included an even proportion of males and females. The age range of patients was between 35-93 years old. The most common malignancies that were noted to co-occur with COVID-19 in our population seemed to be lung, prostate, and hematological malignancies. Although final analyses regarding mortality are to be completed, the proportion of patients who had died with a diagnosis of cancer was around 50% per collection of our current data. Twenty three out of 60 (38%) patients required blood transfusions. In comparison to other reports which had reported bleeding events and thrombotic events, our report had revealed a much less rate of bleeding events (5/60) and thrombotic events (5/60). We plan to repeat our analysis to assess for any confounders in identifying these events, as noted, since some earlier literature had reported between ¼ to ⅔ of patients having a thrombotic event. Our analysis also looks at other descriptive variables such as use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, absolute counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes, platelets, and coagulation markers. Also, our assessment includes a study in assessment of any delays noted in chemotherapy dates for these patients. Analysis of assessment of bleeding, thrombosis, and mortality for the entire patient group is currently in process.

Contrary to the hypothesis that people mistrust algorithms, participants trusted their AI partners to be as cooperative as humans. However, they did not return AI's benevolence as much and exploited the AI more than humans. These findings warn that future self-driving cars or co-working robots, whose success depends on humans' returning their cooperativeness, run the risk of being exploited.

Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses.","Chu, Chin-Yi; Qiu, Xing; McCall, Matthew N.; Wang, Lu; Corbett, Anthony; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Slaunwhite, Christopher; Wang, Qian; Anderson, Christopher; Grier, Alex; Gill, Steven R.; Pryhuber, Gloria S.; Falsey, Ann R.; Topham, David J.; Caserta, Mary T.; Walsh, Edward E.; Mariani, Thomas J",bioRxiv,248,16

The neutralising antibody (NAb) titre was also determined for all samples with a virus neutralisation assay (VNA) using live virus. The positivity rate was 100% with the Wantai assay, 84.8% with the bioMerieux assay and 56.4% with the Abbott assay. Only 51% of HCWs were positive for the presence of NAb. Less than 10 % of HCWs NAb titer of 80.

The Indian Medical Mission extended health-security to approximately 140,000 pilgrims, through outreach medical teams, primary-care clinics, tent-clinics, secondary-care hospitals and evacuation capabilities. Data on medical attendance, bed-occupancy, investigations, referrals, medication usage and deaths was compared. Outpatient attendance was 374,475 in static-clinics, 5135 in tent-clinics and 13,473 through task-forces. 585 (62.90%) in-patients were hospitalized amongst 930 secondary-care referrals. Secondary-care bed-days were 2106 with average bed-occupancy being 77.78%. 495 patients were institutionalized in tertiary-care Saudi-Arabian hospitals.

Analgesics (66.38/100 patients) and antibacterials (48.34/100 patients) were frequently prescribed. Crude mortality amongst Indian pilgrims was 11.99/10,000. Risk-factors associated with high morbidity were old-age and pre-existing comorbidities. Overwhelming surge of patients facilitates transmission of communicable infections and leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel. Respiratory infections are highly prevalent and easily transmissible during Hajj leading to significant morbidity, increased burden to existing health facilities, overwhelming costs on health systems and globalization of multiresistant pathogens. Diabetic patients should avoid heat exposure and use protective footwear during Hajj rituals.

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.","Kim, G.-u.; Kim, M.-J.; Ra, S.H.; Lee, J.; Bae, S.; Jung, J.; Kim, S.-H.",Clin Microbiol Infect,248,29

Therefore, surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. METHODS: A total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children (<6 years, crossing border between Southern China and Hong Kong SAR) showing symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever (body temperature > 37.5 °C), from 2014 May to 2015 Dec. Viral nucleic acids were analyzed and sequenced to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of the four human coronaviruses. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated with Fisher chi-square test. RESULTS: 78 (2.37%; 95%CI 1.8-2.8%) out of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were found to be positive for OC43 (36;1.09%), HKU1 (34; 1.03%), NL63 (6; 0.18%) and 229E (2;0.01%). None of SARS or MERS was detected. The HCoVs predominant circulating season was in transition of winter to spring, especially January and February and NL63 detected only in summer and fall. Complex population with an abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses was circulating and they shared homology with the published strains (99-100%). Besides, phylogenetic evolutionary analysis indicated that OC43 coronaviruses were clustered into three clades (B,D,E), HKU1 clustered into two clades(A,B) and NL63 clustered into two clades(A,B). Moreover, several novel mutations including nucleotides substitution and the insertion of spike of the glycoprotein on the viral surface were discovered. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate and epidemic trend of coronaviruses were stable and no obvious fluctuations were found. The detected coronaviruses shared a conserved gene sequences in S and RdRp. However, mutants of the epidemic strains were detected, suggesting continuous monitoring of the human coronaviruses is in need among cross-border children, who are more likely to get infected and transmit the viruses across the border easily, in addition to the general public.","Liu, Peilin; Shi, Lei; Zhang, Wei; He, Jianan; Liu, Chunxiao; Zhao, Chunzhong; Kong, Siu Kai; Loo, Jacky Fong Chuen; Gu, Dayong; Hu, Longfei",Virol J,248,20

Despite the wide array of diagnostic tools, invasive techniques, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are often required to obtain adequate specimens. PneumoniaCheck(TM) is a new device that collects aerosol particles from cough, allowing microbiological analyses. Up to now it has been tested only for bacteria detection, but no study has investigated its usefulness for virus identification. Methods: In this pilot study we included 12 consecutive patients with pneumonia. After testing cough adequacy via a peak flow meter, a sampling with PneumoniaCheck(TM) was collected and a BAL was performed in each patient. Microbiological analyses for virus identification were performed on each sample and concordance between the two techniques was tested (sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values), taking BAL results as reference. Results: BAL was considered adequate in 10 patients. Among them, a viral pathogen was identified by PneumoniaCheck(TM) 6 times, each on different samples, whereas BAL allowed to detect the presence of a virus on 7 patients (14 positivities). Overall, the specificity for PneumoniaCheck(TM) to detect a virus was 100%, whereas the sensitivity was 66%. When considering only herpes viruses, PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a lower sensitivity, detecting a virus in 1/4 of infected patients (25%). Conclusions: In this pilot study PneumoniaCheck(TM) showed a good correlation with BAL for non-herpes virologic identification in pneumonia patients, providing excellent specificity. Further studies on larger population are needed to confirm these results and define its place in the panorama of rapid diagnostic tests for lower respiratory tract infections.","Patrucco, Filippo; Gavelli, Francesco; Ravanini, Paolo; Daverio, Matteo; Statti, Giulia; Castello, Luigi Mario; Andreoni, Stefano; Balbo, Piero Emilio",J Breath Res,248,26

Using three different lectins that specifically recognize this structure, we establish that nucleolin (NCL), a protein implicated in cancer, contains 9-O-Ac-Sia. Surprisingly, antibodies against the glycolipid 9-O-Ac-Sia GD3 also detected 9-O-Ac-Sia NCL. NCL is present on the surface of pre-B ALL cells as a sialoglycoprotein that is partly 9-O-acetylated and conversely, 9-O-Ac-Sia-containing structures other than NCL are present on these cells as well. Interestingly, NCL and the 9-O-Ac-Sia signal had less co-localization on normal pre-B cells. We also investigated regulation of NCL on the cell surface and found that sialidase treatment increased the percentage of cells positive for cell surface NCL, suggesting that sialylation of NCL promotes internalization. Treatment of pre-B ALL cells with the chemotherapy drug vincristine also increased the percentage of cells with surface NCL and correlated with increased 9-O-Ac-Sia expression. All tested leukemia cells including primary samples expressed NCL, suggesting it as a possible therapeutic target. We confirmed this by showing inhibition of cell proliferation in some pre-B ALLs by exposure to a NCL-specific aptamer AS1411.","Joo, Eun Ji; Wasik, Brian R; Parrish, Colin; Paz, Helicia; Mϋhlenhoff, Martina; Abdel-Azim, Hisham; Groffen, John; Heisterkamp, Nora",Sci Rep,248,6

Created in the aftermath of the 2013–16 West African Ebola epidemic, the United Kingdom’s Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST) was designed to address critical gaps in outbreak response illuminated during the epidemic, while leveraging existing UK institutional strengths. The partnership between the government agency, Public Health England, and an academic consortium, led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, seeks to integrate outbreak response, operational research and capacity building. We explored the design, establishment and early experiences of the UK-PHRST as one of the first bodies of its kind globally, paying particular attention to governance decisions which enabled them to address their complex mission. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative case study using 19 in-depth interviews with individuals knowledgeable about the team’s design and implementation, review of organisational documents, and observations of meetings to analyse the UK-PHRST’s creation, establishment and initial 2 years of operations. RESULTS: According to key informants, adopting a triple mandate (response, research and capacity building) established the team as novel in the global epidemic response architecture. Key governance decisions recognised as vital to the model included: structuring the team as a government-academic collaboration which leveraged long-term and complementary UK investments in public health and the higher education sector; adopting a more complex, dual reporting and funding structure to maintain an ethos of institutional balance between lead organisations; supporting a multidisciplinary team of experts to respond early in outbreaks for optimal impact; prioritising and funding epidemic research to influence response policy and practice; and ensuring the team’s activities reinforced the existing global health architecture. CONCLUSION: The UK-PHRST aims to enhance global outbreak response using an innovative and integrated model that capitalises on institutional strengths of the partnership. Insights suggest that despite adding complexity, integrating operational research through the government-academic collaboration contributed significant advantages. This promising model could be adopted and adapted by countries seeking to build similar outbreak response and research capacities.

The present study sought to determine knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of health care workers (HCWs) toward COVID-19 in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals (MUTHs) in Uganda. Methods: An online cross sectional, descriptive study was undertaken through WhatsApp Messenger among HCWs in four MUTHs. HCWs aged 18 years and above constituted the study population. KAP toward COVID-19 was assessed by using a pre-validated questionnaire. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine sufficient knowledge (≥80%), positive attitude (≥4), and good practice (≥2.4). All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and GraphPad Prism 8.3. Results: Of the 581 HCWs approached, 136 (23%) responded. A vast majority of the participants were male (n = 87, n = 64%), with a median age of 32 (range: 20–66) years. Eighty-four (62%) were medical doctors and 125 (92%) had at least a bachelor's degree. Overall, 69% (n = 94) had sufficient knowledge, 21% (n = 29) had positive attitude, and 74% (n = 101) had good practices toward COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were age >40 years (aOR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–1.0; p = 0.047) and news media (aOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.4–17.0; p = 0.015). Factors associated with good practices were age 40 years or more (aOR: 48.4; 95% CI: 3.1–742.9; p = 0.005) and holding a diploma (aOR: 18.4; 95% CI: 1–322.9; p = 0.046). Conclusions: Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices.

Thus, it is highly significant that cytosolic GPX1 has been shown to interact with an inactive C145A mutant of M(pro), the main cysteine protease of SARS-CoV-2, but not with catalytically active wild-type M(pro). This seemingly anomalous result is what might be expected if GPX1 is a substrate for the active protease, leading to its fragmentation. We show that the GPX1 active site sequence is substantially similar to a known M(pro) cleavage site, and is identified as a potential cysteine protease site by the Procleave algorithm. Proteolytic knockdown of GPX1 is highly consistent with previously documented effects of recombinant SARS-CoV M(pro) in transfected cells, including increased reactive oxygen species and NF-κB activation. Because NF-κB in turn activates many pro-inflammatory cytokines, this mechanism could contribute to increased inflammation and cytokine storms observed in COVID-19. Using web-based protease cleavage site prediction tools, we show that M(pro) may be targeting not only GPX1, but several other selenoproteins including SELENOF and thioredoxin reductase 1, as well as glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione synthesis. This hypothesized proteolytic knockdown of components of both the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems is consistent with a viral strategy to inhibit DNA synthesis, to increase the pool of ribonucleotides for RNA synthesis, thereby enhancing virion production. The resulting “collateral damage” of increased oxidative stress and inflammation would be exacerbated by dietary deficiencies of selenium and glutathione precursors.","Taylor, Ethan Will; Radding, Wilson",Front Nutr,248,20

Through genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, we identified the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, lineage P.1, that acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around early November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.4–2.2 times more transmissible and 25–61% more likely to evade protective immunity elicited by previous infection with non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.","Faria, Nuno R.; Mellan, Thomas A.; Whittaker, Charles; Claro, Ingra M.; Candido, Darlan da S.; Mishra, Swapnil; Crispim, Myuki A.

The objective of this study was to determine information sources, factors influencing recommendations, clinical practices in patient assessment, communications, and recommendations, and priority areas for additional training among physicians who certify patients for medical marijuana. METHODS: A cross-sectional state-wide anonymous survey of registered medical marijuana physicians in Florida between June and October 2020 was administered. Numerical responses were quantified using counts and percentages. The frequencies for “often” and “always” responses were aggregated when appropriate. RESULTS: Among 116 respondents, the mean (standard deviation) age was 57 (12) years old, and 70% were male. The most frequently used information sources were research articles (n = 102, 95%), followed by online sources (n = 99, 93%), and discussions with other providers and dispensary staff (n = 84, 90%). Safety concerns were most influential in patient recommendations (n = 39, 39%), followed by specific conditions (n = 30, 30%) and patient preferences (n = 26, 30%). Ninety-three physicians (92%) reported they “often” or “always” perform a patient physical exam. Eighty-four (77%) physicians provided specific administration route recommendations. Half (n = 56) “often” or “always” provided specific recommendations for Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol: cannabidiol ratios, while 69 (62%) “often” or “always” provided specific dose recommendations. Online learning/training modules were the most preferred future training mode, with 88 (84%) physicians “likely” or “very likely” to participate. The top 3 desired topics for future training were marijuana-drug interactions (n = 84, 72%), management of specific medical conditions or symptoms (n = 83, 72%), and strategies to reduce opioids or other drugs use (n = 78, 67%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey of over 100 medical marijuana physicians indicates that their clinical practices rely on a blend of research and anecdotal information sources. While physicians report clinical factors as influential during patient recommendation, patient assessment practices and treatment regimen recommendations vary substantially and rely on experimental approaches. More research is needed to inform evidence-based practice and training, especially considering details on drug interactions, risk-benefit of treatment for specific clinical conditions, and strategies to reduce opioid use.","Sajdeya, Ruba; Shavers, Anna; Jean-Jacques, Jennifer; Costales, Brianna; Jugl, Sebastian; Crump, Carly; Wang, Yan; Manfio, Luran; Pipitone, R.

Currently, there are neither specific antiviral drugs nor vaccines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. We screened in silico, a group of natural spice and herbal secondary metabolites (SMs) for their inhibition efficacy against multiple target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein. Docking and simulation results indicated that epicatechin, embelin, hesperidin, cafestol, murrayanine and murrayaquinone-A have higher inhibition efficacy over at least one of the known antiviral drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and Ribavirin. Combination of these potentially effective SMs from their respective plant sources was analysed, and its absorption and acute oral toxicity were examined in Wistar rats and classified as category 5 as per the Globally Harmonized System. The identified SMs may be useful in the development of preventive nutraceuticals, food supplements and antiviral drugs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 501 865 participants (54% women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. RESULTS: Of 472 946 participants alive when COVID-19 was first apparent in the UK (taken as 1 February 2020), 217 (34% women) died from COVID-19 over the next 10 months, resulting in an incidence, per 100 000 person years, of 100.65 (95% CI 79.47 to 121.84) for women and 228.59 (95% CI 194.88 to 262.30) for men. Greater social deprivation, quantified using the Townsend Deprivation Score, was associated with greater risk of fatal COVD-19. Adjusted for age and ethnicity, HRs for women and men, comparing those in the most with the least deprived national fifths, were 3.66 (2.82 to 4.75) for women and 3.00 (2.46 to 3.66) for men. Adjustments for key baseline lifestyle factors attenuated these HRs to 2.20 (1.63 to 2.96) and 2.62 (2.12 to 3.24), respectively. There was evidence of a log-linear trend in the deprivation–fatal COVID-19 association, of similar magnitude to the equivalent trends for the associations between deprivation and fatal influenza or pneumonia and fatal cardiovascular disease. For all three causes of death, there was no evidence of a sex difference in the associations. CONCLUSIONS: Higher social deprivation is a risk factor for death from COVID-19 on a continuous scale, with two to three times the risk in the most disadvantaged 20% compared with the least. Similarities between the social gradients in COVID-19, influenza/pneumonia and cardiovascular disease mortality, the lack of sex differences in these effects, and the partial mediation of lifestyle factors suggest that better social policies are crucial to alleviate the general medical burden, including from the current, and potential future, viral pandemics.","Woodward, Mark; Peters, Sanne A E; Harris, Katie",J Epidemiol Community Health,248,26

Convenient transportation networks lead to rapid mobilization in the context of globalization, which is an important factor underlying the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Transportation systems can cause the transmission of viruses during the epidemic period, but they also support the reopening of economies after the epidemic. Understanding the mechanism of the impact of mobility on the spread of infectious diseases is thus important, as is establishing the risk model of the spread of infectious diseases in transportation networks. In this study, the basic structure and application of various epidemic spread models are reviewed, including mathematical models, statistical models, network-based models, and simulation models. The advantages and limitations of model applications within transportation systems are analyzed, including dynamic characteristics of epidemic transmission and decision supports for management and control. Lastly, research trends and prospects are discussed. It is suggested that there is a need for more in-depth research to examine the mutual feedback mechanism of epidemics and individual behavior, as well as the proposal and evaluation of intervention measures. The findings in this study can help evaluate disease intervention strategies, provide decision supports for transport policy during the epidemic period, and ameliorate the deficiencies of the existing system.","Li, Jian; Xiang, Tao; He, Linghui",,248,5

Accumulating evidences have shown that the new coronavirus could not only infect human beings, but also can infect other species which might result in the cross-species infections. In this research, 1056 ACE2 protein sequences are collected from the NCBI database, and 173 species with >60% sequence identity compared with that of human beings are selected for further analysis. We find 14 polar residues forming the binding interface of ACE2/2019-nCoV-Spike complex play an important role in maintaining protein–protein stability. Among them, 8 polar residues at the same positions with that of human ACE2 are highly conserved, which ensure its basic binding affinity with the novel coronavirus. 5 of other 6 unconserved polar residues (positions at human ACE2: Q24, D30, K31, H34 and E35) are proved to have an effect on the binding patterns among species. We select 21 species keeping close contacts with human beings, construct their ACE2 three-dimensional structures by Homology Modeling method and calculate the binding free energies of their ACE2/2019-nCoV-Spike complexes. We find the ACE2 from all the 21 species possess the capabilities to bind with the novel coronavirus. Compared with the human beings, 8 species (cow, deer, cynomys, chimpanzee, monkey, sheep, dolphin and whale) present almost the same binding abilities, and 3 species (bat, pig and dog) show significant improvements in binding affinities.

An asthmatic female adolescent presented with fever and flu-like symptoms for 7 days and was admitted with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She progressed with hemodynamic instability responsive to vasoactive drugs. Antibiotic therapy and support measures were introduced, showing progressive hemodynamics and respiratory improvement, however with persistent fever and increased inflammatory markers. During the hospitalization, she developed bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, hand and feet desquamation, strawberry tongue, and cervical adenopathy, and was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. She was prescribed intravenous immunoglobulin and, due to the refractory clinical conditions, corticosteroid therapy was added; 24 hours later, the patient was afebrile.

OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates of mental health indicators and stressors for US adults by disability status during April and May 2020, shortly following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed data from Porter Novelli View 360 opt-in Internet panel survey conducted during the weeks of April 20th and May 18th(,) 2020 among 1004 English-speaking adults aged ≥18 years without and with disabilities (serious difficulty with hearing, vision, cognition, or mobility; any difficulty with self-care or independent living). Weighted logistic regression was used to test for significant differences between calculated prevalence estimates at the P ≤ .05 level. RESULTS: One in four adults reported any disability. Adults with any disability were significantly more likely than adults without disability to report current depressive symptoms, frequent mental distress, suicidal ideation, and COVID-19-related initiated or increased substance use (all p values < .0001). Adults with disabilities also reported significantly higher levels of stressors, such as access to health care services (p < .0001), difficulty caring for their own (or another’s) chronic condition (p < .0001), emotional or physical abuse from others (p < .001), and not having enough food (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The disproportionately high levels of poor mental health indicators among adults with disabilities as compared to those without highlight the importance of delivering timely mental health screening and treatment/intervention during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to persons with disabilities.","Okoro, Catherine A.; Strine, Tara W.; McKnight-Eily, Lela; Verlenden, Jorge; Hollis, NaTasha D.",Disabil Health J,248,16

In order to tackle the crisis effectively we need to know the trajectories of number of the people infected (i.e. confirmed cases). Such information is crucial to government agencies for developing effective preparedness plans and strategies. We used a statistical modeling approach (extreme value distributions, EVDs) for projecting the future confirmed cases on a global scale. Using the 69 days data (from January 22, 2020 to March 30, 2020), the EVDs model predicted the number of confirmed cases from March 31, 2020 to April 9, 2020 (validation period) with an absolute percentage error < 15 % and then projected the number of confirmed cases until the end of June 2020. Also, we have quantified the uncertainty in the future projections due to the delay in reporting of the confirmed cases on a global scale. Based on the projections, we found that total confirmed cases would reach around 11.4 million globally by the end of June 2020.The USA may have 2.9 million number of confirmed cases followed by Spain(1.52 million) and Italy (1.28 million).","Aadhityaa, M; Kasiviswanathan, KS; Ilampooranan, Idhayachandhiran; Soundharajan, B; Balamurugan, M; He, Jianxun",,248,14

We conducted a prospectively planned analysis of COVID-19 in patients who received B-cell depleting anti-CD20 antibodies and chemotherapy for B-cell lymphomas. The control cohort consisted of age- and sex-matched patients without lymphoma who were hospitalized because of COVID-19. We performed detailed clinical analyses, in-depth cellular and molecular immune profiling, and comprehensive virological studies in 12 patients with available biospecimens. B-cell depleted lymphoma patients had more severe and protracted clinical course (median hospitalization 88 versus 17 d). All patients actively receiving immunochemotherapy (n = 5) required ICU support including long-term mechanical ventilation. Neutrophil recovery following granulocyte colony stimulating factor stimulation coincided with hyperinflammation and clinical deterioration in 4 of the 5 patients. Immune cell profiling and gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed early activation of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and the complement system in B-cell depleted lymphoma patients, with subsequent exacerbation of the inflammatory response and dysfunctional interferon signaling at the time of clinical deterioration of COVID-19. Longitudinal immune cell profiling and functional in vitro assays showed SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-effector cell responses. Finally, we observed long-term detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens (median 84 versus 12 d) and an inability to mount lasting SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in B-cell depleted lymphoma patients. In summary, we identified clinically relevant particularities of COVID-19 in lymphoma patients receiving B-cell depleting immunochemotherapies.","Gaitzsch, Erik; Passerini, Verena; Khatamzas, Elham; Strobl, Carolin D.; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Scherer, Clemens; Osterman, Andreas; Heide, Michael; Reischer, Anna; Subklewe, Marion; Leutbecher, Alexandra; Tast, Benjamin; Ruhle, Adrian; Weiglein, Tobias; Stecher, Stephanie-Susanne; Stemmler, Hans J.; Dreyling, Martin; Girl, Philipp; Georgi, Enrico; Wölfel, Roman; Mateyka, Laura; D’Ippolito, Elvira; Schober, Kilian; Busch, Dirk H.; Kager, Juliane; Spinner, Christoph D.; Treiber, Matthias; Rasch, Sebastian; Lahmer, Tobias; Iakoubov, Roman; Schneider, Jochen; Protzer, Ulrike; Winter, Christof; Ruland, Jürgen; Quante, Michael; Keppler, Oliver T.; von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael; Hellmuth, Johannes; Weigert, Oliver",Hemasphere,248,16

This study analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, reveals China’s epicenters of the pandemic through spatial clustering, and delineates the substantial effect of distance to Wuhan on the pandemic spread. The results show that the daily new COVID-19 cases mostly occurred in and around Wuhan before March 6, and then moved to the Grand Bay Area (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). The total COVID-19 cases in China were mainly distributed in the east of the Huhuanyong Line, where the epicenters accounted for more than 60% of the country’s total in/on 24 January and 7 February, half in/on 31 January, and more than 70% from 14 February. The total cases finally stabilized at approximately 84,000, and the inflection point for Wuhan was on 14 February, one week later than those of Hubei (outside Wuhan) and China (outside Hubei). The generalized additive model-based analysis shows that population density and distance to provincial cities were significantly associated with the total number of the cases, while distances to prefecture cities and intercity traffic stations, and population inflow from Wuhan after 24 January, had no strong relationships with the total number of cases.

The program included eight Scientific Sessions to occur over three full days at either Padova University or the Hotel Augustus on Euganei Hills (Padova), Italy. Abruptly, however, in early January the Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak started in China and changed the world perspectives and expectations. In Italy, it started in Lombardy and Veneto, two main industrial areas of the country with intense connections and interchanges of people and commercial activities with China. Indeed, the virus was first isolated from a couple of Chinese tourists, who inadvertently incubated the infection during their visit to many towns in Italy. Within the following two weeks, the epidemic had the first Italian cases and victims in an area south of Milan and in a Village of the Euganei Hills (Vo Euganeo, Padova). The village was immediately quarantined, but it was too late. The virus had escaped the area. Thus, it was a mandatory, though difficult decision (made even before the Italian National Government posted rules to be followed to decrease spread of the infection), to post-pone the Padua Muscle Days meeting from 18-21 March, 2020 to 25-28 November, 2020. Luckily, the vast majority of organizers, chairs, speakers, and attendees accepted the decision and have assured their presence in late November, despite the coincidence with the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Currently, the only changes in the program are the new dates; however, it is difficult to forecast the future. Anyhow, the rationale of the decision to post-pone 2020PMD was reinforced by the actions of many organizers of international events. One of the most recent examples is the March 6, 2020 decision of the leaders of the Experimental Biology Host Societies to cancel Experimental Biology (EB) 2020, set to take place April 4–7 in San Diego, California, USA. All these active civil responses to world dangers are mandatory to avoid those military responses that are easy to start, but provide the worst results. How do we not lose half of the 2020 year?

A total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID‐19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0–7 days from COVID‐19 patients confirmed by reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and chest CT scan. According to the SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n = 46) and PCR negative group (n = 274). The relationship between chest CT and rapid antibody test results were compared statistically. Of the 320 COVID‐19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 8.4%, 0.3%, and 11.6% within 1 week, respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 79.7% of the patients. In the study, 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 71 patients with negative chest CT scans had IgM and two (2.8%) were both IgM/IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in one (0.4%), and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity. The results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 within 0–7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an urgent search for effective interventions. SARS-CoV-2 mortality/morbidity risk increases with age and for those chronic disease co-morbidities, both of which are associated with lower zinc status, as is the risk of infection. Methods Rapid review methods will be applied to a systematic review of zinc for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and viral respiratory tract infections in humans. Included are published studies reporting randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compare zinc intervention to placebo and/or other comparator interventions. English and Chinese language databases will be searched for primary studies of viral respiratory tract infections and clinical trial registries for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to concerns about indirectness, studies evaluating non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections will be rated down by one level, and non-specific or confirmed non-coronavirus viral infections will be rated down by two levels. Review constraints include 1) using Google translate when screening articles published in languages other than English or Chinese and limited translation 2) following calibration, only one reviewer will screen articles, extract data, appraise quality and conduct the analysis, 3) prioritising data extraction and meta-analyses of SARS-CoV-2 studies and critical outcomes of other viral infections, followed by high risk groups and 4) reporting important preliminary findings prior to peer review if necessary. Discussion . The application of these rapid review methods and broadening the inclusion criteria to include other coronavirus-related viral respiratory tract infections aims to enable a timely evidence appraisal of priority research questions and dissemination of results.","Hunter, Jennifer; Arentz, Susan; Goldenberg, Joshua; Yang, Guoyan; Beardsley, Jennifer; Mertz, Dominik; Stephen,",Integr Med Res,248,4

The present study aimed to identify the active chemical constituents of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and investigate their mechanisms through interleukin-6 (IL-6) integrating network pharmacological approaches. Methods: We collected the compounds from all herbal ingredients of the previously mentioned TCM, but those that could down-regulate IL-6 were screened through the network pharmacology approach. Then, we modeled molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity between compounds and IL-6. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological processes and pathways of compounds. Finally, we screened out the core genes of compounds through the construction of the protein–protein interaction network and the excavation of gene clusters of compounds. Results: The network pharmacology research showed that TCM could decrease IL-6 using several compounds, such as quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin. Molecular docking results showed that the molecular binding affinity with IL-6 of all compounds except γ-aminobutyric acid was < −5.0 kJ/mol, indicating the potential of numerous active compounds in TCM to directly interact with IL-6, leading to an anti-inflammation effect. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to topologize the biological processes and pathways of compounds, revealing potential mechanisms for COVID-19 treatment. Conclusion: These results indicated the positive effect of TCM on the prevention and rehabilitation of COVID-19 in at-risk people.

Consequently, robust, high-quality prehospital guidance documents are needed to inform care. These guidance documents include, but are not limited to, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), protocols and algorithms that are contextually appropriate for SSA. However, SSA prehospital guidance mostly originates from the ‘Global North,’ with limited guidance for Africa by Africans. To strengthen prehospital clinical practice in SSA, we described and appraised all prehospital SSA guidance documents informing clinical decision making. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of prehospital-relevant guidance documents, including CPGs, algorithms, protocols and position statements originating from SSA. We performed a comprehensive literature search in various databases (PUBMED and SCOPUS), guideline clearing houses (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, Trip, and Guidelines International Network), journals, various forms of grey literature and contacted experts. Guidance document screening and data extraction was done independently, in duplicate and reviewed by a third author. Guidance quality was then determined using the AGREE II tool and data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We included 51 guidance documents from 13 countries across SSA after screening 2320 potential documents. The majority of guidance documents lacked an evidence foundation, made recommendations based on expert input, and were predominantly end-user presentations such as algorithms or protocols. Overall, reporting quality was poor, specifically for critical domains such as rigour of development; however, clarity of presentation was generally strong. Guidance topics were focused around resuscitation and common diseases (both communicable and non-communicable) with major gaps identified across a variety of topics; such as mental health for example. CONCLUSION: The majority of prehospital clinical guidance from SSA provides clinicians with excellent ready to use end-user material. Conversely, most of the guidance documents lack an appropriate evidence foundation and fail to transparently report the guidance development process, highlighting the need to strengthen and build guideline development capacity to promote the transition from eminence-based to evidence-based guidance for prehospital care in SSA. Guideline developers, professional societies and publishers need to be aware of international and local guidance document development and reporting standards in order to produce guidance we can trust.","Malherbe, Petrus; Smit, Pierre; Sharma, Kartik; McCaul, Michael",Afr J Emerg Med,248,24

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome involves the core replication-transcription complex (RTC, nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and the proofreading complex (nsp14-nsp10) that can correct mismatched base pairs during replication. Structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 RTC have been actively studied, yet little is known about SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10. Here, we purified, reconstituted, and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 proofreading nuclease in vitro. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 is activated by nsp10, functioning as a potent RNase that can hydrolyze RNAs in the context of single- and double-stranded RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid duplex. SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 shows a metal-dependent nuclease activity but has different metal selectivity from RTC. While RTC is activated by Ca(2+), nsp14-nsp10 is completely inhibited. Importantly, the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 efficiently removed the A:A mismatch at the 3′-end of the primer, enabling the stalled RTC to restart RNA replication. Our collective results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 functions as the RNA proofreading complex in SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a useful foundation to understand the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism.","Ma, Zhijun; Pourfarjam, Yasin; Kim, In-Kwon",Protein Expr Purif,248,5

Among the most significant environmental aspects of ports that contribute to the issue of climate change are those due to carbon dioxide emissions generated by port activities. Given the importance of this topic, this paper gathers initiatives and methodologies that have been undertaken to calculate and reduce CO(2) emissions and climate change effects in ports. After studying these methodologies, their strengths and opportunities for further enhancement have been analyzed. The results show that, in recent years, several ports have started to calculate their carbon footprint and report it. However, in some of the cases, not all the sources of GHG gases that are occurring actually in ports are taken into account, such as emissions from waste treatment operations and employees’ commuting. On other occasions, scopes are not defined following standard guidelines. Furthermore, each authority or operator uses its own method to calculate CO(2) emissions, which makes the comparison of results difficult. For these reasons, this paper suggests the need for creating a standardized tool to calculate carbon footprint in ports, which will make it possible to establish a benchmark and a potential comparison of results among ports.","Azarkamand, Sahar; Wooldridge, Chris; Darbra, R.

Several factors affect NK cytotoxic activity rendering it dysfunctional and thereby impeding the ability to scavenge abnormal cells as a part of immune escaping mechanisms induced by different types of cancers. NK cells play a crucial role augmenting the activity of various types of anticancer mAb since dysfunctional NK cells are the main reason for the low response to these therapies. To this light, we examined the phenotypic characters of the circulating NK cells isolated from HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Then, dysfunctional NK cells, from HCC patients, were reactivated with cytokines cocktail and their cytotoxic activity with the anti-EGFR mAb ""cetuximab"" was investigated. This showed a downregulation of patients NK cells activating receptors (NKP30, NKP46, NKG2D and CD16) as well as CD56 and up-regulation of NKG2A inhibitory receptor. We also reported an increase in aberrant CD56- NK cells subset in peripheral blood of HCC patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, confirming the dysfunctionality of peripheral NK cells isolated from HCC patients. Cytokines re-activation of those NK cells lead to upregulation of NK activating receptors and downregulation of inhibitory receptor. Moreover, the percentage of aberrant CD56- NK cells subset was reduced. Here, we proved that advanced HCC patients have an increased percentage of more immature and noncytotoxic NK cell subsets in their peripheral blood, which might account for the low cytotoxicity noticed in those patients. A significant improvement in the cytotoxicity against HCC was noticed upon using reactivated NK cells combined with cetuximab. Therefore, this study highlights the potential recruitment of NK immune cells along with cetuximab to enhance cytotoxicity against HCC.","Mahgoub, Shahenda; Abosalem, Hadeer; Emara, Mohamed; Kotb, Nahla; Maged, A; Soror, Sameh",Molecular immunology,248,1

Both a lack of accurate and timely data and pervasive misinformation are causing increasing harm and growing tension between data privacy and public health concerns. OBJECTIVE: This aim of this paper is to describe how blockchain, with its distributed trust networks and cryptography-based security, can provide solutions to data-related trust problems. METHODS: Blockchain is being applied in innovative ways that are relevant to the current COVID-19 crisis. We describe examples of the challenges faced by existing technologies to track medical supplies and infected patients and how blockchain technology applications may help in these situations. RESULTS: This exploration of existing and potential applications of blockchain technology for medical care shows how the distributed governance structure and privacy-preserving features of blockchain can be used to create “trustless” systems that can help resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and addressing public health needs in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain relies on a distributed, robust, secure, privacy-preserving, and immutable record framework that can positively transform the nature of trust, value sharing, and transactions. A nationally coordinated effort to explore blockchain to address the deficiencies of existing systems and a partnership of academia, researchers, business, and industry are suggested to expedite the adoption of blockchain in health care.","Khurshid, Anjum",JMIR Med Inform,248,16

Previous research with school-aged children has shown that negative thoughts and worries can predict mental health symptoms following stressful events. So far preschool children have been neglected in these investigations. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore negative thoughts and worries that preschool aged children are having during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: As part of a larger mixed-method study, caregivers of N = 399 preschoolers aged between 3 and 5 years (M = 4.41) answered open-ended questions about their COVID-19 related thoughts and worries. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify relevant themes from the qualitative data. A theoretical model of child thoughts and worries was developed based on these qualitative findings and the existing empirical and theoretical literature. Results: Caregivers gave examples that indicated that preschoolers had difficulties understanding causality and overestimated the risk of COVID-19 infection. Caregivers reported that their children expressed worries about getting sick and infecting others as well as about changes in daily life becoming permanent. Caregivers observed their children’s preoccupation with COVID-19 and worries in conversations, play and drawings as well as in behavioural changes – increased arousal, cautiousness, avoidance and attachment-seeking behaviour. Conclusion: Preschool children can and do express negative thoughts and worries and have also experienced threat and increased vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. A theoretical model is proposed that could inform assessments, interventions and future research in the field.","Vasileva, Mira; Alisic, Eva; De Young, Alex",European journal of psychotraumatology,248,30

S is expressed on the exterior of the SARS-CoV-2 virion and contains two subunits, namely the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2. It is the key element for mediating viral entry as well as a crucial antigenic determinant capable of stimulating protective immune response through elicitation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in COVID-19 patients. Given that S2 is highly conserved in comparison to the S1, here, we provide a review of the latest findings on the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit and further discuss its potential as an attractive and promising target for the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","Ng, Kim Tien; Mohd-Ismail, Nur Khairiah; Tan, Yee-Joo",Vaccines (Basel),248,29

METHODS Clinical data of 1404 patients who underwent colposcopy in single center in China were reviewed. Based on history and current cervical screening (HPV & cytology), corresponding recommendations were given according to the 2019 ASCCP guidelines. The agreement and discrepancy of colposcopy indication were analyzed between the Chinese consensus and the 2019 ASCCP guidelines. RESULTS Colposcopy indication was matched in about 80% patients. The left 20% were recommended with follow-up by the 2019 ASCCP guidelines. The discrepancy mainly focused on patients having a current result of HPV-positive NILM without unknown history. The ratio of observed CIN3+ in our database over estimated CIN3+ by the 2019 ASCCP guidelines was 6.2 (31/5). The ratio was even higher in patients with HPV16/18-positive NILM (7, 28/4), compared with those with other types of high-risk HPV-positive NILM (3, 3/1). The 2019 ASCCP guidelines had a relatively high sensitivity (83.1%), a low specificity (21.5%), a low positive predictive value (14.1%) and a high negative predictive value (89.1%) for prediction of CIN 3+. CONCLUSIONS We could try to apply the 2019 ASCCP guidelines in Chinese population. The classification of HR-HPV was strongly recommended during risk assessment. For patients with HPV16/18 infection, colposcopy should be recommended. Perspective multi-center randomized controlled trial with reliable follow-up should be performed in the future to confirm the feasibility.","Gui, Ting; Chen, Zhiyan; Chen, Fei",PloS one,248,17

Around two fifths of the world's population, or up to 3.9 billion people, are at a risk of dengue infection. Infection induces a life-long protective immunity to the homologous serotype but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection caused by other serotypes. Thus, there is a need for a vaccine which is capable of providing a life- long protection against all the serotypes of dengue virus. In our study, comparative genomics of Dengue virus (DENV) was conducted to explore potential candidates for novel vaccine targets. From our analysis we successfully found 100% conserved epitopes in Envelope protein (RCPTQGE); NS3 (SAAQRRGR, PGTSGSPI); NS4A (QRTPQDNQL); NS4B (LQAKATREAQKRA) and NS5 proteins (QRGSGQV) in all DENV serotypes. Some serotype specific conserved motifs were also found in NS1, NS5, Capsid, PrM and Envelope proteins. Using comparative genomics and immunoinformatics approach, we could find conserved epitopes which can be explored as peptide vaccine candidates to combat dengue worldwide. Serotype specific epitopes can also be exploited for rapid diagnostics. All ten proteins are explored to find the conserved epitopes in DENV serotypes, thus making it the most extensively studied viral genome so far.","Verma, Mansi; Bhatnagar, Shradha; Kumari, Kavita; Mittal, Nidhi; Sukhralia, Shivani; Gopirajan AT, Shruthi; Dhanaraj, P.S.; Lal, Rup",Gene,248,5

Besides, their social behavior and stress level regarding COVID-19 infection were assessed. Materials and Methods An online questionnaire was distributed to medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, and applied health science students in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak quarantine in March 2020. The questionnaire comprised 38 questions assessing demographic data, knowledge, attitude, risk perception, and stress level toward COVID-19. Questions regarding infection control measures and social behavior after the quarantine were also included. Statistical Analysis Independent samples t -test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square at a significance level of 5% were used for data analysis. Results A total number of 935 responses were collected. The knowledge score of 55.72% of participants was satisfactory and it was higher for the clinical years’ students compared with the basic years’ students ( p = 0.000) (descending order: sixth year > fifth year > fourth year > third year > first year > second year).

Infection with the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) impairs oxygen diffusion capacity of the lung and in consequence causes hypoxemia. In 20 - 40 % of COVID-19 cases, patients have alarmingly low oxygen (O2 ) saturation of the blood without being dyspneic, a condition called ""silent hypoxia"".1 However, hypoxemia leads to severe injuries in diverse organs, particularly those of high oxygen dependency such as the brain, heart or kidney.1 Tissue hypoxia results from an imbalance between O2 consumption and O2 delivery.2 Insufficient oxygen supply forces cells to adapt via multiple physiological processes as has been extensively reported in Acta Physiologica (Oxf.).3-5 In general, but also in the context of COVID-19, the basic understanding of cellular O2 availability represents a major topic.6-8 The final amount of oxygen reaching the cell, or more precisely the mitochondria for oxidative metabolism, is mainly attributed to i) the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood as determined by the haemoglobin (Hb) level, and ii) the ability to release O2 to the tissue as determined by the Hb-O2 affinity. The latter may belong to the physiological knowledge that is underestimated in clinical routine, as indicated by only few investigations in this regard. However, due to the risk of thrombotic events, the issue of Hb-O2 affinity might be of exceptional relevance in COVID-19 and silent hypoxia. Thus, we are wondering whether the modulation of oxygen affinity to haemoglobin may help to improve cellular oxygen availability.","Kulow, Vera A.; Fähling, Michael",Acta Physiol (Oxf),248,16

The objective of this paper is to document findings from interviews conducted with family members on three categories: (1) feelings experienced during the visit, (2) barriers, challenges or concerns faced using this service, and (3) opportunities for improvements. METHODS: Family members were interviewed postvisit via phone. For category 1 (feelings), automated analysis in Python using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner package produced weighted valence (extent of positive, negative or neutral emotive connotations) of the interviewees’ word choices. Outputs were compared with a manual coder’s valence ratings to assess reliability. Two raters conducted inductive thematic analysis on the notes from these interviews to analyse categories 2 (barriers) and 3 (opportunities). RESULTS: Valence-based and manual sentiment analysis of 230 comments received on feelings showed over 86% positive sentiments (88.2% and 86.8%, respectively) with some neutral (7.3% and 6.8%) and negative (4.5% and 6.4%) sentiments. The qualitative analysis of data from 57 participants who commented on barriers showed four primary concerns: inability to communicate due to patient status (44% of respondents); technical difficulties (35%); lack of touch and physical presence (11%); and frequency and clarity of communications with the care team (11%). Suggested improvements from 59 participants included: on demand access (51%); improved communication with the care team (17%); improved scheduling processes (10%); and improved system feedback and technical capabilities (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of vICU for remote family visitations evoked happiness, joy, gratitude and relief and a sense of closure for those who lost loved ones. Identified areas for concern and improvement should be addressed in future implementations of telecritical care for this purpose.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Dhala, Atiya; Zheng, Feibi; Ahmadi, Nima; Kash, Bita; Masud, Faisal",BMJ Qual Saf,248,20

Due to the importance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for state-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting soft tissue on the chest x-rays. The dataset for exploring best segmentation model is from Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the Chest X-rays. However, most variant U-Nets mainly focus on extraction of contextual information and skip connections. There is still a large space for improving extraction of spatial features. In this paper, we propose a dual encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected recurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating contextual feature extraction. In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation of features, the inception blocks with dilation are adopted. The inception blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information from various receptive fields. At the same time, the two paths are fused by summing features, thus preserving the contextual and spatial information for decoding part. This multi-learning-scale model is benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from two different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net achieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net, R2U-Net and attention R2U-Net. This model has proved the feasibility for mixed dataset and approaches state-of-the-art. The source code for this proposed framework is public https://github.com/uceclz0/DEFU-Net.","Zhang, L.

METHODS: An observational cohort of hospitalized and outpatient participants with ILI was conducted in six hospitals in Mexico. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza and other common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 4778 participants were enrolled in this study and had complete data. A total of 2053 (43.0%) had severe ILI. Seven hundred and seventy‐eight (16.3%) were positive for influenza, 2636 (55.2%) were positive for other viral respiratory pathogens, and 1364 (28.5%) had no respiratory virus isolated. Adults with influenza were more likely to be hospitalized if they were underweight (OR: 5.20), obese (OR: 3.18), or morbidly obese (OR: 18.40) compared to normal‐weight adults. Obese adults with H1N1 had a sixfold increase in odds of hospitalization over H3N2 and B (obese OR: 8.96 vs 1.35, morbidly obese OR: 35.13 vs 5.58, respectively) compared to normal‐weight adults. In adults with coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and rhinovirus, participants that were underweight (OR: 4.07) and morbidly obese (OR: 2.78) were more likely to be hospitalized as compared to normal‐weight adults. All‐cause influenza‐like illness had a similar but less pronounced association between underweight or morbidly obesity and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk of being hospitalized in adult participants that are underweight or morbidly obese, regardless of their viral pathogen status. Having influenza, however, significantly increases the odds of hospitalization in those who are underweight or morbidly obese.","Moser, Joe‐Ann S.; Galindo‐Fraga, Arturo; Ortiz‐Hernández, Ana A.; Gu, Wenjuan; Hunsberger, Sally; Galán‐Herrera, Juan‐Francisco; Guerrero, María Lourdes; Ruiz‐Palacios, Guillermo M.; Beigel, John H.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,248,5

In May 2020, a sample of 626 family systems therapists (58.6% women, 40.6% men; M = 57.4 years old; M years in practice = 25.5) completed a national online study assessing these variables. Results suggested that family systems therapists performed 7.92% of their clinical work using teletherapy before the pandemic and 88.17% during the pandemic.

Teletherapy uptake was unrelated to primary practice setting, provider age, gender, race/ethnicity, and practice location (urban/suburban vs. rural) but was higher for family systems therapists who reported increased supportive teletherapy policies and training in their practice setting. Organizational infrastructure and availability of training played an important role in influencing teletherapy uptake during the pandemic. Family systems therapists have a unique opportunity to deploy teletherapy modalities to meet the needs of families during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and infrastructure and training to do so may facilitate that work.","McKee, Grace B.; Pierce, Bradford S.; Tyler, Carmen M.; Perrin, Paul B.; Elliott, Timothy R.",Fam Process,248,1

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: County-level daily COVID-19 case and death data from March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, were extracted from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. EXPOSURE: The Gini coefficient, a measure of unequal income distribution (presented as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents a perfectly equal geographical region where all income is equally shared and 1 represents a perfectly unequal society where all income is earned by 1 individual), and other county-level data were obtained primarily from the 2014 to 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Covariates included median proportions of poverty, age, race/ethnicity, crowding given by occupancy per room, urbanicity and rurality, educational level, number of physicians per 100 000 individuals, state, and mask use at the county level. RESULTS: As of February 28, 2021, on average, each county recorded a median of 8891 cases of COVID-19 per 100 000 individuals (interquartile range, 6935-10 666 cases per 100 000 individuals) and 156 deaths per 100 000 individuals (interquartile range, 94-228 deaths per 100 000 individuals). The median county-level Gini coefficient was 0.44 (interquartile range, 0.42-0.47). There was a positive correlation between Gini coefficients and county-level COVID-19 cases (Spearman ρ = 0.052; P < .001) and deaths (Spearman ρ = 0.134; P < .001) during the study period. This association varied over time; each 0.05-unit increase in Gini coefficient was associated with an adjusted relative risk of COVID-19 deaths: 1.25 (95% CI, 1.17-1.33) in March and April 2020, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.13-1.28) in May and June 2020, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.37-1.55) in July and August 2020, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.98-1.10) in September and October 2020, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81) in November and December 2020, and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.07) in January and February 2021 (P < .001 for interaction). The adjusted association of the Gini coefficient with COVID-19 cases also reached a peak in July and August 2020 (relative risk, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.22-1.33]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that income inequality within US counties was associated with more cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the summer months of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vast disparities that exist in health outcomes owing to income inequality in the US. Targeted interventions should be focused on areas of income inequality to both flatten the curve and lessen the burden of inequality.","Tan, Annabel X.; Hinman, Jessica A.; Abdel Magid, Hoda S.; Nelson, Lorene M.; Odden, Michelle C.",JAMA Netw Open,248,10

The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP.","Jung, In Young; Jeon, Yong Duk; Ahn, Mi-young; Goag, Eunkyong; Lee, EunHye; Ahn, Hea Won; Ahn, Jin Young; Ku, Nam Su; Kim, June Myung; Choi, Jun Yong",BMC Infect Dis,248,1

This study examined the evolution of psychosocial impacts with the progression of the pandemic in adult populations from different countries and continents, and identified, among a wide range of individual and country-level factors, which ones are contributing to this evolving psychological response. An online survey was conducted in May/June 2020 and in November 2020, among a sample of 17,833 adults (Phase 1: 8806; Phase 2: 9027) from eight countries/regions (Canada, the United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, the Philippines, New Zealand). Probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) were assessed. The independent role of potential factors was examined using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD or MDE was indicated by 30.1% and 32.5% of the respondents during phases 1 and 2, respectively (a 7.9% increase over time), with an important variation according to countries/regions (range from 22.3% in Switzerland to 38.8% in the Philippines). This proportion exceeded 50% among young adults (18–24 years old) in all countries except for Switzerland. Beyond young age, several factors negatively influenced mental health in times of pandemic; important factors were found, including weak sense of coherence (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 3.89), false beliefs (aOR = 2.33), and self-isolation/quarantine (aOR = 2.01). The world has entered a new era dominated by psychological suffering and rising demand for mental health interventions, along a continuum from health promotion to specialized healthcare. More than ever, we need to innovate and build interventions aimed at strengthening key protective factors, such as sense of coherence, in the fight against the adversity caused by the concurrent pandemic and infodemic.","Généreux, Mélissa; Schluter, Philip J.; Landaverde, Elsa; Hung, Kevin KC; Wong, Chi Shing; Mok, Catherine Pui Yin; Blouin-Genest, Gabriel; O’Sullivan, Tracey; David, Marc D.; Carignan, Marie-Eve; Champagne-Poirier, Olivier; Pignard-Cheynel, Nathalie; Salerno, Sébastien; Lits, Grégoire; d’Haenens, Leen; Coninck, David De; Matthys, Koenraad; Champagne, Eric; Burlone, Nathalie; Qadar, Zeeshan; Herbosa, Teodoro; Ribeiro-Alves, Gleisse; Law, Ronald; Murray, Virginia; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Roy, Mathieu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,248,16

Uncontrolled activation of complement contributes to acute and chronic inflammation, the generation of cytokine storm, intravascular coagulation and cell/tissue damage, which may be a favorable target for the treatment of multiple organ failure and reduction of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Cytokine storm suppression therapy can alleviate the symptoms of critically ill patients to some extent, but as a remedial etiological measure, its long-term efficacy is still questionable. Anti-complement therapy has undoubtedly become an important hotspot in the upstream regulation of cytokine storm. However, chemosynthetic complement inhibitors are expensive, and their drug resistance and long-term side effects require further investigation. New complement inhibitors with high efficiency and low toxicity can be obtained from natural products at low development cost. This paper puts forward some insights of the development of natural anti-complement products in traditional Chinese medicine, that may provide a bright perspective for suppressing cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

DESIGN: Policy mapping and systematic review DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: for the policy mapping, we searched websites of relevant government bodies and used data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker for a convenient sample of 31 countries across different regions. For the systematic review, we searched Medline (Ovid), PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and COVID-19 specific databases. We included randomized controlled trial, non-randomized studies, modeling studies, and qualitative studies. Two independent reviewers selected studies, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias. RESULTS: Most countries adopted a total border closure at the start of the pandemic. For the remainder of the year, partial border closure banning arrivals from some countries or regions was the most widely adopted measure, followed by mandatory quarantine and screening of travelers. The systematic search identified 69 eligible studies, including 50 modeling studies. Both observational and modeling evidence suggest that border closure may reduce the number of COVID-19 cases, disease spread across countries and between regions, and slow the progression of the outbreak. These effects are likely to be enhanced when implemented early, and when combined with measures reducing transmission rates in the community. Quarantine of travelers may decrease the number of COVID-19 cases but its effectiveness depends on compliance and enforcement and is more effective if followed by testing, especially when less than 14 day-quarantine is considered. Screening at departure and/or arrival is unlikely to detect a large proportion of cases or to delay an outbreak. Effectiveness of screening may be improved with increased sensitivity of screening tests, awareness of travelers, asymptomatic screening, and exit screening at country source. While four studies on contextual evidence found that the majority of the public is supportive of travel restrictions, they uncovered concerns about the unintended harms of those policies. CONCLUSION: Most countries adopted full or partial border closure in response to COVID-19 in 2020. Evidence suggests positive effects on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic for border closure (particularly when implemented early), as well as quarantine of travelers (particularly with higher levels of compliance). While these positive effects are enhanced when implemented in combination with other public health measures, they are associated with concerns by the public regarding some unintended effects.","Bou-Karroum, Lama; Khabsa, Joanne; Jabbour, Mathilda; Hilal, Nadeen; Haidar, Zeinab; Abi Khalil, Pamela; Khalek, Rima Abdul; Assaf, Jana; Honein-AbouHaidar, Gladys; Samra, Clara Abou; Hneiny, Layal; Al-Awlaqi, Sameh; Hanefeld, Johanna; El-Jardali, Fadi; Akl, Elie A.; Bcheraoui, Charbel El",J Infect,248,1

The aerosols contain fluorescent virus-like nanoparticles to track transmission through materials that greatly assist the accuracy of detection, thus avoiding artifacts including pore flooding and the loss of aerosol due to evaporation and droplet breakup. Effective materials comprise both absorbent, hydrophilic layers and barrier, hydrophobic layers. Although the hydrophobic layers can adhere virus-like nanoparticles, they may also repel droplets from adjacent absorbent layers and prevent wicking transport across the fabric system. Effective designs are noted with absorbent layers comprising terry cloth towel, quilting cotton, and flannel.

A Systematic Review,15.9274645,8.218038,2021-09-09,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) is a global pandemic that started in China in 2019 and has negatively affected all economic sectors of the world, including agriculture. However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector.","Pirasteh-Anosheh, Hadi; Parnian, Amir; Spasiano, Danilo; Race, Marco; Ashraf, Muhammad",Environ Res,248,1

We localized transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike (S) protein in DRMs in the viral envelope. Though S protein was not solubilized by cold non-ionic detergents, this behavior was unchanged when cholesterol was depleted from viral membrane by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and the protein did not comigrate with cellular DRM marker proteins in flotation analyses. Therefore, the S protein is not anchored in the viral membrane DRMs as they are known to occur in the plasma membrane. Cholesterol depletion from viral membrane may not affect the adsorption process as neither the sialic acid binding activity nor the binding to aminopeptidase N was reduced post-MβCD treatment. Reduced infectivity of cholesterol-depleted TGEV was observed only when the adsorption process occurred at 37 °C but not when the virus was applied at 4 °C.

As this global crisis continues with little signs of abatement, we examine burnout and associated factors among HCWs. Design Cross-sectional survey study. Setting and Participants Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative and support staff in four public hospitals and one primary care service in Singapore 3 months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Methods Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised three validated instruments, namely the Oldenberg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were employed to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Results Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3,075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores ≥8, shifts lasting ≥8 hours and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, while high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared to those redeployed onsite. Conclusions and Implications Every level of the healthcare workforce is susceptible to high levels of burnout during this pandemic. Modifiable workplace factors include adequate training, avoiding prolonged shifts ≥8 hours and promoting safe working environments. Mitigating strategies should target every level of the healthcare workforce including frontline and non-frontline staff. Addressing and ameliorating burnout among HCWs should be a key priority for the sustainment of efforts to care for patients in the face of a prolonged pandemic.","Tan, Benjamin YQ.; Abhiram, Kanneganti; Lim, Lucas JH.; Tan, Melanie; Chua, Ying Xian; Tan, Lifeng; Sia, Ching Hui; Denning, Max; Goh, Ee Teng; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Kinross, James; Sim, Kang; Chan, Yiong Huak; Ooi, Shirley",J Am Med Dir Assoc,248,32

PRESENTATION OF CASE: This report presents the case of a never-ventilated 58 years old male patient without pre-existing, underlying lung disease demonstrating severe lung parenchyma changes due to COVID-19-pneumonia. He suffered from recurrent bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces, which were successfully treated with bilateral thoracoscopy and resections of the destroyed lung areas. Notably, he has already been under treatment with anticoagulation due to portal thrombosis 8 years ago. DISCUSSION: Although especially know from patients under mechanical ventilation, this patient suffered from spontaneous pneumothorax without ever been ventilated. Probably due to the severe vascular inflammatory changes and focal endothelitis like also seen in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the pneumothorax may lead to a prolonged air leak, which needs surgical therapy. The patients pre-existing anticoagulation therapy may prevented him from a mere severe course. CONCLUSION: Early surgical therapy may be considered in COVID-19 patients with persistent air leak, even if not mechanically ventilated. Simultaneously, the role of early anticoagulation needs further investigation.","Caviezel, Claudio; Weiss, Lina; Haessig, Gabriela; Alfaré, Christian; Haberecker, Martina; Varga, Zsuzsanna; Frauenfelder, Thomas; Opitz, Isabelle",Int J Surg Case Rep,248,20

Here, we incorporate an epidemic model into a game theoretical framework to investigate the effects of travel strategies on infection control. Potential visitors must decide whether to travel to a destination that is at risk of infectious disease outbreaks. We compare the individually optimal (Nash equilibrium) strategy to the group optimal strategy that maximizes the overall population utility. Economic epidemiological models often find that individual and group optimal strategies are very different. By contrast, we find perfect agreement between individual and group optimal strategies across a wide parameter regime. For more limited regimes where disagreement does occur, the disagreement is (i) generally very extreme; (ii) highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits; and (iii) can manifest either in a higher travel volume for individual optimal than group optimal strategies, or vice versa. The simulations show qualitative agreement with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Beijing, China. We conclude that a conflict between individual and group optimal visitor travel strategies during outbreaks may not generally be a problem, although extreme differences could emerge suddenly under certain changes in economic and epidemiological conditions.","Zhao, Shi; Bauch, Chris T.; He, Daihai",Journal of The Royal Society Interface,248,26
675281,675281,675281,Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Are Not at Increased Risk of COVID-19: A Large Multinational Cohort Study,16.157944,10.022115,2020-10-31,"OBJECTIVES: Several physiological abnormalities that develop during COVID-19 are associated with increased mortality. In the present study, we aimed to develop a clinical risk score to predict the in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, based on a set of variables available soon after the hospitalisation triage. SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of 516 patients consecutively admitted for COVID-19 to two Italian tertiary hospitals located in Northern and Central Italy were collected from 22 February 2020 (date of first admission) to 10 April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients≥18 years admitted for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Simple clinical and laboratory findings readily available after triage were compared by patients’ survival status (‘dead’ vs ‘alive’), with the objective of identifying baseline variables associated with mortality. These were used to build a COVID-19 in-hospital mortality risk score (COVID-19MRS). RESULTS: Mean age was 67±13 years (mean±SD), and 66.9% were male. Using Cox regression analysis, tertiles of increasing age (≥75, upper vs <62 years, lower: HR 7.92; p<0.001) and number of chronic diseases (≥4 vs 0–1: HR 2.09; p=0.007), respiratory rate (HR 1.04 per unit increase; p=0.001), PaO(2)/FiO(2) (HR 0.995 per unit increase; p<0.001), serum creatinine (HR 1.34 per unit increase; p<0.001) and platelet count (HR 0.995 per unit increase; p=0.001) were predictors of mortality. All six predictors were used to build the COVID-19MRS (Area Under the Curve 0.90, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.93), which proved to be highly accurate in stratifying patients at low, intermediate and high risk of in-hospital death (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19MRS is a rapid, operator-independent and inexpensive clinical tool that objectively predicts mortality in patients with COVID-19. The score could be helpful from triage to guide earlier assignment of COVID-19 patients to the most appropriate level of care.","Fumagalli, Carlo; Rozzini, Renzo; Vannini, Matteo; Coccia, Flaminia; Cesaroni, Giulia; Mazzeo, Francesca; Cola, Maria; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Fontanari, Paolo; Lavorini, Federico; Marcucci, Rossella; Morettini, Alessandro; Nozzoli, Carlo; Peris, Adriano; Pieralli, Filippo; Pini, Riccardo; Poggesi, Loredana; Ungar, Andrea; Fumagalli, Stefano; Marchionni, Niccolò",BMJ Open,248,16

We measured humoral immune responses in 72 HDP after standard vaccination with two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses were evaluated with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ChemiLuminescent ImmunoAssay (CLIA) two weeks after the second dose. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in a control of 16 healthy healthcare workers (HCW). The control group of HCW has shown a strong antibody response with a median (MD (Q1; Q3)) antibody titer of 800.0 AU/mL (520.5; 800.0). In comparison to HCW, HDP under 60 years of age responded equally (597.0 AU/mL (410.5; 800.0), p = 0.051). However, the antibody responses of the HDP negatively correlated with age (r(2) = 0.2954 p < 0.0001), leading to significantly lower antibody titers in HDP over 60 years (280.0 AU/mL (45.7; 477.0), p < 0.0001). To thoroughly understand the immunogenicity of the new mRNA-based vaccines in HDP, longitudinal data on the effectiveness and durability of antibody responses are needed. Modifications of immunization schedules should be considered in HDP with low or without antibody responsiveness after standard vaccination to boost immune reactivity and prolong protective effects in these vulnerable patients.","Jahn, Michael; Korth, Johannes; Dorsch, Oliver; Anastasiou, Olympia Evdoxia; Sorge-Hädicke, Burkhard; Tyczynski, Bartosz; Gäckler, Anja; Witzke, Oliver; Dittmer, Ulf; Dolff, Sebastian; Wilde, Benjamin; Kribben, Andreas",Vaccines (Basel),248,16

Impacts of regional weather and climate on epidemics have been investigated but need further study with new methods. We combined the number of monthly confirmed new cases and death with month, latitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and sunshine ultraviolet (UV) to explore the climate impact on epidemics in 116 countries and territories with at least 1000 confirmed cases. Correlation and regression analyses were performed with Stata. Humid subtropical climate regions had the most confirmed COVID-19 cases (24.4%). The case mortality in temperate marine regions was the highest (11.6%). Case-weighted means of the latitude, monthly maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and sunshine UV were 36.7 degrees, 20.5, 63%, 63mm, and 53.5, respectively. The case mortality was 7.44% in cold regions but only 4.68% in hot regions, 7.14% in rainy regions but only 3.86% in rainless regions, and 7.40% in cloudy regions but only 4.64% in sunny regions. Monthly confirmed cases increase as the temperature, rainfall, and sunshine UV rise in cold regions (r=0.34, 0.26, 0.26, respectively), but no correlation in hot regions. Every 1 increase in monthly maximum temperature leads to an increase in the natural logarithm of monthly confirmed new cases by 2.4% in cold regions. Monthly confirmed cases increase as the temperature, rainfall, and sunshine UV rise in arid regions (r=0.29, 0.28, 0.26, respectively), but no correlation in humid regions. Monthly confirmed new cases increase as the temperature and sunshine UV rise in rainy regions (r=0.30, 0.29), but no correlation in rainless regions. Monthly confirmed new deaths increase as the temperature and sunshine UV rise in cloudy regions (r=0.30, 0.30), but no correlation in sunny regions.

Patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and no antecedent liver disease may display evidence of cytolytic liver damage, proportional to the severity of COVID‐19 but rarely of clinical significance. The mechanism of hepatocellular injury is unclear and possibly multifactorial. The clinical impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, a cohort whose global size is difficult to estimate, has been assessed appropriately only recently and data are still evolving. Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk of developing severe COVID‐19 and worse liver‐related outcomes as compared to those with non‐cirrhotic liver disease. OLT patients have an intermediate risk. Specific interventions in order to reduce the risk of transmission of infection among this high‐risk population have been outlined by international societies, together with recommendations for modified treatment and follow‐up regimens during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

The results highlight unidirectional causality between economic growth and pollution. Then, a D2C algorithm on proportion-based causality is applied, implementing the Oryx 2.0.8 protocol in Apache. The underlying hypothesis is that a predetermined pollution concentration, caused by economic growth, could foster COVID-19 by making the respiratory system more susceptible to infection.

SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2. To determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples. We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.","Aguiar, Jennifer A; Tremblay, Benjamin Jean-Marie; Mansfield, Michael J; Woody, Owen; Lobb, Briallen; Banerjee, Arinjay; Chandiramohan, Abiram; Tiessen, Nicholas; Dvorkin-Gheva, Anna; Revill, Spencer; Miller, Matthew S; Carlsten, Christopher; Organ, Louise; Joseph, Chitra; John, Alison; Hanson, Paul J; McManus, Bruce M; Jenkins, Gisli; Mossman, Karen; Ask, Kjetil; Doxey, Andrew C; Hirota, Jeremy A",bioRxiv,248,1

For this purpose, a multiple response optimization was employed using desirability functions, which demand a search for optimal conditions for a set of responses simultaneously. A test set of eighty thyme honey samples were analyzed under the optimum conditions for validation of the proposed model. The optimized combination of isolation conditions was the temperature (60 °C), equilibration time (15 min), extraction time (30 min), magnetic stirrer speed (700 rpm), sample volume (6 mL), water: honey ratio (1:3 v/w) with total desirability over 0.50. It was found that the magnetic stirrer speed, which has not been evaluated before, had a positive effect, especially in combination with other factors. The above-developed methodology proved to be effective in the optimization of isolation of specific volatile compounds from a difficult matrix, like honey.

We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R(0) and R(t) using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of COVID-19 and testing practices from different United States (US) states. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R(0) and R(t). Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of COVID-19.","Pitzer, Virginia E.; Chitwood, Melanie; Havumaki, Joshua; Menzies, Nicolas A.; Perniciaro, Stephanie; Warren, Joshua L.; Weinberger, Daniel M.; Cohen, Ted",medRxiv,248,16

Background Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus that is associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal tract disease. Objectives To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBoV amongst hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in Cambodia. Study Design Samples were collected from 2773 patients of all ages hospitalised with symptoms of ALRI between 2007 and 2009. All samples were screened by multiplex RT‐PCR/PCR for 18 respiratory viruses. All samples positive for HBoV were sequenced and included in this study. Results Of the samples tested, 43 (1·5%) were positive for HBoV. The incidence of HBoV did not vary between the consecutive seasons investigated, and HBoV infections were detected year‐round. The incidence of HBoV infection was highest in patients aged <2 years, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most common clinical diagnosis, regardless of age. A total of 19 patients (44%) were co‐infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory pathogen. All isolates were classified as HBoV type 1 (HBoV‐1). High conservation between Cambodian NP1 and V1V2 gene sequences was observed. Conclusions Human bocavirus infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral co‐infection. Specific studies are required to further understand the true pathogenesis of HBoV in the context of severe respiratory illness.","Arnott, Alicia; Vong, Sirenda; Rith, Sareth; Naughtin, Monica; Ly, Sowath; Guillard, Bertrand; Deubel, Vincent; Buchy, Philippe",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,248,26

METHODS: An HCV progression Markov model was developed considering DAA eligibility and population data during the years 2015‐2019. The period of time to recover the investment in DAAs was calculated as the cost saved by avoiding estimated clinical events for 1000 standardized treated patients. A delayed treatment scenario because of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) was also developed. RESULTS: The estimated number of avoided hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplantations over a 20‐year time horizon was: 1,057 in England; 1,221 in Italy; 1,211 in Romania; and 1,103 in Spain for patients treated during 2015‐2016 and 640 in England; 626 in Italy; 739 in Romania; and 643 in Spain for patients treated during 2017‐2019. The cost‐savings ranged from € 45 to € 275 million. The investment needed to expand access to DAAs in 2015‐2019 is estimated to be recovered in 6.5 years in England; 5.4 years in Italy; 6.7 years in Romania; and 4.5 years in Spain. A delay in treatment because of COVID‐19 will increase liver mortality in all countries. CONCLUSION: Direct‐acting antivirals have significant clinical benefits and can bring substantial cost‐savings over the next 20 years, reaching a Break‐even point in a short period of time. When pursuing an exit strategy from strict lockdown measures for COVID‐19, providing DAAs should remain high on the list of priorities in order to maintain HCV elimination efforts.","Mennini, Francesco S.; Marcellusi, Andrea; Robbins Scott, Sarah; Montilla, Simona; Craxi, Antonio; Buti, Maria; Gheorghe, Liana; Ryder, Stephen; Kondili, Loreta A.",Liver Int,248,20

Amid soaring contagion due to newer strains of the virus, it is imperative to design dynamic, spatiotemporal models to contain the spread of infection during future outbreaks of the same or variants of the virus. The reliance on existing prediction and contact tracing approaches on prior knowledge of inter- or intra-zone mobility renders them impracticable. We present a spatiotemporal approach that employs a network inference approach with sliding time windows solely on the date and number of daily infection numbers of zones within a geographical region to generate temporal networks capturing the influence of each zone on another. It helps analyze the spatial interaction among the hotspot or spreader zones and highly affected zones based on the flow of network contagion traffic. We apply the proposed approach to the daily infection counts of New York State as well as the states of USA to show that it effectively measures the phase shifts in the pandemic timeline. It identifies the spreaders and affected zones at different time points and helps infer the trajectory of the pandemic spread across the country. A small set of zones periodically exhibit a very high outflow of contagion traffic over time, suggesting that they act as the key spreaders of infection. Moreover, the strong influence between the majority of non-neighbor regions suggests that the overall spread of infection is a result of the unavoidable long-distance trips by a large number of people as opposed to the shorter trips at a county level, thereby informing future mitigation measures and public policies.","Roy, Satyaki; Biswas, Preetom; Ghosh, Preetam",Sci Rep,248,1

Besides pets (cats, dogs, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets) and farm animals (minks), different zoo animal species have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (large felids and non-human primates). After the summer of 2020, a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in Barcelona (Spain), reaching a peak of positive cases in November. During that period, four lions (Panthera leo) at the Barcelona Zoo and three caretakers developed respiratory signs and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen. Lion infection was monitored for several weeks and nasal, fecal, saliva, and blood samples were taken at different time-points. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal samples from all studied lions and the viral RNA was detected up to two weeks after the initial viral positive test in three out of four animals. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was also detected in the feces of animals at different times. Virus isolation was successful only from respiratory samples of two lions at an early time-point. The four animals developed neutralizing antibodies after the infection that were detectable four months after the initial diagnosis. The partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from one animal caretaker was identical to the sequences obtained from lions. Chronology of the events, the viral dynamics, and the genomic data support human-to-lion transmission as the origin of infection.","Fernández-Bellon, Hugo; Rodon, Jordi; Fernández-Bastit, Leira; Almagro, Vanessa; Padilla-Solé, Pilar; Lorca-Oró, Cristina; Valle, Rosa; Roca, Núria; Grazioli, Santina; Trogu, Tiziana; Bensaid, Albert; Carrillo, Jorge; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Blanco, Julià; Parera, Mariona; Noguera-Julián, Marc; Clotet, Bonaventura; Moreno, Ana; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia",Viruses,248,23

METHODS: We review the data of children who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 for a suspected infection. We compared the clinical characteristics of the subjects who tested positive and negative, including the sensibility, positive and negative predictive value of different combination of signs and symptoms. RESULTS: Of all the suspected infected, 2596 tested negative (96.2%) and 103 tested positive (3.8%). The median age was 7.0 and 5.3 years for the positive and negative ones, respectively. The female to male ratio was ~1:1.3. Fever and respiratory symptoms were mostly reported. Most positive children had a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects (59.2%). A total of 99.3% of patients without fever nor exposure to the virus proved negative to the SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a child without fever or contact with infected subjects is SARS-CoV-2 negative. If this were to be confirmed, many resources would be spared, with improved care of both COVID-19 and not COVID-19-affected children. IMPACT: Key message: lack of fever and exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected people highly predicts a negative results of the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab in the paediatric population. Added value to the current literature: this is the first article to prove this point. Impact: reduction of emergency department accesses of children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection; increased outpatient management of children with cough or other common respiratory symptoms of infancy; sparing of many human and material health resources.","Roversi, Marco; Raucci, Umberto; Pontrelli, Giuseppe; Ranno, Stefania; Ambrosi, Michela; Torelli, Antonio; Pisani, Mara; Coltella, Luana; Piccioni, Livia; Colagrossi, Luna; Agosta, Marilena; Scialanga, Barbara; Reale, Antonino; Perno, Carlo Federico; Rossi, Paolo; Villani, Alberto",Pediatr Res,248,24

Bivariate and multivariate analyzes were performed. RESULTS: About 387 respondents agreed to participate in the study. The study showed low awareness regarding infectious agents, lifestyle, diet and many work exposures. The predictors of the attitude of respondents regarding the preventability of cancer were: believing that cancer has an environmental cause (p=.014), not having a healthy lifestyle (p = 0.004), not smoking waterpipe (p = 0.023), being single (p = 0.013), and having a university degree (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be made to improve awareness of the cancer risk factors regarding infectious agents, lifestyle, diet and many work exposures. This can also be followed by further studies assessing the impact of these community and governmental cancer prevention initiatives on cancer risk factors level of awareness.","KABALAN, MAYSSAN; EL-HAJJ, MAYA; KHACHMAN, DALIA; AWADA, SANAA; RACHIDI, SAMAR; AL-HAJJE, AMAL; AJROUCHE, ROULA",J Prev Med Hyg,248,1

The goal of this systematic review was to examine the success of different practices in preventing viral transmission between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and their infants. METHODS Electronic searches were performed in the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Studies involving pregnant or breastfeeding patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were included. Infants tested within 48 hours of birth who had two tests before hospital discharge were included. Infants older than one week with a single test were also included. RESULTS Twenty eight studies were included. In the aggregated data, among 190 breastfeeding infants, 22 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (11.5%), while 4 of 152 (2.63%) among bottle-fed (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0006). The positivity rates for roomed in infants (20/103, 19.4%) were significantly higher than those isolated (5/300, 1.67%) (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in positivity rate among infants who received kangaroo care (25%vs 9%, p = 0.2170), or delayed cord clamping (3.62%vs 0.9%, p = 0.1116). CONCLUSIONS Lack of robust studies involving large patient population does not allow meaningful conclusions from this systematic review. Aggregated data showed increased positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 among infants who were breast fed and roomed-in. There were no differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in infants received skin to skin care or delayed cord clamping.","Kollikonda, S; Chavan, M; Cao, C; Yao, M; Hackett, L; Karnati, S",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,248,26

A case report,16.23037,9.943074,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious damage to public health. COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific therapy; its mortality rate increases significantly once patients deteriorate. Furthermore, intensive monitoring of COVID-19 is limited by insufficient medical resources and increased risks of exposure to medical staff. We therefore aim to build an early warning and rapid response system (EWRRS) to address these problems. METHOD: The research is designed as a prospective cohort study, to verify a dynamic and interactive evaluation system; it includes patient self-reporting, active monitoring, early alarming and treatment recommendations. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be recruited from Sept 2020 to Aug 2021 at a tertiary contagious hospital. Patients with life expectancy <48 hours, pregnant or lactating, in immunosuppression states or end-stage diseases will be excluded. The intervention is implementation of EWRRS to detect early signs of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients, to provide timely and efficient treatment suggestions by the system. EWRRS can determine the classification and interactive evaluation of patient information; the determination is based on the application of 3 different scenario modules, separately driven by patients, nurses, and physicians. The primary outcome is change in disease severity category after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with different disease severity types; critical deterioration events; patients who had unplanned transfers to an intensive care unit (ICU) and required critical care interventions; intervals from warning to implementation of clinical interventions; hospital mortality; length of ICU and hospital stay; workload of medical staff and risks of exposure to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis is that EWRRS provides an example of an early identification, warning, and response system for COVID-19. In addition, EWRRS can potentially be extended to use as a grading metric for general critically ill patients in an ICU setting.","Zhou, Hua; Huang, Huibin; Xie, Xiaolei; Gao, Jiandong; Wu, Ji; Zhu, Yan; He, Wei; Liu, Jingyuan; Li, Ang; Xu, Yuan",Medicine (Baltimore),248,15

Currently, most of the research efforts towards the development of vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were mainly focused on the spike (S) protein, which mediates virus entry into the host cell by binding to ACE2. As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, variants have emerged, characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the “UK variant”, in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant. Our work also adds useful structural information on antigenic “hotspots” and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.","Borocci, Stefano; Cerchia, Carmen; Grottesi, Alessandro; Sanna, Nico; Prandi, Ingrid Guarnetti; Abid, Nabil; Beccari, Andrea R.; Chillemi, Giovanni; Talarico, Carmine",Int J Mol Sci,248,1

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), one of the most relevant arbovirus currently known, is a re-emergent virus that causes a disease named chikungunya fever, characterized by a severe arthralgia (joint pains) that can persist for several months or years in some individuals. Until now, no vaccine or specific antiviral drug is commercially available. Nitrogen heterocyclic scaffolds are found in medications, such as aristeromycin, favipiravir, fluorouracil, 6-azauridine, thioguanine, pyrimethamine, among others. New families of natural and synthetic nitrogen analogous compounds are reported to have significant anti-CHIKV effects. In the present work, we focus on these nitrogen-based heterocyclic compounds as an important class with CHIKV antiviral activity. We summarize the present understanding on this class of compounds against CHIKV and also present their possible mechanism of action.","Santana, Andreza C.; Silva Filho, Ronaldo C.; Menezes, José C.

METHODS: The plasmid pET-MS2-pac was constructedwith one C-variant pac site, and then the plasmid pM-CR-2C containing 1,891-bp chimeric sequences and two C-variant pac sites was produced. Meanwhile, three plasmids (pM-CR-C, pM-CR-2W and pM-CR-W) were obtained as parallel controls with a different number and affinity of the pac site. Finally, the armored RNA was expressed and purified. RESULTS: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases target RNA was expressed successfully by the one-plasmid expression system with two C-variant pac sites, while for one pac site, no matter whether the affinity was changed or not, only the 1,200 bases target RNA was packaged. It was also found that the C-variant pac site could increase the expression efficiency of the armored RNA. The armored RNA with 1,891-bp exogenous RNA in our study showed the characterization of ribonuclease resistance and stability at different time points and temperature conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The armored RNA with 1,891 bases exogenous RNA was constructed and the expression system can be used as a platform for preparation of the armored RNA containing long RNA sequences.","Wei, Baojun; Wei, Yuxiang; Zhang, Kuo; Yang, Changmei; Wang, Jing; Xu, Ruihuan; Zhan, Sien; Lin, Guigao; Wang, Wei; Liu, Min; Wang, Lunan; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Intervirology,248,17

We report here on 10 years of serological and molecular data in African lions, leveraging comprehensive demographic and behavioural data to test if endemic pathogens shape subsequent infection by epidemic pathogens. We combine network and community ecology approaches to assess broad network structure and characterise associations between pathogens across spatial and temporal scales. We found significant non‐random structure in the lion‐pathogen co‐occurrence network and identified both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens.

Analysis of 28 distinct anatomic sites from 21 steers infected with FMDV serotype A, O or SAT2, had the highest prevalence of overall viral detection in the dorsal nasopharynx (80.95%) and dorsal soft palate (71.43%). FMDV was less frequently detected in laryngeal mucosal tissues, oropharyngeal mucosal sites, and lymph nodes draining the pharynx. Immunomicroscopy indicated that within persistently infected mucosal tissues, FMDV antigens were rarely detectable within few epithelial cells in regions of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Transcriptome analysis of persistently infected pharyngeal tissues by qRT-PCR for 14 cytokine genes indicated a general trend of decreased mRNA levels compared to uninfected control animals. Although, statistically significant differences were not observed, greatest suppression of relative expression (RE) was identified for IP-10 (RE = 0.198), IFN-β (RE = 0.269), IL-12 (RE = 0.275), and IL-2 (RE = 0.312). Increased relative expression was detected for IL-6 (RE = 2.065). Overall, this data demonstrates that during the FMDV carrier state in cattle, viral persistence is associated with epithelial cells of the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory tract and decreased levels of mRNA for several immunoregulatory cytokines in the infected tissues.","Pacheco, Juan M.; Smoliga, George R.; O’Donnell, Vivian; Brito, Barbara P.; Stenfeldt, Carolina; Rodriguez, Luis L.; Arzt, Jonathan",PLoS One,248,16

Early challenges showed the insufficient drones’ steering capacity and cognitive gap related to the lack of theoretical foundation for controlling algorithms. The aim of this paper is to present a game-based algorithm of controlling behaviours in the relation between an operator (OP) and a technical object (TO), based on the assumption that the game is logistics-oriented and the algorithm is to support ML applied in e-commerce optimization management. Algebraic methods, including matrices, Lagrange functions, systems of differential equations, and set-theoretic notation, have been used as the main tools. The outcome is a model of a game-based optimization process in a two-element logistics system and an algorithm applied to find optimal steering strategies. The algorithm has been initially verified with the use of simulation based on a Bayesian network (BN) and a structured set of possible strategies (OP/TO) calculated with the use of QGeNie Modeller, finally prepared for Python. It has been proved the algorithm at this stage has no deadlocks and unforeseen loops and is ready to be challenged with the original big set of learning data from a drone-operating company (as the next stage of the planned research).","Miler, Ryszard K.; Kuriata, Andrzej; Brzozowska, Anna; Akoel, Akram; Kalinichenko, Antonina",Sensors (Basel),248,28

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 32 children, aged 12 through 18 years, diagnosed with probable myopericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination as per the CDC criteria for myopericarditis at 9 US centers between May 10, 2021 and June 20, 2021. We retrospectively collected the following data: demographics, SARS-CoV-2 virus detection or serologic testing, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging study results, treatment and time to resolutions of symptoms. RESULTS: Most (90%) cases followed the second dose of vaccine, and chest pain (100%) was the most common presenting symptom. Patients came to medical attention a median of 2 days (range: <1-20 days) after receipt of Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. All adolescents had an elevated plasma troponin concentration. Echocardiographic abnormalities were infrequent, and 84% showed normal cardiac function at presentation. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), obtained in 16 patients (50%), revealed that 15 (94%) had late gadolinium enhancement consistent with myopericarditis. Most were treated with ibuprofen or an equivalent NSAID for symptomatic relief, one patient was treated primarily with a corticosteroid orally and three patients were given a corticosteroid orally after initial administration of ibuprofen or NSAID; two patients also received intravenous immune globulin. Symptom resolution was observed within 7 days in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that symptoms due to myopericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination tend to be mild and transient.

PURPOSE: To assess the performance of United States (U.S.) and Chinese radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT. METHODS: A total of 219 patients with both positive COVID-19 by RT-PCR and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 7 Chinese hospitals in Hunan Providence, China from January 6 to February 20, 2020. A total of 205 patients with positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel for viral pneumonia and CT findings consistent with or highly suspicious for pneumonia by original radiology interpretation within 7 days of each other were identified from Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Three Chinese radiologists blindly reviewed all chest CTs (n=424) to differentiate COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. A sample of 58 age-matched cases was randomly selected and evaluated by 4 U.S. radiologists in a similar fashion. Different CT features were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: For all chest CTs, three Chinese radiologists correctly differentiated COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia 83% (350/424), 80% (338/424), and 60% (255/424) of the time, respectively.
