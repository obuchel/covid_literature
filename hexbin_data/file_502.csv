Experimental models in five species, the mouse, rabbit, swine, cat, and ferret, were established with use of 10 viruses: Herpesvirus hominis types 1 and 2, murine cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, Shope fibroma virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, swine influenza virus, feline viral rhinotracheitis virus, feline panleukopenia virus, and ferret distemper virus. Criteria for selection were: (1) representation from a number of major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. Antiviral activity was observed for 5-iododeoxyuridine in H. hominis infections in hairless mice and influenza in swine, and a slight degree of efficacy was noted in rabbits infected with Shope fibroma virus. Toxicity was also observed in most of the experimental models. There was a suggestion of antiviral activity with 6-azauridine in swine infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; however, enhancement of disease and some toxicity were seen in most of the other models. Efficacy of these two compounds was not well substantiated by these studies.","Steffenhagen, K. A.; Easterday, B. C.; Galasso, G.

Determinations of Na-K-ATPase in mucosal homogenates from small and large intestine revealed decreased activity of this enzyme in the upper small bowel. Our data indicate that a defect in active sodium transport in this region may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the diarrhea. Further studies using this model should help to define the mechanisms producing diarrhea in acute infantile gastroenteritis.","Kelly, M.; Butler, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131288/,502

Current vaccine production facilities would be unable to meet the global requirement for vaccine. As a possible supplement a DNA vaccine may be appropriate, and bioprocess engineering factors bearing on the use of existing biopharmaceutical and antibiotics plants to produce it are described. This approach addresses the uncertainty of timing of a pandemic that precludes purpose‐built facilities. The strengths and weaknesses of alternative downstream processing routes are analyzed, and several gaps in public domain information are addressed. The conclusion is that such processing would be challenging but feasible.","Hoare, Mike; Levy, M.

With the outbreak of viral infection, a large number of newly diagnosed and died patients infected with various viruses are still reported every year. Viral infection has already been one of the major global public health issues and lead to huge economic and social burdens. Studying of viral pathogenesis is a very important way to find methods for prevention, diagnosis, and cure of viral infection; more evidence has confirmed that major vault protein (MVP) is closely associated with viral infection and pathogenesis, and this review is intended to provide a broad relationship between viruses and MVP to stimulate the interest of related researchers.","Wang, Wei; Xiong, Liang; Wang, Pengyun; Wang, Fubing; Ma, Qingfeng",IUBMB Life,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165711/,502
10023,"Context of diversification of the viviparous Gyrodactylidae (Platyhelminthes, Monogenoidea)",2003-08-13,"Summary: Although viral variants which are not recognized by epitope‐specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have been shown lo arise during a number of persistent virus infections, in many cases their significance remains controversial: it has been argued that the immune response is sufficiently plastic to contain their replication. In this review, we describe the mechanisms by which amino acid changes in viral proteins may affect epitope recognition by virus‐specific CTL, and discuss the viral and immunological basis for the emergence of viral variants bearing such amino acid changes during infection. We then consider the impact that viral variation may have on the host CTL response and its ability to contain virus replication. We argue that the emergence of a viral variant demonstrates that it must have an in vivo replicative advantage, and that as such, the variant must tip the balance between virus replication and immune control somewhat in favor of the virus. Further, we suggest that although the immune response can evolve to recognize new viral epitopes, the CTL generated following such evolution frequently have a reduced ability to contain virus replication. We conclude that this escape mechanism likely does make a significant contribution to persistence/pathogenesis during a number of different virus infections.","Borrow, Persephone; Shaw, George M.",Immunol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165923/,502

The mechanism of their cytotoxic activity has been also examined by immunoassaying the levels of key anti- and proapoptotic protein markers. The analytical and spectral data of the all synthesized target congeners were compatible with their structures. Synthesized compounds showed diverse moderate to powerful antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results of MTT assay revealed that seven synthesized compounds (i.e., 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b, 13b, 13c and 13h) particularly exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the three cancerous cell lines under investigation. Ranges of IC(50) values obtained were 5.7–21.3 and 5.8–37.4 µg/mL against HCT-116 and MCF-7, respectively; which is 3.8 and 6.5-fold (based on the least IC(50) values) more significant relative to the reference chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In HepG-2 cells, the analogue 13h exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC(50) value of 19.2µg/mL relative to doxorubicin (IC(50) = 21.6µg/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was specific to cancerous cells, as evidenced by the minimal toxicity in the noncancerous control skin-fibroblast cells. ELISA results indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect against examined cancer cell lines is mediated via engaging the activation of apoptosis as illustrated by the significant increase in proapoptotic protein markers (p53, bax and caspase-3) and reduction in the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2. Taken together, results of the present study emphasize the potential of spiro pyrazole-oxindole analogues as valuable candidate anticancer agents against human cancer cells.","Abo-Salem, Heba M.; Nassrallah, Amr; Soliman, Ahmed A.F.; Ebied, Manal S.; Elawady, Mohamed E.; Abdelhamid, Sayeda A.; El-Sawy, Eslam R.; Al-Sheikh, Yazeed A.; Aboul-Soud, Mourad A.

10743,Vaping induced pneumonitis: a small community hospital’s case series and analysis,2020-05-04,"In the preantibiotic era, passive antibody administration (serum therapy) was useful for the treatment of many infectious diseases. The introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy in the 1940s led to the rapid abandonment of many forms of passive antibody therapy. Chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than antibody therapy. In this last decade of the 20th century the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy is diminishing because of the rapidly escalating number of immunocompromised individuals, the emergence of new pathogens, the reemergence of old pathogens, and widespread development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This diminishment in the effectiveness of chemotherapy has been paralleled by advances in monoclonal antibody technology that have made feasible the generation of human antibodies. This combination of factors makes passive antibody therapy an option worthy of serious consideration. We propose that for every pathogen there exists an antibody that will modify the infection to the benefit of the host. Such antibodies are potential antimicrobial agents. Antibody-based therapies have significant advantages and disadvantages relative to standard chemotherapy. The reintroduction of antibody-based therapy would require major changes in the practices of infectious disease specialists.","Casadevall, Arturo; Scharff, Matthew D.",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197598/,502
11672,The Negative Implications of Being Tolerated: Tolerance From the Target’s Perspective,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND: Between 5% and 30% of children in high-income countries live with a substance misusing parent, the majority of which is below dependent levels. However, little is understood about the impact of nondependent parental substance misuse upon children. METHODS: We searched the international literature using rigorous systematic methods to identify studies examining parental substance misuse and adverse outcomes in children. The inclusion criteria were cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and cohort studies; of children aged 0–18 years whose parents are high-risk substance misusers; reporting on their health, psychological, substance use, educational, and social outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 36 papers (from 33 unique studies), most of which were assessed as being of medium to high methodological quality (N= 28). Parental nondependent substance misuse was found to be associated with adversity in children, with strong evidence of an association with externalizing difficulties (N = 7 papers, all finding an association) and substance use (N = 23 papers, all finding an association) in adolescents and some evidence of adverse health outcomes in early childhood (N = 6/8 papers finding an association). There is less evidence of an association between parental substance misuse and adverse educational and social outcomes. The body of evidence was largest for parental alcohol misuse, with research examining the impact of parental illicit drug use being limited. CONCLUSION: Methodological limitations restrict our ability to make causal inference. Nonetheless, the prevalence of adverse outcomes in children whose parents are nondependent substance misusers highlights the need for practitioners to intervene with this population before a parent has developed substance dependency.","McGovern, Ruth; Gilvarry, Eilish; Addison, Michelle; Alderson, Hayley; Geijer-Simpson, Emma; Lingam, Raghu; Smart, Debbie; Kaner, Eileen",Trauma Violence Abuse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7243080/,502
14755,On the Adaptive Value of Paranormal Beliefs - a Qualitative Study,2021-01-19,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, and made a worldwide health emergency. Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.","Razizadeh, Meghdad; Nikfar, Mehdi; Liu, Yaling",ChemRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814830/,502

Hence, it is equally critical that the energy cycle must have a sustainable structure. Therefore, it is an indisputable fact that developing and performing correct and consistent energy policies is vitally necessary. Energy consumption planning includes a continuous process to reassess existing and potential alternative energy approaches and strategies. The public and private decision-makers in charge of planning and managing energy consumption policies must adapt their strategies to novel and superior alternative resources according to sustainability and efficiency criteria. In this paper, the fuzzy EDAS method is used to address the best renewable energy consumption by taking political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental (PESTLE) dimensions into account. The analysis of the paper indicates the most efficient renewable energy consumption is sourced by geothermal, solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and biomass, respectively. By further investigation, it is concluded that the most optimum renewable energy consumption alternatives based on PESTLE dimensions are geothermal and solar energies.","Demirtas, Ozgur; Derindag, Omer Faruk; Zarali, Fulya; Ocal, Oguz; Aslan, Alper",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941332/,502
16630,Medical students’ perspective on common stressors experienced at medical school and how to address them,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: Nimodipine is routinely administered in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, the effect of nimodipine on oxygen exchange in the lungs is insufficiently explored. METHODS: The study explored nimodipine medication in artificially ventilated patients with aSAH. The data collection period was divided into nimodipine-dependent (ND) and nimodipine-independent (NID) periods. Values for arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) were collected and compared between the periods. Patients were divided in those with lung injury (LI), defined as median Horowitz index (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ≤40 kPa (≤300 mmHg), and without and in those with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and without. RESULTS: A total of 53 out of 150 patients were artificially ventilated, and in 29 patients, the Horowitz index could be compared between ND and NID periods. A linear mixed model showed that during ND period the Horowitz index was 2.3 kPa (95% CI, 1.0–3.5 kPa, P<0.001) lower when compared to NID period. The model suggested that in the presence of LI, ND period is associated with a decrease of the index by 2.8 kPa (95% CI, 1.2–4.3 kPa, P<0.001). The decrease was more pronounced with LRTI than without: 3.4 kPa (95% CI, 0.8–6.1 kPa) vs. 2.1 kPa (95% CI, 0.7–3.4 kPa), P=0.011 and P=0.002, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LI or LRTI in the context of aSAH, pulmonary function may worsen with nimodipine treatment. The drop of 2 to 3 kPa of the Horowitz index in patients with no lung pathology may not outweigh the benefits of nimodipine. However, in individuals with concomitant lung injury, the effect may be clinically relevant.","Lunkiewicz, Justyna; Brandi, Giovanna; Willms, Jan; Strässle, Christian; Narula, Gagan; Keller, Emanuela; Muroi, Carl",Acta Neurochir (Wien),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024036/,502

The sufficiency of the conditions permits the construction of correct communicating systems; their necessity shows that all choreography-defined communicating system can be obtained in this way.

However, it is still not straightforward to employ such simulators in the typical DRL pipeline, since their steep learning curve and the enormous amount of development required to interface with DRL methods significantly restrict their use by researchers. To overcome these limitations, in this work we present an open-source framework that combines an established interface used by DRL researchers, the OpenAI Gym interface, with the state-of-the-art Webots robot simulator in order to provide a standardized way to employ DRL in various robotics scenarios. Deepbots aims to enable researchers to easily develop DRL methods in Webots by handling all the low-level details and reducing the required development effort.

We use this notion to analyse the learnability of certain concepts, defined as the capability of a classifier to recognise unseen members of a concept after training on a random subset of it. We first use this method to measure the learnability of concepts on pretrained word embeddings. We then develop a statistical analysis of concept learnability, based on hypothesis testing and ROC curves, in order to compare the relative merits of various embedding algorithms using a fixed corpora and hyper parameters.

Conventional vaccines provide effective protection for birds to survive ND outbreaks, but they may not completely suppress NDV shedding. NDV strains circulate on farms for a long time after the initial infection and cause potential risks. A new vaccine with fast clearance ability and low viral shedding is needed. In this study, we used interleukin-12 (IL-12) as an adjuvant and electroporation (EP) as an advanced delivery system to improve a DNA vaccine candidate. The fusion (F) protein gene from an NDV strain of the prevalent genotype VII.1.1 was cloned to prepare the vaccine. Chickens immunized with the F gene DNA vaccine co-delivered with an IL-12-expressing plasmid DNA showed higher neutralizing antibody levels and stronger concanavalin-A-induced lymphocyte proliferation than those treated with the F gene DNA vaccine alone. The co-delivered vaccine provided 100% protection, and less viral shedding and a shorter release time were observed in challenged chickens than when the F gene DNA vaccine was administered alone. The use of F gene DNA combined with IL-12 delivered by electroporation is a promising approach for vaccination against ND.","Xie, Peng; Li, Yanling; Li, Yaling; Liang, Jianpeng; Xiang, Bin; Lin, Qiuyan; Jin, Jiaqi; Ding, Chan; Xu, Chenggang; Ren, Tao",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282469/,502

The optimal mode of mechanical ventilation for managing PBLI is not currently known, and clinical trials in humans are impossible due to the sporadic and violent nature of the disease. METHODS: A high-fidelity multi-organ computational simulator of PBLI pathophysiology was configured to replicate data from 14 PBLI casualties from the conflict in Afghanistan. Adaptive and responsive ventilatory protocols implementing low tidal volume (LTV) ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) were applied to each simulated patient for 24 h, allowing direct quantitative comparison of their effects on gas exchange, ventilatory parameters, haemodynamics, extravascular lung water and indices of ventilator-induced lung injury. RESULTS: The simulated patients responded well to both ventilation strategies. Post 24-h investigation period, the APRV arm had similar PF ratios (137 mmHg vs 157 mmHg), lower sub-injury threshold levels of mechanical power (11.9 J/min vs 20.7 J/min) and lower levels of extravascular lung water (501 ml vs 600 ml) compared to conventional LTV. Driving pressure was higher in the APRV group (11.9 cmH(2)O vs 8.6 cmH(2)O), but still significantly less than levels associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate use of APRV may offer casualties with PBLI important mortality-related benefits and should be considered for management of this challenging patient group.","Scott, Timothy E.; Das, Anup; Haque, Mainul; Bates, Declan G.; Hardman, Jonathan G.",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309205/,502

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 32 patients with knee osteoarthritis who were scheduled to undergo primary and unilateral TKA reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were enrolled into this prospective single-institution cohort study. Demographic and epidemiological data, travel and contact history were collected. Eligible cohort was randomly assigned to a study (TKA using containment sheet) group and a control group (TKA without containment sheet). Radiological and functional outcomes before operation and at the final follow-up were assessed using Western Ontario and Mc-master Universities Osteoarthritis Index score (WOMAC) and the visual analog scale (VAS). The primary outcome was the postoperative effectiveness of containment sheet and face shield, defined as the numbers of countable macroscopic aerosols and/or splatters to naked eyes. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05 levels. RESULTS: Present cohort was comprised of 14 men (43.75%) and 18 women (56.25%) with an average age of 65.45 ± 4.07 years (range, 62–75 years). There were no statistically significant differences with regard to baseline parameters and perioperative demographics. Functional outcomes for knee function at the last follow-up showed significant improvement in both the groups (p < 0.05). Face shield showed significant number of aerosols/splatters in control group. Highest number/concentration of aerosols/splatters was contained within the sheet. CONCLUSION: The proposed containment sheet can minimize the dispersion of aerosols and splatters generated during TKA and provide a safe healthcare environment in a cost-effective manner.","Shah, Vikram Indrajit; Upadhyay, Sachin; Shah, Kalpesh; Singh, Vipin",Arthroplasty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7449786/,502

41152,The Austrian Corona Panel Project: monitoring individual and societal dynamics amidst the COVID-19 crisis,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious disease with highly morbidity and mortality that causes serious health problems worldwide. Atypical mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play critical roles in the development of tissues and have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets for various diseases. However, the potential role of atypical MAPKs in ALI remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of atypical MAPKs family member MAPK4 in ALI using LPS-induced murine ALI model. RESULTS: We found that MAPK4 deficiency mice exhibited prolonged survival time after LPS challenge, accompanied by alleviated pathology in lung tissues, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered composition of immune cells in BALF. Furthermore, the transduction of related signaling pathways, including MK5, AKT, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways, was reduced obviously in LPS-treated MAPK4(−/−) mice. Notably, the expression of MAPK4 was up-regulated in lung tissues of ALI model, which was not related with MAPK4 promoter methylation, but negatively orchestrated by transcriptional factors NFKB1 and NR3C1. Further studies have shown that the expression of MAPK4 was also increased in LPS-treated macrophages. Meanwhile, MAPK4 deficiency reduced the expression of related pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophage in response to LPS treatment. Finally, MAPK4 knockdown using shRNA pre-treatment could ameliorate the pathology of lung tissues and prolong the survival time of mice after LPS challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings reveal an important biological function of atypical MAPK in mediating the pathology of ALI, indicating that MAPK4 might be a novel potential therapeutic target for ALI treatment.","Mao, Ling; Zhou, Ya; Chen, Longqing; Hu, Lin; Liu, Shiming; Zheng, Wen; Zhao, Juanjuan; Guo, Mengmeng; Chen, Chao; He, Zhixu; Xu, Lin",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7570399/,502
41956,Reinventing the Wheel in ARDS: Awake Proning in COVID-19,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are at increased risk of thrombotic adverse events. Plasma derived immune globulin (IG) products, which are used in pregnancy for various indications, may contain procoagulant impurity activated coagulation factor XI (FXIa). Procoagulant IG products have been associated with increased thrombogenicity but their effect in pregnancy is unknown. METHODS: Late pregnant (gestation days 17–20) or early lactation (days 1–3) and control female mice were treated with IGs supplemented with human FXIa then subjected to ferric chloride (FeCl(3)) vessel injury. Occlusion of blood vessel was assessed by recording blood velocity in the femoral vein for 20 min using doppler ultrasound laser imaging. FXIa dose was selected by the ability to increase thrombin generation in mouse plasma in vitro. RESULTS: FXIa produced robust thrombin generation in mouse plasma ex vivo. Following FeCl(3) injury, pregnant and non-pregnant mice receiving IG + FXIa exhibited faster reduction of blood velocity in femoral vein compared to IG alone or untreated controls. In vitro, thrombin generation in plasma samples collected after thrombosis in FXIa-treated animals was elevated and could be reduced by anti-FXI antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that intravenously-administered FXIa may contribute to thrombosis at the site of vascular injury in both pregnant and non-pregnant animals.

Unlike external stigma, internal stigma is not well explored in in the Middle East and North African countries, while grasping this particular form of stigma is essential to limit its effects. The present study aims to measure internal stigma effects and to identify factors associated with this kind of stigma not yet documented among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Morocco. METHODS: The PLHIV Stigma Index questionnaire (adapted and translated into French and Moroccan Arabic dialect “darija”) was used to collect information regarding the stigma and discrimination experienced by PLHIV across 8 cities in Morocco (September–October 2016). A randomly drawn cluster of 10 PLHIV, consisting of 5 men and 5 women, was drawn at each participating medical care center to achieve a nationally representative sample of PLHIV. Fifteen interviewers living with HIV and five supervisors were selected and trained to administer the questionnaire. An internal stigma score (range: 0–7), was calculated based on seven negative feelings/ beliefs. Negative binomial regression was used to identify characteristics associated with the internal stigma score. RESULTS: Among 626 PLHIV, internal stigma was reported by 88.2%. The median [IQR] internal stigma score was 4 [2–5]. Regarding internal stigma, 51% avoided going to the local clinic when needed and 44% chose not to attend social gatherings. Belonging to at least one key population (aIRR [95%CI] = 1.15 [1.03; 1.28]), experiencing discriminatory reactions from family following HIV status disclosure (1.28 [1.11; 1.49]), avoiding HIV services for fear of stigmatization by staff (1.16 [1.05; 1.28]) and being denied health services because of HIV status (1.16 [1.03;1.32]), are among the factors significantly associated with an increase of the internal stigma score. CONCLUSIONS: Internal stigma is high among Moroccan PLHIV and significantly impacting their life decisions and their healthcare access.

Of particular importance is the extent to which industrial, domestic, and agricultural discharges are modifying the dissolved inorganic constituents (major elements, trace elements, nutrients, and heavy metals) of large river systems vis-à-vis water quality. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown provides a rare opportunity to quantify the impact of restricted anthropogenic activities on the water chemistry resilience of large rivers. By analyzing the daily geochemical record of the Ganga River, we demonstrate that reduced industrial discharge during 51 days of mandated nationwide lockdown decreased the dissolved heavy metal concentrations by a minimum of 50%. In contrast, nitrate and phosphate inputs predominantly derived from agricultural runoff and domestic sewage maintained a chemical status quo as these sources were not impacted by the nationwide confinement or their residence time was longer than the characteristic time of the perturbation. We demonstrate the high resilience of dissolved heavy metals and conclude that industrial wastewater minimization programs will substantially improve heavy metal pollution of the Ganga River in a short time span of a few months.","Shukla, Tanuj; Sen, Indra S.; Boral, Soumita; Sharma, Sanjeet",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7860139/,502

I argue that the inherent deficiencies of the educational system, starting with the structural constraints and ending with the psycho-social context in which Roma (or minoritized, marginalized, vulnerable) children learn, can be and are challenged by initiatives, strategies or processes that fall out of the immediate range of the strict framework of the educational system. Bourdieu used the Maxwell’s demon as a metaphor to illustrate the reproduction of socio-economic inequalities in the framework of school system. But this ‘demon’ might be challenged with more or less success if we step out and look for possible ‘tools’ to counteract this demon. Two such cases are presented in this chapter. One is a project implemented with and by the local Roma community using external financing and the other one is the participation of the members of the communities in international migration and use of remittances. I will emphasize that independently of the type and amount of the mobilized resources the individuals and/or communities are able to create and proactively make good use of path-departing opportunities through mechanisms of redefining and changing contextual constraints thus improvements can be observed in the school participation of the Roma children (PS. PS. The article was written before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. Its effects seems to neutralize the positive impact of the above mentioned processes: the slow steps taken in improving the socio-economic situation of the Roma seems to be stopped; prejudices and ethnic hatred seems to be stronger; access to services for Roma communities get more difficult, including to education: in this context, a further research question is how on-line schooling changed or will change the participation of Roma children?).","Toma, Stefánia",Social and Economic Vulnerability of Roma People,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7869945/,502

This chapter presents the findings derived from a panel study of three consecutive mass surveys conducted with the same respondents prior to and then after the referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union that took place on 23 June 2016. Analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data is used to highlight the intricate complexities of this remarkable vote and the findings reveal that there is unprecedented polarisation and division within communities.

One in four children suffer from chronic undernutrition and approximately 820 million people have a caloric deficit. The effects of malnutrition are transgenerational and they have an impact from the individual to the national level. Although globally there is sufficient food for all, several countries have inadequately domestic food production. Moreover, the deficit in micronutrient achieves about 3 billion people worldwide due to the lower levels in food or availability of these micronutrients for absorption by the intestines. Therefore, agronomic sciences have an important role in providing nutritious food (quality) rather than adequate calories (quantity). In this scenario, biofortification is a notable tool to improve individual nutritional status. Biofortification is the use of the most appropriate biotechnological or traditional breeding practices for micronutrient enrichment (such as vitamins and chemical elements) of staple crops. From the chemical elements considered essential, the deficiencies of calcium, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are the most common. Several studies for biofortification were conducted focusing the use of agronomic approaches (use of fertilizers in soils, irrigation water, and hydroponic cultivation systems, or by the foliar application during plant growth), conventional breeding, and genetic approaches (the ancient breeding to the modern genetic engineering employing synthetic genes), and the plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM) approaches (use of microorganisms in soil/plant rhizosphere during plant growth). These biofortification approaches have disadvantages and advantages and are dependent on important variables such as farming practices and soil properties. Moreover, biofortification must be associated with the plant-resistance to stress during cultivation, yield improvement, food color/palatability, and the bioavailability of the nutrients after human ingestion. The highest number of publications on biofortification are from countries that are among the main food producers in the world (the USA, India, China, Australia, and Brazil), evidencing the importance of this technique in contributing to more nutritious food, especially for the poverty population.","Freire, Bruna Moreira; Pereira, Rodrigo Mendes; Lange, Camila Neves; Batista, Bruno Lemos",Sustainable Solutions for Elemental Deficiency and Excess in Crop Plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979238/,502

51017,The early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business sales,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been far reaching and have necessitated many changes to healthcare delivery. At the QEII Health Sciences Center physical space limitations for patient check-in and recovery have restricted outpatient endoscopy to 3 of 4 available endoscopy suites. On June 1, 2020 a new system of central endoscopy triage and coordination for the Division of Digestive Care and Endoscopy (DC&E) was implemented in an effort to increase efficiency and maintain patient access to endoscopy. The components of the RESET (Re-introduce Endoscopy Safely and EfficienTly) Plan included a) a new endoscopy coordinator role to manage a common endoscopy waitlist, endoscopist schedules, and booking clerks, b) a modified triage system to improve waitlist consistency, c) a common endoscopy waitlist with patients booked in the next available appointment regardless of endoscopist, d) discontinuation of fixed endoscopy slots for endoscopists, and e) appointment scheduling no sooner than 4-weeks in advance to minimize no-shows and last-minute cancellations. AIMS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the RESET Plan on the efficiency of DC&E endoscopy. METHODS: A retrospective pre- and post-implementation study evaluating the volume and efficiency of outpatient endoscopy before and after implementation of the RESET Plan. The Pre-RESET period included all procedures performed from June 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019. The Post-RESET period included all procedures performed from June 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. A separate endoscopy suite and triage system is used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and these cases were excluded. Early effectiveness outcomes were reported including a comparison of the number of endoscopic procedures per week and per list, pre- and post- implementation. Data analysis was primarily descriptive with data expressed as frequencies, means (SD), and proportions (%). Exploratory group comparisons were performed using independent-samples T-Test. RESULTS: During the 5-month Pre-RESET period, 2203 endoscopic procedures were performed. During the Post-RESET period a total of 1920 procedures were performed. Due to pandemic restrictions, there was a 29% decrease in available endoscopy lists from 2019 to 2020. There was a 24% increase in the number procedures performed per endoscopy list, from 6.4 to 8.0 (p=0.004, 95% CI 0.52–2.53), pre- and post-RESET. CONCLUSIONS: While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery, it has also provided an opportunity to implement health system structure and process changes. The RESET Plan resulted in significant gains in efficiency which largely offset losses in endoscopy throughput imposed by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Future research will determine what patient and health system factors most significantly impact system efficiency as well as the cost-effectiveness of the RESET Plan.

A high level of disclosure exists from 2004 to 2019 with 93 percent of the industry disclosing some information about employees. The highest categories of disclosure are remuneration, health and safety, and training and development. We find that total disclosure is significantly related to having employee share ownership, a Big 4 auditor, a larger board of directors, a majority independent board, independent chair, an audit and nomination committee and higher ROA.","Kent, Pamela; McCormack, Robyn; Zunker, Tamara",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013194/,502
51769,Consumer self-reported and testosterone responses to advertising of luxury goods in social context,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a new phenomenon and has affected the population’s lifestyle in many ways, such as panic buying (the so-called “hamster shopping”), adoption of home-office, and decline in retail shopping. For transportation planners and operators, it is interesting to analyze the spatial factors’ role in the demand patterns at a POI (Point of Interest) during the COVID-19 lockdown viz-a-viz before lockdown. DATA AND METHODS: This study illustrates a use-case of the POI visitation rate or popularity data and other publicly available data to analyze demand patterns and spatial factors during a highly dynamic and disruptive event like COVID-19. We develop regression models to analyze the correlation of the spatial and non-spatial attributes with the POI popularity before and during COVID-19 lockdown in Munich by using lockdown (treatment) as a dummy variable, with main and interaction effects. RESULTS: In our case-study for Munich, we find consistent behavior of features like stop distance and day-of-the-week in explaining the popularity. The parking area is found to be correlated only in the non-linear models. Interactions of lockdown with POI type, stop-distance, and day-of-the-week are found to be strongly significant. The results might not be transferable to other cities due to the presence of different city-specific factors. CONCLUSION: The findings from our case-study provide evidence of the impact of the restrictions on POIs and show the significant correlation of POI-type and stop distance with POI popularity. These results suggest local and temporal variability in the impact due to the restrictions, which can impact how cities adapt their transport services to the distinct demand and resulting mobility patterns during future disruptive events.","Mahajan, Vishal; Cantelmo, Guido; Antoniou, Constantinos",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8050495/,502

This special issue (SI) aims to enhance our understanding of how firms in Asia and beyond strategically respond to the BRI and what new theories and investigations are needed to better elucidate this new environment. In this editorial, we present a brief description of BRI, a review of related studies in the international business (IB) domain, a summary of the articles included in the SI and their contributions to the study of BRI, and an agenda for future research. We suggest that more attention should be given to examination of organizational heterogeneity under the BRI theme. In particular, there exists a variety of players like the governments of the host countries, non-government institutions, firms with different ownership structures, managers with different backgrounds, and their idiosyncratic characteristics should be incorporated in BRI studies. Moreover, future studies should find fine-grained ways to theorize and operationalize the policy effects of BRI. We call for further investigation of the consequences of BRI, including but not limiting to different aspects of IB activities, innovation, entrepreneurship, and corporate social responsibility.","Li, Jiatao; Qian, Gongming; Zhou, Kevin Zheng; Lu, Jane; Liu, Bin",Asia Pac J Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059992/,502

Despite the growth in digitised services for accessing cultural resources, to date no economic valuation has been performed on digital local history resources which are accessible online. Despite the recent emergence of online portals for digital cultural services in many countries (such as virtual tours of art galleries and digitisation of cultural archives)﻿ a shift which has accelerated in response to the Covid-19 epidemic, there remains a major literature gap around the value of digital culture. Failure to account for the value of digital archives risks sub-optimal allocation of resources to accessing and preserving these aspects of local cultural history. In response, we performed the first contingent valuation study to estimate willingness to pay for a free online film archive portal containing historical film footage for localities throughout the United Kingdom. Users were willing to pay an average hypothetical subscription for digital archive film services of £38.52/annum. Non-users in the general population were asked their willingness to pay a hypothetical annual donation to maintain free public access (£4.68/annum on average). The results suggest that positive social value is gained from online access to digital archive film, and from knowing that the cultural heritage continues to be digitally accessible by the public for current and future generations. We outline how this evidence aligns with a theoretical framework of use and non-use value for digital goods and services extending beyond those who currently use the portal, to those introduced to it, and those in the general public who have never directly experienced the online archive service. We also report what we believe is the first application of Subjective Wellbeing analysis to engagement with a digital cultural service. The advantage of applying methods from economics to value cultural activities in monetary terms is that it makes emerging modes of digital cultural goods and services commensurable with other costs and benefits as applied to cultural policy and investment decisions, putting it on a level footing with physical cultural assets.","Lawton, Ricky N.; Fujiwara, Daniel; Hotopp, Ulrike",J Cult Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223529/,502
55154,Toward an agency and reactance theory of crowding: Insights from COVID‐19 and the tourism industry,2021-05-04,"Social relevance has become a key element to assess the social legitimacy of an academic discipline. This contrasts with a widespread sentiment among political scientists about the existence of a relevance gap. The context of multiple crises Europe has experienced since the late 2000s has provided political scientists with a multitude of opportunities to demonstrate the social relevance of their work and the usefulness of the discipline. This introductory article to the special issue aims to offer an explorative framework and a preliminary discussion of empirical examples to assess the phenomenon of political scientists’ relevance in the public sphere during recent turbulent times. The framework (which emphasises three basic dimensions of social relevance – partisanship, visibility, and impact) is used to interpret the main results of the five case studies included in the special issue. Results show that contextual factors (salience of the issue, political and media contexts) influence political scientists’ engagement in the public sphere, the role they adopt and their visibility. The article ends emphasising the importance of collective action within the discipline as an instrument to enhance its social relevance.","Real-Dato, José; Verzichelli, Luca",Eur Polit Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8237535/,502

The country has been mired in violence for decades which has resulted in the destruction of the social infrastructure including the health sector. Recently, Afghanistan has deployed community health workers (CHW) who make up majority of the health workforce in the remote areas of this country. This paper aims to bring the plight of the CHWs to the forefront of discussion and shed light on the challenges they face as they attempt to bring basic healthcare to people living in a conflict zone. The paper discusses the motivations of Afghani women to become CHWs, their status in the community and within the health system, the threatening situations under which they operate, and the challenges they face as working women in a deeply patriarchal society within a conflict zone. The paper argues that female CHWs should be provided proper accreditation for their work, should be allowed and encouraged to progress in their careers, and should be instilled at the heart of healthcare program planning because they have the field experience to make the most effective and community oriented programmatic decisions.","Parray, Ateeb Ahmad; Dash, Sambit; Ullah, Md.

(Covid-19, Journal de bord, 17/08/2021)",2021-09-03,"On March 2, 2020, the first Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) case was reported in Jakarta, Indonesia. One and a half months later (15/05/2020), the cumulative number of infection cases was 16,496, with a total of 1076 mortalities. This study investigates the possible role of weather in the early cases of COVID-19 in six selected cities in Indonesia. Daily temperature and relative humidity data from weather stations nearby in each city were collected from March 3 to April 30, 2020, corresponding with COVID-19 incidence. Correlation tests and regression analysis were performed to examine the association of those two data series. Moreover, we analyzed the distribution of COVID-19 referring the weather data to estimate the effective range of weather data supporting the COVID-19 incidence. Our result reveals that weather data is generally associated with COVID-19 incidence. The daily average temperature (T-ave) and relative humidity (RH) present significant positive and negative correlation with COVID-19 data, respectively. However, the correlation coefficients are weak, with the strongest correlations found at the 5-day lag, i.e., 0.37 (− 0.41) for T-ave (RH). The regression analysis consistently confirmed this relation. The distribution analysis reveals that most COVID-19 cases in Indonesia occurred in the daily temperature range of 25–31 °C and relative humidity of 74–92%. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 incidence in Indonesia has a weak association with weather conditions. Therefore, non-meteorological factors seem to play a more prominent role and should be given greater consideration in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The implant-derived particulate debris such as ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) can initiate the local immune response and recruit monocytic cells to phagocytose particles for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS induces osteoclastogenesis and macrophages to secrete cytokines which ultimately promote the development of osteolysis. In this work, we develop the few-layered Nb(2)C (FNC) as an antioxidant which possesses the feature of decreasing the production of cytokines and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis by its ROS adsorption. Moreover, local injection of FNC attenuates the UHMWPE-induced osteolysis in a mouse calvarial model. In sum, our results suggest that FNC can be used for treating osteolytic bone disease caused by excessive osteoclastogenesis.","Sun, Kuo-Yang; Wu, Yizhang; Xu, Jia; Xiong, Wenfang; Xu, Wei; Li, Jiawei; Sun, Ziying; Lv, Zhongyang; Wu, X.S.; Jiang, Qing; Cai, Hong-Ling; Shi, Dongquan",Bioact Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429634/,502

58850,Influence of Working From Home During the COVID-19 Crisis and HR Practitioner Response,2021-09-23,"In actual product development, the cognitive differences between users and designers make it difficult for the designed products to be recognized by users. To reduce the cognitive differences between these two design subjects, this paper proposes a method of cognitive matching of the design subjects. First, we use the relevant methods of Kansei engineering to quantify the Kansei image cognition of the two design subjects and construct a cognitive matching model of the design subjects with information entropy and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Second, according to the Kansei image, the Kansei image prototype cluster is constructed, and the representative Kansei image prototype is obtained. Then, we combine an artificial neural network (ANN) with a cognitive matching model of the design subjects to construct a product Kansei image evaluation system; this is used to evaluate the evolved forms. Finally, a product Kansei image form evolution system is constructed based on the genetic algorithm (GA). To some extent, the system simulates the cognitive matching process between designers and users in product design, helps designers to more accurately understand the cognitive trends of the two design subjects, and provides a theoretical basis for the intelligent design of product forms through the cognitive balance of multiple design subjects. This paper takes a beverage bottle as an example to verify the feasibility of the model through a comparative study.","Zhang, Shutao; Wang, Shijie; Zhou, Aimin; Liu, Shifeng; Su, Jianning",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500774/,502

According to the review of literature, the spectrum of identified genes/proteins shows that the virus promotes IL1α/β–IL1R1 signaling (type 1 immunity) and immunity defense against helminths and venoms (type 2 immunity). In the alteration of homeostasis in the pulmonary epithelial tissue, the virus blocks the function of cilia and the molecular programs that are involved in wound healing (EMT and MET). Additionally, the protein–RNA recognition method described here identifies compatible sequences in the S1A-domain for the post-transcriptional promotion of PIKFYVE, which is one of the critical factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell, and for the post-transcriptional repression of xylulokinase XYLB. A decrease in XYLB product (Xu5P) in plasma was proposed as one of the potential metabolomics biomarkers of COVID-19.

This study aimed at developing a nomogram with high accuracy in predicting CR-POPF after PD. METHODS A total of 1182 patients undergoing PD in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAHSYSU, n = 762) and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC, n = 420) between January 2010 and May 2018 were enrolled. The patients from FAHSYSU were assigned as testing cohort, and those from FUSCC were used as external validation cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors for CR-POPF. Nomogram was developed on the basis of significant predictors. The performance of nomogram was evaluated by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS In testing cohort, 87 out of 762 patients developed CR-POPF. Three predictors were significantly associated with CR-POPF, including body mass index ≥24.0 kg/m2, pancreatic duct diameter <3 mm, and drainage fluid amylase on postoperative day 1 ≥2484 units/L (all p ≤ 0.001). Prediction of nomogram was accurate with AUC of 0.934 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.914-0.950) in testing cohort and 0.744 (95% CI: 0.699-0.785) in external validation cohort. The predictive accuracy of nomogram was better than that of previously proposed fistula risk scores both in testing and external validation cohort (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The novel nomogram based on three easily available parameters could accurately predict CR-POPF after PD.

In vivo, xylene-induced mouse ear edema, formaldehyde-induced paw edema and carrageenan-induced mice paw edema were significantly decreased by HC volatile oil. HC volatile oil showed pronounced inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) E2 and malondialdehyde production in the edematous exudates. In vitro exposure of mouse resident peritoneal macrophages to 1, 10, 100 and 1000 µg/mL of HC volatile oil significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of NO and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to HC volatile oil had no effect on cell viability and systemic toxicity. Furthermore, HC volatile oil inhibited the production of NO and TNF-α by down-regulating LPS-stimulated iNOS and TNF-α mRNA expression. Western blot analysis showed that HC volatile oil attenuated LPS-stimulated synthesis of iNOS and TNF-α protein in the macrophages, in parallel.

These analyses showed that 19-27% of hospitalized patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 developed acute myocardial injury, defined as an increase in troponin levels. Fifty-sixty percent of these patients died. The highest mortality rate was detected among patients with both progressively incremental troponin levels and a history of cardiovascular disease. Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration. In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels. In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.","Alderighi, Camilla; Rasoini, Raffaele; Ambrosio, Giuseppe; Valente, Serafina; Gensini, Gian Franco",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,https://doi.org/10.1714/3343.33128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310916/,502

To explore the underlying molecular mechanism of the lactation process in the mammary gland, transcriptome profiles of Iranian fat-tailed Ghezel sheep breed milk at two stages, before (BF) and after peak (AF) stages of lactation were investigated. Functional impacts of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BF and AF stages were surveyed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. Totally, 75 DEGs were identified between BF and AF stages of lactation. The RNA-Seq results were validated by Q-RT-PCR. Gene ontology of DEGs mainly enriched in metabolic process and oxidative phosphorylation. PPI network analysis also highlighted the contribution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling, oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways in the lactation process. Intriguingly, the genes involved in fat metabolism dominantly down-regulated at AF stage. Our results provide new insight into transcriptional changes and add to growing body of knowledge on the lactation process in fat-tailed sheep breeds.","Farhadian, Mohammad; Rafat, Seyed Aabbas; Panahi, Bahman; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil",Animal biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2020.1784185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633600/,502

The majority of residents have chronic illnesses and conditions and are vulnerable to infections and many share rooms and have congregate meals. There was evidence of inadequate registered nurse (RN) staffing levels and infection control procedures in many nursing homes prior to the outbreak of the virus. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of nurse staffing in California nursing homes and compare homes with and without COVID-19 residents. Study data were from both the California and Los Angeles Departments of Public Health and as well as news organizations on nursing homes reporting COVID-19 infections between March and May 4, 2020. Results indicate that nursing homes with total RN staffing levels under the recommended minimum standard (0.75 hours per resident day) had a two times greater probability of having COVID-19 resident infections. Nursing homes with lower Medicare five-star ratings on total nurse and RN staffing levels (adjusted for acuity), higher total health deficiencies, and more beds had a higher probability of having COVID-19 residents. Nursing homes with low RN and total staffing levels appear to leave residents vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. Establishing minimum staffing standards at the federal and state levels could prevent this in the future.","Harrington, Charlene; Ross, Leslie; Chapman, Susan; Halifax, Elizabeth; Spurlock, Bruce; Bakerjian, Debra","Policy, politics & nursing practice",https://doi.org/10.1177/1527154420938707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635838/,502
65799,"The Truth about a Lie: The Criminal Justice System, is it Just?",2021-03-15,"RATIONALE The evaluation of new therapeutic resources against COVID-19 represents a priority in clinical research considering the minimal options currently available. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the adjuvant use of systemic oxygen-ozone administration in the early control of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS PROBIOZOVID is an ongoing, interventional, randomized, prospective, double-arm trial enrolling patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. From a total of 85 patients screened, 28 were recruited. Patients were randomly divided into ozone-autohemotherapy group (14) and control group (14). The procedure consisted in a daily double-treatment with systemic Oxygen-Ozone administration for 7 days. All patients were treated with ad interim best available therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was delta in the number of patients requiring orotracheal-intubation despite treatment. Secondary outcome was the difference of mortality between the two groups. Moreover, haematological parameters were compared before and after treatment. No differences in the characteristics between groups were observed at baseline. As a preliminary report we have observed that one patient for each group needed intubation and was transferred to ITU. No deaths were observed at 7-14 days of follow up. Thirty-day mortality was 8,3% for ozone group and 10% for controls. Ozone therapy didn't significantly influence inflammation markers, haematology profile and lymphocyte subpopulations of patients treated. Ozone therapy had an impact on the need for the ventilatory support, although didn't reach statistical significance. Finally, no adverse events related to the use of ozone-autohemotherapy were reported. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary results, although not showing statistically significant benefits of ozone on COVID-19, did not report any toxicity. This article is protected by copyright.

67042,Loneliness of the Blind and the Visually Impaired.,2021,"BACKGROUND In many countries emergency departments (EDs) are facing an increase in demand for services, long waits, and severe crowding. One response to mitigate overcrowding has been to provide primary care services alongside or within hospital EDs for patients with non-urgent problems. However, it is unknown how this impacts the quality of patient care and the utilisation of hospital resources, or if it is cost-effective. This is the first update of the original Cochrane Review published in 2012. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of locating primary care professionals in hospital EDs to provide care for patients with non-urgent health problems, compared with care provided by regularly scheduled emergency physicians (EPs). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library; 2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and King's Fund, from inception until 10 May 2017. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP for registered clinical trials, and screened reference lists of included papers and relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies that evaluated the effectiveness of introducing primary care professionals to hospital EDs attending to patients with non-urgent conditions, as compared to the care provided by regularly scheduled EPs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS We identified four trials (one randomised trial and three non-randomised trials), one of which is newly identified in this update, involving a total of 11,463 patients, 16 general practitioners (GPs), 9 emergency nurse practitioners (NPs), and 69 EPs. These studies evaluated the effects of introducing GPs or emergency NPs to provide care to patients with non-urgent problems in the ED, as compared to EPs for outcomes such as resource use. The studies were conducted in Ireland, the UK, and Australia, and had an overall high or unclear risk of bias. The outcomes investigated were similar across studies, and there was considerable variation in the triage system used, the level of expertise and experience of the medical practitioners, and type of hospital (urban teaching, suburban community hospital). Main sources of funding were national or regional health authorities and a medical research funding body.There was high heterogeneity across studies, which precluded pooling data. It is uncertain whether the intervention reduces time from arrival to clinical assessment and treatment or total length of ED stay (1 study; 260 participants), admissions to hospital, diagnostic tests, treatments given, or consultations or referrals to hospital-based specialist (3 studies; 11,203 participants), as well as costs (2 studies; 9325 participants), as we assessed the evidence as being of very low-certainty for all outcomes.No data were reported on adverse events (such as ED returns and mortality). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We assessed the evidence from the four included studies as of very low-certainty overall, as the results are inconsistent and safety has not been examined. The evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions for practice or policy regarding the effectiveness and safety of care provided to non-urgent patients by GPs and NPs versus EPs in the ED to mitigate problems of overcrowding, wait times, and patient flow.","Gonçalves-Bradley, Daniela; Khangura, Jaspreet K; Flodgren, Gerd; Perera, Rafael; Rowe, Brian H; Shepperd, Sasha",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd002097.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29438575/,502

68766,Pandemic-Driven Posttraumatic Growth for Organizations and Individuals.,2020-10-08,"Background/Aims Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the key factor inducing mucosal and systemic inflammation in various intestinal and parenteral diseases, which could initially disrupt the epithelial barrier function. EphrinA1/ephA2 is speculated to increase the epithelial permeability for its ""repulsive interaction"" between adjacent cells. This study aim to investigate the role of ephrinA1/ephA2 in LPS-induced epithelial hyperpermeability. Methods In vivo model challenged with oral LPS in C57BL/6 mice and in vitro model exposed to LPS in Caco2 monolayer were established. The barrier function was assessed including expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-1), transepithelial electrical resistance, and permeability to macromolecules (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fluorescent dextran 4 kDa [FD4]). Moreover, the expression and phosphorylation of ephrinA1/ephA2 were quantified, and its roles in the process of epithelial barrier disruption were confirmed via stimulating ephA2 with ephrinA1-Fc chimera (ephrinA1-Fc) and inactivating ephA2 with ephA2-Fc chimera (ephA2-Fc), or ephA2 monoclonal antibody (ephA2-mab), as well as inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) with PD98059. Results LPS induced significant barrier dysfunction with dismissed occludin and claudin-1 expression, reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and increased FD4 permeability, accompanied by upregulated ephrinA1/ephA2 pathway and phosphorylation of ephA2 receptor. Furthermore, ephA2-Fc, and ephA2-mab ameliorated LPS-induced epithelial hyperpermeability, which was also inhibited by PD98059. Additionally, ephrinA1-Fc led to apparent epithelial leakage in Caco2 monolayer by promoting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which could be obviously blocked by ephA2-mab and PD98059. Conclusion EphrinA1/ephA2 promotes epithelial hyperpermeability with an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, which involves in LPS-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.","Chen, Yuhua; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Yongbo; Bai, Tao; Song, Jun; Qian, Wei; Hou, Xiaohua",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,https://doi.org/10.5056/jnm19095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32606260/,502

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of bilateral orchidopexy on serum inhibin-B and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). METHODS A cohort study including 208 bilateral cryptorchid boys (median age: 1.7 year) was evaluated with serum inhibin-B and FSH in relation to histological parameters. Based on the fertility potential, the boys were divided into three subgroups. At follow-up (median age: 2.7 years) the boys were evaluated with FSH and in case of inhibin-B using multiple of the median (MoM). RESULTS Inhibin-B MoM improved significantly at follow-up. In 32 boys with high FSH at orchidopexy 63% normalized FSH and 59% increased MoM inhibin-B, but 31% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. In 105 boys with transient hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 52% increased inhibin-B MoM but 31% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. In 71 boys with normal FSH, inhibin-B, and G/T, 54% increased inhibin-B MoM and 15% had impaired inhibin-B at follow-up. The effect of the surgery was best in patients younger than 1 year. CONCLUSION Orchidopexy, especially before 1 year of age, improves the fertility potential in bilateral cryptorchidism. At follow-up, 26% (54/208) had a risk of infertility based on inhibin-B.","Hildorf, Simone; Cortes, Dina; Clasen-Linde, Erik; Fossum, Magdalena; Thorup, Jorgen",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04820-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423103/,502

The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that more than 1 million workers are out of the workforce due to the opioid crisis. The impact on workers is equally profound, including job loss, divorce and family disruption, and potentially imprisonment, injury, illness, and death. Pain from occupational injuries and illnesses and stress are important pathways to opioid use disorder. Effective workplace programs that incorporate the public health approach to prevention offer a significant opportunity to prevent and respond to the opioid crisis. To date, the nation's efforts at combating the crisis have not included the necessary policy reforms to transform the workplace from a pathway to opioid misuse to a pathway to prevention, including education of workers, unions, employers, and health care providers and treatment and recovery of affected workers. Several key policy interventions are recommended to address this disconnect, including prevention of workplace injury, illness, and emotional distress; worker education and training; and replacement of stigmatizing, punitive workplace substance use programs with supportive programs.

Serum IgG4 levels are typically elevated but half of the patients had normal serum IgG4 levels. IgG4-RD represents a spectrum of diseases that involve various organs such as the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and salivary glands often manifesting as diffuse organ enlargement or a mass-like lesion mimicking cancer. An increased incidence of malignancy among patients with IgG4-RD has been reported. Thus, differentiating malignancy from IgG4-RD manifestation is important as the treatment differs. Glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy and should be started early to prevent fibrosis. Patients usually have an excellent clinical response to steroids, and poor steroid response is indicative of an alternative diagnoses such as malignancy.

This novel process combines physical compression with ultrasonic vibration to permanently weld particles together, thereby producing a robust compact. Fundamental relationships among operating parameters, energy imparted to the specimens, and physical properties of the agglomerated products were developed. Integrated agglomeration energy was determined to be a linear function of percent maximum horn amplitude and ultrasonication time, and integrated energy in turn influenced product physical properties, such as density and fracture strength, in highly significant linear relationships. Microscopic, computer tomographic, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses confirmed progressive compaction of and thermal stability changes in the flour matrix with increased processing energy. Specimens agglomerated at higher energy levels were furthermore demonstrated to have higher fracture strength than conventionally (pressure-only) compressed specimens despite similar densities, due to the robust interparticle bridging produced by agglomeration. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ultrasonic agglomeration represents a potential improvement over standard compression in the manufacturing of meal-supplementing energy bars. Ultrasonic agglomeration effectively adheres particles together without incorporation of low-nutrient- density syrups and binders. Agglomerated and compacted products also have superior mechanical stability, which can improve texture and physical stability during product handling.","Barrett, Ann; Ahnrud, Gianna; Ziegler, David; Liu, Xun; Kaletunc, Gonul",Journal of food science,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323291/,502

This concept was introduced in a now classic article by Kahan, Peters, Dawson, & Slovic [2017, Behavioral Public Policy 1, 54-86], who used numeracy to index reasoning capacity, and demonstrated that the tendency to engage in ideologically congruent interpretation of facts increased substantially with people's numeracy. Despite the importance of this finding, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, there is yet no consensus in the literature about the factual strength of motivated numeracy. We therefore conducted a large-scale replication of Kahan, Peters, Dawson, and Slovic (2017), using a pre-specified analysis plan with strict evaluation criteria. We did not find good evidence for motivated numeracy; there are distinct patterns in our data at odds with the core predictions of the theory, most notably (i) there is ideologically congruent responding that is not moderated by numeracy, and (ii) when there is moderation, ideologically congruent responding occurs only at the highest levels of numeracy. Our findings suggest that the cumulative evidence for motivated numeracy is weaker than previously thought, and that caution is warranted when this feature of human cognition is leveraged to improve science communication on contested topics such as climate change or immigration.","Persson, Emil; Andersson, David; Koppel, Lina; Västfjäll, Daniel; Tinghög, Gustav",Cognition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051421/,502

Methods This preliminary prospective randomized study was conducted between March 2017 and July 2017. A total of 26 patients undergoing single-port VATS were randomly assigned to two groups: the ETOIMS group (n=12), which received intramuscular stimulation prior to chest tube insertion toward the end of procedure, and the IV-PCA group (n=14), which received continuous infusion of fentanyl with a basal rate of 10 µg/mL/h. To measure postoperative pain, visual analogue scale (VAS; range, 0-10) was used as the primary endpoint. Results Baseline characteristics were not different between the two groups. According to the linear mixed model, there was statistical difference in the serial VAS score between the two groups (P=0.007). The ETOIMS group showed a significantly lower VAS score compared with the IV-PCA group, especially at postoperatively hour 8, day 1, and day 2.

Due to the lack of specific and effective antiviral drugs, transmission of the disease increases exponentially and makes it more serious and harder to control. Drugs that were assumed to be effective against COVID-19 have failed in various stages of clinical trials and this made the scientific community more disappointed. But, the race of researchers for developing new and effective antiviral to stop the disease progression still continues and our work is one among them. This study is an attempt to analyze the action of Tectoquinone and Acteoside; an important phytocompound, on SARS-CoV2 viral protease via in silico approach. The compounds were selected on the basis of their molecular docking values and they were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations about 50 ns to determine the stability and the thermodynamic feasibility between the target and the ligands. Binding energies like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the complexes were determined after MD simulations. The Pharmacokinetics and drug likeness evaluation of the compounds provide a strong evidence for the use of these compounds in developing drugs for clinical trials.

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of IMC eradication when using RFA±EMR and to identify clinical and pathologic predictors of treatment failure. A retrospective review of medical records and a central review of index histologic parameters were performed for 78 patients who underwent RFA±EMR as the primary treatment for biopsy-proven IMC at 4 academic tertiary medical centers. Complete eradication (CE) (absence of IMC/DYS on first follow-up endoscopy) was achieved in 86% of patients, and durable eradication (DE) (CE with no recurrence of IMC/DYS until last follow-up) was achieved in 78% of patients, with significant variation between the 4 study sites (P=0.03 and 0.09 by analysis of variance for DE and CE, respectively). Use of EMR before RFA significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure for IMC/DYS (hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.48; P=0.001), whereas IMC involving ≥50% of the columnar metaplastic area on index examination significantly increased the risk for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-11.7; P=0.005). Endoscopic and pathologic factors associated with treatment failure in BE-associated IMC treated with RFA±EMR may help identify the subset of IMC patients for whom a more aggressive initial approach may be justified.","Agoston, Agoston T; Strauss, Adam C; Dulai, Parambir S; Hagen, Catherine E; Muzikansky, Alona; Fudman, David I; Abrams, Julian A; Forcione, David G; Jajoo, Kunal; Saltzman, John R; Odze, Robert D; Lauwers, Gregory Y; Gordon, Stuart R; Lightdale, Charles J; Rothstein, Richard I; Srivastava, Amitabh",The American journal of surgical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1097/pas.0000000000000566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645729/,502

Like other natural disasters, droughts cause significant changes in the environment that can lead to negative health outcomes. As droughts are becoming more frequent and intense with climate change, public health systems need to address impacts associated with these events. Partnering with federal and local entities, we evaluated the state of knowledge of drought and health in the United States through a National Drought and Public Health Summit and a series of subsequent regional workshops. The intended outcome was to develop public health strategies for implementing activities to better support and prepare public health systems for future droughts. The information gathered from this work identified multiple policy and law options to address the public health issues associated with drought. These policy recommendations include the use of public health emergency declarations for drought events, increased usage of preparedness evaluations for drought emergencies, and engagement of drought and climate experts in state and local risk assessments. As drought events are projected to increase in frequency and magnitude with climate change, taking policy action now will help decrease the health impacts of drought and save lives.","Lookadoo, Rachel E; Bell, Jesse E","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",https://doi.org/10.1177/1073110520979372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404338/,502

We aimed to compare the donor safety and graft results of pure LLDRH to those of OLRDH. METHODS From May 2013 to July 2017, 288 consecutive donors underwent either OLRDH (n = 197) or pure LLDRH (n = 91). After propensity score matching, 72 donors were included in each group. The primary outcome was postoperative complications during a 90-day follow-up period. Comprehensive complication index, duration of hospital stay, need for additional pain control, readmission, and donor outcomes were also compared. RESULTS The incidence of major complication during the 90-day follow-up was higher in the OLDRH group than the LLDRH group (6.6% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.017) but was not statistically significant in propensity-matched analysis (11.1% vs. 13.9%, odds ratio [OR], 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-3.51; P = 0.62). A right hepatic duct less than 1 cm was independently associated with complication in the pure LLDRH group (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.08-14.99; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION In the initial 91 pure LLDRH cases, incidence of major complication was higher than in the OLDRH group, but the difference was not significant in propensity-matched analysis. A right hepatic duct verified as less than 1 cm may be related to increased frequency of complications in pure LLDRH donors.

SAGB has also been suggested as a conversion option from other procedures, but so far not extensively explored in that direction. METHODS The study retrospectively reviewed and analyzed 154 consecutive SAGB procedures, including 48 conversional SAGB (cSAGB) and 106 primary SAGB (pSAGB). Preoperative physical dimensions and perioperative complications were obtained. Patients were followed 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, with weight measurements compared between groups. RESULTS Operative times were longer in the cSAGB group but length of hospital stay was the same for both groups. Sixty-five percent of the cSAGB group had adjustable banding as a primary operation, and 94 % opted for conversion due to insufficient weight loss or regain thereof. Follow-up data availability was 98, 82, and 79 % for the three checkpoints. Three and 6 months postoperatively, cSAGB had inferior mean excess weight loss (EWL) compared to pSAGB, though both groups were successful after 6 months (mean EWL >50 %). Body mass index loss was significantly higher for pSAGB for the first postoperative 3 months. Low complication rates in both groups precluded statistical comparison in that respect. DISCUSSION Initial weight loss after conversional SAGB is inferior to primary SAGB after 6 months. The observed safety of cSAGB is comparable to previous evidence for this procedure in the conversional settings. CONCLUSION SAGB may be considered as a safe and effective conversional procedure, but not as effective as pSAGB for initial weight loss.","Meydan, Chanan; Raziel, Asnat; Sakran, Nasser; Gottfried, Varda; Goitein, David",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2336-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562250/,502

In moyamoya patients treated with a superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass, treatment of a new or an enlarging aneurysm can be complicated by the presence of the bypass and by limitations on the use of standard frontotemporal craniotomies to gain access to the aneurysm. Furthermore, endovascular access can be limited by the presence of fragile moyamoya vessels and precluded by atresia of large vessels. CASE DESCRIPTION A 45-year-old female patient with a history of moyamoya disease and previous left STA-MCA bypass presented with an enlarging left superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. We used a keyhole supraorbital craniotomy as a minimally invasive route to treat this aneurysm of the circle of Willis, with minimal interruption to the existing bypass or collateral circulation. CONCLUSIONS In patients with moyamoya disease who have existing STA-MCA bypass and de novo or expanding aneurysms, treatment is fraught with challenges. We advocate the use of a minimally invasive keyhole supraorbital craniotomy with an eyebrow incision for aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease occurring on the proximal anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries, the anterior communicating artery, the basilar apex, the posterior communicating artery, the proximal superior cerebellar artery, and the posterior cerebral artery.","Kalani, M Yashar S; Spetzler, Robert F; Wanebo, John E",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2016.07.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436206/,502

One way to increase uptake is to take advantage of environments outside of primary care which present easy opportunities for vaccination. This study provides a narrative review of hospital-based strategies in acute care settings aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates for adult inpatients. METHODS A search was conducted using Scopus, Embase and PubMed databases for articles reporting on hospital-based interventions aimed at improving influenza vaccination for adults. Studies published in English were included and descriptively analysed. RESULTS A total of 31 articles were included. Tested interventions included 7 standing order protocols (SOP); 4 reminders; 4 assessment/administration programs; 1 patient education program; 1 organisational-based program; 7 multi-component strategies and 8 studies comparing SOPs with other strategies. One article was included in both SOPs and reminders categories. Studies were published between 1983 and 2017 and conducted in the USA, Canada, or Australia. 18 studies reported statistical significance. Individually, each type of intervention showed success. SOPs were significantly more effective than other individual interventions, but multi-component interventions (which included an SOP) were more effective than SOPs alone. Three articles reported no significant increase in uptake attributed mainly to patient refusals, even with a strategy involving patient education. Only three studies tested provider-level strategies including hospital campaigns, hospital reward programs and interdepartmental competitions, and showed success. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-based interventions are an effective means of improving opportunistic inpatient vaccination. Suggestions for future research include organisational or system-based interventions; qualitative review of barriers and enablers to inpatient vaccination programs; and re-examination of outpatient settings for vaccine delivery. Most studies were not randomised or controlled; therefore, we also recommend additional RCT studies to confirm existing findings on individual strategies.","McFadden, Kathleen; Seale, Holly",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357955/,502

Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning. The residents found simulation relevant to the residencies' core curriculum.

A systematic search of six academic databases was conducted through October 2020. Studies were included if they reported full economic evaluations of interventions aimed at preventing overweight or obesity, or interventions aimed at improving obesity-related behaviors, with at least one intervention component delivered by telephone (telehealth) or web-based technology (eHealth). Findings were reported narratively, based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. Twenty-seven economic evaluations were included from 20 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixteen of the included interventions had a telehealth component, whereas 11 had an eHealth component. Seventeen interventions were evaluated using cost-utility analysis, five with cost-effectiveness analysis, and five undertook both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Only eight cost-utility analyses reported that the intervention was cost-effective. Comparison of results from cost-effectiveness analyses was limited by heterogeneity in methods and outcome units reported.

It is shown that the NFP-E can achieve fine control over the relative expression of two cotransfected plasmids. Finally, the dynamics of electropore closure after the pulsing ends with the NFP-E is investigated. Localized electroporation has recently been utilized to demonstrate the converse process of delivery (sampling), in which a small volume of the cytosol is retrieved during electroporation without causing cell lysis. Single-cell temporal sampling confers the benefit of monitoring the same cell over time and can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying processes such as stem cell differentiation and disease progression.

No data are available if therapy can be safely de-escalated to endocrine monotherapy in patients with long-lasting disease control. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis on the clinical course of 22 patients at our center who received CDK4/6 inhibitors with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant. All patients had at least stable disease for >6 months and made a joint decision with their provider to electively discontinue CDK4/6 inhibitors. Best objective response (BOR) at treatment discontinuation, progression-free survival, and re-treatment characteristics were recorded. RESULTS Of 138 patients who received CDK4/6 inhibitors as first- or second-line therapy at our center, 22 met the inclusion criteria. Median duration of CDK4/6 treatment was 18 months (range 6-45). BOR was complete response in 1, partial response in 8, and stable disease in 13 patients. After a median duration of endocrine monotherapy of 9.5 months (range 5-44 months), 6 of 22 patients had progressive disease (1 local relapse and 5 systemic progression). All patients with disease progression had at least stable disease to chemotherapy (N = 1) or re-treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors (N = 4). CONCLUSION Elective discontinuation of CDK4/6 inhibitors is feasible in patients with long-lasting disease stabilization.

However, the potential risk of transmitting diseases disqualifies the use of serum for clinical cell therapy in most countries. Hence, most clinical cell therapy programs have replaced human serum with human serum albumin, which can result in inferior quality of released cell products. Photochemical treatment of different blood products utilizing Intercept® technology has been shown to inactivate a broad variety of pathogens of RNA and DNA origin. The present study assesses the feasibility of using pathogen-inactivated, blood group-compatible serum for use in human pancreatic islet culture. Isolated human islets were cultured at 37°C for 3-4 days in CMRL 1066 supplemented with 10% of either pathogen-inactivated or nontreated human serum. Islet quality assessment included glucose-stimulated insulin release (perifusion), ADP/ATP ratio, cytokine expression, and posttransplant function in diabetic nude mice. No differences were found between islets cultured in pathogen-inactivated or control serum regarding stimulated insulin release, intracellular insulin content, and ADP/ATP ratio. Whether media was supplemented with treated or nontreated serum, islet expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, or tissue factor was not affected. The final diabetes-reversal rate of mice receiving islets cultured in pathogen-inactivated or nontreated serum was 78% and 87%, respectively (NS). As reported here, pathogen-inactivated human serum does not affect viability or functional integrity of cultured human islets. The implementation of this technology for RNA- and DNA-based pathogen inactivation should enable reintroduction of human serum for clinical cell therapy.","Ståhle, Magnus U; Brandhorst, Daniel; Korsgren, Olle; Knutson, Folke",Cell transplantation,https://doi.org/10.3727/096368910x539056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21054939/,502

The use of spinal anaesthesia with an obturator nerve block was associated with a significantly reduced risk of obturator reflex (P<0.00001), bladder perforation (P=0.02), incomplete resection (P<0.0001) and 12-month tumour recurrence (P=0.005). Obturator nerve block was not associated with an increased risk of local anaesthetic toxicity (0/159). Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggests that TURBT employing spinal anaesthesia with an obturator nerve block is superior to the use of spinal anaesthesia alone. During the COVID-19 pandemic, where avoidance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as a general anaesthesia is paramount, the use of an obturator nerve block with spinal anaesthesia is essential for the safety of both patients and staff without compromising care. Further high-quality RCTs with adequate sample sizes are required to compare the different techniques of obturator nerve block as well as comparing this method to general anaesthesia with complete neuromuscular blockade.","Krishan, Anil; Bruce, Angus; Khashaba, Shehab; Abouelela, Mohamed; Ehsanullah, Syed Ali",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33218270/,502

Nevertheless, their implementation in clinical practice remains challenging. AIMS To evaluate the prevalence of the use of these UC management algorithms in 127 patients followed by private gastroenterologists. METHODS Charts of all UC patients seen during the year 2015 (n=127) by 10 gastroenterologists were reviewed. The gastroenterologist's management was then compared to the corresponding algorithm situation and, in case of disagreement, analysed by an expert committee. RESULTS 94.5% of patients corresponded to a clinical situation described in algorithms. Gastroenterologist's management was adequate to the corresponding algorithm situation in 74.2% of cases. Among the 31 cases of disagreement, the gastroenterologist's decision differed from the algorithm position in 21 cases, and in 76.2% of cases the expert committee would have made the same decision. In the remaining 10 cases, the decision differed from the corresponding algorithm for reasons independent from the gastroenterologist (patient's choice etc.). CONCLUSIONS French national algorithms for UC management allowed coverage of 95% of clinical cases in real world. In three quarters of cases, these algorithms were strictly followed by private gastroenterologists. Dissemination of these algorithms could optimize and strengthen the practitioner's choice.","Bonnaud, Guillaume; Haennig, Audrey; Levy, Jonathan; Sigur, Nicolas; Ledit, Alain; Cabarrot, Philippe; Faure, Patrick; Auzimour, Catherine; El Atmani, Asmaa; Hebuterne, Xavier; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2016.08.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697417/,502

METHODS The laparoscopic procedures were prospectively and randomly performed in 38 patients. Of the 38 patients, 18 underwent the first version (II-SG) and 20 underwent the second version in which a diversion of the second portion of the duodenum was applied (II-DSG) and a segment of ileum was interposed into the proximal duodenum. The groups were comparable regarding age (56 and 50 years); gender (13 men and 5 women and 14 men and 6 women); weight (78 and 86 kg); mean BMI (27 and 29 kg/m(2)); duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (10.1 and 9.2 years); the presence of dyslipidemia (12 and 8 patients), micro- and macroalbuminuria (9 and 9 patients), hypertension (8 and 15 patients), and retinopathy (5 and 8 patients); and the use of antidiabetic medications and the hemoglobin A1c level (8.6% and 8.4%). All patients were followed up for >or=2 years. RESULTS The mean hospital stay was 3.4 days for the II-SG and 3.5 days for the II-DSG group. No patient required reoperation. All patients in both groups achieved lower levels of hemoglobin A1c. In the II-SG group, the mean hemoglobin A1c level was 6.35% (range 4.9-8.1). In the II-DSG group, the mean hemoglobin A1c level was 5.39% (range 4.2-6.5%). The mean BMI decreased in both groups to 22.2 kg/m(2) in the II-SG group and 22.7 kg/m(2) in the II-DSG group. Normal cholesterol levels (<200 mg/dL) were observed in 95% of the II-SG group and 100% of the II-DSG group. The triglycerides were lower than 150 mg/dL in 73% of the II-SG group and 90% of the II-DSG group after 24 months. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic II-SG and II-DSG were safe and effective operations for controlling type 2 diabetes mellitus in a nonobese (BMI 21-34 kg/m(2)) population.","De Paula, Aureo L; Stival, Alessandro R; Macedo, Antonio; Ribamar, José; Mancini, Marcio; Halpern, Alfredo; Vencio, Sérgio",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2009.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20096647/,502

Alex Sohal.,2020-05-12,"PURPOSE To compare volume, sphericity, and short-axis diameter of the coagulation zone of four commercially available microwave ablation systems with three technical concepts in an ex vivo setting and to formulate mathematical models to predict these quantities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two high-power systems (systems A and B), a system that enables simultaneous use of three antennas (system C), and a non-perfusion-cooled system that automatically adapts power and frequency (system D) were tested in ex vivo bovine livers (108 ablations). Coagulation volume, sphericity, and mean short-axis diameter were assessed, and mathematical functions were fitted for each system and assessed with the coefficient of determination (R(2)). Analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests were used for interdevice comparison after 5 and 10 minutes and after maximum recommended ablation time. RESULTS Volume and short-axis diameter were determined by using a mathematical model for every system, with coefficients of determination of 0.75-0.98 and 0.70-0.97, respectively. Correlation for determination of sphericity was lower (R(2) = 0.01-0.68). Mean results with ablation performed according to manufacturer recommendations were as follows: Volume, sphericity, and short-axis diameter were 57.5 cm(3), 0.75, and 43.4 mm, respectively, for system A; 72.3 cm(3), 0.68, and 45.5 mm, respectively, for system B; 17.1 cm(3), 0.58, and 26.8 mm, respectively, for system C (one antenna); 76.5 cm(3), 0.89, and 50.6 mm, respectively, for system C (three antennas); and 56.0 cm(3), 0.64, and 40.9 mm, respectively, for system D. Systems A (mean volume, 52.4 cm(3) ± 4.5 [standard deviation]) and B (39.4 cm(3) ± 1.7) reach large ablation zones with 5-minute ablation. CONCLUSION The largest ablation zone is obtained with systems B and C (three antennas) under maximum recommended ablation duration and with system A under short ablation time. The most spherical zone is obtained with system C (three antennas).","Hoffmann, Rüdiger; Rempp, Hansjörg; Erhard, Ludwig; Blumenstock, Gunnar; Pereira, Philippe L; Claussen, Claus D; Clasen, Stephan",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.13121127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440327/,502

In the present study, the ability of Gloeophyllum striatum to synthesize silver nanoparticles is described for the first time. Nanoparticles were formed in an eco-friendly extracellular manner and characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, MADLS and SEM techniques. The obtained nanoparticles showed excellent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MIC values for gram-negative bacteria were 15 µM, while for gram-positive strains they reached 30 µM. The haemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the synthesized nanoparticles towards mammalian cells were also determined. The addition of AgNPs at the concentrations above 30 µM caused 50% haemolysis of red blood cells after they 24-hour incubation. A decrease in the viability of fibroblasts by over 50% was also found in the samples treated with nanoparticles at the concentrations above 30 µM. The ecotoxicological risk of silver nanoparticles was assessed using A. franciscana and D. magna crustaceans as well as L. sativum plants. The EC50 values for A. franciscana and D. magna were 61.97 and 0.275 µM, respectively. An about 20% reduction in the length of L. sativum shoots and roots was noted after the treatment with AgNPs at the concentration of 100 µM.","Zawadzka, Katarzyna; Felczak, Aleksandra; Nowak, Marta; Kowalczyk, Aleksandra; Piwoński, Ireneusz; Lisowska, Katarzyna",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118550/,502

Evidence from Four Years of Longitudinal Survey Scores.,2020-07-07,"To analyse clinical studies investigating coating agents such as sealants and other bonding materials to prevent the initiation or inhibit the progress of white spot lesions (WSL) during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. Electronic databases (Pubmed, CENTRAL, EMBASE) were screened for studies. No language restrictions were applied. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done in duplicate. Primary outcome included assessment of WSL with visual-tactile assessment and/or laser fluorescence measurements. Twenty-four studies with 1117 patients (age: 11-40 years) and 12,809 teeth were included. Overall, 34 different sealants or bonding materials were analysed. Fourteen studies analysed fluoride and 14 studies non-fluoride releasing materials. Meta-analysis for visual tactile assessment revealed that sealants significantly decreased the initiation of WSL compared to untreated control (RR [95%CI] = 0.70 [0.53; 0.93]; very low level of evidence). Materials releasing fluoride did not decrease initiation of WSL compared to those with no fluoride release (RR [95%CI] = 0.84 [0.70; 1.01]; very low level of evidence). For laser fluorescence measurements no meta-analysis could be performed. The use of sealants seems to be effective in preventing the initiation of post-orthodontic WSL. Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting that fluoride-releasing sealants or bonding materials are more effective than those without fluoride release. No gold standard prevention strategy to prevent WSL during treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances has been established yet. However, based on only a limited number of studies the use of sealants seems to be effective in preventing the initiation of post-orthodontic WSL.","Kamber, R; Meyer-Lueckel, H; Kloukos, D; Tennert, C; Wierichs, R J",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95888-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400668/,502

There is no ""one size fits all"" solution that addresses nutrition. In relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, viral infections in general and RNA viruses in particular, are known to induce and promote oxidative stress, consequently increasing and draining the body's demand for micronutrients, especially those related to antioxidant enzymatic systems, thus hindering the human body's ability to cope optimally with oxidative stress. Common polymorphisms in major antioxidant enzymes, with world population minor allele frequencies ranging from 0.5% to 50%, are related to altered enzymatic function, with substantial potential effects on the body's ability to cope with viral infection-induced oxidative stress. In this review we highlight common SNPs of the major antioxidant enzymes relevant to nutritional components in the context of viral infections, namely: superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases and catalase. We delineate functional polymorphisms in several human antioxidant enzymes that require, especially during viral crisis, adequate and potentially additional nutritional support to cope with the disease pathological consequences. Thus, in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, nutrition should be tightly monitored and possibly supplemented, with special attention to those carrying common polymorphisms in antioxidant enzymes.","Birk, Ruth",Nutrition research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954422420000244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33081856/,502

We aimed to develop a model to predict the likelihood of asynchronies occurring. We analyzed 10,409,357 breaths from 51 critically ill patients who underwent mechanical ventilation >24 h. Patients were continuously monitored and common asynchronies were identified and regularly indexed. Based on discrete time-series data representing the total count of asynchronies, we defined four states or levels of risk of asynchronies, z1 (very-low-risk) - z4 (very-high-risk). A Poisson hidden Markov model was used to predict the probability of each level of risk occurring in the next period. Long periods with very few asynchronous events, and consequently very-low-risk, were more likely than periods with many events (state z4). States were persistent; large shifts of states were uncommon and most switches were to neighbouring states. Thus, patients entering states with a high number of asynchronies were very likely to continue in that state, which may have serious implications. This novel approach to dealing with patient-ventilator asynchrony is a first step in developing smart alarms to alert professionals to patients entering high-risk states so they can consider actions to improve patient-ventilator interaction.","Marchuk, Yaroslav; Magrans, Rudys; Sales, Bernat; Montanya, Jaume; López-Aguilar, Josefina; de Haro, Candelaria; Gomà, Gemma; Subirà, Carles; Fernández, Rafael; Kacmarek, Robert M; Blanch, Lluis",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36011-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514876/,502

This study aimed to identify data sources in the region, potentially suitable for vaccine safety surveillance. METHODS Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. RESULTS Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied impacting on timeliness of data access. CONCLUSIONS Variation in vaccine data availability, complexities in data access including, governance and data release approval procedures, together with requirement for data linkage for outcome information, all contribute to the challenges in building a distributed network for vaccine safety assessment in the Asia-Pacific and globally.

114387,Notice of duplication publication: Emotional Burden Associated with COVID-19: Trust and Communication in Cancer Care.,2021-03-12,"Sertoli cells play a key role in spermatogenesis by supporting the germ cells throughout differentiation. The isolation of Sertoli cells is essential to study their functions. However, the close contact of Sertoli cells with other testicular cell types and the high proliferation of contaminating cells are obstacles to obtain pure primary cultures. Current rodent Sertoli cell isolation protocols result in enriched, rather than pure Sertoli cells. Therefore, novel approaches are necessary to improve the purity of Sertoli cell primary cultures. The goal of this study is to obtain pure mouse Sertoli cells using lineage tracing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We bred the Amh-Cre mouse line with tdTomato line to generate mice constitutively expressing red fluorescence specifically in Sertoli cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells isolated from prepubertal mice showed that 79% of cells expressed tdTomato, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; however, nearly all adherent cells were positive for vimentin. Most of the tomato-negative cells expressed α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a peritubular myoid cell marker, but double-negative populations were also present. These findings suggest that vimentin lacks Sertoli cell-specificity and that α-SMA is not adequate to identify all of the contaminating cells. Upon FACS sorting; however, virtually 100% of the cells were tdTomato positive, expressed vimentin, but not α-SMA. Prepubertal mice yielded a higher number of Sertoli cells compared to adults, but both could be adequately sorted. In conclusion, our study shows that lineage tracing and sorting is an efficient strategy for acquiring pure populations of murine Sertoli cells.","Zomer, Helena D; Reddi, Prabhakara P",Molecular reproduction and development,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrd.23406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735067/,502

119150,The impact of COVID-19 on autism research: Reflections from China.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND To date, elective nephron-sparing surgery is an established method for the exstirpation of renal tumors. While open partial nephrectomy remains the reference standard of the management of renal masses, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) continues to evolve. Conventional techniques include clamping the renal vessels risking ischaemic damage of the clamped organ. Thus, new techniques are needed that combine a sufficient tissue incision for exstirpation of the tumor with an efficient coagulation to assure haemostasis and abandon renal vessel clamping in LPN. Laser-excision of renal tumors during laparoscopic surgery seems to be a logical solution. METHODS We performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 11 patients with a renal tumor in exophytic position (mean size 32 mm, ranging 8-45 mm) by laser-supported LPN. RESULTS Regular ultrasound monitoring and insertion of a temporary drainage showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. All tumors were removed with a histopathologically confirmed surrounding margin of normal renal tissue (R0 resection). Serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The experience won in these patients have confirmed that laser-assisted LPN without clamping of the renal vessels could be a safe and gentle alternative to classic partial nephrectomy in patients with exophytic position of renal tumors.","Loertzer, Hagen; Strauß, Arne; Ringert, Rolf Herrmann; Schneider, Philine",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2490-13-31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786969/,502

Determinants of adherence-identified from quantitative and qualitative studies-were mapped into the theoretical domains framework and interventions proposed using the behavioural change wheel. RESULTS Twenty-seven studies (22 quantitative and 5 qualitative) were included. The pooled prevalence of medication non-adherence was 39% (95% CI 30-48%). Nine studies reported association between non-adherence and outcomes, including blood pressure, disease progression, adverse events, and mortality. Modifiable determinants of non-adherence were mapped into 11 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework-of which, six appeared most relevant. Non-adherence decisions were usually due to lack of knowledge on CKD, comorbidities, and medications; polypharmacy and occurrence of medication side effects; changes in established routines such as frequent medication changes; higher medication cost, poor accessibility to medications, services and facilities; inadequate patient-healthcare professional communication; and forgetfulness. Using the behavioural change wheel, we identified several areas where interventions can be directed to improve medication adherence. CONCLUSION Medication non-adherence is common in adults with CKD, not on KRT and may lead to poor outcomes. Evidence synthesis using mixed study designs was crucial in identifying determinants of non-adherence, drawing on a parsimonious approach from behaviour science.

Stress in work (workplace stress) has a significant role in the pathomechanism of burnout. Nurses are exposed to excessive stress burden in work so expected incidence of burnout is relatively high among them. Goal of this study is to draw a picture about the situation, condition of mental health, degree and rate of burnout in nurses in given health care situations. METHODS Self-completed, anonymous questionnaire questioning the surveyed socio-demographic data while using three standardized questionnaires with the measurement of the degree of burnout, physical and mental exhaustion and fatigue as well as dysfunctional attitudes. RESULTS The study surveyed 805 individuals analyzing the specific characteristics of supporting relationship and joining points between degree of burnout and (hospital) department care form. Among 374 nurses working in the intensive care unit 9.4% suffer from burnout, while among 155 nurses working in active care unit this rate is 0.6%. According to the findings of the study there are also other influential elements, namely the facts that nurses have part-time jobs (second jobs) besides their full-time jobs and the lack of moral and financial respect or recognition. Among the surveyed population 273 individuals--33.9%--are at risk regarding burnout, 44 individuals--5.5%--show signs of burnout and 7 individuals--0.9%--are in a condition where treatment is needed. The study supposed the influential role of certain personality factors (dysfunctional attitudes) in the development of burnout. Comparison showed that burnout phenomenon and dysfunctional attitudes are correlated. CONCLUSION The survey results confirmed that socio-demographic factors had no effect on burnout development. The severity of patients' condition and the degree of permanent stressful situation in intensive care units are among determinant workplace factors.","Pálfiné, Szabó Ilona",Orvosi hetilap,https://doi.org/10.1556/oh.2008.28370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18632507/,502
124122,Compassionate Computing in the Time of COVID-19: Interview with Laurie N. Taylor.,2020,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of the international organ donation and transplantation (ODT) system. Multiple organizations have developed guidance, but to date, no comparative summary has emerged to understand differences in existing recommendations. METHODS We developed and applied a comparative methodology to a convenience sample of recommendations available on The Transplantation Society website. Document types were classified according to characteristics such as type of organization (e.g. governing body or professional society) and geographic region. Recommendations were grouped according to content and summaries were posted on a public website. This process is ongoing and will be updated as new recommendations become available. RESULTS 18 documents were extracted in the initial review. All documents were based on expert opinion, and none described a formal literature review or adherence with clinical guideline development processes. Recommendation categories included screening of potential donors, risk assessment of potential recipients, post-transplant risk, living/paired donation, protection of ODT professionals, and ethics/logistics. While many documents included similar recommendations, such as the need to screen and test patients who are potential donors, there was variation on some topics. Type of recommended laboratory testing varied with 64% recommending nasopharyngeal swabs, 43% oropharyngeal, and 24% bronchial aspirates. Updated results are available at https://cdtrp.ca/en/covid-19-international-recommendations-for-odt/ CONCLUSION:: The current state of COVID-19 ODT recommendations are limited to expert opinion. Substantial variation exists regarding recommendations, which are based on emerging, but currently low-quality evidence.

Analysis of Government Strategies and Policies, 1992-2020.",2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND In the short-term, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of the type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity. There are few data with greater follow-up. Our aim was to evaluate the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the control of type 2 diabetes in patients with severe obesity at 5 years at the University Hospital, France. METHODS From a total of 355 patients with severe obesity operated between January 2006 and June 2010, 52 (15%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes before undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS There were 31 females (60%) and 21 males (40%), with a mean age of 51 ± 10 years (range 27-67) with a mean body mass index of 48 ± 10 kg/m2 (range 35-82). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 10.8 ± 10.8 years before bariatric operation. The preoperative glycated hemoglobin was 8 ± 2% (range 5.9-12.8) in 45 patients; 17 patients (38%) had levels of glycated hemoglobin ≥9%. Three patients (6%) required insulin alone, 4 (8%) were taking oral antidiabetic medicine and insulin, and the remaining 45 patients (87%) were taking only oral antidiabetic medicines. The complete data regarding weight loss at 5-year follow-up were obtained for 46 patients, yielding an overall follow-up rate of 89%. The prolonged remission of type 2 diabetes achieved at 1 year that persisted at 5 years of follow-up was present in 9 patients (17%). No patient with complete remission of their type 2 diabetes required insulin preoperatively. Improvement of type 2 diabetes was observed in 30 patients (58%) at 1 year, which was maintained for 27 patients (52%) at 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has demonstrated a moderate efficacy in the treatment morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Markedly increased preoperative glycated hemoglobin levels, older age, and preoperative need for insulin treatment may be the factors predicting failure of complete remission of type 2 diabetes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.","Nedelcu, Marius; Loureiro, Marcelo; Skalli, Mehdi; Galtier, Florence; Jaussent, Audrey; Deloze, Melanie; Gagner, Michel; Fabre, Jean Michel; Nocca, David",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2017.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28739091/,502

The outcome of lower respiratory infection is determined by the degrees to which immunity is protective and inflammation is damaging. Intercellular and interorgan signaling networks coordinate these actions to fight infection and protect the tissue. Cells residing in the lung initiate and steer these responses, with additional immunity effectors recruited from the bloodstream. Responses of extrapulmonary tissues, including the liver, bone marrow, and others, are essential to resistance and resilience. Responses in the lung and extrapulmonary organs can also be counterproductive and drive acute and chronic comorbidities after respiratory infection. This review discusses cell-specific and organ-specific roles in the integrated physiological response to acute lung infection, and the mechanisms by which intercellular and interorgan signaling contribute to host defense and healthy respiratory physiology or to acute lung injury, chronic pulmonary disease, and adverse extrapulmonary sequelae. Pneumonia should no longer be perceived as simply an acute infection of the lung. Pneumonia susceptibility reflects ongoing and poorly understood chronic conditions, and pneumonia results in diverse and often persistent deleterious consequences for multiple physiological systems.","Quinton, Lee J; Walkey, Allan J; Mizgerd, Joseph P",Physiological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00032.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767563/,502

Competitive binding inhibition of lectins with various oligosaccharide specificities indicated that glycans linked to gp64 are mannose-rich, whilst glycans linked to gp116 possess terminal N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine in addition to terminal mannose-type sugars. Mass spectrometry analyses of peptides generated from YHV proteins before and after deglycosylation with PNGase-F, using combinations of the endoproteinases trypsin, Asp-N and Lys-C, confirmed occupancy of six of the seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp116 and three of the four potential sites in gp64.","Soowannayan, Chumporn; Cowley, Jeff A; Pearson, Roger D; Wallis, Tristan P; Gorman, Jeffrey J; Michalski, Wojtek P; Walker, Peter J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.022111-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554800/,502

Studies of different measures of nutritional intake or folate status have been done to investigate the possible role of folate in the prevention of OFC. Only one knowledge synthesis has attempted to bring together different types of evidence. The aim of the present work was to update it. METHODS Evidence for associations between OFC and dietary folate, supplement use, folic acid fortification, biomarkers of folate status, and variants of MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) were included. Potentially eligible articles were systematically identified from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (2007-2020) and combined using random-effects meta-analysis when appropriate. Quality assessments were conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane's risk of bias tool. RESULTS Sixty-four studies published since the previous knowledge synthesis were identified, with eight of these identified through a supplementary search from October, 2018 to August, 2020. There was an inverse association between folic acid-containing supplement use before or during pregnancy and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), with considerable between-study heterogeneity. The prevalence of CL/P showed a small decline post-folic acid fortification in seven studies (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02). No association was found between OFC and genetic markers of folate status. The coronavirus-19 pandemic has threatened food availability globally and therefore there is a need to maintain and even enhance surveillance concerning maternal intake of folate and related vitamins. CONCLUSIONS The risk of non-syndromic OFC was reduced among pregnant women with folic acid-containing supplements during the etiologically relevant period. However, high heterogeneity between included studies, incomplete reporting of population characteristics and variation in timing of exposure and supplement types mean that conclusions should be drawn with caution.","Zhou, Yulai; Sinnathamby, Vigigah; Yu, Yamei; Sikora, Lindsey; Johnson, Candice Y; Mossey, Peter; Little, Julian",Birth defects research,https://doi.org/10.1002/bdr2.1827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33118705/,502

We aimed to summarise the current systematic review evidence and evaluate the consistency of CBT's effect across different conditions. We included reviews of CBT randomised controlled trials in any: population, condition, format, context, with any type of comparator and published in English. We searched DARE, Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CDAS, and OpenGrey between 1992 and January 2019. Reviews were quality assessed, their data extracted and summarised. The effects upon health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled, within-condition groups. If the across-condition heterogeneity was I2 < 75%, we pooled effects using a random-effect panoramic meta-analysis. We summarised 494 reviews (221 128 participants), representing 14/20 physical and 13/20 mental conditions (World Health Organisation's International Classification of Diseases). Most reviews were lower-quality (351/494), investigated face-to-face CBT (397/494), and in adults (378/494). Few reviews included trials conducted in Asia, South America or Africa (45/494). CBT produced a modest benefit across-conditions on HRQoL (standardised mean difference 0.23; 95% confidence intervals 0.14-0.33, I2 = 32%). The effect's associated prediction interval -0.05 to 0.50 suggested CBT will remain effective in conditions for which we do not currently have available evidence. While there remain some gaps in the completeness of the evidence base, we need to recognise the consistent evidence for the general benefit which CBT offers.","Fordham, Beth; Sugavanam, Thavapriya; Edwards, Katherine; Stallard, Paul; Howard, Robert; das Nair, Roshan; Copsey, Bethan; Lee, Hopin; Howick, Jeremy; Hemming, Karla; Lamb, Sarah E",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720005292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33455594/,502

145798,Dyadic-Explanations During Preparatory Self-Study Enhance Learning: A Randomised Controlled Study.,2021-03-08,"INTRODUCTION The material properties of meshes used in hernia repair contribute to the overall mechanical behavior of the repair. The anisotropic potential of synthetic meshes, representing a difference in material properties (e.g., elasticity) in different material axes, is not well defined to date. Haphazard orientation of anisotropic mesh material can contribute to inconsistent surgical outcomes. We aimed to characterize and compare anisotropic properties of commonly used synthetic meshes. METHODS Six different polypropylene (Trelex(®), ProLite™, Ultrapro™), polyester (Parietex™), and PTFE-based (Dualmesh(®), Infinit) synthetic meshes were selected. Longitudinal and transverse axes were defined for each mesh, and samples were cut in each axis orientation. Samples underwent uniaxial tensile testing, from which the elastic modulus (E) in each axis was determined. The degree of anisotropy (λ) was calculated as a logarithmic expression of the ratio between the elastic modulus in each axis. RESULTS Five of six meshes displayed significant anisotropic behavior. Ultrapro™ and Infinit exhibited approximately 12- and 20-fold differences between perpendicular axes, respectively. Trelex(®), ProLite™, and Parietex™ were 2.3-2.4 times. Dualmesh(®) was the least anisotropic mesh, without marked difference between the axes. CONCLUSION Anisotropy of synthetic meshes has been underappreciated. In this study, we found striking differences between elastic properties of perpendicular axes for most commonly used synthetic meshes. Indiscriminate orientation of anisotropic mesh may adversely affect hernia repairs. Proper labeling of all implants by manufacturers should be mandatory. Understanding the specific anisotropic behavior of synthetic meshes should allow surgeons to employ rational implant orientation to maximize outcomes of hernia repair.","Saberski, E R; Orenstein, S B; Novitsky, Y W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0731-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20882394/,502

OBJECTIVE To determine the association between 100% fruit juice consumption and change in BMI or BMI z score in children. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases. STUDY SELECTION Longitudinal studies examining the association of 100% fruit juice and change in BMI measures were included. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted data using a predesigned data collection form. RESULTS Of the 4657 articles screened, 8 prospective cohort studies (n = 34 470 individual children) met the inclusion criteria. Controlling for total energy intake, 1 daily 6- to 8-oz serving increment of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.003 (95% CI: 0.001 to 0.004) unit increase in BMI z score over 1 year in children of all ages (0% increase in BMI percentile). In children ages 1 to 6 years, 1 serving increment was associated with a 0.087 (95% confidence interval: 0.008 to 0.167) unit increase in BMI z score (4% increase in BMI percentile). 100% fruit juice consumption was not associated with BMI z score increase in children ages 7 to 18 years. LIMITATIONS All observational studies; studies differed in exposure assessment and covariate adjustment. CONCLUSIONS Consumption of 100% fruit juice is associated with a small amount of weight gain in children ages 1 to 6 years that is not clinically significant, and is not associated with weight gain in children ages 7 to 18 years. More studies are needed in children ages 1 to 6 years.","Auerbach, Brandon J; Wolf, Fred M; Hikida, Abigail; Vallila-Buchman, Petra; Littman, Alyson; Thompson, Douglas; Louden, Diana; Taber, Daniel R; Krieger, James",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-2454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336576/,502

METHODS Prospective single-center pediatric observational study. Simultaneous NIRS measurements over forehead (cNIRS, crS02) and kidney (rNIRS, rrSO2), at the same time, the cardiac output were determined by transthoracic echocardiography. Area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver-operating curve (ROC) was analyzed for NIRS regarding cerebral circulatory arrest. RESULTS There were two groups of patients (weight 2.1-73 kg): Group A: patients with intact cerebral perfusion (n = 36). Group B: patients with cerebral circulatory arrest (n = 8) proven by Doppler ultrasound scan or perfusion scintigraphy. There was no difference in cardiac output between the groups. PICU mortality for Group A was 3/36 (8.3%), for Group B 8/8, (100%). Mean cNIRS values were significantly higher with 68.92 (SEM = 2.54, SD = 15.25) in Group A compared with 34.63 (SEM = 5.36, SD = 15.15) in Group B (P < 0.001). ROC analysis for cNIRS detecting cerebral circulatory arrest was significant (AUC 0.948, 95% confidence interval 0.876-1.000, SE = 0.037, P < 0.001). Discrimination was optimal at 46 for cNIRS, at 36.5 for the difference rNIRS-cNIRS and at 0.5646 for the quotient cNIRS/rNIRS. The probability of a cerebral circulatory arrest was 77.8% (cNIRS) and 87.5% (combinations of cNIRS and rNIRS) at these cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS cNIRS did detect cerebral circulatory arrest with high sensitivity. Specificity was, however, not high enough to confirm a cerebral circulatory arrest.","Blohm, Martin E; Obrecht, Denise; Hartwich, Jana; Singer, Dominique",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24354795/,502
148734,The Show Must Go On: Using Technology for Rapid Onboarding and Orientation During COVID-19 and Beyond.,2021-03-01,"Immunoglobulin in cerebral spinal fluid and antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma are common hallmarks of microbial infections and autoimmune disorders. However, the signals directing ASC migration into the inflamed CNS are poorly characterized. This study demonstrates that CXCR3 mediates CNS accumulation of ASC during neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis. Expansion of CXCR3-expressing ASC in draining lymph nodes prior to accumulation within the CNS was consistent with their recruitment by sustained expression of CXCR3 ligands during viral persistence. Both total and virus-specific ASC were reduced greater than 80% in the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice. Similar T cell CNS recruitment and local T cell-dependent antiviral activity further indicated that the ASC migration defect was T cell independent. Furthermore, in contrast to the reduction of ASC in the CNS, neither virus-specific ASC trafficking to bone marrow nor antiviral serum antibody was reduced relative to levels in control mice. Impaired ASC recruitment into the CNS of infected CXCR3(-/-) mice coincided with elevated levels of persisting viral RNA, sustained infectious virus, increased clinical disease, and mortality. These results demonstrate that CXCR3 ligands are indispensable for recruitment of activated ASC into the inflamed CNS and highlight their local protective role during persistent infection.","Marques, Cristina P; Kapil, Parul; Hinton, David R; Hindinger, Claudia; Nutt, Stephen L; Ransohoff, Richard M; Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00202-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507985/,502
150476,"Medical misinformation in mass and social media: an urgent call for action, especially during epidemics.",2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND Whether infarct size modifies intra-arterial treatment effect is not certain, particularly in patients with large infarcts. We examined the effect of the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial treatment in a subgroup analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN). METHODS MR CLEAN was a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial of intra-arterial treatment in patients (aged ≥18 years from the Netherlands) with proximal arterial occlusion of the anterior circulation, given intra-arterial treatment within 6 h of stroke onset. The primary outcome was 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. We estimated the intra-arterial treatment effect for all patients in MR CLEAN who had ASPECTS graded by using multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis (a proportional odds model) to calculate the adjusted common odds ratio for a shift towards a better functional outcome according to the mRS for intra-arterial treatment and usual care than for usual care alone. We entered an interaction term into the model to test for interaction with prespecified ASPECTS subgroups: 0-4 (large infarct) versus 5-7 (moderate infarct) versus 8-10 (small infarct). MR CLEAN is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR1804, and the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN10888758. FINDINGS 496 patients-232 (47%) in the intra-arterial treatment and usual care group and 264 (53%) in the usual care alone group-were included in the analysis. We noted no significant difference in intra-arterial treatment effect between the ASPECTS subgroups according to 90 day ordinal mRS (adjusted common odds ratio interaction term relative to ASPECTS 8-10: ASPECTS 0-4: 0·79 [95% CI 0·20-3·19], p=0·740; and ASPECTS 5-7: 1·02 [0·44-2·35], p=0·966). Intra-arterial treatment did not cause a significant increase in the proportion of patients with at least one serious adverse event in any of the ASPECTS subgroups (ASPECTS 0-4: eight [73%] of 11 patients in treatment and usual care group vs 11 [58%] of 19 in usual care alone group, p=0·42; ASPECTS 5-7: 32 [59%] of 54 vs 19 [49%] of 39, p=0·31; ASPECTS 8-10: 70 [42%] of 167 vs 82 [40%] of 206; p=0·68). For death within 7 days or within 30 days and hemicraniectomy, the differences between the intra-arterial treatment and usual care versus usual care alone groups were not significant by ASPECTS subgroups. A significantly higher proportion of patients had recurrent ischaemic stroke in the intra-arterial treatment plus usual care group than in the usual care alone group in the ASPECTS 8-10 subgroup (eight [5%] vs one [<1%]; p=0·007). INTERPRETATION Contrary to findings from previous studies suggesting that only patients with non-contrast CT ASPECTS of more than 7 benefit from intra-arterial treatment, data from this study suggest that patients with ASPECTS 5-7 should be treated. Further evidence is needed for patients with ASPECTS 0-4, for whom treatment might yield only marginal absolute benefit.

151690,Covid-19 and cardiovascular disease.,2020-05-20,"OBJECTIVE To compare the accuracies of quantitative computed tomography (CT) parameters and semiquantitative visual score in evaluating clinical classification of severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p < 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p < 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","Yin, Xi; Min, Xiangde; Nan, Yan; Feng, Zhaoyan; Li, Basen; Cai, Wei; Xi, Xiaoqing; Wang, Liang",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32529815/,502
152127,Post-COVID-19: Trauma-Informed Care for the School Community.,2021-06-01,"CONTEXT.— We previously examined pituitary adenomas with immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for steroidogenic factor 1, Pit-1, anterior pituitary hormones, cytokeratin CAM 5.2, and the α-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and found that a screening panel comprising stains for steroidogenic factor 1, Pit-1, and adrenocorticotropic hormone successfully classified most cases and reduced the overall number of stains required. OBJECTIVES.— To examine the potential role of IHC stain for T-box transcription factor (Tpit) in the classification of our series of pituitary adenomas and to update our screening panel as necessary. DESIGN.— We collected 157 pituitary adenomas from 2 institutions and included these in tissue microarrays. Immunostains for Tpit were scored in a blinded fashion using the Allred system. Adenomas were assigned to a gold standard class based on IHC pattern followed by application of available clinical and serologic information. Test characteristics were calculated. Correlation analyses, cluster analyses, and classification tree analyses were used to see whether IHC staining patterns reliably reflected adenoma class. RESULTS.— Of the cases collected, 147 (93.6%) had sufficient material for Tpit analysis. IHC stain for Tpit identified 8 null cell adenomas (all nonfunctioning clinically) as silent corticotrophs; Tpit stains showed better sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value than IHC for adrenocorticotropic hormone and cytokeratin CAM 5.2. Correlation analyses continued to show the expected relationships among IHC stains. Cluster analyses showed grouping of adenomas into clinically consistent groups. Classification tree analysis underscored the central role of transcription factor IHC stains, including Tpit, in adenoma classification. CONCLUSIONS.— Substitution of Tpit stain for the adrenocorticotropic hormone stain improves our prior algorithm by reducing the number of false-negatives and false-positives. As a result, fewer adenomas are classified as null cell adenoma, and more adenomas are classified as silent corticotroph adenoma.","McDonald, William C; McDonald, Kelsey N; Helmer, Jordan A; Ho, Bridget; Wang, Amber; Banerji, Nilanjana",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0091-oa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991684/,502

152822,Aboriginal fractions: enumerating identity in Taiwan.,2012,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus primarily affecting the respiratory system, was initially diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Identified as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, the virus rapidly became a global pandemic. The effects on health care worldwide were unprecedented as countries adapted services to treat masses of critically ill patients.The aim of this study is to analyze the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic had on thoracic surgery at a major trauma center during peak prevalence. METHODS Prospective unit data were collected for all patients who underwent thoracic surgery during March 2020 until May 2020 inclusive. Retrospective data were collected from an earlier comparable time period as a comparison. RESULTS In the aforementioned time frame, 117 thoracic surgical operations were performed under the care of four thoracic surgeons. Six operations were performed on three patients who were being treated for SARS-CoV-2. One operation was performed on a patient who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2. There were no deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 in any patient undergoing thoracic surgery. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that during the first surge of SARS-CoV-2, it was possible to adapt a thoracic oncology and trauma service without increase in mortality due to COVID-19. This was only possible due to a significant reduction in trauma referrals, cessation of benign and elective work, and the more stringent reprioritization of cancer surgery. This information is vital to learn from our experience and prepare for the predicted second surge and any similar future pandemics we might face.","Smelt, Jeremy; Santhirakumaran, Gowthanan; Vaughan, Paul; Hunt, Ian; Tan, Carol",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1718938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225438/,502

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this paper is to describe direct support professionals' experiences assisting adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in accessing virtual and in-person health care during COVID-19. METHODS A content analysis was conducted on responses obtained from an online questionnaire distributed to 942 direct support professionals in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to report the type of visits that occurred and open text responses describing these visits were coded. RESULTS Twenty four percent of direct support professionals reported supporting someone at an in-person medical appointment, 22% reported attending at least one video-based virtual appointment and 58% reported supporting at least one phone based virtual appointment in the first 5 months of the pandemic. They identified several barriers and facilitators with each type of visit which suggests there is no ""single way"" to provide health care to this group, but that optimal care depends on maximizing the fit between the person's abilities, the skill set of direct support professionals and health care providers, and the presenting health care issue. CONCLUSIONS Study findings provide insight into the experience of health care for this population during COVID-19 and can be used to support direct support professionals and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to adapt to safe, supportive and comprehensive virtual and in-person health care during the pandemic and beyond.","Lunsky, Y; Bobbette, N; Selick, A; Jiwa, M I",Disability and health journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531290/,502
155351,Developing New Online Course Accessibility Services for Faculty through Collaboration between Librarians and Campus Departments: A Case Study.,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the standard of care for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinical outcomes of iodized oil computed tomography (IoCT) versus ultrasound (US)-guided RFA for HCC remain unclear. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed consecutive treatment-naïve patients who received curative RFA for HCC within Milan criteria from January 2016 to December 2018. Patients who underwent either IoCT-guided RFA (IoCT group) or US-guided RFA (US group) were included. Various clinical factors, including tumor location, were adjusted with a 1:1 propensity score matching. Subsequently, the cumulative incidence rates for recurrence and hazard ratios for survival were calculated. RESULTS We included 184 (37.9%) and 301 (62.1%) patients who received IoCT- and US-guided RFA, respectively. Before propensity score matching, IoCT guidance was significantly associated with multiple tumors, higher body mass index, lower albumin level, and tumors located at S8. After matching, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year local tumor progression rates of the IoCT group were significantly lower than those of the US group (4.4%, 6.9%, and 7.5% vs. 14.4%, 16.3%, and 16.3%, respectively, at p = 0.002, 0.009, and 0.016, respectively). In univariate analyses and multivariate analyses that adjusted for clinical and tumor location-related parameters, the IoCT group had better recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.581, 95% confidence interval 0.375-0.899) than those with US guidance but not overall survival. CONCLUSION IoCT-guided RFA had a lower local tumor progression rate and better recurrence-free survival than did US-guided RFA for HCC within the Milan criteria. CT-guide RFA is a safe and effective alternative to US-guided with similar overall survival. IoCT-guided RFA might have a better local tumor control than US-guided. IoCT-guided RFA may be more suitable for male patients, aged < 70 years, a single tumor measuring 2-5 cm, and a tumor located at the subdiaphragmatic/subcardiac region.","Wu, Chih-Horng; Liang, Po-Chin; Su, Tung-Hung; Lin, Ming-Chi; Chang, Yu-Hsuan; Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang; Kao, Jia-Horng",Hepatology international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12072-021-10236-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338971/,502

Here, we report on the synthesis of novel PI4KB inhibitors, which were rationally designed based on two distinct structural types of inhibitors that bind in the ATP binding side of PI4KB. These ""hybrids"" not only excel in outstanding inhibitory activity but also show high selectivity to PI4KB compared to other kinases. Thus, these compounds exert selective nanomolar or even subnanomolar activity against PI4KB as well as profound antiviral effect against hepatitis C virus, human rhinovirus, and coxsackievirus B3.

The optimal treatment strategy for this population is not known. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews-NHS Economic Evaluation Database were searched from inception until July 2019. A systematic review and narrative summary was performed of RCTs comparing observation or ART versus cALND in clinically node-negative female breast cancer patients with positive SNs. The Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs was used to assess risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), axillary recurrence, and axillary surgery-related morbidity. RESULTS Three trials compared observation with cALND, and two trials compared ART with cALND. No studies blinded participants or personnel, and there was heterogeneity in inclusion criteria, study design, and follow-up. Neither observation nor ART resulted in statistically inferior 5- or 8-year OS or DFS compared with cALND. There was also no statistically significant increase in axillary recurrences associated with either approach. Four trials reported morbidity outcomes, and all showed cALND was associated with significantly more lymphedema, paresthesia, and shoulder dysfunction compared with observation or ART.

There is evidence that patients with epidermotropic PCGDTCL may have an improved prognosis compared with those with only dermal and/or subcutaneous involvement. METHODS Systematic review of the literature and application of inclusion criteria yielded 48 manuscripts detailing the cases of 104 patients. RESULTS Individuals included 57 male (51.4%) and 47 female (48.5%) patients. Of 104 patients included in this analysis, 57 (54.8%) had no epidermotopism, 47 (45.2%) demonstrated any degree of epidermotropism, and 25 cases were predominantly epidermotropic (25/104, 24%). There was no significant difference in survival between these groups (P = 0.398). The most commonly performed immunohistochemical markers were CD3, CD4, CD8, CD5, CD7, CD30, CD56, TCR beta, TCR gamma, and TCR delta. There was no statistically significant difference in immunophenotype between groups. Lesion morphology was described in the majority of cases (85/104, 80.9%), most commonly some combination of nodules, plaques, and tumors (77.4%). Several cases had more atypical presentations, including ""mycosis-fungoides-like"" and ulcerated.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effects of treating preoperative anaemia or iron deficiency with IV iron in adult cardiac surgery patients. METHODS We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Systems Online and Excerpta Medica Database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing IV iron to oral iron or no iron. We performed title and abstract, full-text screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and evaluated the overall quality of evidence. RESULTS We identified 4 RCTs and 7 observational studies. Pooled data from observational studies suggested a benefit of IV iron compared to no iron on mortality [relative risk 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.65; P < 0.001, very low quality], units transfused per patient (mean difference -1.22, 95% CI -1.85 to -0.60; P < 0.001, very low quality), renal injury (relative risk 0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.69; P < 0.001, very low quality) and hospital length of stay (mean difference -4.24 days, 95% CI -6.86 to -1.63; P = 0.001, very low quality). Pooled data from RCTs demonstrated a reduction in the number of patients transfused with IV iron compared to oral or no iron (relative risk 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94; P = 0.005, moderate quality). The pooled estimates of effect from RCTs for mortality, hospital length of stay, units transfused per patient and renal injury were consistent in direction with observational studies. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis suggests that IV iron improves postoperative morbidity in adult cardiac surgery patients with preoperative anaemia or iron deficiency. A large, rigorous, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multicentre trial is needed to clarify the role of IV iron in this patient population.

(Special Section: Innovation in sport business management.),2021,"INTRODUCTION The objective of this study was to evaluate the initial learning curve for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) using the da Vinci Xi Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, California). METHODS This study included the initial 65 consecutive patients with small renal tumors who had undergone RAPN at our institution. A single trained surgeon with extensive experience in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, but not in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, performed RAPN for all patients using the da Vinci Xi. The learning curve was analyzed by examining the perioperative outcomes among five groups each consisting of 13 consecutive patients. RESULTS In this series, the median tumor size and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score were 23 mm and 7, respectively, and the median console time and warm ischemia time (WIT) were 116 and 15 minutes, respectively. Fifty-eight patients (89.2%) achieved trifecta outcomes, meaning that the ischemic time was ≤25 minutes, there was a negative surgical margin, and no major postoperative complications occurred. Although there were no significant changes in R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores over time, increased surgeon experience was significantly associated with a shorter console time and WIT. Drawing logarithmic approximation curves enabled the achievement of a console time ≤150 minutes and WIT ≤20 minutes at the sixth and fourth procedures, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified an independent correlation between surgeon experience with WIT, but not with console time. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that regardless of a surgeon's prior experience in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, an experienced robotic surgeon can perform RAPN using the da Vinci Xi with acceptable perioperative outcomes after a small number of procedures.","Motoyama, Daisuke; Matsushita, Yuto; Watanabe, Hiromitsu; Tamura, Keita; Suzuki, Takahisa; Ito, Toshiki; Sugiyama, Takayuki; Otsuka, Atsushi; Miyake, Hideaki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30689309/,502

162813,Hand Hygiene during Pandemic,2021,"Background: Understanding the determinants of long-term immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the concurrent impact of vaccination and emerging variants of concern will guide optimal strategies to achieve global protection against the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A prospective cohort of 332 COVID-19 patients was followed beyond one year. Plasma neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV-based reporter pseudoviruses expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spikes and was longitudinally analyzed using mixed-effects models. Findings: Long-term neutralizing activity was stable beyond one year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while outpatient responses were dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosted responses to natural infection, although viral variants, mainly B.1.351, reduced the efficacy of neutralization. Importantly, despite showing higher neutralization titers, hospitalized patients showed lower cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variant compared to outpatients. Multivariate analysis identified severity of primary infection as the factor that independently determines both the magnitude and the inferior cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses. Conclusions: Neutralizing response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous in magnitude but stable beyond one year after infection. Vaccination boosts these long-lasting natural neutralizing responses, counteracting the significant resistance to neutralization of new viral variants. Severity of primary infection determines higher magnitude but poorer quality of long-term neutralizing responses.","Pradenas, E.; Trinite, B.; Urrea, V.; Marfil, S.; Tarres-Freixas, F.; Ortiz, R.; Rovirosa, C.; Rodon, J.; Vergara-Alert, J.; Segales, J.; Guallar, V.; Valencia, A.; Izquierdo-Useros, N.; Noguera-Julian, M.; Carrillo, J.; Paredes, R.; Mateu, L.; Chamorro, A.; Toledo, R.; Massanella, M.; Clotet, B.; Blanco, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.12.21261921v1?rss=1,502
163268,Covid and Regional Anaesthesia,2021,"Fraud acts as a major deterrent to a companys growth if uncontrolled. It challenges the fundamental value of Trust in the Insurance business. COVID-19 brought additional challenges of increased potential fraud to health insurance business. This work describes implementation of existing and enhanced fraud detection methods in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 environments. For this purpose, we have developed an innovative enhanced fraud detection framework using actuarial and data science techniques. Triggers specific to COVID-19 are identified in addition to the existing triggers. We have also explored the relationship between insurance fraud and COVID-19. To determine this we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient and fitted logarithmic regression model between fraud in health insurance and COVID-19 cases. This work uses two datasets: health insurance dataset and Kaggle dataset on COVID-19 cases for the same select geographical location in India. Our experimental results shows Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86, which implies that the month on month rate of fraudulent cases is highly correlated with month on month rate of COVID-19 cases. The logarithmic regression performed on the data gave the r-squared value of 0.91 which indicates that the model is a good fit. This work aims to provide much needed tools and techniques for health insurance business to counter the fraud.","Gupta, Rohan Yashraj; Mudigonda, Satya Sai; Baruah, Pallav Kumar; Kandala, Phani Krishna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04210v1.pdf,502
163290,Are We Doing Enough? COVID Responses from Urban and Rural Community Colleges,2021,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is predominantly a respiratory illness, but gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of variable severity have been reported. In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, observational studies have demonstrated the elevation of pancreatic enzymes as surrogate markers for pancreatic injury without evidence of acute pancreatitis (AP). We report a case of AP in a patient with COVID-19 with SARS-CoV-2 as possible etiological agent with imaging evidence of pancreatitis. We hypothesize a causal relationship of SARS-CoV-2 in this patient with an otherwise unexplained presentation of AP after excluding the common causes. We postulate that AP in COVID-19 could be related to the abundant expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptors in the pancreas which serve as viral entry binding receptors for SARS-CoV-2 or due to direct viral involvement of the pancreas. Although there seems to be an association between diabetes and AP, the available data regarding the etiological role of diabetes in causing AP is very limited. We also propose that imaging studies such as computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen should be considered in the diagnosis of AP in patients with COVID-19 infection to exclude the false positive amylase and lipase.","Gadiparthi, C.; Mohapatra, S.; Kanna, S.; Vykuntam, V.; Chen, W.

163414,The state aid instruments in response to the COVID-19 crisis,2021,"Abstract Geothermal Energy is one of the most consistent and viable sources of renewable energy. However, harnessing this energy has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the difficulty in drilling hard igneous rock formations that occur in and around geothermal wells. Therefore, an energy efficient method that can drill hard rocks needs to be developed. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale energy delivery, in the form of plasma, to weaken rock by inducing micro-cracks is studied. Two different types of granite (igneous rock) were sampled and used in this study, out of which the one control group was treated with five, 40kV, 80J pulses of plasma while the other was left uncracked. The effect of the cracks is quantified by conducting facing tests on the plasma cracked and uncracked samples and measuring a reduction in the specific cutting energy. Two different methods were used to estimate the specific cutting energy, where the first method considered the entire cutting process and the second method considered only the stable cutting region. The plasma treatment showed a maximum of 65% and a minimum of 15% reduction in specific cutting energy and was regarded as being dependent on mainly the hardness and size of the samples. All results in this study are validated using statistical analysis.","Kazi, Aamer; Riyaz, Mirza; Tang, Xin; Staack, David; Tai, Bruce",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315298; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315298,502
163487,The challenges of Covid-19 pandemic on improving plastic waste recycling rates,2021,"Abstract In this work, we present a model for origami-based sheet metal (OSM) folding that can predict the required bending force. OSM folding is enabled by introducing bending features along the bending line, named material discontinuity (MD). Firstly, the introduced analysis in this work developed a bending setup for OSM that does not require a die then introduced a method to analytically derive the bending force for a regular sheet without any added folding features. The analytical approach is followed using an experimental setup identical to the developed OSM bending configuration. Secondly, the OSM bending experiment is conducted to measure the required bending force and to identify which parameters influence the OSM bending force significantly. Finally, an empirical model is proposed considering the analytical force in the first step and the influencing parameters defined in the second step. Regression analysis is carried out using one portion of experimental force measurement to determine the coefficients of the proposed empirical model. The other measurement set is used to validate the prediction model. The validation results of the proposed prediction model show good agreement between the developed prediction model and the experiment results. The prediction model provided a shape factor that represents the topology of each bending feature, as well.","Ablat, Muhammad Ali; Qattawi, Ala; Jaman, Md Shah; Alafaghani, Ala’aldin; Yau, Curtis; Soshi, Masakazu; Sun, Jian-Qiao",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315158; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315158,502

(Special Issue: Covid-19.),2020,"The global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic relies strongly on the human defense of antibody, which is assumed to bind the antigen’s receptor binding domain (RBD) with its hypervariable region (HVR). Due to the similarity to other viruses such as SARS, however, our understanding of the antibody-virus interaction has been largely limited to the genomic sequencing, which poses serious challenges to containment and rapid serum testing. Based on the physical/chemical nature of the interaction, infrared spectroscopy was employed to reveal the binding disparity, the real cause of the antibody-virus specificity at the molecular level, which is inconceivable to be investigated otherwise. Temperature dependence was discovered in the absorption value from the 1550 cm−1 absorption band, attributed to the hydrogen bonds by carboxyl/amino groups, binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 antibodies. The infrared absorption intensity, associated with the number of hydrogen bonds, was found to increase sharply between 27 °C and 31 °C, with the relative absorbance matching the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types (19 vs. 12) at 37 °C. Meanwhile, the ratio of bonds at 27 °C, calculated by thermodynamic exponentials, produces at least 5% inaccuracy. Beyond genomic sequencing, the temperature dependence, as well as the bond number match at 37 °C between relative absorbance and the hydrogen bonding numbers of the two antibody types, is not only of clinical significance in particular but also as a sample for the physical/chemical understanding of vaccine–antibody interactions in general.","Wang, Ryan Taoran Xu Alex Fan Zhou Qi Song Tinglu Xu Kelvin J.; Xu, Gu",Crystals,https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst11080997,502

More specifically, the authors try to examine the possibility of digital transformation as a replacement for trust within a joint problem-solving context.Design/methodology/approachA survey instrument was developed and administrated to manufacturing firms within the United Kingdom and the United States. Based on data collected from 291 senior managers, multiple linear regressions were conducted through a customized process model to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThe results point to the actual impact of digital transformation being far more complicated than the initial benefits that it appears to bring within a supply chain. Thus, technology is only effective when applied within the right context. The authors showcase that the trio of digital transformation, trust and joint problem-solving can be highly valuable to establish supply chain resilience and that further investigation on the interrelationships between these concepts is warranted.Practical implicationsManufacturing firms that aim to adopt new technologies should not consider advanced digital technologies as an alternative to trust. While digital transformation can improve resource sharing and integration, governance mechanisms–such as trust–will remain the cornerstones of strategic supplier relationships. Therefore, supply chain partners must strive to achieve a balance between trust and the right type of digital technology.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the growing literature focusing on the role that digital transformation can play in developing supply chain capabilities. It adds an early empirical insight on the role of technology and governance in joint problem-solving and supply chain resilience.","Faruquee, Murtaza Paulraj Antony Chandra Ade Irawan",International Journal of Operations & Production Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijopm-10-2020-0702,502

The research data obtained was analyzed using repeated-measure ANOVA. One hundred and thirty-two participants passed the manipulation check questions and were processed in order to answer the question posed. The results show that there are differences between the structural roles and also when the corporate performance indicators are below target. The evaluator's negative bias is also higher than that of the evaluatee. These findings confirm the relevance of attribution theory and negative bias theory, but the correlation test shows that evaluators also consider external attributes when making strategy reviews.

164543,Standardized incidence ratio of the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study in a Midwestern state,2021-09-30,"Aims Certain cancers, pathogenic infections, and other diseases are facilitated by the host enzyme furin, a calcium-dependent serine protease that is the most prominent member of the family of proprotein convertases. Furin and the other proprotein convertases modify certain other proteins to change them from their inactive to active forms. Previous attempts to find an effective, non-toxic furin inhibitor to treat diseases facilitated by furin have had only limited success, due to toxicity or large molecular size that impedes absorption of the molecule. This has placed increased importance on the development of small-molecule furin inhibitors. The object of this study was to consider the effect of the noble gas helium as a furin inhibitor. Methods This study uses a fluorometric furin inhibition assay to compare the enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin after exposure to balloon-grade helium gas, compared to the enzymatic activity of untreated recombinant human furin. Results Helium exposure was found to decrease the in vitro enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin by as much as 55%; this inhibition lasted for up to 16 hours. Fluorescence measurements of enzymatic activity were taken for 24 hours. Conclusions These findings appear to be the first to report helium as a partial furin inhibitor. The observed partial inhibition was consistent throughout the experiment. The effectiveness of helium as a partial furin inhibitor, its favorable side-effect profile, and its long history of safe use in respiratory therapy, when mixed with 20% oxygen or more and administered under direct medical supervision, make it a promising treatment for diseases facilitated by furin or its substrates. Further studies in cell culture or clinical trials may expand its clinical role for such diseases.","Beihl, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.18.423485,502

The objective of this report was to characterize the demographics and beliefs of unvaccinated Hispanics to help address their concerns that lead to vaccine hesitancy. Methods: Of 1,011 potential participants from a national online panel, 22.3% (N = 225, 51.6% female, age = 40.5) met inclusion criteria of Hispanic adults and not receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The 30-item survey included items about demographics, political affiliations, sources of news (e.g., Fox vs. CNN), reasons for being unvaccinated, and ratings (0 = strongly disagree, 100 = strongly agree) of 10 controversial statements regarding COVID-19. Results: Over three-fifths (62.6%) identified side effects and safety concerns while almost one-third (30.5%) a lack of efficacy as their top reasons for being unvaccinated. Agreement to statement: The developers of the COVID-19 vaccine rushed the development and cut-corners, was rated highest (63.22) which was significantly (p < .001) higher than the other nine statements (e.g., The COVID-19 vaccine does not work).

Collapsing glomerulopathy can be triggered by viral infections such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptional profiling of collapsing glomerulopathy lesions is difficult since only a few glomeruli may exhibit this histology within a kidney biopsy and the mechanisms driving this heterogeneity are unknown. Therefore, we used recently developed digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology which permits quantification of mRNA at the level of individual glomeruli. Using DSP, we profiled 1,852 transcripts in glomeruli from HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with biopsy confirmed collapsing glomerulopathy. The increased resolution of DSP uncovered heterogeneity in glomerular transcriptional profiles that were missed in early laser capture microdissection studies of pooled glomeruli. Focused validation using immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization showed good concordance with DSP results. Therefore, DSP represents a powerful method to dissect transcriptional programs of pathologically discernible kidney lesions.","Smith, Kelly D.; Henriksen, Kammi; Nicosia, Roberto F.; Alpers, Charles E.; Akilesh, Shreeram",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459502,502

The pandemic situation, with various physical distancing restrictions in place, especially for vulnerable older adults, has increased the importance of deploying health monitoring and social interaction technologies for aging in place. The pandemic also made it more difficult for researchers and developers of technologies to evaluate the usability of home health monitoring technologies. Existing technology evaluation methods mostly involve laboratory and home technology usability evaluations that could be problematic during physical distancing restrictions, and are not well suited for rapid evaluation of health monitoring technologies. The increasing trend in virtual doctor and health professional visits puts additional pressure to speed up innovation for home health and wellness monitoring and communication technologies without increasing risks for vulnerable populations. Researchers observed challenges with performing HCI research with older adults in a pandemic situation, including challenges with participant recruitment, obtaining informed consent for the study, shipping technology to the willing participants, assessing the ability of older adults to set up both digital health technology and remote usability tools, and research data collection. The need for low cost, low risk, easy to use and privacy-preserving usability evaluation methods and tools for home health monitoring is growing rapidly, and new remote usability evaluation methods and tools will add to the growing arsenal of digital technologies used in the public health response to COVID-19 and beyond. © 2021, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.","Kondratova, I.; Fournier, H.; Katsuragawa, K.","7th International Conference on Human Aspects of IT for the Aged Population, ITAP 2021, held as part of the 23rd International Conference, HCI International 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78108-8_3,502

When the COVID-19 pandemic impeded street protests in spring 2020, SMOs had to adapt their strategies to online-only formats. We analyze the German-language Twitter communication of the climate movement Fridays for Future (FFF) before and during the lockdown to explain how SMOs adapted their strategy under online-only conditions. We collected (re-)tweets containing the hashtag #fridaysforfuture (N = 46,881 tweets, N = 225,562 retweets) and analyzed Twitter activity, use of hashtags, and predominant topics. Results show that although the number of tweets was already steadily declining before, it sharply dropped during the lockdown. Moreover, the use of hashtags changed substantially and tweets focused increasingly on thematic discourses and debates around the legitimacy of FFF, while tweets about protests and calls for mobilization decreased.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new avenues for infectious disease research.

Author summary During the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract information about host–pathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological knowledge as a potential tool to support investigations during an emergency. This tool is contrasted with conventional approaches that would take months to comb through the massive amount of existing literature. In addition to providing background information for research, scientific publications can be processed to transform textual information into complex networks, which can be integrated with existing knowledge resources to suggest novel hypotheses that potentially contribute to innovative infectious disease research approaches. This study shows that the knowledge extraction and mapping process required to inform clinical and research responses to an emerging epidemic can be efficiently and effectively executed with a dedicated and trained group of experts, a validated process and the necessary tools. Our results further provide an overview of ZIKV biology, allow prediction of drug efficacy and indentify specific host factors and signalling pathways affected by ZIKV.","Bauch, Angela; Pellet, Johann; Schleicher, Tina; Yu, Xiao; Gelemanović, Andrea; Cristella, Cosimo; Fraaij, Pieter L.; Polasek, Ozren; Auffray, Charles; Maier, Dieter; Koopmans, Marion; de Jong, Menno D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.044743,502

In addition, as rurality increased, agencies were more likely to offer training but less likely to experience officers contracting COVID-19 and an officer shortage. Lastly, as the rurality of the county in which the agency resides increased, the ability to supply PPE decreased. Practical implications: Based on these findings, it is imperative that rural police agencies give attention to risk management and the formulation of policy to prepare for public health emergencies. Originality/value: While knowledge about how large police agencies in the United States have responded during the coronavirus pandemic is building, little is known about rural policing during pandemics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mrozla, T.

166158,Investors' reactions to COVID-19 related announcements: evidence from the cargo shipping industry,2021,"We empirically explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on Islamic and conventional stock markets from a global perspective. We also explore the co-movement between Islamic and conventional stock markets. Two comparable pairs of conventional and Islamic stock indices -Dow JonesIndex and FTSEIndex are considered in this study. Employing Wavelet-based multi-timescales techniques on the daily data from 21st January to 27th November 2020, our findings indicate that the pandemic creates identical volatility in both stock markets. Our findings further suggest that both markets are strongly associated and tend to co-move highly during our sample period, rebutting the decoupling hypothesis of the Islamic stock market from the conventional market. However, the Shariah screening process fails to provide immunity to Islamic stock markets against financial crises. Our findings suggest that investors should be aware that Islamic stocks' conservative features do not present a superior investment alternative, especially in economic turmoil.","Hasan, Md Bokhtiar Mahi Masnun Kabir Hassan M.; Bashar Bhuiyan, Abul",The North American Journal of Economics and Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101504,502

Our study aimed to assess the mental health difficulties and influence of lockdown stressors among Indian higher education students' and employees of the government, private sector during the COVID-19 lockdown. We collected the basic demographic, sleep generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), perceived stress scale (PSS) and sleep quality data from 676 participants using a web-based cross-sectional survey. Among the participants, the overall prevalence of GAD and PSS were 22.9%, 15.7% (low), 79.4% (medium), 4.7 (high), respectively. Younger participants reported higher GAD and PSS symptoms. Lockdown stressors have a significant correlation with GAD and PSS. In addition, the increased mobile phone usage significantly affects sleep latency, and sleep quality (p < 0.001) is a subject of concern. As part of global preparedness measures, continuous monitoring of sleep and the psychological impacts of outbreaks should become standard practice.","Radhakrishnan, B. L.; Kirubakaran, E.; Belfin, R.

Several wearables utilize photoplethysmography from the wrist vasculature to derive BP assessment although many of these devices are still at the experimental stage. With the ultimate goal of supporting instrument development, we have developed a model the photoplethysmographic waveform derived from the radial artery at the volar surface of the wrist. To do so we have utilized the relation between vessel biomechanics through Finite Element Method and Monte Carlo light transport model. The model shows similar features to that seen in PPG waveform captured using an off the shelf device. We observe the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the PPG signal. A degradation the PPG signal of up to 40% in AC to DC signal ratio was thus observed.","Boonya-ananta, Tananant; Rodriguez, Andres J.; Ajmal, Ajmal; Du Le, Vinh Nguyen; Hansen, Anders K.; Hutcheson, Joshua D.; Ramella-Roman, Jessica C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.214015,502

It argues that the intelligence components of the federal government's Biological Defense Program offered actionable forewarning about an impending pandemic in the years leading to the COVID-19 outbreak. Yet, almost from the opening stages of the pandemic, senior US government officials, including President Donald Trump, have repeatedly claimed that the virus ""came out of nowhere"" and that ""nobody saw it coming."" We show that these assertions contradict more than 15 years of pandemic preparedness warnings by intelligence professionals, and disregard the existence of intelligence-led federal pandemic response strategies of every US administration in our time. However, rather than simply placing blame on the White House for discounting these warnings, we advance a conceptual analysis of what many in the US Intelligence Community view as a critical breakdown in strategic communication between intelligence professionals and key government decision-makers. This study agrees with those who suggest that the White House disregarded its own pandemic experts. However, it also posits that the means of strategic communication employed by intelligence experts to alert the White House to the threat were unproductive. These alerts were communicated largely through the President's Daily Brief, an archaic, and ineffectual method of communication that is not designed to facilitate the kind of laser-focused, unequivocal exchange of information needed when potentially catastrophic threats confront the world. This study suggests that the Intelligence Community must implement more direct, immediate and conclusive methods of communicating intelligence to decision-makers, and should seriously consider creating a new line of products that addresses existential challenges to national security. Lastly, we contend it is time to re-evaluate existing rules that prevent intelligence analysts from offering advice on policy. Although we agree that intelligence professionals should refrain from providing policy advice on routine matters, we question the value of preventing these highly knowledgeable experts from communicating strategic policy advice to decision-makers when it comes to threats of a catastrophic nature, which may prove potentially existential for the US, its allies, and the world.","Lankford, A.

166550,Adaptations of olfactometry and odour measurement with COVID-19 crisis,2021,"Despite the success of vaccines and selected repurposed treatments, COVID-19 is likely to remain a global health problem and further chemotherapeutics are required. Many repurposed drugs have progressed rapidly to Phase 2 and 3 trials without characterisation of Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) including safety in COVID-19. One such drug is Nafamostat Mesylate (Nafamostat), a synthetic serine protease inhibitor with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Preclinical data has demonstrated that it is has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 by directly inhibiting the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent stage of host cell entry. Methods: We present the findings of a phase Ib/II open label, platform randomised controlled trial (RCT), exploring the safety of intravenous Nafamostat in hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonitis. Patients were assigned randomly to standard of care (SoC), Nafamostat or an alternative therapy. Secondary endpoints included clinical endpoints such as number of oxygen free days and clinical improvement/ deterioration, PK/PD, thromboelastometry, D Dimers, cytokines, immune cell flow cytometry and viral load. Results: Data is reported from 42 patients, 21 of which were randomly assigned to receive intravenous Nafamostat. The Nafamostat group developed significantly higher plasma creatinine levels, more adverse events and a lower number of oxygen free days. There were no other statistically significant differences in the primary or secondary endpoints between Nafamostat and SoC. PK data demonstrated that intravenous Nafamostat was rapidly broken down to inactive metabolites. We observed an antifibrinolytic profile, and no significant anticoagulant effects in thromboelastometry. Participants in the Nafamostat group had higher D Dimers compared to SoC. There were no differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and viral loads between the groups. Conclusion In hospitalised patients with COVID-19, we did not observe evidence of anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant or antiviral activity with intravenous Nafamostat. Given the number of negative trials with repurposed drugs, our experimental medicine trial highlights the value of PK/PD studies prior to selecting drugs for efficacy trials. Given the mechanism of action, further evaluation of Nafamostat delivered via a different route may be warranted. This trial demonstrates the importance of experimental trials in new disease entities such as COVID-19 prior to selecting drugs for larger trials.","Quinn, T. M.; Gaughan, E.

The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on January 30, 2020. This study analyzes the effects of lockdown during COVID-19 on land surface temperature for the six categories of water, wetland, bare land, forest, cropland, and urban. It is essential to examine the mean LST differences for each land cover type. This study uses the SR data from Landset8. All Landsat level 1 and level 2 data is directly available to Google Earth Engine, including top of atmosphere (TOA) and surface reflectance (SR). The process is a comparative analysis, so data of the same periods are analyzed for 2019 before lockdown and 2020. There are significant changes that have been seen in land surface temperature. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate an investigation regarding LST differences for each land cover type in various anthropogenic levels. So our results show mean LST differences between during and before the emergence of COVID-19 for each land cover type regarding lockdown policy in Rajasthan, India. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Jangid, A.; Gupta, M.

The results of this survey suggest that gynecologic oncology units had set a proactive approach to COVID-19 outbreak. Triage methods were adopted in order to minimize the in-hospital diffusion of COVID-19. Although 73% of the participants stated that COVID-19 has not significantly modified their everyday practice, 21% declared a decrease in the use of laparoscopy in favor of open (19%) and vaginal (2%) surgery. Interestingly, about 5% of the participants stated that the use of laparoscopic surgery has increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, less than 50% of surgeons adopted specific protection against COVID-19.

Given capital-market pressure and incentives to obtain favourable considerations from the government and lenders, we hypothesise that COVID-19-induced uncertainty can lead managers to release (delay) preexisting firm-specific bad (good) news. Our baseline results show that firms are more likely to disclose unfavourable (favourable) 2019 forecasts in days when recent COVID-19 cases in headquarter provinces increase (decrease). Results in further analyses provide evidence on the aforementioned reporting incentives by showing that the opportunistic timing behaviour is more prominent in firms with higher managerial ownership, non-state ownership, and in firms under financial distress. In addition, we uncover the role of local marketisation level and medical resources in mitigating the opportunistic timing behaviour. Finally, the analysis of market reactions shows that the manipulation of disclosure dates can influence the market price in a favourable direction for firms. Overall, our paper presents a comprehensive picture of corporate opportunistic timing behaviour amid the COVID-19 crisis.","Chen, Hanwen Liu Siyi Liu Xin Wang Jiani",Accounting &amp; Finance,https://doi.org/10.1111/acfi.12830,502

Our hypothesis is that the social impacts of the crisis rescales especially the pathos projection, that is, the speaker's reading of this church target audience's interests and values. Our theoretical framework settles on the sociocognitive studies of the text, in which the reference, that is, the way we make the world known through language, is the central notion and organizer of the epistemological field. Thus, and considering metaphor as an essential element of religious rhetoric, we pursue our objective by examining how this church's founding leader conceptualizes via metaphor references about the pandemic, embedding it to the rhetoric. In this path, we selected three audiovisual records, spaced approximately thirty days since the declaration of Covid-19 pandemic by the WHO, and raised thematically relevant metaphorical referential processes. In our analysis we have applied a dynamic notion of context to observe how relevant social, cultural and political events to the church's life are embedded in the emerging referential processes. In our conclusions, we point how the data confirms our hypothesis and, also, exploit the meanings of the Universal Church's reaction to the pandemic inside the neoliberal rationality spectrum. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Other etiologies include trauma, post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections, hypertriglyceridemia, medications, and scorpion bite to name a few. Hypercalcemia is a rare cause of acute pancreatitis. Hypercalcemia can be due to primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) manifested by raised parathyroid hormone and serum calcium level. In addition acute pancreatitis is a rare presenting complain of PHPT. PHPT can be asymptomatic or present with symptoms of bone pain, kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, accelerated atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension and proximal muscle weakness. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is the term for radiologically visible characteristic feature of skeletal involvement. Case presentation: We report a case of 20 years old male with chief complaint of epigastric and left hypochondrium pain associated with vomiting for two months. Abdominal pain was gradual in onset, radiating to back, and progressive. He also had complains of constipation, blood tinged feces and pain during defecation. Initial lab tests were significant for increased amylase, lipase and a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was made which was confirmed by CT scan. After ruling out the common etiologies of acute pancreatitis, further investigations for uncommon etiologies revealed increased IgG-4 values suggesting autoimmune pancreatitis. However further investigations were done and it did not meet the diagnostic criteria for autoimmune pancreatitis. Covid-19 IgG antibodies were positive, however patient did not have any other symptoms of Covid-19 and PCR Covid-19 test was negative. Although Covid-19 can cause pancreatitis, given the ongoing pandemic, he might have been asymptomatically infected with Covid-19 and developed immunity. Therefore we did not believe Covid-19 to be the cause of his pancreatitis. Thus a search for other rare etiologies was initiated which revealed serum calcium of 15 mg/dL. Serum parathyroid hormone and urinary calcium were increased several times suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism. DEXA scan revealed osteoporosis. Conclusion: Hypercalcemia is one of the rare etiologies of pancreatitis. Thus it should be considered as one of the etiologies of acute pancreatitis after ruling out the more common ones. Secondly, this Case report highlights acute pancreatitis as one of the rare presenting complain of primary hyperparathyroidism which may be associated with several times increased IgG-4 values. Covid-19 has been associated with a number of presenting complains and can cause acute pancreatitis, amid the ongoing pandemic physicians should exercise caution to avoid spurious association of Covid-19 with acute pancreatitis or other presenting complains.","Hussain, T.; Hafizyar, F.; Eimal Latif, A.

In order to accomplish the objective of the article, a mixed methods research was applied. According to the research methodology, the questionnaires were conducted during the first semester of the academic year 2019/20 and then in the first semester of the academic year 2020/21 at the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics. The investigation covered the period before the outset of the pandemic when a blended learning approach included instructor-led classroom training and e-learning elements;and then during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine when webucation was in line with the priorities of the training process. The participants of the study were first-year and second-year students of non-linguistic specialities. The scientific research reflected that teaching ESP was focused on enhancing foreign language learning in the particular field of study such as IT, law, trade, marketing, management or economics, to equip students with the oral and written comprehension and speaking skills that they would need to leverage partnerships with international interlocutors in the business community. The obtained results confirmed the high value of the resources available online for studying ESP as an academic discipline in university-level curricula. The analysis of data showed that during the pandemic almost equal percentages of the respondents faced the challenges that accompanied the process of learning English online. Students noted all four proposed options that characterised the disadvantages of completing the assignments independently, namely the communication vacuum, difficulties in choosing supplemental instructional materials, as well as a lack of self-discipline and control. The outcome confirmed the need to assist students' independent work. To meet that demand, the authors carried out a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) Analysis related to the use of ICTs within the organising framework of students' independent work while teaching ESP during a pandemic. It has been concluded that the opportunities and threats, as well as the strengths and weaknesses, identified through the SWOT analysis, characterise the advantages, drawbacks and peculiarities that emerge in the process of providing guidance for students' independent work in the study of ESP, integrating them into a coherent whole.","Shumeiko, N.; Nypadymka, A.",Advanced Education,https://doi.org/10.20535/2410-8286.223286,502

Therefore, parties involved in providing medical services are subject to exceptionally high expectations, and the activities of doctors and medical institutions are subject to social control. Such control is carried out with the participation of patients and journalists using mass media, particularly the Internet. Even though such control is allowed and freedom of speech and freedom of the press allow for public expression of opinions (including critical and negative ones), presenting one’s position – even on important social issues – does not entitle one to infringe upon the personal rights of medical personnel and health care institutions. Meantime, criticizing and defaming doctors has become increasingly common in recent years due to the growing popularity of internet portals evaluating doctors, social media disseminating information, as well as the social tensions related to the overburdened health service and limited access to some health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, patients exposed to stress about the health or hospital treatment are more likely to manifest their emontions by verbal aggression (insults or slanders) towards the medical personnel [1]. In the case of a threat to or infringement of personal rights, civil and criminal remedies are available to the doctor and the medical establishment, which protect against the negative consequences of an infringement of reputation or good name in the personal, professional and social sphere.","Ożegalska-Trybalska, J.",Nowotwory,https://doi.org/10.5603/njo.2021.0034,502
168750,Keeping Distance? Adaptation Strategies to the Covid-19 Pandemic Among Sport Event Organizers in Sweden,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has renewed interest in human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly as research with them at biosafety level (BSL)-2 avoids the added costs and biosafety concerns that accompany work with SARS-COV-2, BSL-3 research. One of these, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is a well-matched surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 because it is also a Betacoronavirus, targets the human respiratory system, is transmitted via respiratory aerosols and droplets and is relatively resistant to disinfectants. Unfortunately, growth of HCoV-OC43 in the recommended human colon cancer (HRT-18) cells does not produce obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and its titration in these cells requires expensive antibody-based detection. Consequently, multiple quantification approaches for HCoV-OC43 using alternative cell lines exist, which complicates comparison of research results. Hence, we investigated the basic growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 infection in three of these cell lines (HRT-18, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells) including the differential development of cytopathic effect (CPE) and explored reducing the cost, time and complexity of antibody-based detection assay. Multi-step growth curves were conducted in each cell type in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with daily sampling for seven days. Samples were quantified by tissue culture infectious dose50(TCID50)/ml or plaque assay (cell line dependent) and additionally analyzed on the Sartorius Virus Counter 3100 (VC), which uses flow virometry to count the total number of intact virus particles in a sample. We improved the reproducibility of a previously described antibody-based detection based TCID50 assay by identifying commercial sources for antibodies, decreasing antibody concentrations and simplifying the detection process. The growth curves demonstrated that HCoV-O43 grown in MRC-5 cells reached a peak titer of ∼107 plaque forming units/ml at two days post infection (dpi). In contrast, HCoV-OC43 grown on HRT-18 cells required six days to reach a peak titer of ∼106.5 TCID50/ml. HCoV-OC43 produced CPE in Vero E6 cells but these growth curve samples failed to produce CPE in a plaque assay after four days. Analysis of the VC data in combination with plaque and TCID50 assays together revealed that the defective:infectious virion ratio of MRC-5 propagated HCoV-OC43 was less than 3:1 for 1-6 dpi while HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells varied from 41:1 at 1 dpi, to 329:4 at 4 dpi to 94:1 at 7 dpi. These results should enable better comparison of extant HCoV-OC43 study results and prompt further standardization efforts.","Schirtzinger, Erin E.; Kim, Yunjeong; Davis, A.

169232,Supporting new online instructors and engaging remote learners during COVID-19: a distributed team teaching approach,2021,"The widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged training institutions to rethink the execution of their training programs. New approaches to teaching and learning are now needed due to the forced shift to e-learning modes. However, questions remain about how ready pre-service teachers are and their level of engagement in an online learning model of instruction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the readiness and engagement of pre-service teachers for online learning in Indonesia. This study used a non-experimental quantitative research design. Data were gathered from a sample of 285 pre-service teachers using a questionnaire. Data were analysed using WINSTEPS Rasch model measurement software version 4.30. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to examine pre-service teachers’ readiness and engagement of pre-service teachers for an online learning model of instruction, and a Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis was carried out to specifically assess their readiness and engagement for online learning based on their gender and age. Findings indicate pre-service teachers were not ready for online learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia. However, pre-service teachers were found to be actively engaged in online learning. Further analysis indicated there were differences in pre-service teachers’ readiness and engagement in online learning based on their gender and age. This study provides insight into pre-service teachers towards an online learning model of instruction in Indonesia, discusses implications, and offers recommendations for future research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Laksmiwati, P.

169461,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on the Indian summer monsoon,2021,"Mathematical models used in epidemiology to describe the diffusion of infectious diseases often fail to reproduce the recurrent appearance of exponential growth in the number of infections (waves). This feature requires a time-modulation of some parameters of the model. Moreover, epidemic data show the existence of a region of quasi-linear growth (strolling period) of infected cases extending in between waves. We demonstrate that this constitutes evidence for the existence of near time-scale invariance that is neatly encoded via complex fixed points in the epidemic Renormalization Group approach. As a result, we obtain the first consistent mathematical description of multiple wave dynamics and its inter-wave strolling regime. Our results are tested and calibrated against the COVID-19 pandemic data. Because of the simplicity of our approach that is organized around symmetry principles, our discovery amounts to a paradigm shift in the way epidemiological data are mathematically modelled. We show that the strolling period is crucial in controlling the emergence of the next wave, thus encouraging the maintenance of (non)pharmaceutical measures during the period following a wave.","Cacciapaglia, G.; Sannino, F.",Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fams.2021.659580,502

The model equilibria are analyzed. The theoretical results indicate that their stability behavior is the same as for the corresponding system formulated via standard derivatives. This suggests that, at least in this case for the model presented here, the memory effects contained in the fractional operators apparently do not seem to play a relevant role. The numerical simulations instead reveal that the order of the fractional derivative has a definite influence on both the equilibrium population levels and the speed at which they are attained.","Belgaid, Youcef Helal Mohamed Lakmeche Abdelkader Venturino Ezio",Fractal and Fractional,https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract5030087,502

Pre-COVID 19, the department was experiencing poor outcomes in staff stress risk assessment;long wait times for patients, and an overcrowded waiting room. Although appointment levels temporarily decreased during the pandemic, it was soon apparent that outpatient and virtual clinics (VCs) required enhanced support, due to increases in waiting lists. However, new social distancing requirements dictated fewer patients in waiting rooms, and some patients were reluctant to attend appointments, not knowing what to expect. Rapid changes were necessary, with little time for a full assessment of their impact.The department expanded its service, with new VCs, and protocols. The VCs now primarily operate in evenings and Saturdays during outpatient clinic downtime. Staff work 12 hour days, with two teams, separate managers and alternating rotas. With increased responsibility and training, imaging staff lead VCs. They also call patients before their appointment to ask and answer questions and explain requirements.Staff survey results now show significant improvement in all stress categories. Patient responses (n=255), also show significantly favourable results with patients indicating an overall good or excellent experience with the service (96%).The switch to a 12-hour day and compressed workweek can be a risk. Fortunately, in our department, it has been beneficial. This improvement is likely due to certain factors, such as task diversification, the autonomy that staff experience in leading VCs, and extended roles. Smaller work teams provide quick and better contact with managers, improvement in teamwork and opportunity for better relationships. Finally, patient phone calls reduce patient anxiety and improve communication, and reduced staff stress undoubtedly impacts quality of patient care.","Cornick, Shelley Tomlinson-Carine Luke Fox Natalie Gray Jane",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.200,502

In 2020, the pandemic caused by novel coronavirus infection has become one of the most critical global health challenges during the past century. The lack of a vaccine, as the most effective way to control the novel infection, has prompted the development of a large number of preventive products by the scientific community. We have developed a candidate vaccine (EpiVacCorona) against novel coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is based on chemically synthesized peptides conjugated to a carrier protein and adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide and studied the specific activity of the developed vaccine. Aims — study of the immunogenicity and protectivity of the peptide candidate vaccine EpiVacCorona. Methods. The work was performed using standard molecular biological, virological and histological methods. Results. It was demonstrated that EpiVacCorona, when administered twice, spaced 14 days apart, to hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates (african green monkeys, rhesus macaques) at a dose of 260 μg, which is equal to one inoculation dose for humans, induces virus-specific antibodies in 100% of the animals. Experiments in hamsters showed this vaccine to be associated with the dose-dependent immunogenicity. The vaccine was shown to accelerate the elimination of the virus from the upper respiratory tract in ferrets and prevent the development of pneumonia in hamsters and non-human primates following a respiratory challenge with novel coronavirus. Conclusions. The results of a preclinical specific activity study indicate that the use of EpiVacCorona has the potential for human vaccination. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Besides, the capital of Croatia was hit by an earthquake that caused material damage and organizational difficulties. Contrary to the World Health Organization’s recommendations that mental health services are essential services to be maintained during the pandemic, there was severe disruption of utilization and accessibility to mental health services during the pandemic. In the beginning, the only services maintained were in-hospital and emergency services, while daily hospitals and ambulatory visits were disrupted. Psychiatric resources were not formally implemented in the treatment and management of COVID-19 and majority of mental health workers remained within the boundaries of psychiatric services. In the following period, some of the services reopened, with reorientation to online provision. However, the interference of services gradually occurred as the second wave started, with some psychiatric departments being repurposed for non-psychiatric use. Psychiatric care was organized in some of the COVID-19 departments as liaison service. Some of the psychiatric services offered consultation and prevention of burn-out for frontline personnel. Lastly, as the University hospital centre Zagreb was implementing the flexible assertive community treatment teams for persons with severe mental illness through the Large-scale implementation of community based mental health care for people with severe and enduring mental ill health in Europe (RECOVER-E) project in the period from 2018-2022, we investigated the effect of this service on the health outcomes during the pandemic and found it superior compared with the standard treatment.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Rojnic-Kuzman, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.152,502

Thermal imagers and pyrometers are the equipment commonly used to measure temperature in these barriers. In this paper, Temperature measurements performed by these instruments were compared considering the regions usually monitored in these barriers: forehead, ear, and wrist. The temperatures of volunteers were recorded after initial acclimatization, a short period of physical exercise, and a rest period after exercise, evaluating the instruments and regions of measurement and the influence of the condition of rest and physical exercise of the person. The compatibility of the performed measurements in each of these three moments was then compared using statistical and metrological tools. The outcomes showed that the pyrometer has low repeatability since its results vary widely among different measurements due to the temperature variation existing within the analyzed region and the difficulty of guaranteeing the same measurement point. As a result, a thermal imager is more recommended for taking body temperature measurements on the forehead and, preferably, on the ear. It was also determined that the wrist, in particular, has a significantly lower temperature than the central body temperature, and thus this is not a recommended region to measure body temperature when screening febrile people. © 2021 IEEE","de Souza Santos, F.; da Silva, Y.

In this paper we quantify for the first time the economic costs of fatal and non-fatal child maltreatment in the UK in relation to several short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes ranging from physical and mental health problems, to labour market outcomes and welfare use. We combine novel regression analysis of rich data from the National Child Development Study and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing with secondary evidence to produce an incidence-based estimate of the lifetime costs of child maltreatment from a societal perspective. The discounted average lifetime incidence cost of non-fatal child maltreatment by a primary caregiver is estimated at GBP 89,390 (95% uncertainty interval GBP 44,896 to 145,508); the largest contributors to this are costs from social care, short-term health and long-term labour market outcomes. The discounted lifetime cost per death from child maltreatment is estimated at GBP 940,758, comprising health care and lost productivity costs.

Prior studies in patients with T1DM have demonstrated a short-term favorable or neutral effect of the lockdown on glycemic parameters;however, data is limited in T2DM patients. We sought to identify how the lockdown affected the glycemic control of adult patients with T2DM within a specific region of New York Design & Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients with regular outpatient visits within an integrated-delivery health system in South Bronx, New York who had A1C levels measured within 6 months prior to the initiation of lockdown (Mar '20) and a repeat A1C within 3 months after the first phase of reopening in New York (June '20). Analysis of comparison between pre- and post-lockdown HbA1c values was performed using paired samples T-test. Results: A total of 2489 adult patients with an established diagnosis of T2DM and A1C levels available during the study period were identified. 632 patients were excluded due to pregnancy, prediabetes, new-onset diabetes, residency in long-term care facility or hospital admission during the study period. Age range was 18 to 95 years with a mean age of 61. 58% of the patients were female and 41% male. Mean pre-lockdown A1C was 7.64% and mean post-lockdown A1C was 7.76%, indicating an increase of 0.122% (95% CI, 0.0613-0.1827) Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in HbA1C levels (0.122%) in a large cohort of community-dwelling adult patients with type 2 diabetes in South Bronx. Interruptions to regular outpatient care, difficulty in obtaining medications from pharmacies, changes in physical activity or diet and psychological stress related to the pandemic may have been potential contributing factors and need to be addressed to avoid further worsening of diabetes control in the longer term.","Malik, Is-Haq O.; Naher, Kamrun Thrupthi Komandur Zaidi Bushra Leung Vivien",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-185-lb,502

To explore the influence mechanism of customers’ acceptance of SCSs in restaurants, 27 preliminary influencing factors (PIFs) are selected from literature sources and subjects as customers/consumers are kindly asked to estimate the influence of each PIF on their acceptance of SCSs. Based on 91 pieces of valid data, eight main influencing factors (MIFs), i.e., common factors, are extracted by factor analysis procedure.

However, limited residue-level details are available into how the spike interacts with COPI. Here we identify a novel extended COPI binding motif in the spike that encompasses the canonical K-x-H dibasic sequence. This motif demonstrates selectivity for αCOPI subunit. Guided by an in silico analysis of dibasic motifs in the human proteome, we employ mutagenesis and binding assays to show that the spike motif terminal residues are critical modulators of complex dissociation, which is essential for spike release in ERGIC. αCOPI residues critical for spike motif binding are elucidated by mutagenesis and crystallography and found to be conserved in the zoonotic reservoirs, bats, pangolins, camels, and in humans. Collectively, our investigation on the spike motif identifies key COPI binding determinants with implications for retrograde trafficking.","Dey, Debajit; Singh, Suruchi; Khan, Saif; Martin, Matthew; Schnicker, Nicholas J.; Gakhar, Lokesh; Pierce, Brian G.; Hasan, S.

173527,Geographic Scope and Real Estate Firm Performance during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has seen a rise in digital learning materials being shared with students of all levels of education. Learning institutions usually provide a learning management system where all the notes, tutorial and example past year examination questions are provided for students to support their learning activities in courses throughout their studies. Students usually download the learning materials either as.zip or individual files in various file formats. The steps are repetitive for each registered course, therefore can be time consuming for students. Students also need to have a sense of appropriate file management skill in order to organize downloaded materials for easy access whenever necessary. When the number of courses grow throughout the years, improper files organization may result in loss of access or unidentifiable files in student machine or devices. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to address related challenges faced by students in managing the amount of learning materials provided through a learning management system or portal. A RPA-based bot was developed and integrated with a learning management system to accomplish the goals. The integration shows that RPA-based bots can minimize student's effort in managing their learning materials efficiently. © 2021 IEEE.","Razak, S. F. A.; Mashhod, F.; Bin Zaidan, Z.

The speckle images in the form of movies were obtained from suspensions placed in a thin cuvette. The classifier was trained, validated and tested on both single component monodispersive suspensions, as well as on two-component suspensions. It was able to properly recognise all the 73 classes - different suspensions from the training set, which is far beyond the capabilities of the human experimenter, and shows the capability of learning many more. The classes comprised different nanoparticle material and size, as well as different concentrations of the suspended phase. We also examined the capability of the system to generalise, by testing a system trained on single-component suspensions with two-component suspensions. The capability to generalise was found promising but significantly limited. A classification system using neural network was also compared with the one using support vector machine (SVM). SVM was found much more resource-consuming and thus could not be tested on full-size speckle images. Using image fragments very significantly deteriorates results for both SVM and neural networks. We showed that nanoparticle (colloidal) suspensions comprising even a large multi-parameter set of classes can be quickly identified using speckle images classified with convolution neural network.","Jakubczyk, Tomasz; Jakubczyk, Daniel; Stachurski, Andrzej",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09988v1.pdf,502

Here we show that mouse hippocampal synapses employ this principle to trigger Ca2+-dependent vesicle release and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We assess energy barrier changes by fitting release kinetics in response to hypertonic sucrose. Mimicking activation of the C2A domain of the Ca2+-sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), by adding a positive charge (Syt1D232N) or increasing its hydrophobicity (Syt14W), lowers the energy barrier. Removing Syt1 or impairing its release inhibitory function (Syt19Pro) increases spontaneous release without affecting the fusion barrier. Both phorbol esters and tetanic stimulation potentiate synaptic strength, and lower the energy barrier equally well in the presence and absence of Syt1. We propose a model where tetanic stimulation activates Syt1 dependent and independent mechanisms that lower the energy barrier independently in an additive manner to produce PTP by multiplication of release rates.","Huson, Vincent; Meijer, Marieke; Dekker, Rien; ter Veer, Mirelle; Ruiter, Marvin; van Weering, Jan; Verhage, Matthijs; Cornelisse, L.

However, how SARS-CoV-2 interferes with host immune response is incompletely understood. Here, we sequenced small RNAs from SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells and identified a micro-RNA (miRNA) encoded in a recently evolved region of the viral genome. We show that the virus-encoded miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer and they are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3’UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 employs a virus-encoded miRNA to hijack the host miRNA machinery and evade the interferon-mediated immune response.","Singh, Meetali; Chazal, Maxime; Quarato, Piergiuseppe; Bourdon, Loan; Malabat, Christophe; Vallet, Thomas; Vignuzzi, Marco; van der Werf, Sylvie; Behillil, Sylvie; Donati, Flora; Sauvonnet, Nathalie; Nigro, Giulia; Bourgine, Maryline; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Cecere, Germano",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.09.459577,502

However, lung concentration (6.7 µg/mL) to predict the in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be achievable with the currently proposed oral dosing regimen. Further, a high cumulative doses of HCQ may raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we described a non-clinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administrated by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats which achieved 129.4 µg/g (Cmax) in the lung. Compared to unformulated HCQ administered intravenous (IV), liposomal HCQ with normalized dose showed higher (∼30-fold) lung exposure, longer (∼2.5-fold) half-life in lung, but lower blood exposure with ∼20% of Cmax and 74% of AUC and lower heart exposure with 24% of Cmax and 58% of AUC.

This study examines some practice experiences in two southern European public universities in Portugal and Spain. We show that the third mission of universities, which includes social innovation, is both linked to the first two missions of teaching and research, depending on the university’s historical and social context. The high dependence of higher education institutions on economic returns increases the importance of political action to drive the development of social innovation activities. This conditioning factor seems to be intrinsic to some of the barriers that have been identified, such as lack of legitimization and recognition of social innovation practices at the formal governmental level.","Monteiro, Sílvia Rosa Isusi-Fagoaga Almeida Leandro García-Aracil Adela",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073594,502

175005,Challenges in Conducting Online Videoconferencing Qualitative Interviews with Adolescents on Sensitive Topics,2021,"Introduction: COVID-19 can trigger either transient stress-induced state, or newly onset diabetes mellitus (DM). It is well known that HbA1c serves as an indicator of glycemic status 12 weeks before the acute disease. Aim: To examine glycemic status at admission and 6 weeks after hospital discharge in patients with confirmed COVID-19 but no previous DM-history. Methods: Of 155 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pneumonia 111 persons had no previous DM-history. The levels of HbA1с, fasting and admission plasma glucose (FPG and APG) were measured at admission and 6 weeks after the discharge. The severity of COVID-19 was confirmed by CT scan, SpO2, serum IL-6, CRP, D-dimer. Results: All 111 patients had normal FPG and APG values. According to HbA1c level all the patients were divided into two groups: A) HbA1c≤6.0% (n=64, median 5,8%) and B) HbA1c>6,0% (n=47, median 6,4%). Our particular interest was focused on the group B due to the discrepancy of high HbA1c level and normal FPG and APG. Group B patients were retested for glycemic status in 6±1 week after the discharge. Surprisingly the median HbA1c level dropped down from 6,4% to 5,7% in such a short period of time with no antidiabetic drugs. COVID-19 severity markers were significantly higher in the group B. Conclusions: We suggest two explanations for this faster than expected HbA1c decrease: 1) patients with HbA1c>6,0% will progress to DM later, and, therefore, a longer follow-up is needed;2) SARS-CoV-2 virus has extensively glycosylated spike(S)-protein that may bind to erythrocytes. High-pressure liquid chromatography (the standard method for HbA1c) probably fails to separate the glycated 1-β-chain of hemoglobin from glycated viral spikes. In this case, abnormally high HbA1c in COVID-19 patients with no DM-history may serve as a marker of severe viral erythrocyte damage rather than a marker for the glucose control. This hypothesis is confirmed by the prompt (in 6 weeks) normalization of HbA1c level following the virus elimination.","Shestakova, Marina V.; Kononenko, Irina Kalmykova Zilya Zheleznyakova Anna Mokrysheva Natalia",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-1002-p,502

We particularly focus on key-regulators, cell-receptors, and host-processes that are hijacked by the virus for its advantage. ACE2-controlled processes involve a key-regulator CD300e (a TYROBP receptor) and the activation of IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. We further investigate the age-dependency of such receptors and identify the adipose and the brain as potentially contributing tissues for the disease’s severity in old patients.

Materials and Methods: Between 15 March and 15 May 2020, patients hospitalized in Yozgat City Hospital with suspicion of Covid-19 were evaluated retrospectively. Chest CT findings were classified according to the modified COVID-19 reporting system created for this study. RT-PCR reference diagnostic test was accepted and the diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated. Results: A total of 498 patients [54±22 (0;96)] were included in the study. The number of male patients [323 (65%)] was higher than female [175 (35%)]. RT-PCR test was positive in 94 (19%) of the patients. Patients with positive test results were found to be younger than negative ones. Chest CT was positive in 173 (35%) patients: 13% COVID-19 typical findings, 7% high suspect findings, 15% low suspect findings. The sensitivity of CT was 49%, the specificity was 69%, and the sensitivity of RT-PCR was 69%. Infiltrations in CT positive cases were seen in the following areas: 52% in both lungs, 40% in all lobes, 34% in lower lobes, 47% in the posterior, 43% in the anterior and posterior lung regions, 60% in the peripheral, 30% peripheral and central lung regions. Conclusion: The sensitivity of chest CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was relatively low, but had high specificity. It may be more beneficial to use CT for rapid diagnosis in regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19.

Here, we establish the recently discovered pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral strategy. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating viral replication without causing toxicity in host cells. 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs using RNAi and other PDI small molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting additional identified protein targets of 147 may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of Dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.","Almasy, Katherine M.; Davies, Jonathan P.; Lisy, Samantha M.; Tirgar, Reyhaneh; Tran, Sirena C.; Plate, Lars",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.15.098624,502

It should be noted that predicting fatigue damage for structural components is a complex issue that needs various factors involved in fatigue analysis to be taken into account. This paper looked at available fatigue life prediction theories as a start which then helped formulate and develop the fatigue life prediction analysis used in this study. The predicted fatigue life was not off the mark as it also incorporated the effects of residual stresses which are usually disregarded in studies of this nature. The validity of the fatigue life prediction concept is shown with the aid of calculations versus actual fatigue data results. The results show fatigue life prediction that is stable and less erratic on certain irradiation parameters, while other formed components behaved in a predictable manner. Fatigue life prediction analysis is a challenging undertaking and the behavior of benchmarking components is explained and possible reasons for this elucidated.","Mjali, Kadephi Vuyolwethu",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314979,502

177765,Adopting Remote Teaching in the Time of Covid-19: Challenges and Opportunities,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures have disrupted global systems that support the health, food and nutrition security, and livelihoods of billions of people. These disruptions have likewise affected the small-scale fishery (SSF) sector, disrupting SSF supply chains and exposing weaknesses in the global seafood distribution system. To inform future development of adaptive capacity and resilience in the sector, it is important to understand how supply chain actors are responding in the face of a macroeconomic shock. Comparing across seven SSF case studies in four countries, we explore how actors are responding to COVID-19 disruptions, identify constraints to adaptive responses, and describe patterns of disruption and response across cases. In all cases examined, actors shifted focus to local and regional distribution channels and particularly drew on flexibility, organization, and learning to re-purpose pre-existing networks and use technology to their advantage. Key constraints to reaching domestic consumers included domestic restrictions on movement and labor, reduced spending power amongst domestic consumers, and lack of existing distribution channels. In addition, the lack of recognition of SSFs as essential food-producers and inequities in access to technology hampered efforts to continue local seafood supply. We suggest that the initial impacts from COVID-19 highlight the risks in of over-reliance on global trade networks. The SSFs that were able to change strategies most successfully had local organizations and connections in place that they leveraged in innovative ways. As such, supporting local and domestic networks and flexible organizations within the supply chain may help build resilience in the face of future macroeconomic shocks. Importantly, bolstering financial wellbeing and security within the domestic market both before and during such large-scale disruptions is crucial for supporting ongoing supply chain operations and continued food provision during macroeconomic crises.","Bassett, H.

Due to the rapid spread of the (Covid-19), various countries are facing a major health crisis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) an effective way to protect people from Covid-19 is to wear medical masks in public areas. It is very difficult to manually monitor people in public places and detect the face mask in the video. which is mainly because the mask itself acts as an obstruction to the face detection algorithm, because there are no face signs in the mask area. Therefore, automatic face mask detection system helps authorities to identify people who may be susceptible to infections disease. This research aims to use deep learning to automatically detect face masks in videos. The proposed framework consists of two components. The first component is designed for face detection and tracking using OpenCV and machine learning, and in the second component, these facial frames are then processed into our proposed deep transfer learning model MobileNetV2 to identify the mask area. The proposed framework was tested on different videos and images using the smartphone camera. The purpose is to achieve high-precision real-time detection and classification. The model achieved 99.2% accuracy during training and 99.8% validation accuracy. which is better than other recently proposed methods. Experimental results show that the work proposed in this paper can effectively recognize face masks with multiple targets and provide effective personnel surveillance.

178097,Quantitative assessment of changes in surface particulate matter concentrations and precursor emissions over China during the COVID-19 pandemic and their implications for Chinese economic activity,2021,"Purpose: While the COVID-19 virus has been spreading worldwide, some studies have related the pandemic with various aspects of accounting and therefore emphasized the importance of accounting research in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on society as a whole. Recent studies have looked into such an impact on various industries such as retail and agriculture. The current study aims at applying a sociological framework, sociology of worth (SOW), to the gaming industry in Macau, the largest operator of state-allowed gambling and entertainment in China, which will allow for its development during the COVID-19 pandemic to be charted. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the theory of SOW as a framework and collects data from various sources, such as the government, gaming operators and the public, to create timelines and SOW frameworks to analyze the impact of the virus on the gaming industry and the society as a whole. Findings: Detailed content analysis and the creation of different SOW matrices determined that the notion of a “lonely economy” during a time of a critical event may be ameliorated in the long term through compromises of the different worlds and actors of the SOW. Practical implications: Though largely theory-based, this study offers a thorough account of the COVID-19 incident for both the government and the gaming industry to reflect on and to consider new ways to fight against degrowth caused by disasters or crises. Social implications: The SOW framework divides society into different worlds of different worths. The current study shows how the worths of the different worlds are congruent during normal periods, and how cracks appear between them when a sudden crisis, such as COVID-19, occurs. The article serves as a social account of how these cracks are formed and how could they be resolved through compromise and reconstruction. Originality/value: This study is a first attempt to apply SOW to a controversial industry (gaming) while the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are ongoing. It offers a significant contribution to the social accounting literature through its consideration of the combination of unprecedented factors in a well-timed study that pays close attention to analyses and theoretical elaboration. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Noronha, C.; Guan, J.; Sio, S.

178445,Exploring compassionate managerial leadership style in reducing employee stress level during COVID-19 crisis: the case of Nigeria,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are key components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which maintains homeostasis of blood pressure, among other functions. ACE acts in a positive feedback loop, providing amplification, while ACE2, acting in a negative feedback loop, modulates the ACE action, providing stability and fine control. Certain demographic groups that are more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19-and once infected, to have more severe disease and higher mortality-have a deficiency of ACE2. ACE2 has recently been shown to be a major receptor by which SARS-CoV-2 enters cells. This entry process is associated with downregulation of ACE2. Thus, viral cell entry per se can interfere with the RAS feedback system. Viral penetration of cells using ACE2 can lead to a shift in the RAS from the usual “preventive” ACE2 axis to the “adverse” ACE axis of the feedback systems. This imbalance, with predominance of the adverse ACE axis, can lead to downstream actions of increased vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thrombosis. These, in turn, can affect end organs, initiating COVID-19-associated conditions such as cytokine storm, thrombosis, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This focused review highlights the importance of feedback systems in our understanding of the disruption of ACE2 feedback and resulting clinical consequences in COVID-19.","Salgo, M.

178599,"Identifying hidden Zika hotspots in Pernambuco, Brazil: A Spatial Analysis",2021-03-17,"The World Health Association and many governmental agencies recommend the wearing of facemasks by the general public to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is believed that masks can significantly protect others and may offer some protection to the wearer. Although there are standards for FFRs, surgical masks, and recently for barrier face coverings, they all indicate the level of protection for the wearer. However, testing facial masks not at the point of inhalation, but at the source, the exhale, offers a new perspective on how to impede particle emissions. In this paper, the experimental results show that, although the barrier face covering is less effective than FFRs or surgical masks, it can reduce the concentration of aerosols downstream of the device. The results on barrier efficiency show a rapid decrease in effectiveness when the face covering is not sealed to the head. The barrier efficiency of two of the barrier face coverings tested is strongly dependent on leakage caused by the fit rather than the material. While some materials certainly are more effective than others in inhibiting particle penetration, an even more profound factor is the amount of leakage emitted from a mask. New approaches to fit and design in order to create a seal against leakage will become an important factor in combatting SARS-CoV-2.","Bahloul, A.; Brochot, C.; Layne, B.",Health,https://doi.org/10.4236/health.2021.134035,502

Producing timely and accurate estimates of the impact of COVID-19 on mortality is challenging for most countries, but impossible for South Africa (SA) from cause-of-death statistics. Objectives. To quantify the excess deaths and likely magnitude of COVID-19 in SA in 2020 and draw conclusions on monitoring the epidemic in 2021. Methods. Basic details of deaths registered on the National Population Register by the Department of Home Affairs (Doha) are provided to the South African Medical Research Council weekly. Adjustments are made to the numbers of weekly deaths to account for non-registration on the population register, as well as late registration of death with the Doha. The weekly number of deaths is compared with the number predicted based on the Holt-Winters time-series analysis of past deaths for provinces and metropolitan areas. Excess deaths were calculated for all-causes deaths and natural deaths, using the predicted deaths as a baseline. In addition, an adjustment was made to the baseline for natural deaths to account for the drop in natural deaths due to lockdown. Results. We estimated that just over 550 000 deaths occurred among persons aged ≥1 year during 2020, 13% higher than the 485 000 predicted before the pandemic. A pronounced increase in weekly deaths from natural causes peaked in the middle of July across all ages except <20 years, and across all provinces with slightly different timing. During December, it became clear that SA was experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 that would exceed the death toll of the first wave. In 2020, there were 70 000 - 76 000 excess deaths from natural causes, depending on the base. Using the adjusted base, the excess death rate from natural causes was 122 per 100 000 population, with a male-to-female ratio of 0.78. Deaths from unnatural causes halved for both males and females during the stringent lockdown level 5. The numbers reverted towards the predicted number with some fluctuations as lockdown restrictions varied. Just under 5 000 unnatural deaths were averted. Conclusions. Tracking the weekly numbers of deaths in near to real time has provided important information about the spatiotemporal impact of the pandemic and highlights that the ~28 000 reported COVID-19 deaths during 2020 substantially understate the death toll from COVID-19. There is an urgent need to re-engineer the system of collecting and processing cause-of-death information so that it can be accessed in a timely way to inform public health actions.","Bradshaw, D.; Dorrington, R.

This study evaluated change in resting heart rate (RHR) determined by optical plethysmography and relationships to changes in other lifestyle health behaviors (sleep and activity). Methods: Data were obtained from N=197,988 Fitbit users who wore their heart-rate enabled Fitbit device to sleep and had detected sleep stages at least 10 days in the month of January, the baseline period;and synced their devices at least once in the last 10 days of April. In addition, potential participants needed to reside in one of 6 target cities: Chicago, Illinois;Houston, Texas;Los Angeles, California;San Francisco, California;New York City, New York;and Miami, Florida. Users who met these criteria were randomly selected. Daily RHR, sleep duration (minutes), sleep duration variability (standard deviation), bedtime, step count, and active minutes were estimated by the device. Differences between January (before the pandemic) and April (peak of stay-at-home orders) was computed. Correlations between change in RHR and change in other variables were evaluated, stratified by age and sex. Results: For all age groups, in both men and women, mean RHR declined from January to April by about 1bpm, with the highest reductions in the youngest adults (all p&lt;1x10-100 ). In general, acrossboth genders and all age groups, reductions in RHR were correlated with greater sleep duration, delaying bedtime, reduced sleep variability, and more active minutes. Steps were also associated in younger (but not older) adults. Results for ages 18-29 and &gt;=65 are displayed in the Table. Discussion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, RHR decreased robustly but very slightly. Reductionsin RHR were correlated with improvements in other health behaviors (sleep and activity). Causal relationships could not be evaluated, but future studies may explore whether even small changes in health behaviors can measurably impact population RHR.","Rezaei, N.; Grandner, M.

In this article, we make the case for the methodical potential of mobile messengers such as WhatsApp for qualitative mobile in situ research. We exemplify the productive use of the Mobile Instant Messaging Interview (MIMI), a research method developed by Kaufmann and Peil in 2020, to study participants' everyday life in real-time. Based on two case studies from geography and communication studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expound our experiences in the practical application of the MIMI approach and give recommendations. We conclude that MIMIs are a low-cost, easily feasible and short-term implemented approach for research interests across disciplines and possessing great potential for exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. They allow direct access to the practices and experiences of people in situ and in real-time that would otherwise stay hidden and inaccessible to social sciences. The method is suitable for research projects of any size, and can be applied as part of multi- and mixed methods designs and as well for longitudinal designs. Nonetheless, the MIMIs have to be well prepared, demand smart ways of nudging participants into elaborating their responses and require careful coordination between larger teams of researchers.

ENSO can be forecasted seasons ahead thanks to assorted climate precursors (local-Pacific processes, pantropical interactions). However, owing to observational data scarcity and bias-related issues in earth system models, little is known about the importance of these precursors for marine ecosystem prediction. With recently released reanalysis-nudged global marine ecosystem simulations, these constraints can be sidestepped, allowing full examination of tropical Pacific ecosystem predictability. By complementing historical fishing records with marine ecosystem model data, we show herein that equatorial Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) constitute a superlative predictability source for tropical Pacific marine yields, which can be forecasted over large-scale areas up to 2 years in advance. A detailed physical-biological mechanism is proposed whereby Atlantic SSTs modulate upwelling of nutrient-rich waters in the tropical Pacific, leading to a bottom-up propagation of the climate-related signal across the marine food web. Our results represent historical and near-future climate conditions and provide a useful springboard for implementing a marine ecosystem prediction system in the tropical Pacific.","Gómara, Iñigo; Rodríguez-Fonseca, Belén; Mohino, Elsa; Losada, Teresa; Polo, Irene; Coll, Marta",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431587,502

Activation of the Jak-Stat pathway by Interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) in lung epithelial cells is critical for innate immunity to respiratory viruses. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that transcriptional regulation by IFN-α/β required the formation of Interferon-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3) complex consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and Irf9 transcription factors. Furthermore, IFN α/β receptor activates multiple signal transduction pathways in parallel to the Jak-Stat pathway and induces several transcription factors at mRNA levels resulting in the secondary and tertiary rounds of transcription. Transcriptional factor profiling in the transcriptome and RNA analysis revealed that Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) was rapidly induced by IFN-α/β and Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in multiple cell types. Studies in mutant cell lines lacking components of the ISGF-3 complex revealed that IFN-β induction of Egr-1 was independent of Stat1, Stat2, or Irf9. Activation of the Mek/Erk-1/2 pathway was implicated in the rapid induction of Egr-1 by IFN-β in serum-starved mouse lung epithelial cells. Interrogation of multiple microarray datasets revealed that respiratory viruses including coronaviruses regulated Egr-1 expression in human lung cell lines. Furthermore, Egr-1 inducible genes including transcription factors, mediators of cell growth, and chemokines were differentially regulated in the human lung cell lines after coronavirus infection, and in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients. Rapid induction by interferons, TLR ligands, and respiratory viruses suggests a critical role for Egr-1 in antiviral response and inflammation with potential implications for human health and disease.","Ramana, Chilakamarti V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.244897,502

This study aims to systematically review the evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of intrauterine mother to fetus transmission. Literature searches were performed in the WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar for SARS-CoV-2 using keywords and associated synonyms, search date up to 20 December 2020, no language restrictions. Results We included 106 studies assessing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their neonates: these studies comprised 40 reviews (21 fulfilled systematic review methodology, including risk of bias assessment of included studies) and 66 primary studies including 32 case reports (of up to two cases) and 34 prospective and retrospective cohort studies, prospective and retrospective case series, observational studies (including asymptomatic screening), database studies and a quality improvement project. Almost all were conducted in a hospital setting. The 32 case reports were considered to be at high risk of bias, due to the study design; across the 34 remaining primary studies, risk of bias was low to moderate. Sixteen case reports examined vertical transmission, which was not related to maternal symptomatology. For the cohort and case series studies, the percentage of positive neonates ranged from 0% to 22% across the studies. Twenty studies reported no positive vertical transmission. Three studies that reported the highest positivity rates of 11%, 15% and 22% had specifically selected neonates with a positive test (within up to 35 days) within the study population and were therefore more selective populations. Across the cohort and case series studies there were 65/2391 (2.7%) neonates born to mothers with a diagnosis of COVID-19 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 24 hours of birth. No evidence correlated maternal symptomatology to vertical transmission. Mode of delivery did not correlate with rates of vertical transmission. Of 25 studies, 7 identified SARS-CoV-2 in placental tissue; some of these did not demonstrate vertical transmission to the neonate. No study reported the results of viral culture to detect SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The results of these studies indicate that vertical transmission is possible, but is not frequent, and factors that influence when vertical transmission occurs are unknown. Further studies using standardised methods to establish viral infection are needed to establish vertical transmission rates and to assess clinical and other conditions affecting transmission.","Pluddemann, A.; Spencer, E.

Healthcare professionals have repeatedly performed laboratory tests to get the right results to patients, such as, check the chest CT images of the patient's lungs. This is an essential role in clinical treatment and teaching task. In this paper, we tried to classify chest CT image of Covid-19 patient. CNN produce spatial characteristic from images so it very expeditious way for image classification problem. Three techniques are evaluated through experiments. The results of the experiments show the test set has 1119 Covid-19 chest CT images and 446 normal chest CT images. The experiment results represent that our offer model delivered the highest accuracy score of 97.57% among the other models, Inception ResNet-V2 and Inception-V3.","Sari, I.

However, this is often administered with a bulky system that may cause signal distortions and discomfort for animals. We develop an integrated bioelectronic sensing system to provide simultaneous ECG and EEG assessment in real-time under chemical exposure for Xenopus laevis. The microelectrode array (MEA) membrane with integrated ECG and EEG sensing offers an opportunity to achieve multichannel noninvasive electrophysiological monitoring with favorable dimensions and spatial resolution. To validate the performance of our system, we assessed the ECG and EEG of Xenopus under exposure of Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), an epilepsy-inducing drug. Effects of PTZ were detected with clear ECG and EEG alterations, including frequent ictal and interictal EEG events, 30 dB average EEG amplitude elevations, abnormal ECG morphology, and heart rate changes. Overall, our Xenopus-based real-time electrophysiology monitoring system holds high potential for many applications in drug screening and remote environmental toxicity monitoring.","Xia, Xing; Zhang, Jimmy; Vishwanath, Manoj; Sarafan, Sadaf; Torres, Ramses Seferino Trigo; Le, Tai; Lau, Michael P.H.; Nguyen, Anh H.; Cao, Hung",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459337,502

Biological treatment strategies in real life aim to reduce patients' symptoms and different HRQL parameters would share the same behavior as patients' symptoms and disease activity. Objectives: We aim to assess the differences in HRQL reported by spondyloarthropathy patients during the first six months of biological therapy according to the treatment effectiveness. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study of six months of follow-up in spondyloarthropathy patients who are newly on biological therapy. A basal visit and 1, 3 and 6 months follow-up visits were conducted. We analyzed changes during follow-up in the HRQL parameters reported by patients through AsqoL and ASAS-health-index questionnaires. Moreover we measured functional disability through HAQ and BASFI index, disease activity by BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP and ASDAS-ESR index. Statistical analyses were achieved using R software, through multivariate linear regression models for continuous data and Bayesian mixed ordinal regression models with monotonic effect for ordinal data. The corresponding odd ratios (OR) were calculated with their confidence intervals (CI 95%). Results: We included 53 patients (71.77% male), the 73.58% diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and the 26.42% with axial spondyloarthritis. Mean age at the beginning of treatment was 48.74 (11.21) years, mean age at diagnosis was 41.57 (11.97) and mean disease evolution was 7.19 (9.24) years. 60.42% of them exhibited HLAb27 positivity. 34 patients started biological therapy with TNF-α inhibitors and 19 with IL-17 inhibitors. The 81.13% of patients were under monotherapy, and the other 18.87% was treated with DMARDs. The 77.36% of the total number of patients was on the biological therapy at 6 months of follow-up, while the 22.64% discontinued at 6 months of follow-up (9 due to inefficacy and 3 due to adverse effects). 42 patients completed the follow-up at 6 months, and 3 patients achieved until visit 3 due to treatment failure. In 1 case visit 1 and in 7 cases visit 3 could not be performed due to COVID19 pandemic situation. We observed a significant correlation among AsqoL and ASAS-hi values with disease activity indexes (BASDAI, ASDAS-CRP, ASDAS-ESR) and functional disability (HAQ, BASFI). The statistical analyses showed a significant association where AsqoL and ASAS-hi values are significantly decreased in treatment failures compared to the successful treatment (, and in patients with previous biological therapy compared to naïve patients. No effect of years of disease evolution and the type of biological treatment in the AsqoL and ASAS-hi values was observed. (See Table 1) These results were consistent with the significant association found among the disease activity and functional disability with the biological therapy efficacy and the previous biological treatment. Conclusion: The AsqoL and ASAS-hi questionnaire results are correlated with disease activity and functional disability and showed the same behaviour as these parameters, being also associated to the biological therapy efficacy as well as to previous biological therapies. The HRQL variables would be additional clinical results that make it possible to achieve a better management of biological therapies in spondyloarthropathy patients.","Grau García, E.; De La Rubia Navarro, M.; Pávez Perales, C.; Leal Rodriguez, S.; Riesco Barcena, C.; Huaylla Quispe, A.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper responds to calls for “best practice” on how trade unions may react to member voting threshold requirements of the Trade Union Act 2016 (the Act). A broader aim is to make a theoretical contribution related to trade union organising and tactics in “get the vote out” (GTVO) industrial action organising campaigns. Findings: Findings are presented as a lead organiser's first-hand account of a successful GTVO campaign contextualised in relation to theories of organising. The findings offer “best practice” for union organisers required to beat the Act's voting thresholds and also contribute to theories surrounding trade union organising tactics. Research limitations/implications: Further development and adaptation of the proposed model may be required when applied to larger bargaining units and different organising contexts. Practical implications: The findings can inform the organising practices/tactics of trade unions in relation to statutory ballots. The findings also allow Human Resource (HR) practitioners to reflect on their approach to dealing with unions capable of mounting successful GTVO campaigns. Social implications: The findings have the potential to collectively empower workers, via their trade unions, to defend and further their interests in a post-financial crisis context and in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first known empirical account of organising to exceed voting thresholds of the Act, providing practical steps for union organisers in planning for statutory ballots. Further value lies in the paper's use of a novel first-hand account of a GTVO campaign, offering a new and first, theoretical model of organising tactics to beat the Act. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Richards, J.; Ellis, V.",Personnel Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/pr-10-2020-0756,502

Current high-throughput technologies for detecting PAIs, such as promoter capture Hi-C, are often limited in sample size due to the complexity of the experiments. Here, we present an analytical approach that uses summary-level data from DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait locus (mQTL) studies to predict PAIs. Using mQTL data from human peripheral blood (n=1,980), we predicted 34,797 PAIs which showed strong overlap with the chromatin contacts identified by experimental assays. The promoter-interacting DNAm sites were enriched in enhancers or near expression QTLs. Genes whose promoters were involved in PAIs were more actively expressed, and gene pairs with promoter-promoter interactions were enriched for co-expression. Integration of the predicted PAIs with GWAS data highlighted interactions among 601 DNAm sites associated with 15 complex traits. This study demonstrates the use of mQTL data to predict PAIs and provide insights into the role of PAIs in complex trait variation.","Wu, Yang; Qi, Ting; Wang, Huanwei; Zhang, Futao; Zheng, Zhili; Phillips-Cremins, Jennifer E.; Deary, Ian J.; McRae, Allan F.; Wray, Naomi R.; Zeng, Jian; Yang, Jian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/580993,502

181427,A socio-technical transitions perspective for assessing future sustainability following the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"A growing body of evidence suggests that natural populations can evolve to better tolerate the novel environmental conditions associated with urban areas. Invariably, studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas examine only one or a few traits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats. Thus, whether urbanization is driving divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of urbanization remains unclear. To address this gap, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, and grew them up to measure multiple phenotypic traits in a common garden. Overall, urban populations had later phenology and germination, larger flowers, thinner stolons, reduced cyanogenesis, greater biomass, and were more attractive to pollinators. Pollinator observations revealed near complete turnover between urban and nonurban sites, which may explain some of the observed divergence in floral traits and phenology. Our results suggest that adaptation to urban environments involves multiple organismal traits.","Santangelo, James S.; Advenard, Carole; Rivkin, L.

181520,Preventive Measures to Conquest COVID-19: A Mini-review,2021,"Non-residential buildings contribute to around 20% of the total energy consumed in Europe. This consumption continues to increase globally. Smart building proposals (focused on Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB), air quality monitoring, energy saving with thermal comfort, etc.) were already necessary before 2020, and the pandemic has made this research and development area more essential. Furthermore, the need to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and obtain technological solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires holistic contributions through real installations that serve as spaces for measuring, testing, study and research. This article proposes a “measure–analyse–decide and act” methodology to quantify the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) for university buildings as a reference environment for energy efficiency and COVID-19 prevention models. Two conceptual spaces (physical and digital) within two dimensions (users and infrastructures) are designated over an IoT three-level model (information acquisition, interoperable communication, and data-driven decision). An IoT ecosystem (sensoriZAR) was implemented as a proof-of-concept of a smart campus at the University of Zaragoza, Spain. Focused on CO2 and energy consumption monitoring, the results showed effectiveness through real installations, demonstrating the IoT potential as SDG-enabling technologies. These contributions allow not only experimental lab tests (from the authors’ expertise in several specialties of Industrial, Mechanical, Design, Thermal, Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering) but also a reference model for direct application in academic works, research projects and institutional initiatives, extendable to professional environments, buildings and cities. © 2021 by the authors.

We sought to describe their natural history in previously hospitalised patients, compare this with controls, and assess the relationship between symptoms and cardiopulmonary impairment at 6 months post-COVID-19. Methods Fifty-eight patients and thirty matched controls underwent symptom-questionnaires, cardiac and lung magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and spirometry at 3 months following COVID-19. Of them, forty-six patients returned for follow-up assessments at 6 months. Findings At 2-3 months, 83% of patients had at least one cardiopulmonary symptom versus 33% of controls. Patients and controls had comparable biventricular volumes and function. Native cardiac T1 (marker of inflammation) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE, marker of focal fibrosis) were increased in patients. Sixty percent of patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on CMR and 55% had reduced peak oxygen consumption (pVO2) on CPET. By 6 months, 53% of patients remained symptomatic. On CMR, indexed right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (-4.3 mls/m2, P=0.005) decreased and RV ejection fraction (+3.2%, P=0.0003) increased. Native T1 and LGE improved and was comparable to controls. Lung parenchymal abnormalities and peak VO2, although better, were abnormal in patients versus controls. 31% had reduced pVO2 secondary to fatigue and submaximal tests. Cardiopulmonary symptoms in patients did not associate with CMR, lung function, or CPET measures. Interpretation In patients, cardiopulmonary abnormalities improve over time, though some measures remain abnormal relative to controls. Persistent symptoms at 6 months post-COVID-19 did not associate with objective measures of cardiopulmonary health.

Suppose we can electronically control it using Si nanotechnology, named e-POCT. Following the concept of IoT sensors, we can expect that a plenty of deployed e-POCTs may retrieve digital data about where, when, how much, and which virus is being spread. The collected digital data (to be BigData) can be analyzed by AI machines to optimize the global distribution of medical resources. The core technology for e-POCT must be an electronic biosensing. It is composed of a controlling system to selectively collect biomolecules (specific to targeted virus) in specimen solutions, oxide films (or membranes, polymers) to adhere specific biomolecules, and a sensing system to convert the adhered biomolecules to electrical signals. The efficiencies and reliabilities of the components are critical to the performance of the virus sensing. The performance can be characterized by the Limit-of-Detection (LoD) and detection time.

Specifically, the study attempts to find out whether universities are prepared for online assessment during the lockdown and to probe feasible solutions to the challenges that hinder proper assessment in a virtual learning environment (VLE). As the challenges are determined, the study suggests a number of practical solutions. Data on faculty's observations were obtained by means of an online survey. Eighty-three faculty members participated in this study. The findings showed that universities swiftly shifted to e-classes during the lockdown but that they were not adequately primed for an appropriate assessment in an online environment. The findings further showed that instructors were skeptical about the efficiency of remote assessment of their students. In addition, faculty members believed there was still a long way to go with regards to (1) the unavailability of reliable software to preclude academic dishonesty;(2) some faculty being unable to assess their students in VLE as it was their first experience;and (3) formative assessment not having been given enough attention. It is concluded that universities should have an exigency strategy for any sudden future lockdowns. This strategy includes, among other things, intensive e-teaching and e-testing training for faculty, high-tech invigilation and plagiarism software, reliable e-learning platforms with sufficient Internet bandwidth, setting up an e-assessment council at the university level.","Sa'di, R.

183850,Improving patient flow through a better discharge process.,2012,"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions including to health services. In the early response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services. MethodsWe used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021 with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics. ResultsMaintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000 clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19 - 146 discounted deaths per 10,000 clients. DiscussionWhile there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Stover, John; Kelly, Sherrie L; Mudimu, Edinah; Green, Dylan; Smith, Tyler; Taramusi, Issac; Bansi-Matharu, Loveleen; Martin-Hughes, Rowan; Phillips, Andrew N; Bershteyn, Anna",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252663,502

Methods: We conducted a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT), with the Immediate Group receiving the intervention while the Delay Group served as a three-month waitlist-control. A separate cohort living beyond commuting distance was trained by their parents with guidance from physical therapists. Participants were 8 months to 3 years old, with MRI-confirmed perinatal ischemic stroke and early signs of hemiparesis. The intervention was play-based, focused on weight-bearing, balance and walking for 1 hour/day, 4 days/week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). Secondary outcomes included steps and gait analyses. Final follow-up occurred at age four. Results: Thirty-four children participated (25 RCT, 9 Parent-trained). The improvement in GMFM-66 over 12 weeks was greater for the Immediate than the Delay Group (average change 3.4 units higher) and greater in younger children. Average step counts reached 1370-3750 steps/session in the last week of training for all children. Parent-trained children also improved but with greater variability.

196812,[Ethical decision-making framework for the allocation of scarce mechanical ventilators during the COVID-19 crisis].,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery are generally mechanically ventilated postoperatively. Early postoperative extubation is currently recommended in anesthesia guidelines. No current technology can accurately, non-invasively, measure respiratory competence after extubation. Pulse oximetry has been helpful, but this is a late indicator of respiratory compromise. A novel, non-invasive, respiratory volume monitor (RVM) has been shown to deliver accurate continuous, real-time minute ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and respiratory rate (RR) measurements and provide an objective measure of respiratory competence. The RVM will accurately reflect MV, TV and RR in cardiac surgery patients before and after extubation. METHODS RVM traces were recorded from patients before and after cardiac surgery. Continuous monitoring began on admission to the unit and was ended at 24 h after extubation. RVM-based MV, TV and RR were calculated from 30-s segments. MV, TV and RR were also continuously recorded from the ventilator prior to extubation. The RVM was calibrated to each patient using the readings from the ventilator. RESULTS During mechanical ventilation, the RVM measured TVs strongly correlated with the ventilator TVs (r = 0.97). Following extubation, the patient's breathing became more erratic and TVs and MVs decreased. Within 1 h, all patients studied showed a marked recovery of MV and TV. CONCLUSIONS RVM-based MV, TV and RR correlated well with similar data collected from ventilators. After extubation, RVM shows promise as a means to monitor respiratory competence of non-intubated patients, and has implications for use in other settings and improving patient safety.","Ianchulev, Stephan; Ladd, Diane; MacNabb, C Marshall; Qin, Lizeng; Marengi, Nathan; Freeman, Jenny",Journal of clinical medicine research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924170/,502
198904,Visualizing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Children: What We Learn from Patients at Wuhan Children's Hospital,2020,"The inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats with differing susceptibility to demyelinating encephalitis induced by coronavirus MHV4 was characterized. Topographical maps showing the arrangement of infiltrating lymphocyte subsets in virus-infected tissue were developed by digital-image processing of immunohistologically stained CNS sections. The kinetics of the inflammatory process was evaluated by flow-cytometry on lymphocytes isolated from the CNS. Cumulative data obtained with these two techniques demonstrated the following features. In susceptible Lewis (LE) rats, viral antigens were disseminated throughout the CNS, including spinal cord. Onset as well as recovery from neurological disease was associated with a steep rise of infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which localized in close contact to virus-infected cells. Accompanying convalescence was a slight increase in B(OX33+) cells in the CNS and the accumulation of immunoglobulin-containing cells in the centre of virus-infected areas. In clinically resistant Brown Norway (BN) rats, virus-infected cells were mainly restricted to small periventricular foci and the extent of lymphocyte infiltration was never as high as that found at any time during the course of infection in LE rats. There were striking differences in the CD8+ T-cell population compared to LE rats. Cells of this phenotype were identified in virus-affected areas of BN rats only early after infection, and their infiltration profile revealed much lower quantities than in the CNS of susceptible LE rats. Although the population dynamics of B(OX33+) lymphocytes were comparable in BN and LE rats, as determined by flow-cytometry, less immunoglobulin-containing B cells were detected in virus-infected areas of BN rats.","Dörries, R; Schwender, S; Imrich, H; Harms, H",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1663079/,502

200062,Mediative fuzzy logic mathematical model: A contradictory management prediction in COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus infections of rodents can cause diseases of the central nervous system characterised by inflammatory demyelination. The lesions mimick in many aspects the pathology of multiple sclerosis in humans and of other neurological diseases. As an animal model for demyelination, we studied the MHV-JHM induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats. The pathomorphological analysis revealed patterns of lesions which developed in stages. Infected oligodendrocytes were first destroyed by necrosis. Later stages were characterized by demyelinated plaques. In the center of plaques, no virus antigen was found and oligodendrocytes were mainly destroyed by apoptosis. At the edge of plaques, virus antigen was expressed in parallel to infiltrations consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages. The prevailing mechanisms leading to demyelination may change individually and during defined stages of the disease. The transcriptional expression of chemoattractants and other mediators of inflammation was studied by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Virus induced inflammatory demyelination was accompanied by high expression of a relatively novel cytokine, the endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II). By immunocytochemistry, EMAP II was detected in parenchymal microglia located both within the lesions and in unaffected areas. Furthermore, the level of transcriptional expression of the regulatory calcium binding S100 proteins MRP8, MRP14 and CP10 was associated with inflammatory demyelination and expression of IFN gamma, IL-2, TNF alpha, and iNOS.","Wege, H; Schluesener, H; Meyermann, R; Barac-Latas, V; Suchanek, G; Lassmann, H",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782312/,502

200472,Global Analysis of Accountability for Fake News Spread About the Covid-19 Pandemic in Social Media,2020,"The article focuses on the fact that 2020 has become a new point in the history of mankind, irrevocably changing the ways of life accepted in society and forcing the entire population of the earth to live in a new way. If a person's health is threatened and / or worried about the thought of a terminal illness, it is difficult to focus on something else. Over the past year, many have experienced this reality for the first time. Effective January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus outbreak a health emergency, causing international concern. The fact that some countries (New Zealand, Australia and South Korea) quickly contained the spread of the virus, but faced new, imported cases, leads to the conclusion that the victory over COVID-19 is possible only worldwide. And if in 2020 masks and social distancing were the methods of fighting the virus, then the main method of 2021 will be the vaccination of the inhabitants of the earth. However, here, too, the key factor is the scale of vaccination, which is one of the main factors in the effectiveness of the fight against any large-scale disease. Here, every person faces a moral and legal question: participation in vaccination is the right of every person as a bearer of human dignity, which implies the impossibility of taking any action on a person without his consent, or the duty of a member of society, which implies the need for vaccination as the question of the survival of the human race as a whole. The article draws attention to the refusal to vaccinate against measles in Ukraine and the consequences of such a choice. The reason for the lack of measles vaccination at the required epidemiological level in Ukraine is not the lack of the necessary vaccines, but the conscious choice of a negative model of behavior by the citizens of the country. The refusal to vaccinate children may be due to a psychological factor caused by the death of a student who was vaccinated against measles on the eve of death. At the same time, the media thirteen years after the event, conducting numerous medical examinations, provides fundamentally contradictory information about the causal relationship between the vaccination of a student against measles and his death. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes caused by viruses. Despite this vaccination coverage against viral infections, seasonal influenza in many countries around the world remains low. Even if a vaccine is available to the citizens of a particular country, but educational programs are not carried out on the need and importance of vaccination, the potential for increasing vaccination rates against viruses will continually diminish. The most common explanation for the current upsurge in vaccine uncertainty is that the Internet enables vaccine deniers to reach out to a wide audience by publicizing their beliefs. Some activists only criticize some vaccines. Such a selective stance may indicate a communication strategy used to promote a particular vaccine. Attention should also be paid to the refusal to vaccinate due to the lack of acceptance by the human mind of traditional medicine, not belief in its effectiveness, the use of alternative, alternative medicine in the treatment of diseases. The reasons for not trusting the vaccination process are highlighted. These include: lack of trust in vaccine manufacturers who are economically motivated to make a profit; not trusting medical institutions that provide vaccinations and the conditions in which vaccines are stored; lack of confidence in government agencies involved in the procurement of vaccines, the possibility of corruption in case of abuse of their powers; fear of disease and side effects due to vaccination; distortion by the media of objective data on vaccination.","Mernyk, A; Yaroshenko, O; Inshyn, M; Lukianov, D; Hyliaka, O",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365440/,502

Achieving these two aims requires the consideration of unpalatable measures. Julian Savulescu and James Cameron argue that mandatory isolation of the elderly is justified under these circumstances, as they are at increased risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19, and are thus likely to put disproportionate strain on limited healthcare resources. However, their arguments for this strategy are contingent on the lack of viable alternatives. We suggest that there is a possible alternative: a mandatory, centralised contact-tracing app. We argue that this strategy is ethically preferable to the selective isolation of the elderly, because it does not target members of a certain group, relying instead on the movements of each individual, and because it avoids the extended isolation of certain members of the society. Although this type of contact-tracing app has its drawbacks, we contend that this measure warrants serious consideration.","White, Lucie; van Basshuysen, Philippe",J Med Ethics,,502

However, movement disorders in the setting of 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) have been a strikingly less discussed topic. Objectives: To summarize available pieces of evidence documenting de novo movement disorders in COVID-19. Methods: We used the existing PRISMA consensus statement. Data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to the 29th January, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies. Results: Twenty-two articles were selected for the qualitative synthesis. Among these, a total of 52 patients with de novo movement disorders were reported. Most of these had myoclonus, ataxia, tremor or a combination of these, while three had parkinsonism and one a functional disorder. In general, they were managed successfully by intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids. Some cases, primarily with myoclonus, could be ascribed to medication exposures, metabolic disturbances or severe hypoxia, meanwhile others to a post-or para-infectious immune-mediated mechanism. SARS-CoV-2 could also invade the central nervous system, through vascular or retrograde axonal pathways, and cause movement disorders by two primary mechanisms. Firstly, through the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, resulting in the imbalance of dopamine and norepinephrine; and secondly, the virus could cause cellular vacuolation, demyelination and gliosis, leading to encephalitis and associated movement disorders. Conclusion: De novo movement disorders are scantly reported in COVID-19. The links between SARS-CoV-2 and movement disorders are not yet established. However, we should closely monitor COVID-19 survivors for the possibility of post-COVID movement disorders.","Ghosh, Ritwik; Biswas, Uttam; Roy, Dipayan; Pandit, Alak; Lahiri, Durjoy; Ray, Biman Kanti; Benito-León, Julián",,,502

Therapies to prevent or treat COVID-19, including antiviral drug and several vaccines, are still being development. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressing in lung, has been confirmed to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 infection, interventions for attachment of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 may be a potential approach to prevent viral infections and it is considered as a potential target for drug development. In this study, we observed that seabuckthorn and its flavonoid compounds quercetin and isorhamnetin were shown strong retention to ACE2 overexpression HEK293 (ACE2h ) cells by CMC analysis. Based on drug receptor interaction analysis and viral entry studies in vitro, we evaluated the interaction of two flavonoid compounds and ACE2 as well as the inhibitory effect of the two compounds on viral entry. Surface plasmon resonance assay proved the effect that isorhamnetin bound to the ACE2, and its affinity (KD value) was at the micromolar level, that was, 2.51 ± 0.68 µM. Viral entry studies in vitro indicated that isorhamnetin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus entering ACE2h cells. Based on promising in vitro results, we proposed isorhamnetin to be a potential therapeutic candidate compound against COVID-19.","Zhan, Yingzhuan; Ta, Wenjing; Tang, Wenjuan; Hua, Ruochen; Wang, Jue; Wang, Cheng; Lu, Wen",Drug dev. res,,502

However, the potential bioaccumulation of microplastics by plants and their effects on plants' physiology remains unexplored. Here, we evaluated the adsorption, potential uptake, and physiological effects of polyethylene (PE) microbeads in an experimental hydroponic culture of maize. Using isotope analysis, taking advantage of the different carbon isotope composition (Î´13C) of fossil-derived PE and C4 plants (e.g., maize), we estimated that about 30% of the carbon in the rhizosphere of microplastic-exposed plants was derived from PE. Still, we did not find evidence of PE translocation to the shoots. Plastic bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere caused a significant decline in transpiration, nitrogen content, and growth. Our results indicate that plastic particles may accumulate in the rhizosphere, impairing water and nutrient uptake, and eventually reaching root eaters. Due to the implications for food production and livestock feeding, our findings encourage further research on the mechanism leading to the bioaccumulation of microplastics on the surface of belowground tissues.","Urbina, Mauricio A; Correa, Francisco; Aburto, Felipe; Ferrio, Juan Pedro",Sci Total Environ,,502

Although increases in stress-related symptomatology and other adverse psycho-social outcomes, as well as their most important risk factors have been described, hardly anything is known about potential protective factors. Resilience refers to the maintenance of mental health despite adversity. To gain mechanistic insights about the relationship between described psycho-social resilience factors and resilience specifically in the current crisis, we assessed resilience factors, exposure to Corona crisis-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms in a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 24 languages during the most intense phase of the lockdown in Europe (22 March to 19 April) in a convenience sample of N = 15,970 adults. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (p < 0.0001). The resilience factor PAS also partly mediated the positive association between perceived social support and resilience, and its association with resilience was in turn partly mediated by the ability to easily recover from stress (both p < 0.0001). In comparison with other resilience factors, good stress response recovery and positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis were the strongest factors. Preregistered exploratory subgroup analyses (osf.io/thka9) showed that all tested resilience factors generalize across major socio-demographic categories. This research identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted by public mental health efforts in this and in future pandemics.","Veer, Ilya M; Riepenhausen, Antje; Zerban, Matthias; Wackerhagen, Carolin; Puhlmann, Lara M C; Engen, Haakon; Köber, Göran; Bögemann, Sophie A; Weermeijer, Jeroen; Uscilko, Aleksandra; Mor, Netali; Marciniak, Marta A; Askelund, Adrian Dahl; Al-Kamel, Abbas; Ayash, Sarah; Barsuola, Giulia; Bartkute-Norkuniene, Vaida; Battaglia, Simone; Bobko, Yaryna; Bölte, Sven; Cardone, Paolo; Chvojková, Edita; Damnjanovic, Kaja; De Calheiros Velozo, Joana; de Thurah, Lena; Deza-Araujo, Yacila I; Dimitrov, Annika; Farkas, Kinga; Feller, Clémence; Gazea, Mary; Gilan, Donya; Gnjidic, Vedrana; Hajduk, Michal; Hiekkaranta, Anu P; Hofgaard, Live S; Ilen, Laura; Kasanova, Zuzana; Khanpour, Mohsen; Lau, Bobo Hi Po; Lenferink, Dionne B; Lindhardt, Thomas B; Magas, Dávid Á; Mituniewicz, Julian; Moreno-López, Laura; Muzychka, Sofiia; Ntafouli, Maria; O039,; Leary, Aet; Paparella, Ilenia; Põldver, Nele; Rintala, Aki",Transl Psychiatry,,502

205972,Public–Private Collaboration Led by Private Organizations in Combating Crises: Evidence From China’s Fighting Against COVID-19,2021,"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the center of what has become a public health crisis. While the virus is well-known for its trademark effects on respiratory function, neurological damage has been reported to affect a considerable proportion of severe cases. To characterize the neuro-invasive potential of this disease, a contemporary review of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae was conducted using the limited, but growing, literature that is available. These neurological squeal are based on the manifestations that the virus has on normal central and peripheral nervous system function. The authors present the virology of the SARS-CoV-2 agent by analyzing its classification as an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. A comprehensive timeline is then presented, indicating the progression of the disease as a public health threat. Furthermore, underlying chronic neurological conditions potentially lead to more adverse cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. The CNS may also be susceptible to an immune response where a “cytokine storm” can manifest into neural injury. Histological evidence is provided, while symptoms such as headache and vertigo are highlighted as CNS manifestations of COVID-19. Treatment of these symptoms is addressed with paracetamol being recommended as a possible, but not conclusive, treatment to some CNS symptoms. The authors then discuss the peripheral nervous system sequelae and COVID's impact on causing chemosensory dysfunction starting with viral attack on olfactory sensory neurons and cells types within the lining of the nose. Histological evidence is also provided while symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia are characterized as PNS manifestations. Possible treatment options for these symptoms are then addressed as a major limitation, as anecdotal, and not conclusive evidence can be made. Finally, preventive measures of the neurological sequelae are addressed using a multidirectional approach. Postmortem examinations of the brains of COVID-19 patients are suggested as being a possible key to formulating new understandings of its neuropathology. Lastly, the authors suggest a more comprehensive neurological follow-up of recovered patients, in order to better characterize the neurological sequelae of this illness.","Fiani, Brian; Covarrubias, Claudia; Desai, Aditi; Sekhon, Manraj; Jarrah, Ryan",Front.

206279,Challenges and practices on waste management and disposal during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"While almost any kind of face mask offers some protection against particles and pathogens of different sizes, the most efficient ones make use of a layered structure where one or more layers are electrically charged. These electret layers are essential for the efficient filtration of difficult-to-capture small particles, yet the exact nature of electrostatic capture with respect to the charge on both the particles and the electret fibres as well as the effect of the immediate environment remain unclear. Here, we explore in detail the electrostatic interactions between the surface of a single charged electret fibre and a model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics coupled to a detailed spike protein charge regulation model, we show how pH and salt concentration drastically change both the scale and the sign of the interaction. Furthermore, the configuration of the few spike proteins closest to the electret fibre turns out to be as important for the strength of the interaction as their total number on the virus envelope, a direct consequence of spike protein charge regulation. The results of our work elucidate the details of virus electrostatics and contribute to the general understanding of efficient virus filtration mechanisms.","Javidpour, Leili; BoZic, AnZe; Naji, Ali; Podgornik, Rudolf",Soft Matter,,502

Development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for autonomous deployment and recovery of sensor probes for sample caching is already in progress with NASA's MARS 2020 mission. To challenge student teams to develop autonomy for sample recovery settings, the 2020 NSF CPS Challenge was positioned around the launch of the MARS 2020 rover and sUAS duo. This paper discusses perception and trajectory planning for sample recovery by sUAS in a simulation environment. Out of a total of five teams that participated, the results of the top two teams have been discussed. The OpenUAV cloud simulation framework deployed on the Cyber-Physical Systems Virtual Organization (CPS-VO) allowed the teams to work remotely over a month during the COVID-19 pandemic to develop and simulate autonomous exploration algorithms. Remote simulation enabled teams across the globe to collaborate in experiments. The two teams approached the task of probe search, probe recovery, and landing on a moving target differently. This paper is a summary of teams' insights and lessons learned, as they chose from a wide range of perception sensors and algorithms.","Mick, Darwin; Siddarth, K.

ObjectiveTo develop a decision support tool that assists college administrators in designing and evaluating customized COVID vaccination, screening, and prevention plans. DesignDecision analysis linked to a compartmental epidemic model, quantifying the interaction of policy instruments (e.g., vaccination promotion, asymptomatic testing, physical distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions), institutional priorities (e.g., risk tolerance, desire to resume activities), and assumptions about vaccine performance and background epidemic severity. ParticipantsHypothetical cohort of 5000 individuals (students, faculty, and staff) living and working in the close environs of a residential college campus. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Cumulative infections over a 120-day semester. ResultsUnder Base Case assumptions, if 90% coverage with an 85%-effective vaccine can be attained, the model finds that campus activities can be fully resumed while holding cumulative cases below 5% of the population without the need for routine, asymptomatic testing. With 50% population coverage using such a vaccine, a similar ""return to normalcy"" would require daily asymptomatic testing of unvaccinated individuals. The effectiveness of vaccination in reducing susceptibility to infection is a critical uncertainty. Conclusions & RelevanceVaccination coverage is the most powerful tool available to college administrators to achieve a safe return to pre-pandemic operations this fall. Given the breadth of potential outcomes in the face of uncontrollable and uncertain factors, even colleges that achieve high vaccination coverage should be prepared to reinstitute testing and distancing policies on short notice.","Paltiel, A David; Schwartz, Jason L",,,502

209263,Positive Youth Development Through Leisure: Confronting the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems in an unprecedented way by imposing new demands on health care resources and scientific knowledge. There has also been an exceedingly fast accumulation of new information on this novel virus. As the traditional peer-review process takes time, there is currently a significant gap between the ability to generate new data and the ability to critically evaluate them. This problem of an excess of mixed-quality data, or infodemic, is echoing throughout the scientific community. APPROACH: The authors aimed to help their colleagues at the Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, manage the COVID-19 infodemic with a methodologic solution: establishing an in-house mechanism for continuous literature review and knowledge distribution (March-April 2020). Their methodology included the following building blocks: a dedicated literature review team, artificial intelligence-based research algorithms, brief written updates in a graphical format, large-scale webinars and online meetings, and a feedback loop. OUTCOMES: During the first month (April 2020), the project produced 21 graphical updates. After consideration of feedback from colleagues and final editing, 13 graphical updates were uploaded to the center's website; of these, 31% addressed the clinical presentation of the disease and 38% referred to specific treatments. This methodology as well as the graphical updates it generated were adopted by the Israeli Ministry of Health and distributed in a hospital preparation kit. NEXT STEPS: The authors believe they have established a novel methodology that can assist in the battle against COVID-19 by making high-quality scientific data more accessible to clinicians. In the future, they expect this methodology to create a favorable uniform standard for evidence-guided health care during infodemics. Further evolution of the methodology may include evaluation of its long-term sustainability and impact on the day-to-day clinical practice and self-confidence of clinicians who treat COVID-19 patients.","Gruber, Amit; Ghiringhelli, Matteo; Edri, Oded; Abboud, Yousef; Shiti, Assad; Shaheen, Naim; Ballan, Nimer; Neuberger, Ami; Caspi, Oren",Acad Med,,502

210049,Development of an online tooth morphology course in response to COVID-19 restrictions,2021,"BACKGROUND: Risk communication is a key component of public health interventions during an outbreak. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the forefront in the development of risk communication strategies. The WHO introduced a range of activities with the purpose of enabling the public to avail verified and timely information on COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Given the various WHO activities to protect the public health during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the extent of familiarity and uptake of the WHO recommendations among the public during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: To do this, we conducted a large-scale Pan-European survey covering around 7500 individuals that are representative of populations from seven European countries, collected online during April 2-April 15, 2020. We use descriptive statistics including proportions and correlations and graphical representations such as bar charts to analyze and display the data. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that information from the WHO in the context of COVID-19 is well trusted and acted upon by the public. Overall familiarity and adherence were quite high in most countries. Adherence was higher for social distancing recommendations compared to hygiene measures. Familiarity and adherence were higher among older, female, and highly educated respondents. However, country level heterogeneities were observed in the level of trust in information from the WHO, with countries severely affected by the pandemic reporting lower levels of trust. CONCLUSION: Our findings call for efforts from health authorities to get regular feedback from the public on their familiarity and compliance with recommendations for preventive measures at all stages of the pandemic, to further develop and adapt risk communication as the pandemic evolves.","Varghese, Nirosha Elsem; Sabat, Iryna; Neumann-Böhme, Sebastian; Schreyögg, Jonas; Stargardt, Tom; Torbica, Aleksandra; van Exel, Job; Barros, Pedro Pita; Brouwer, Werner",PLoS One,,502

Although growing evidence demonstrates a direct association between endotheliitis and severe COVID-19, the role of endothelial damage biomarkers has been scarcely studied. We investigated the relationship between circulating mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) levels, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: Prospective observational study enrolling adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. On admission to emergency department, a blood sample was drawn for laboratory test analysis. Primary and secondary endpoints were 28-day all-cause mortality and severe COVID-19 progression. Area under the curve (AUC) and multivariate regression analysis were employed to assess the association of the biomarker with the established endpoints. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients were enrolled. During hospitalization, 25 (25.3%) cases progressed to severe disease and the 28-day mortality rate was of 14.1%. MR-proADM showed the highest AUC to predict 28-day mortality (0.905; [CI] 95%: 0.829-0.955; P < .001) and progression to severe disease (0.829; [CI] 95%: 0.740-0.897; P < .001), respectively. MR-proADM plasma levels above optimal cut-off (1.01 nmol/L) showed the strongest independent association with 28-day mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.470, 95% CI: 2.066-53.049; P < .005) and with progression to severe disease (HR: 6.803, 95% CI: 1.458-31.750; P = .015). CONCLUSION: Mid-regional proadrenomedullin was the biomarker with highest performance for prognosis of death and progression to severe disease in COVID-19 patients and represents a promising predictor for both outcomes, which might constitute a potential tool in the assessment of prognosis in early stages of this disease.","García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Calvo Nieves, María Dolores; Rodríguez Mulero, María Dolores; Calcerrada Alises, Ismael; Hernández Olivo, Marta; Trapiello Fernández, Wysali; González Morales, Mercedes; Bolado Jiménez, Cristina; Albaladejo-Otón, María Dolores; Fernández Ovalle, Hilda; Conesa Hernández, Andrés; Azpeleta Manrique, Eugenio; Consuegra-Sánchez, Luciano; Nogales Martín, Leonor; Conesa Zamora, Pablo; Andaluz-Ojeda, David",Eur J Clin Invest,,502

Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of this pandemic on cancer care worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a validated web-based questionnaire of 51 items. The questionnaire obtained information on the capacity and services offered at these centers, magnitude of disruption of care, reasons for disruption, challenges faced, interventions implemented, and the estimation of patient harm during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 356 centers from 54 countries across six continents participated between April 21 and May 8, 2020. These centers serve 716,979 new patients with cancer a year. Most of them (88.2%) reported facing challenges in delivering care during the pandemic.

212458,"Socio-economic and environmental impacts of COVID-19 pandemic: Building resilience of the seven lakes of San Pablo city, Philippines",2021,"The role of face masks to prevent and control COVID-19 is critical, especially since asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can shed high loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the surrounding environment. In addition to being a two-way barrier to protect against virions droplets both in terms of ""source control"" (for the benefits of the community) and ""physical protection"" (for wearer), face masks also allow maintaining physiological temperatures and humidity of the nasal cavity and mouth, independently from the external environmental conditions. Beyond compromising the viral transmission speed, exposure to cold environments could have a detrimental effect on the host's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The innate human immune system becomes in fact weaker with cooler nose temperatures and thus more vulnerable to viral replication. Furthermore, there is evidence that warm, humid climates are associated with reduced spread of SARS-CoV-2, while cold dry conditions favor its stability and transmissibility. In the early stage of a viral infection, a physiological body temperature in the upper airways supports the innate immune system, endorsing the muco-ciliary clearance, inhibiting, or deactivating any first settlement of viruses. Face masks are therefore strongly recommended also outdoors, especially under cold weather conditions, not only as a physical barrier against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but also to prevent the rapid cooling of the nasal mucosa and the inhibition of the human innate defense of the upper airways.","Bubbico, Luciano; Mastrangelo, Giuseppe; Larese-Filon, Francesca; Basso, Paolo; Rigoli, Roberto; Maurelli, Martina; Ferlito, Salvatore; Capelli, Marco; Gisabella, Claudio; Javanbakht, Mohammad; Bellizzi, Saverio; Cegolon, Luca",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,502

212462,Redefining the Classic Concept of the Court? -responses to the Corporate Solvency Problem in the Ongoing Covid-19 Crisis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Increased anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely noted. The purpose of this study was to test whether the prepandemic functional connectome predicted individual anxiety induced by the pandemic. METHODS: Anxiety scores from healthy undergraduate students were collected during the severe and remission periods of the pandemic (first survey, February 22-28, 2020, N=589; second survey, April 24 to May 1, 2020, N=486). Brain imaging data and baseline (daily) anxiety ratings were acquired before the pandemic. The predictive performance of the functional connectome on individual anxiety was examined using machine learning and was validated in two external undergraduate student samples (N=149 and N=474). The clinical relevance of the findings was further explored by applying the connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety to distinguish between individuals with specific mental disorders and matched healthy control subjects (generalized anxiety disorder, N=43; major depression, N=536; schizophrenia, N=72). RESULTS: Anxiety scores increased from the prepandemic baseline to the severe stage of the pandemic and remained high in the remission stage. The prepandemic functional connectome predicted pandemic-related anxiety and generalized to the external sample but showed poor performance for predicting daily anxiety. The connectome-based neuromarkers of pandemic-related anxiety further distinguished between participants with generalized anxiety and healthy control subjects but were not useful for diagnostic classification in major depression and schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the functional connectome to predict individual anxiety induced by major stressful events (e.g., the current global health crisis), which advances our understanding of the neurobiological basis of anxiety susceptibility and may have implications for developing targeted psychological and clinical interventions that promote the reduction of stress and anxiety.","He, Li; Wei, Dongtao; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Jie; Cheng, Wei; Feng, Jianfeng; Yang, Wenjing; Zhuang, Kaixiang; Chen, Qunlin; Ren, Zhiting; Li, Yu; Wang, Xiaoqin; Mao, Yu; Chen, Zhiyi; Liao, Mei; Cui, Huiru; Li, Chunbo; He, Qinghua; Lei, Xu; Feng, Tingyong; Chen, Hong; Xie, Peng; Rolls, Edmund T; Su, Linyan; Li, Lingjiang; Qiu, Jiang",Am J Psychiatry,,502

Like other coronaviridae, the viral transmission occurs mainly through droplets. In addition, the virus has been detected in different clinical specimens, suggesting a potential transmission by other routes, including blood transfusion. However, the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via blood products is still unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors from South-Eastern Italy. Moreover, in the seropositive donors, we searched for the presence of the virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Overall, 1,797 blood donors from the Apulia region were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using a commercially available assay. Only 18/1,797 donors (1.0%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; in none of them SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and in plasma samples. Our results indicate that most of the blood donors in Apulia remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic; further, none had detectable virus both in nasopharyngeal swabs and in blood samples.

213385,The Challenges of Navigating the COVID-19 Pandemic for Australia's Franchise Sector,2020,"Within COVID-19 there is an urgent unmet need to predict at the time of hospital admission which COVID-19 patients will recover from the disease, and how fast they recover to deliver personalized treatments and to properly allocate hospital resources so that healthcare systems do not become overwhelmed. To this end, we have combined clinically salient CT imaging data synergistically with laboratory testing data in an integrative machine learning model to predict organ-specific recovery of patients from COVID-19. We trained and validated our model in 285 patients on each separate major organ system impacted by COVID-19 including the renal, pulmonary, immune, cardiac, and hepatic systems. To greatly enhance the speed and utility of our model, we applied an artificial intelligence method to segment and classify regions on CT imaging, from which interpretable data could be directly fed into the predictive machine learning model for overall recovery. Across all organ systems we achieved validation set area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values for organ-specific recovery ranging from 0.80 to 0.89, and significant overall recovery prediction in Kaplan-Meier analyses. This demonstrates that the synergistic use of an artificial intelligence (AI) framework applied to CT lung imaging and a machine learning model that integrates laboratory test data with imaging data can accurately predict the overall recovery of COVID-19 patients from baseline characteristics.","Wang, W.

213397,An overview of Kuwait’s water resources and a proposed plan to prevent the spread of the Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic through Kuwait’s water supply facilities and groundwater system,2021,"RATIONALE: Detailed data on the characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. OBJECTIVE: We determined the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Uganda. MEASUREMENTS: As of the 16 May 2020, a total of 203 cases had been confirmed. We report on the first 56 patients; 29 received hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and 27 did not. Endpoints included admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation or death during hospitalisation. MAIN RESULTS: The median age was 34.2 years; 67.9% were male; and 14.6% were <18 years. Up 57.1% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever (21.4%), cough (19.6%), rhinorrhea (16.1%), headache (12.5%), muscle ache (7.1%) and fatigue (7.1%). Rates of comorbidities were 10.7% (pre-existing hypertension), 10.7% (diabetes) and 7.1% (HIV), Body Mass Index (BMI) of &#8805;30 36.6%. 37.0% had a blood pressure (BP) of >130/90 mm Hg, and 27.8% had BP of >140/90 mm Hg. Laboratory derangements were leucopenia (10.6%), lymphopenia (11.1%) and thrombocytopenia (26.3%). Abnormal chest X-ray was observed in 14.3%. No patients reached the primary endpoint. Time to clinical recovery was shorter among patients who received HCQ, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with COVID-19 presented with mild disease and exhibited a clinical trajectory not similar to other countries. Outcomes did not differ by HCQ treatment status in line with other concluded studies on the benefit of using HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.","Kirenga, Bruce; Muttamba, Winters; Kayongo, Alex; Nsereko, Christopher; Siddharthan, Trishul; Lusiba, John; Mugenyi, Levicatus; Byanyima, Rosemary K; Worodria, William; Nakwagala, Fred; Nantanda, Rebecca; Kimuli, Ivan; Katagira, Winceslaus; Bagaya, Bernard Sentalo; Nasinghe, Emmanuel; Aanyu-Tukamuhebwa, Hellen; Amuge, Beatrice; Sekibira, Rogers; Buregyeya, Esther; Kiwanuka, Noah; Muwanga, Moses; Kalungi, Samuel; Joloba, Moses Lutaakome; Kateete, David Patrick; Byarugaba, Baterana; Kamya, Moses R; Mwebesa, Henry; Bazeyo, William",,,502

214912,Skin eruption and gastrointestinal symptoms as presentation of COVID-19,2020,"The rapid spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and its significant health and social impact urges the search for effective and readily available solutions to mitigate the damages. Thus, evaluating the effectiveness of existing vaccines like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has attracted attention. The aim of this review was evidence synthesis on the effect of BCG vaccine in preventing severe infectious respiratory disease including COVD-19, but not tuberculosis. We considered studies conducted on human participants of any study design from any country setting that were published in Enlgish. We did a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Scopus and Google scholar databases and a free search on Google. The identified studies were appraised and relevant data were extracted using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. The extracted findings were synthesized with tables and narrative summary. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings indicated that BCG vaccine has a strong protective effect against both upper and lower acute respiratory tract infections. For instance in countries with universal BCG vaccination policy, the incidence of COVID-19 was lower compared to the counterparts. Addtionally, BCG vaccine was found to protect against infections like lethal influenza A virus, pandemic influenza (H1N1), and other acute respiratory tract infections. BCG improved the human body's immune response involving antigen-specific T cells and memory cells. It also induced adaptive functional reprogramming of mononuclear phagocytes that induce protective effects against different respiratory infections other than tuberculosis. In countries with universal BCG vaccination, the incidence and death from acute respiratory viral infection including COVID - 19 is significantly low. However, there is an urgent need for further evidence from well-designed studies to understand the possible role of BCG vaccination over time and across age groups, its possible benefits in special populations such as health workers and cost-savings related to a policy of universal BCG vaccination.","Yitbarek, Kiddus; Abraham, Gelila; Girma, Tsinuel; Tilahun, Tizta; Woldie, Mirkuzie",Vaccine,,502
215192,Hungering for a Solution: Physicians Can Help Tackle Food Insecurity,2021,"The objectives were to explore, among university students, the level of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and resistancy and to determine the motivations and barriers, and the reasons that may change student vaccination decision making. An online observational cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a French university in January 2021 with questions about the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the motivations and the barriers. The convenience sample included 3089 students, with a mean of age of 20.3 (SD = 1.9). To the question on the intention to vaccinate against the COVID-19, 58.0% of students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination, 17.0% reported that they would not and 25.0% were not sure. The main motivations for vaccine acceptance were “I don′t want to transmit COVID-19 to others”, the main barriers for vaccine resistance or hesitancy were “I prefer to wait until I have more experience with these new vaccines”. Age, female gender, being in first three years of study, studied sciences courses and neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study were significantly associated with a higher risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. Self-estimated knowledge of conventional vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, and confidence in efficiency and safety of conventional vaccination were associated with a lower risk of vaccine hesitancy or resistancy. It is relevant to disseminate evidence-based interventions to promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptability for college students, especially for the students in neither sciences nor healthcare courses of study, as college students will soon be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.","Tavolacci, Marie Pierre Dechelotte Pierre Ladner Joel",Vaccines,,502
215243,Fertility preservation during the COVID-19 pandemic: mitigating the viral contamination risk to reproductive cells in cryostorage,2020,"BACKGROUND: Age and disease prevalence are the two biggest risk factors for COVID-19 symptom severity and death. We therefore hypothesized that increased biological age, beyond chronological age, may be driving disease-related trends in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Using the UK Biobank England data, we tested whether a biological age estimate (PhenoAge) measured more than a decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was predictive of two COVID-19 severity outcomes (inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19). Logistic regression models were used with adjustment for age at the pandemic, sex, ethnicity, baseline assessment centers, and pre-existing diseases/conditions. RESULTS: 613 participants tested positive at inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, 2020, 154 of whom succumbed to COVID-19. PhenoAge was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality (ORMortality=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.7×10 -13) adjusting for demographics including age at the pandemic. Further adjustment for pre-existing disease s/conditions at baseline (ORM=1.50, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73 per 5 years, p=3.1×10 -8) and at the early pandemic (ORM=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40 per 5 years, p=0.011) decreased the association. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoAge measured in 2006-2010 was associated with COVID-19 severity outcomes more than 10 years later. These associations were partly accounted for by prevalent chronic diseases proximate to COVID-19 infection. Overall, our results suggest that aging biomarkers, like PhenoAge may capture long-term vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, even before the accumulation of age-related comorbid conditions.","Kuo, Chia-Ling; Pilling, Luke C; Atkins, Janice L; Masoli, Jane A H; Delgado, João; Tignanelli, Christopher; Kuchel, George A; Melzer, David; Beckman, Kenneth B; Levine, Morgan E","J. gerontol.

215487,Exploring Public Response to COVID-19 on Weibo with LDA Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is the most commonly recommended immune prevention strategy. However, data on influenza vaccination in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is scarce. In this study, our goals were to (i) measure vaccination coverage rates (VCR) for influenza in a large cohort of children, adolescents and adults with CHD, (ii) identity patient characteristics as predictors for vaccination, and (iii) investigate the impact of influenza vaccination on hospitalization. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study in Belgium included 16,778 patients, representing 134,782 vaccination years, from the BELgian COngenital heart disease Database combining Administrative and Clinical data (BELCODAC). Data over 9 vaccination years (2006-2015) were used, and patients were stratified into five age cohorts: 6 months-4 years; 5-17 years; 18-49 years; 50-64 years; and &#8805;65 years. RESULTS: In the respective age cohorts, the VCR was estimated to be 6.6%, 8.0%, 23.9%, 46.6%, and 72.8%. There was a steep increase in VCR as of the age of 40 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that higher anatomical complexity of CHD, older age, presence of genetic syndromes, and prior cardiac interventions were associated with significantly higher VCRs. Among adults, men had lower and pregnant women had higher VCRs. The association between influenza vaccination and all-cause hospitalization was not significant in this study. CONCLUSION: The influenza VCR in people with CHD is low, especially in children and adolescents. Older patients, particularly those with complex CHD, are well covered. Our findings should inform vaccination promotion strategies in populations with CHD.","Moons, Philip; Fieuws, Steffen; Vandermeulen, Corinne; Ombelet, Fouke; Willems, Ruben; Goossens, Eva; Van Bulck, Liesbet; de Hosson, Michèle; Annemans, Lieven; Budts, Werner; De Backer, Julie; Moniotte, Stéphane; Marelli, Arianne; De Groote, Katya",Can. j. cardiol,,502

Health interventions to promote physical activity are more likely to be successful if they take into account the experiences and perspectives of their target population. Our study objective was to explore barriers and facilitators to physical activity among Latino adolescents with the goal of informing future interventions for this population. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with (n = 30) low-income, Latino adolescents. The interviews were analyzed using inductive methods and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation model of behavior. RESULTS: Adolescents described capability gaps including lacking skills for preferred activities. School physical education and parks provided opportunities for adolescents to be physically active. Adolescents also described opportunity challenges, including age limits, not being able to afford preferred classes, and safety concerns. Families provided role modeling but rarely engaged in activities with adolescents. Adolescents were motivated to engage in physical activity but often lacked the necessary resources. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to increase physical activity among urban Latino adolescents should offer tailored programming, incorporate families, enhance physical education, and improve the safety and appeal of recreational facilities.","Vasquez, Taylor; Fernandez, Alicia; Haya-Fisher, Julissa; Kim, Sarah; Beck, Amy L",Hisp Health Care Int,,502

We aimed to evaluate the changes of frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs, a population of cells with potent immunosuppressive capacity, in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Elevated frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs was positively correlated with oropharyngeal viral loads and length of hospital stay, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts and serum albumin. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between the frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs and T cell subsets, NK cell counts, and B cell percentages. The frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs could be used as a predictor of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: A high frequency of CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg MDSCs, especially in severe patients, may indicate an immunoparalysis status and could be a predictor of disease severity and prognosis.","Xue, GuoHui; Jiang, Mei; Zhao, Rui; Le, AiPing; Li, JunMing",Aging (Albany NY),,502

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults aged 65 and older (n = 1,427). MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was measured with the frailty phenotype (Fried criteria). Loneliness was assessed with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Social isolation was operationalized using information on partner status, social support, and network size. Two categorical variables were created, for each possible combination regarding frailty and loneliness (FL) and frailty and social isolation (FS), respectively. Mortality was monitored over a period of 22 years (1995-2017). Survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the effects of the FL and FS combinations on mortality. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, depression, chronic diseases, and smoking. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 13%, and 5.9% of the sample were frail and lonely, and 6.2% frail and socially isolated. In fully adjusted models, older adults who were only frail had a higher risk of mortality compared with people without any of the conditions (hazard ratio [HR] range = 1.40-1.48; P < .01). However, the highest risk of mortality was observed in people with a combined presence of frailty and loneliness or social isolation (HRFL = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-2.37; HRFS = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.36-2.30). Sensitivity analyses using a frailty index based on the deficit accumulation approach instead of the frailty phenotype showed similar results, confirming the robustness of our findings. CONCLUSION: Frail older adults are at increased risk of mortality, but this risk is even higher for those who are also lonely or socially isolated. To optimize well-being and health outcomes in physically frail older adults, targeted interventions focusing on both subjective and objective social vulnerability are needed.","Hoogendijk, Emiel O; Smit, Annelot P; van Dam, Carmen; Schuster, Noah A; de Breij, Sascha; Holwerda, Tjalling J; Huisman, Martijn; Dent, Elsa; Andrew, Melissa K",J. am. geriatr. soc,,502

219953,Migrant workers and the COVID-19 crisis in Australia: an overview of governmental responses,2021,"The best timing of orotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome is unknown. The use of non-invasive ventilation, a life-saving technique in many medical conditions, is debated in patients with ARDS since prolonged NIV and delayed intubation may be harmful. Shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators during a respiratory pandemic can trigger a widespread use of early non-invasive ventilation in many hospitals but which is the best way to ventilate patients with severe bilateral pneumonia and severely increased spontaneous ventilation is controversial. Moreover, viral spreading to health-care workers and other hospitalized patients is an issue for any device used to administer oxygen. Even if protective mechanical ventilation is currently the gold standard for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome, tracheal intubation is not without risks and is associated with delirium, hemodynamic instability, immobilization and post intensive care syndrome. Both invasive and non-invasive ventilation are associated with advantages and limitations that should be carefully considered when patients with COVID-19-ARDS need our attention. In the absence of strong evidence , in this review we highlight all the pro and con of these two different approaches.","Cabrini, Luca; Ghislanzoni, Luca; Severgnini, Paolo; Landoni, Giovanni; Baiardo Redaelli, Martina; Franchi, Federico; Romagnoli, Stefano",Minerva cardioangiol,,502

219991,COVID-19 Emergency eLearning and Beyond: Experiences and Perspectives of University Educators,2021,"The problem of quickest detection of a change in the mean of a sequence of independent observations is studied. The pre-change distribution is assumed to be stationary, while the post-change distributions are allowed to be non-stationary. The case where the pre-change distribution is known is studied first, and then the extension where only the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution are known. No knowledge of the post-change distributions is assumed other than that their means are above some pre-specified threshold larger than the pre-change mean. For the case where the pre-change distribution is known, a test is derived that asymptotically minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all possible post-change distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Towards deriving this asymptotically optimal test, some new results are provided for the general problem of asymptotic minimax robust quickest change detection in non-stationary settings. Then, the limiting form of the optimal test is studied as the gap between the pre- and post-change means goes to zero, called the Mean-Change Test (MCT). It is shown that the MCT can be designed with only knowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution. The performance of the MCT is also characterized when the mean gap is moderate, under the additional assumption that the distributions of the observations have bounded support. The analysis is validated through numerical results for detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution. The use of the MCT in monitoring pandemics is also demonstrated.","Liang, Yuchen; Veeravalli, Venugopal V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11348v1.pdf,502

This cross-sectional study explored the willingness to accept a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a university population in Southern Italy. The perceived risk level of developing COVID-19 was 6.5 and it was significantly higher among females, younger subjects, and those who agreed/strongly agreed that COVID-19 is a severe disease. Only 21.4% of respondents were not worried at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. Males, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, those who perceived a lower risk of developing COVID-19, and those who did not need information regarding the vaccination against COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no concern at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. The vast majority (84.1%) were willing to receive a future vaccine against COVID-19. Almost coherently with predictors of concern on the safety of the vaccine, being male, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, not being concerned at all that COVID-19 vaccination might not be safe, and agreeing that COVID-19 can have serious health consequences were significant predictors of the willingness to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. A considerable proportion of the population had a positive willingness to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine, although some concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness and safety and public health activities seem necessary to achieve the rate that can lead to the protection of the community.","Di Giuseppe, Gabriella; Pelullo, Concetta Paola; Della Polla, Giorgia; Pavia, Maria; Angelillo, Italo Francesco",,,502

This study included 46 drug-naive children aged 4-17 y diagnosed with ASD. The Autism Behavior Checklist (AuBC), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), and Children's chronotype questionnaire (CCQ) were filled out before and at the end of the COVID-19 mandated home confinement by the children's parents. Children with ASD during the home confinement reported higher chronotype scores, i.e., eveningness chronotype, sleep problems, and autism symptom scores compared to the normal non-hone confinement state. The chronotype score and sleep problems of children with ASD during the home confinement period varied according to the AuBC score. The sleep problems of the children with ASD during the home confinement period mediated the relationship between chronotype score and severity of autism symptoms. It is essential to validate the role of the mediator effect of sleep problems and chronotype in larger samples of children with ASD with restricted to home confinement during the pandemic period. If sleep problems can be controlled with parental education, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapeutic interventions, the impact on children with ASD of home confinement can be reduced.","Türkoglu, Serhat; Uçar, Halit Necmi; Çetin, Fatih Hilmi; Güler, Hasan Ali; Tezcan, Muatafa Esat",Chronobiol Int,,502

It also aimed at identifying the determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media-Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961-8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736-1.952). It is expected that both the government and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce depression and anxiety among university students.","Islam, Md Akhtarul; Barna, Sutapa Dey; Raihan, Hasin; Khan, Md Nafiul Alam; Hossain, Md Tanvir",PLoS One,,502

To build a less contagious network, transportation problem and pick-up-delivery vehicle routing problem are designed as two stages, respectively to carry out distribution.

A multi-attribute decision making approach is suggested to determine the priorities of affected areas, according to their urgency in terms of entropy weights. Moreover, a robust optimization approach for uncertain-random parameter is developed to cope with uncertainty in different scenarios, and thereafter augmented weighted Tchebycheff method is applied to solve the model. To demonstrate the practicability of the proposed model and solving approach, three test problems with reasonable sizes are considered and results are discussed through some sensitivity analyses.","Mondal, Arijit Roy Sankar Kumar",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,,502

230600,Non-COVID-19 deaths after social distancing in Norway,2020,"Drinking water softening is often implemented to increase consumer convenience e.g. by reducing lime scaling and soap use. Softening reduces hardness, but changes also the overall mineral composition of the water, depending on the technology. A broad spectrum of effects from softening has to be considered in relation to e.g. health and corrosion when selecting softening technology and design, otherwise adverse effects may be overlooked in the attempt to increase consumer convenience. We here provided a framework for evaluating softening technologies using water quality indicators for lime scaling, soap use, corrosion, human health, taste and removal of contaminants. None of the evaluated softening technologies scored positive on all the included water quality indicators. Precipitation technologies (lime/soda-ash softening and pellet softening) reduce the predicted copper and lead release, but negatively affect stainless steel corrosion expressed by the Larson Ratio. Pellet softening does not remove magnesium, which may limit the achievable softening depth, but maintains a protective effect against cardio-vascular diseases. Strong-acid cation exchange is not expected to affect the included corrosion indicators, whereas the effects from membrane separation (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) and weak-acid cation exchange depend on the specific source water and process design. All the evaluated technologies reduce hardness, calcium carbonate precipitation potential (CCPP) and atopic eczema, but have potential adverse effects on dental carries (expressed by DMF-S). Our framework provides a better understanding of softening and can prepare water utility planners and managers for better decisions that balance the positive and adverse effects from drinking water softening.","Tang, Camilla; Rygaard, Martin; Rosshaug, Per S; Kristensen, John B; Albrechtsen, Hans-Jørgen",Water Res,,502
230710,"Covid-19 Pandemic, Social Mitigation and Taxation: The Open Veins of Inequality in Latin America",2020,"Background: Focused history taking, knowledge-based clinical reasoning, and adequate case presentation during hand-offs represent important facets of competence of practicing physicians. Based on a validated 360-degree assessment simulating a first day of residency we developed a training for final-year medical students including patient consultation, patient management, and patient hand-off. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the training was changed to a telemedicine format and evaluated. Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly designed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items. The two formats were compared with t-tests. Results: The students were similarly satisfied with the content of the training independently of its format. Both groups found the patient cases interesting (presence: 4.68 ± 0.49, telemedicine: 4.66 ± 0.48). With respect to the telemedicine format, participants were glad that an option had been found that could be offered throughout the final year (4.94 ± 0.24) despite the COVID-19 pandemic and they regarded it as a very useful training for their final examination (4.94 ± 0.24). Conclusion: The telemedicine format of the competence-based training worked as well as the presence format. In its telemedicine format, the training can be offered to students independently of their location.","Harendza, Sigrid; Gärtner, Julia; Zelesniack, Elena; Prediger, Sarah",GMS J Med Educ,,502
230768,Furlough Schemes in the COVID-19 Crisis: An Initial Analysis of Furloughed Employees Resuming Work (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic the Dutch government implemented its so-called 'intelligent lockdown' in which people were urged to leave their homes as little as possible and work from home. This life changing event may have caused changes in lifestyle behaviour, an important factor in the onset and course of diseases. The overarching aim of this study is to determine life-style related changes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. METHODS: Life-style related changes were studied among a random representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands using an online survey conducted from 22 to 27 May 2020. Differences in COVID-19-related lifestyle changes between Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) users and non-CAM users were determined. The survey included a modified version of the I-CAM-Q and 26 questions on lifestyle related measures, anxiety, and need for support to maintain lifestyle changes. RESULTS: 1004 respondents were included in the study, aged between 18 and 88 years (50.7% females). Changes to a healthier lifestyle were observed in 19.3% of the population, mainly due to a change in diet habits, physical activity and relaxation, of whom 56.2% reported to be motivated to maintain this behaviour change in a post-COVID-19 era. Fewer respondents (12.3%) changed into an unhealthier lifestyle. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that changing into a healthier lifestyle was positively associated with the variables 'Worried/Anxious getting COVID-19' (OR: 1.56, 95% C.I. 1.26-1.93), 'CAM use' (OR: 2.04, 95% C.I. 1.38-3.02) and 'stress in relation to financial situation' (OR: 1.89, 95% C.I. 1.30-2.74). 'Age' (OR 18-25: 1.00, OR 25-40: 0.55, 95% C.I. 0.31-0.96, OR 40-55:0.50 95% C.I. 0.28-0.87 OR 55+: 0.1095% C.I. 0.10-0.33), 'stress in relation to health' (OR: 2.52, 95% C.I. 1.64-3.86) and 'stress in relation to the balance work and home' (OR: 1.69, 95% C.I. 1.11-2.57) were found predicting the change into an unhealthier direction. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the coronavirus crisis resulted in a healthier lifestyle in one part and, to a lesser extent, in an unhealthier lifestyle in another part of the Dutch population. Further studies are warranted to see whether this behavioural change is maintained over time, and how different lifestyle factors can affect the susceptibility for and the course of COVID-19.","van der Werf, Esther T; Busch, Martine; Jong, Miek C; Hoenders, H J Rogier",BMC Public Health,,502

COVID-19 and many other infectious diseases are spread by human movement and contact, but complex transportation networks in 21 century make it difficult to predict disease spread in rapidly changing situations. It is especially challenging to estimate the network of infection transmission in the countries that the traffic and human movement data infrastructure is not yet developed. In this study, we devised a method to estimate the network of transmission of COVID-19 from the time series data of its infection and applied it to determine its spread across areas in Japan. We incorporated the effects of soft lockdowns, such as the declaration of a state of emergency, and changes in the infection network due to government-sponsored travel promotion, and predicted the spread of infection using the Tokyo Olympics as a model. The models used in this study are available online, and our data-driven infection network models are scalable, whether it be at the level of a city, town, country, or continent, and applicable anywhere in the world, as long as the time-series data of infections per region is available. These estimations of effective distance and the depiction of infectious disease networks based on actual infection data are expected to be useful in devising data-driven countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases worldwide.","Yamada, Tetsuya; Shi, Shoi",,,502
234369,Harnessing the power of social media to support medical training during COVID-19,2020,"Thrombin, the ligand of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), is a well-known stimulator of proangiogenic responses in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which are mediated through the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the transcriptional events underlying this thrombin-induced VEGF induction and angiogenic response are less well understood at present. As reported here, we conducted detailed promotor activation and signal transduction pathway studies in human microvascular ECs, to decipher the transcription factors and the intracellular signaling events underlying the thrombin and PAR-1-induced endothelial VEGF induction. We found that c-FOS is a key transcription factor controlling thrombin-induced EC VEGF synthesis and angiogenesis. Upon the binding and internalization of its G-protein-coupled PAR-1 receptor, thrombin triggers ERK1/2 signaling and activation of the nuclear AP-1/c-FOS transcription factor complex, which then leads to VEGF transcription, extracellular secretion, and concomitant proangiogenic responses of ECs. In conclusion, exposure of human microvascular ECs to thrombin triggers signaling through the PAR-1-ERK1/2-AP-1/c-FOS axis to control VEGF gene transcription and VEGF-induced angiogenesis. These observations offer a greater understanding of endothelial responses to thromboinflammation, which may help to interpret the results of clinical trials tackling the conditions associated with endothelial injury and thrombosis.","Catar, Rusan; Moll, Guido; Hosp, Isa; Simon, Michele; Luecht, Christian; Zhao, Hongfan; Wu, Dashan; Chen, Lei; Kamhieh-Milz, Julian; Korybalska, Katarzyna; Zickler, Daniel; Witowski, Janusz",,,502

We investigated spinal entheseal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 and 9 activation and therapeutic modulation, including JAK inhibition. We also investigated if COVID-19 infection, a potent TLR-7 stimulator triggered PsA flares. Methods: Normal entheseal pDCs were characterized and stimulated with imiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) to evaluate TNF and IFN&#945; production. NanoString gene expression assay of total pDCs RNA was performed pre- and post- ODN stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of induced IFN&#945; protein was performed with Tofacitinib and PDE4 inhibition. The impact of SARS-CoV2 viral infection on PsA flares was evaluated. Results: CD45+HLA-DR+CD123+CD303+CD11c- entheseal pDCs were more numerous than blood pDCs (1.9 ± 0.8% vs 0.2 ± 0.07% of CD45+ cells, p=0.008) and showed inducible IFN&#945; and TNF protein following ODN/imiquimod stimulation and were the sole entheseal IFN&#945; producers. NanoString data identified 11 significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including TNF in stimulated pDCs. Canonical pathway analysis revealed activation of dendritic cell maturation, NF-&#954;B signaling, toll-like receptor signaling and JAK/STAT signaling pathways following ODN stimulation. Both tofacitinib and PDE4i strongly attenuated ODN induced IFN&#945;. DAPSA scores elevations occurred in 18 PsA cases with SARS-CoV2 infection (9.7 ± 4 pre-infection and 35.3 ± 7.5 during infection).

236757,Impact of COVID-19 on Higher Education in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Currently available coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are approved for intramuscular injection and efficacy may not be ensured when given subcutaneously. For years, subcutaneous vaccination was recommended in patients with hemophilia to avoid intramuscular bleeds. Therefore, recommendations for the application of COVID-19 vaccines are needed. METHODS: The Delphi methodology was used to develop consensus recommendations. An initial list of recommendations was prepared by a steering committee and evaluated by 39 hemophilia experts. Consensus was defined as &#8805;75% agreement and strong consensus as &#8805;95% agreement, and agreement as a score &#8805;7 on a scale of 1 to 9. After four rounds, a final list of statements was compiled. RECOMMENDATIONS: Consensus was achieved that COVID-19 vaccines licensed only for intramuscular injection should be administered intramuscularly in hemophilia patients. Prophylactic factor replacement, given on the day of vaccination with a maximum interval between prophylaxis and vaccination of 24 hours (factor VIII and conventional factor IX concentrates) or 48 hours (half-life extended factor IX), should be provided in patients with moderate or severe hemophilia. Strong consensus was achieved that patients with mild hemophilia and residual factor activity greater than 10% with mild bleeding phenotype or patients on emicizumab usually do not need factor replacement before vaccination. Swelling, erythema, and hyperthermia after vaccination are not always signs of bleeding but should prompt consultation of a hemophilia care center. In case of injection-site hematoma, patients should receive replacement therapy until symptoms disappear. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus was achieved on recommendations for intramuscular COVID-19 vaccination after replacement therapy for hemophilia patients depending on disease severity.","Pfrepper, Christian; Holstein, Katharina; Königs, Christoph; Heller, Christine; Krause, Manuela; Olivieri, Martin; Bidlingmaier, Christoph; Sigl-Kraetzig, Michael; Wendisch, Jörg; Halimeh, Susan; Horneff, Silvia; Richter, Heinrich; Wieland, Ivonne; Klamroth, Robert; Oldenburg, Johannes; Tiede, Andreas",Hamostaseologie,,502

Motivating potential travelers to take precautions is critical, especially for those at higher risk for severe illness. To provide an evidence base for communication efforts, we examined the experiences and views of travelers during the summer of 2020 through a telephone survey of 1,968 US adults, conducted in English and Spanish, July 2 through July 16, 2020. The survey found that more than one-quarter (28%) of adults had traveled domestically in the prior 30 days, most commonly for ""vacation"" (43%), and less than half wore masks (46%) or practiced social distancing (47%) ""all of the time."" Although high-risk adults were significantly less likely to travel than non-high-risk adults (23% vs 31%; P < .001), they were no more likely to take precautions. Many travelers did not wear a mask or practice social distancing because they felt such actions were unnecessary (eg, they were outside or with friends and family). Although a substantial share of travelers (43% to 53%) trusted public health agencies ""a great deal"" for information about reducing risks while traveling, more travelers (73%) trusted their own healthcare providers. Findings suggest that outreach may be improved by partnering with providers to emphasize the benefits of layering precautions and provide targeted education to high-risk individuals. Messages that are empathetic to the need to reduce stress and convey how precautions can protect loved ones may be particularly resonant after more than a year of pandemic-related restrictions.","SteelFisher, Gillian K; McMurtry, Caitlin L; Caporello, Hannah L; McGowan, Ericka; Schafer, Thomas J; Lubell, Keri M; Friedman, Allison L; Allen, Jessica; Shockey, Caitlin; Grady, Alison; Ben-Porath, Eran N",Health Secur,,502
238739,Spatial tale of G-7 and Brics stock markets during COVID-19: An event study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess associations between BMI and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. A secondary aim was to investigate whether associations varied by age. METHODS: The cohort comprised patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) who tested positive for COVID-19 (N = 9,347). For each outcome, we fit piecewise logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines (knots at BMI of 23, 30, and 39), adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, VHA nursing home residence, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental analyses included age-by-BMI interaction terms (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: We found evidence of a nonlinear J-curve association between BMI and likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. BMI was associated with increased odds for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients with BMI 30 to 39 but decreased odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with BMI 23 to 30. Patients under age 75 with BMI between 30 and 39 had increased odds for mortality with increasing BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Odds for severe outcomes with COVID-19 infection increased with increasing BMI for people with, but not without, obesity. This nonlinear relationship should be tested in future research. COVID-19 public health messages in VHA, and broadly, should incorporate information about risks associated with all classes of obesity, particularly for those under age 75.","Breland, Jessica Y; Wong, Michelle S; Steers, W Neil; Yuan, Anita H; Haderlein, Taona P; Washington, Donna L",Obesity (Silver Spring),,502

Our aim in this COVID-19 pandemic was to provide information about the follow-up of new onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and to discuss the integration of telemedicine into routine clinical care in the long term. METHODS: The changes in Coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD); percentage of time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR) and time above range (TAR) were evaluated in 8 patients with new-onset T1D diagnosed in Pediatric Diabetes division of Ege University, during COVID-19 pandemic over a period of two-months follow-up using telemedicine system. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 51 (24-66) days. Two of the patients were using low glucose suspend system and 6 were on multiple dose daily injection therapy (MDI). Target TIR values were achieved in 7 patients in the last televisit and according to last consensus suggestions' TBR <70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l) (level 1 hypoglycemia) of <4% and a TBR <54 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l) (level 2 hypoglycemia) of <1% were achieved in all patients.

Recent clinical evidences suggest increased level of cytokines and chemokines targeting lung tissue as a prominent etiological factor. The immunomodulatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as the alternative therapy for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is well known. Several studies have also revealed that similar therapeutic impacts of parent MSCs are also exhibited by MSCs-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes. In this review, we explored the therapeutic potential of both MSCs and exosomes in mitigating the COVID-19 induced cytokine storm as well as promoting the regeneration of alveolar tissue, attributed to the intrinsic cytokines and growth factor present in the secretome. The preliminary studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of MSCs and exosomes in mitigating symptoms associated with COVID-19. Thus, they can be used on compassionate basis, owing to their ability to endogenously repair and decrease the inflammatory reactions involved in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. However, more preclinical and clinical studies are warranted to understand their mechanism of action and further establish their safety and efficacy.","Gupta, Ashim; Kashte, Shivaji; Gupta, Manu; Rodriguez, Hugo C; Gautam, Shraddha Singh; Kadam, Sachin",Hum Cell,,502

While monotherapy with two of the individual cocktail components also showed clear in vivo protection, neither recapitulated the efficacy of TATX-03. This synergistic effect was further supported by examining in vivo efficacy of these individual antibodies and corresponding combination therapy at a lower dose. Furthermore, in vitro screenings using VSV-particles pseudo-typed with spike proteins representing the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern Alpha, Beta, and Delta showed that TATX-03 maintained its neutralization potency.

The most likely original source of the virus was spillover from an animal reservoir and subsequent adaptation to humans sometime during the winter of 2019 in Wuhan Province, China. Because of its genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1, it is probable that this novel virus has a similar host range and receptor specificity. Due to concern for human-pet transmission, we investigated the susceptibility of domestic cats and dogs to infection and potential for infected cats to transmit to naive cats. We report that cats are highly susceptible to infection, with a prolonged period of oral and nasal viral shedding that is not accompanied by clinical signs, and are capable of direct contact transmission to other cats. These studies confirm that cats are susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, but are unlikely to develop clinical disease. Further, we document that cats developed a robust neutralizing antibody response that prevented reinfection following a second viral challenge. Conversely, we found that dogs do not shed virus following infection but do seroconvert and mount an antiviral neutralizing antibody response. There is currently no evidence that cats or dogs play a significant role in human infection; however, reverse zoonosis is possible if infected owners expose their domestic pets to the virus during acute infection. Resistance to reinfection holds promise that a vaccine strategy may protect cats and, by extension, humans.","Bosco-Lauth, Angela M; Hartwig, Airn E; Porter, Stephanie M; Gordy, Paul W; Nehring, Mary; Byas, Alex D; VandeWoude, Sue; Ragan, Izabela K; Maison, Rachel M; Bowen, Richard A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,502

This novel experimental approach, which imaging the inside of a membrane oxygenator during fluid perfusion using high-power X-ray CT, identifies air and blood retention in the local part of a membrane oxygenator. The cause of excessive pressure drop in a membrane oxygenator, which has been the most serious dysfunction in cardiovascular surgery and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is the local retention of blood and air inside the oxygenator. Our designed blood flow channel for a membrane oxygenator has a circular channel and minimizes the boundary between laminated parts. The pressure drop in the blood flow channel is reduced, and the maximum gas transfer rates are increased by using this pediatric membrane oxygenator, as compared with the conventional oxygenator. Furthermore, it would be possible to reduce the incidents, which have occurred clinically, due to excessive pressure drop in the blood flow channel of the membrane oxygenator. The membrane oxygenator is said to be the ""last stronghold"" for patients with COVID-19 receiving ECMO treatment.

245285,Does tax policy fit in the portfolio of COVID-19 responses?,2021,"The most severe clinical manifestations of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are due to an unbalanced immune response and a pro-thrombotic hemostatic disturbance, with arterial hypertension or diabetes as acknowledged risk factors. While waiting for a specific treatment, the clinical management of hospitalized patients is still a matter of debate, and the effectiveness of treatments to manage clinical manifestations and comorbidities has been questioned. In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the clinical management of arterial hypertension, inflammation and thrombosis on the survival of COVID-19 patients. The Spanish cohorts included in this observational retrospective study are from HM Hospitales (2035 patients) and from Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (72 patients). Kaplan Meier survival curves, Cox regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed, considering demographic variables, comorbidities and treatment arms (when opportune) as covariates. The management of arterial hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is not detrimental, as was initially reported, and neither was the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). On the contrary, our analysis shows that the use on itself of corticosteroids is not beneficial. Importantly, the management of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an anticoagulant significantly improves the survival of hospitalized patients. These results delineate the current treatment options under debate, supporting the effectiveness of thrombosis prophylaxis on COVID-19 patients as a first-line treatment without the need for compromising the treatment of comorbidities, while suggesting cautiousness when administering corticosteroids.","Martínez-Botía, Patricia; Bernardo, Ángel; Acebes-Huerta, Andrea; Caro, Alberto; Leoz, Blanca; Martínez-Carballeira, Daniel; Palomo-Antequera, Carmen; Soto, Inmaculada; Gutiérrez, Laura",,,502

The physical properties of aerosol particles which may contain viable virus have implications for the safe use of personal protective equipment and infection control protocols. As elective work in the NHS is reinstated, it is important that the implications of the possibility of airborne transmission of the virus in hospitals are more widely understood.

However, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against the newly emerged coronavirus and identifying the available therapeutics as soon as possible is critical for the response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC), a well-known prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China, has been widely used in treating upper respiratory tract infections and acute lung injury, owing to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Despite the definite evidence of effective use of SFJDC in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, the underlying action mechanism remains unknown. Currently, a systematic study integrated with absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation, target prediction, network construction and functional bioinformatics analyses is proposed to illustrate the potential immune and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SFJDC against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to further validate the reliability of the interactions and binding affinities between drugs and targets, docking, Molecular dynamics Simulations (MD) simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach (MM-PBSA) calculations were carried out. The results demonstrate that SFJDC regulates the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory related targets on multiple pathways through its active ingredients, showing the potential anti-novel coronavirus effect. Overall, the work can provide a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of SFJDC for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from multi-scale perspectives, and may also offer a valuable clue for developing novel pharmaceutical strategies to control the current coronavirus.","Tao, Zhengang; Zhang, Lei; Friedemann, Thomas; Yang, Guangshan; Li, Jinhu; Wen, Yaocai; Wang, Jinghui; Shen, Aizong",J Funct Foods,,502

The restrictive measures imposed forced many organizations and workers to work through online platforms and no longer in-person. Smart working, enjoyed by some workers for its flexibility, affected several professional categories. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in the psychological variables related to four groups of professional categories (practitioners, managers, executive employees, teachers), particularly the teachers group. Methods: A total sample of 628 individuals was recruited through a random probability sample across Italy. Due to the lockdown, an online questionnaire was developed;several validated scales were chosen, and some ad hoc constructed items related to the smart working experience were included. Results: The results showed statistically significant differences between the four groups of examined smart workers. Conclusions: All workers have had to readjust to this new way of working, but our results show that teachers were the most affected, both in the perception of their psychological well-being and in the management of the smart working mode.","Mari, Emanuela Lausi Giulia Fraschetti Angelo Pizzo Alessandra Baldi Michela Quaglieri Alessandro Burrai Jessica Barchielli Benedetta Avallone Francesco Giannini Anna Maria",Sustainability,,502

DISCUSSION: This new strain of coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enters human cells that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptors, which exist in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and heart, causing coronavirus disease. Transmission occurs essentially through the respiratory tract and the main symptoms are fever, cough and dyspnea. Diagnosis is based on epidemiological, clinical and imaging features and confirmed by nucleic acid testing. CONCLUSION: Despite intensive research, the exact origin of the virus and pathophysiology of coronavirus disease is not yet completely known, and clinically approved vaccines and drugs that target severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are lacking.","Gouveia, Cristina Carvalho; Campos, Luís",Acta med. port,,502

First, after a principal component analysis, observation days of a historical dataset are clustered. Two different methods are compared: a Gaussian Mixture Model and a k-means algorithm. The clustering results reveal that congestion maps of days of the same group have substantial similarity in their traffic conditions and dynamic. Such a map is a binary visualization of the congestion propagation on the freeway, giving more importance to the traffic dynamics. Second, a consensus day is identified in each cluster as the most representative day of the community according to the congestion maps. Third, this information obtained from the historical data is used to predict traffic congestion propagation and travel times. Thus, the first measurements of a new day are used to determine which consensual day is the closest to this new day. The past observations recorded for that consensual day are then used to predict future traffic conditions and travel times. This method is tested using ten months of data collected on a French freeway and shows very encouraging results.","Chiabaut, Nicolas; Faitout, R'emi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05073v2.pdf,502

Multidisciplinary public health rapid response teams (RRTs) are one mechanism used within a larger COVID-19 outbreak response strategy. As COVID-19 RRTs are deployed, countries are facing operational challenges in optimizing their RRT's impact, while ensuring the safety of their RRT responders. From March to May 2020, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received requests from 12 countries for technical assistance related to COVID-19 RRTs and emergency operations support. Challenges included: (1) an insufficient number of RRT responders available for COVID-19 deployments; (2) limited capacity to monitor RRT responders' health, safety, and resiliency; (3) difficulty converting critical in-person RRT operational processes to remote information technology platforms; and (4) stigmatization of RRT responders hindering COVID-19 interventions.

METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, Phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (Day 1: 1800 mg BID; Days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure also was measured. RESULTS: From May 14-July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days),P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease.

When the patient has recovered from the primary insult, the cranioplasty restores protection and cosmesis, recovering fluid dynamics and improving neurological status. During this time, the bone flap must be stored, but there is a lack of standardization of tissue banking practices for this aim. In this work, we have reviewed the literature on tissue processing and storage practices. Most of the published articles are focused from a strictly clinical and surgical point of view, paying less attention to issues related to tissue manipulation. When bone resorption is avoided and the risk of infection is controlled, the autograft represents the most efficient choice, with the lowest risk of complication. Otherwise, depending on the degree of involvement, the patient may have to undergo new surgery, assuming further risks and higher healthcare costs. Therefore, tissue banks must implement protocols to provide products with the highest possible clinical effectiveness, without compromising safety. With a centralised management of tissue banking practices there may be a more uniform approach, thus facilitating the standardization of procedures and guidelines.","Mirabet, Vicente; García, Daniel; Yagüe, Nuria; Larrea, Luis Roberto; Arbona, Cristina; Botella, Carlos",Cell tissue bank,,502

The mean VAS's in patients with hyposmia/anosmia and hypogeusia/ageusia were 5.52 ± 2.08 and 5.79 ± 2.21, respectively. CONCLUSION: The most common otolaryngologic symptoms of COVID-19 infection are known as sore throat, smell and/or taste disturbances. However, our study showed that these patients can be seen with different symptoms in otological or laryngeal areas. Therefore, a more careful evaluation should be made in terms of otolaryngologic symptoms when COVID 19 infection is suspected.","Özçelik Korkmaz, Müge; Egilmez, Oguz Kadir; Özçelik, Muhammet Ali; Güven, Mehmet",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,502

257733,Creating a Silver Linings Playbook,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious risk of contagion to humans. There is a need to find reliable non-contact tests like vocal correlates of COVID-19 infection. Thirty-six Asian ethnic volunteers 16 (8M & 8F) infected subjects and 20 (10M &10F) non-infected controls participated in this study by vocalizing vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/. Voice correlates of 16 COVID-19 positive patients were compared during infection and after recovery with 20 non-infected controls. Compared to non-infected controls, significantly higher values of energy intensity for /o/ (p = 0.048);formant F1 for /o/ (p = 0.014);and formant F3 for /u/ (p = 0.032) were observed in male patients, while higher values of Jitter (local, abs) for /o/ (p = 0.021) and Jitter (ppq5) for /a/ (p = 0.014) were observed in female patients. However, formant F2 for /u/ (p = 0.018), mean pitch F0 for /e/, /i/ and /o/ (p = 0.033;0.036;0.047) decreased for female patients under infection. Compared to recovered conditions, HNR for /e/ (p = 0.014) was higher in male patients under infection, while Jitter (rap) for /a/ (p = 0.041);Jitter (ppq5) for /a/ (p = 0.032);Shimmer (local, dB) for /i/ (p = 0.024);Shimmer (apq5) for /u/ (p = 0.019);and formant F4 for vowel /o/ (p = 0.022) were higher in female patients under infection. However, HNR for /e/ (p = 0.041);and formant F1 for /o/ (p = 0.002) were lower in female patients compared to their recovered conditions. Obtained results support the hypothesis since changes in voice parameters were observed in the infected patients which can be correlated to a combination of acoustic measures like fundamental frequency, formant characteristics, HNR, and voice perturbations like jitter and shimmer for different vowels. Thus, voice analysis can be used for scanning and prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Based on the findings of this study, a mobile application can be developed to analyze human voice in real-time to detect COVID-19 symptoms for remedial measures and necessary action.

METHODS: This study included 2638 cases enrolled from 227 health care facilities that participated in the COVID-19 Registry Japan (COVIREGI-JP). The inclusion criteria for enrollment of a case in COVIREGI-JP are both (1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and (2) inpatient treatment at a health care facility. RESULTS: The median age of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 40-71). More than half of the cases were male (58.9%, 1542/2619). Nearly 60% of the cases had close contact to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. The median duration of symptoms before admission was 7 days (IQR: 4-10). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15%, 396/2638) and diabetes without complications (14.2%, 374/2638). The number of non-severe cases (68.2%, n=1798) was twice the number of severe cases (31.8%, n=840) at admission. The respiratory support during hospitalization includes those who received no oxygen support (61.6%, 1623/2636), followed by those who received supplemental oxygen (29.9%, 788/2636), and IMV/ECMO (mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) (8.5%, 225/2636). Overall, 66.9% (1762/2634) of patients were discharged home, while 7.5% (197/2634) died. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the clinical epidemiological features of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients in Japan. When compared with existing inpatient studies in other countries, these results demonstrated less comorbidities and a trend towards lower mortality.","Matsunaga, Nobuaki; Hayakawa, Kayoko; Terada, Mari; Ohtsu, Hiroshi; Asai, Yusuke; Tsuzuki, Shinya; Suzuki, Setsuko; Toyoda, Ako; Suzuki, Kumiko; Endo, Mio; Fujii, Naoki; Suzuki, Michiyo; Saito, Sho; Uemura, Yukari; Shibata, Taro; Kondo, Masashi; Izumi, Kazuo; Terada-Hirashima, Junko; Mikami, Ayako; Sugiura, Wataru; Ohmagari, Norio",Clin. infect. dis,,502

Effective ART reduces morbidity and mortality rates among persons with HIV infection and prevents HIV transmission once viral load is suppressed to undetectable levels (2,3). In April 2019, through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR),* CDC launched an 18-month ART Surge program in nine Nigerian states to rapidly increase the number of persons with HIV infection receiving ART. CDC analyzed programmatic data gathered during March 31, 2019-September 30, 2020, to describe the ART Surge program's progress on case finding, ART initiation, patient retention, and ART Surge program growth. Overall, the weekly number of newly identified persons with HIV infection who initiated ART increased approximately eightfold, from 587 (week ending May 4, 2019) to 5,329 (week ending September 26, 2020). The ART Surge program resulted in 208,202 more HIV-infected persons receiving PEPFAR-supported ART despite the COVID-19 pandemic (97,387 more persons during March 31, 2019-March 31, 2020 and an additional 110,815 persons during April 2020-September 2020). Comprehensive, data-guided, locally adapted interventions and the use of incident command structures can help increase the number of persons with HIV infection who receive ART, reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality as well as decreasing HIV transmission.","Dirlikov, Emilio; Jahun, Ibrahim; Odafe, Solomon F; Obinna, Ogbanufe; Onyenuobi, Chibuzor; Ifunanya, Mgbakor; Efuntoye, Timothy A; Tingir, Nguhemen; Ene, Uzoma; Fagbemi, Ayodele; Meribe, Chidozie; Bassey, Orji; Ayo, Adeola; Fagbamigbe, Omodele Johnson; Amafah, Joy; Bamidele, Moyosola; Alagi, Matthias; Oladipo, Ademola; Dalhatu, Ibrahim; Okoye, McPaul; Onotu, Dennis; Gwamna, Jerry; Abrams, William A; Conner, Deborah A; Nwaohiri, Anuli; Carpenter, Deborah; Ijeoma, Ugonna C; Shah, Sarita; Tison, Laura I; Shah, Minesh; Chun, Helen; Williams-Sherlock, Michelle; Boyd, Andrew T; Bachanas, Pamela; Ikpeazu, Akudo; Aliyu, Gambo Gumel; Ellerbrock, Tedd; Swaminathan, Mahesh",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,502

In four preregistered studies (N = 3,718, Western population), we found that (a) empathy indeed relates to the motivation to adhere to physical distancing and to wearing face masks and (b) inducing empathy for people most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to these measures (whereas merely providing information about the importance of the measures does not).

Of the control measures implemented, only national lockdown brought the reproduction number (Rt eff) below 1 consistently; if introduced 1 week earlier, it could have reduced deaths in the first wave from an estimated 48,600 to 25,600 [95% credible interval (CrI): 15,900 to 38,400]. The infection fatality ratio decreased from 1.00% (95% CrI: 0.85 to 1.21%) to 0.79% (95% CrI: 0.63 to 0.99%), suggesting improved clinical care. The infection fatality ratio was higher in the elderly residing in care homes (23.3%, 95% CrI: 14.7 to 35.2%) than those residing in the community (7.9%, 95% CrI: 5.9 to 10.3%).

However, public attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies used during this pandemic are not well understood. Three experiments (preregistered; online samples; N = 1,868; U.S. residents) assessed attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies. The experiments evaluated assessments of utilitarian, egalitarian, prioritizing the worst-off, and social usefulness principles in conditions arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving resource scarcity, resource reallocation, and bias in resource allocation toward at-risk groups, such as the elderly or people of color. We found that participants agreed with allocation motivated by utilitarian principles and prioritizing the worst-off during initial distribution of resources and disagreed with allocation motivated by egalitarian and social usefulness principles. At reallocation, participants agreed with giving priority to those patients who received the resources first. Lastly, support for utilitarian allocation varied when saving the greatest number of lives resulted in disadvantage for at-risk or historically marginalized groups. Specifically, participants expressed higher levels of agreement with policies that shifted away from maximizing benefits to one that assigned the same priority to members of different groups if this mitigated disadvantage for people of color. Understanding these attitudes can contribute to developing triage policies, increase trust in health systems, and assist physicians in achieving their goals of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Buckwalter, Wesley; Peterson, Andrew",PLoS One,,502

Inducing a positive emotion narrowed perceived personal space, whereas inducing a negative emotion widened personal space. For both positive and negative emotions, the perceived interpersonal distance was shorter when the approaching face was unmasked than masked. There was no interaction effect on personal space between induced affect and masking or unmasking the approaching face. This study might provide insight into interpersonal behavior during a pandemic juncture.","Sakuma, Natsuo; Ikeda, Kazunari",Percept Mot Skills,,502
262901,COVID-19 and islamic social finance,2021,"Enterprises are the origin of social innovation. Enterprises implement sustainable relations through “people-oriented” social value creation, particularly other economic developments in the post-2020 COVID-19 pandemic no longer show linear development but more diversity. On the one hand, enterprises must face the fast social transformation towards AI and superintelligence. On the other hand, enterprises must cope with green sustainable development, emphasizing corporate social responsibility in innovative research and development. An increasing number of enterprises respond to the service-oriented and green sustainability-based consumer market today by expanding and collaborating between the upstream and downstream relations in supply chains. Therefore, enterprises must construct a healthy and sustainable dynamic value chain through value co-creation. The study analyzes the types of the dynamic brand value chain and the operational conditions that provide enterprises with the direction in searching for and establishing a sustainable partnership. We employ literature review, case analysis, and in-depth interviews to determine the types and causes of the dynamic brand value chain, followed by integrating sustainable design to verify the sustainability in the dynamic brand value chain model. The study findings show that growth in quadrants of culture for the tandem brand value chain acts as the primary motivation to strengthen a sustainable relationship. Subsequently, the development in pursuit of brand value creation will intensify the sustainable relationships and activities of the brand, causing sustainable partnerships to be more intense. The primary motivation for the branch brand value chain lies in the growth in quadrants of culture;the more extensive the development system, the more diverse the participating niche brand, and the brand value innovation of pursuit climbs higher.","Tzu-Fei, Hsiung Cheng Yueh-Hsiu Zi-Xun Han",Sustainability,,502
263087,"Infection control measures, in situ simulation, and failure modes and effect analysis to fine-tune change management during COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: Based on current evidence, recent guidelines of the National Institute of Health, USA indicated the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease, not requiring high-flow oxygen. No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. METHODS: The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by the ongoing RCTs.","Cantini, Fabrizio; Goletti, Delia; Petrone, Linda; Najafi Fard, Saied; Niccoli, Laura; Foti, Rosario",Drugs,,502
263688,Statement from the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges Regarding Safe Courts and Access to Justice During COVID‐19,2020,"Given the role of human behavior in the spread of disease, it is vital to understand what drives people to engage in or refrain from health-related behaviors during a pandemic. This paper examines factors associated with the adoption of self-protective health behaviors, such as social distancing and mask wearing, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the USA. These behaviors not only reduce an individual's own risk of infection but also limit the spread of disease to others. Despite these dual benefits, universal adoption of these behaviors is not assured. We focus on the role of socioeconomic differences in explaining behavior, relying on data collected in April 2020 during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. The data include information on income, gender and race along with unique variables relevant to the current pandemic, such as work arrangements and housing quality. We find that higher income is associated with larger changes in self-protective behaviors. These gradients are partially explained by the fact that people with less income are more likely to report circumstances that make adopting self-protective behaviors more difficult, such as an inability to tele-work. Both in the USA and elsewhere, policies that assume universal compliance with self-protective measures-or that otherwise do not account for socioeconomic differences in the costs of doing so-are unlikely to be effective or sustainable.","Papageorge, Nicholas W; Zahn, Matthew V; Belot, Michèle; van den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Choi, Syngjoo; Jamison, Julian C; Tripodi, Egon",J Popul Econ,,502
263733,Dataset of Jordanian university students' psychological health impacted by using e-learning tools during COVID-19,2020,"The delivery of endoscopic care is changing rapidly in the era of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) Endoscopy and Procedures Committee has formulated this statement to offer practical guidance to help standardize endoscopy services for pediatric patients with the aim of minimizing COVID-19 transmission to staff, patients, and caregivers and to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) during this critical time. Appropriate use of PPE is essential to minimize transmission and preserve supply. Pediatric endoscopic procedures are considered at high risk for COVID-19 transmission. We recommend that all pediatric endoscopic procedures are done in a negative pressure room with all staff using proper airborne, contact, and droplet precautions regardless of patient risk stratification. This includes appropriate use of a filtering face-piece respirator (N95, N99, FFP2/3, or PAPR), double gloves, facial protection (full visor and/or face shield), full body water-resistant disposable gown, shoe covers and a hairnet. In deciding which endoscopic procedures should proceed, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits to optimize healthcare delivery and minimize risk. To inform these decisions, we propose a framework for stratifying procedures as emergent (procedures that need to PROCEEED), urgent (PAUSE, weigh the benefits and risks in deciding whether to proceed) and elective (POSTPONE procedures). This statement was based on emerging evidence and is meant as a guide. It is important that all endoscopy facilities where pediatric procedures are performed follow current recommendations from public health agencies within their jurisdiction regarding infection prevention and control of COVID-19.","Walsh, Catharine M.; Fishman, Douglas S.; Lerner, Diana G.",J.

For this study, we conducted a large-scale comparative genome study of MERS-CoV from both human and dromedary camels from 2012 to 2019 to map any genetic changes that emerged in the past 8 years. We downloaded 1309 submissions, including 308 full-length genome sequences of MERS-CoV available in GenBank from 2012 to 2019. We used bioinformatics tools to describe the genome structure and organization of the virus and to map the most important motifs within various regions/genes throughout the genome over the past 8 years. We also monitored variations/mutations among these sequences since its emergence. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the cluster within African camels is derived by S gene. We identified some prominent motifs within the ORF1ab, S gene and ORF-5, which may be used for barcoding the African camel lineages of MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we mapped some sequence patterns that support the zoonotic origin of the virus from dromedary camels. Other sequences identified selection pressures, particularly within the N gene and the 5' UTR. Further studies are required for careful monitoring of the MERS-CoV genome to identify any potential significant mutations in the future.","Ba Abduallah, Mohamed M; Hemida, Maged Gomaa",Rev Med Virol,,502

In this paper, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on nuclear medicine departments in Africa (19 countries, 41 centers) and Latin America (15 countries, 83 centers) obtained from the survey. Respectively in Africa and Latin America, the volume of nuclear medicine procedures decreased by 69% and 79% in June 2020 and 44% and 67% in October 2020. Among the nuclear medicine procedures, oncological PET studies showed less of a decline in utilization compared to conventional nuclear medicine studies. A gradual trend towards a return to the pre-COVID-19 status of the supply chains of radioisotopes, generators, and other essential materials was evident. Overall, in 2020, the pandemic-related challenges resulted in significant decrease in nuclear medicine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in Africa and Latin America. The impact was more pronounced in Latin America than in Africa. The current COVID-19 pandemic poses many challenges for the practice of nuclear medicine. If adequately prepared, departments can continue to deliver their essential services, while mitigating the risk for patients and staff. This requires adapting the SOPs, as quickly as possible, to meet the new requirements.","Giammarile, Francesco; Delgado Bolton, Roberto C; El-Haj, Noura; Mikhail, Miriam; Morozova, Olga; Orellana, Pilar; Pellet, Olivier; Estrada Lobato, Enrique; Pynda, Yaroslav; Paez, Diana",Semin. nucl. med,,502

264626,Cross-Cultural Validity of Psychological Distress Measurement During the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"Some of the articles being published during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic highlight a link between severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the so-called cytokine storm, also with increased ferritin levels. However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined 'hyperferritinemic syndrome', which already includes adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.","Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier",,,502

The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia who required additional oxygen supplementation for hypoxia. We compared patients with and without ARDS based in their initial D-Dimer levels. Methods: Retrospective study conducted at BronxCare Hospital. Included all adult patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen for hypoxia during the period of March to May 2020. Patients were classified in two groups based in the presence or absence of ARDS;then they were sub-classified based in their initial D-dimer levels, D-dimer levels ≥ 4 times upper limit of normal (ULN) compared with patients with D-dimer levels ≤ 4 times ULN. Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), mechanical ventilation, shock, acute renal failure and thrombotic complications. Results: We identified 1242 patients. There were no differences for age, gender, race or comorbidities among the groups except for BMI. Mean age was 62.8 with 61% been males. There were 254(20.4%) patients in the ARDS and 988(79.5%) in the non-ARDS group. Hospital and ICU LOS was higher in patients with ARDS with D-dimer levels ≤ 4 times ULN. 33% of patients received mechanical ventilation, mainly in the ARDS group. Overall mortality was 36.6%. Mortality rate was higher in ARDS with D-dimer levels ≥ 4 ULN (81.4%) followed by patients with ARDS with D-dimer levels ≤ 4 times ULN (70.1%), non ARDS with D-dimer levels ≥ 4 ULN (35.7%) and non ARDS with D-dimer levels ≤ 4 times ULN (21.1%) (p&lt; 0.0001). On logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was seen in patients with ARDS irrespective of D-dimer levels, older age, history of asthma and presence of acute renal failure. Female sex and use of ascorbic acid showed decrease in mortality. Conclusions: Our study confirms prior findings in COVID-19 pneumonia. Patient with non-ARDS requiring supplemental oxygen despite lower levels of D-dimer have a significant mortality. Use of readily available data on admission can assist the clinicians for admission triage decisions and have implications on discharge planning and follow up. Closely monitor patients with Covid-19 associated acute respiratory failure for the need for mechanical ventilation, shock, acute renal failure and thrombotic complications.

In this study, the neuroimaging findings and clinical course of adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care hospital network in Canada were characterized. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary hospital network in Ontario, Canada. All adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted from February 1, 2020 to July 22, 2020 who received neuroimaging related to their COVID-19 admission were included. CT and MR images were reviewed and categorized by fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Demographic and clinical data were collected and correlated with imaging findings. RESULTS: We identified 422 patients admitted with COVID-19 during the study period. 103 (24.4%) met the inclusion criteria and were included: 30 ICU patients (29.1%) and 73 non-ICU patients (70.9%). A total of 198 neuroimaging studies were performed: 177 CTs and 21 MRIs. 17 out of 103 imaged patients (16.8%) had acute abnormalities on neuroimaging: 10 had macrohemorrhages (58.8%), 9 had acute ischemia (52.9%), 4 had SWI abnormalities (23.5%), and 1 had asymmetric sulcal effacement suggesting possible focal encephalitis (5.8%). ICU patients were more likely to have positive neuroimaging findings, more specifically acute ischemia and macrohemorrhages (P < 0.05). Macrohemorrhages were associated with increased mortality (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Macrohemorrhages, acute ischemia and SWI abnormalities were the main neuroimaging abnormalities in our cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Acute ischemia and hemorrhage were associated with worse clinical status.","Jegatheeswaran, Vibeeshan; Chan, Michael W K; Chakrabarti, Sumon; Fawcett, Adrian; Chen, Yingming Amy",Can Assoc Radiol J,,502

Although this has generated high levels of exhaustion, it may also have contributed to feelings of professional satisfaction. The objective of this study was to explore the levels of satisfaction among nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the role of job demands, resources and emotional experiences in explaining their levels of satisfaction. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain between March and May 2020. Three hundred and thirty-five nursing home workers participated. A quantitative analysis was conducted, as was a content analysis of the responses to an open-ended question about the respondents' perceptions of job demands and resources during the crisis. The results showed that workers had very high levels of satisfaction. Social pressure from work, contact with death and suffering, and emotional exhaustion were negatively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, under conditions of extensive contact with suffering people and great fear of contagion, social support at work was shown to promote professional satisfaction. In conclusion, nursing home workers in Spain experienced high rates of satisfaction during the COVID-19 crisis despite the high job demands, lack of job resources, fear of contagion and exhaustion. The main practical implication of this study is the importance of ensuring optimal working conditions in the nursing home sector in order to guarantee professional satisfaction, prevent burnout, reduce turnover and promote post-crisis resilience.","Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Amutio, Alberto; Moreno-Jiménez, Bernardo; Garrosa, Eva",Heal. soc. care community,,502

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from the proband and his pedigree members for the extraction of genomic DNA. Mutational analysis was performed on the proband through whole-exome sequencing. Suspected variant was verified by Sanger sequencing. A series of molecular methods including PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation and transformation were also used to construct wild-type and mutant eukaryotic expression vectors of the PKD2 gene, which were transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells for the observation of protein expression and cell localization. RESULTS: The proband was found to harbor a c.2051dupA (p. Tyr684Ter) frame shift mutation of the PKD2 gene, which caused repeat of the 2051st nucleotide of its cDNA sequence and a truncated protein. Immunofluorescence experiment showed that the localization of the mutant protein within the cell was altered compared with the wild-type, which may be due to deletion of the C-terminus of the PKD2 gene.

With the ongoing struggle across the globe to combat COVID-19 disease, published literature has described the role of kidney disease in COVID-19 patients based on single/multicenter experiences across the globe. We extracted data from observational studies describing comorbid CKD, AKI and CRRT and outcomes and severity of COVID-19-hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019-August 20, 2020 following PRISMA guidelines. Severity of COVID-19 includes intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation < 90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilization, in-hospital admission and mortality. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled estimates, and forest plots were created. In total, 29 studies with 15,017 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of AKI was 11.6% [(430/3693)], comorbid CKD 9.7% [(1342/13,728)] and CRRT 2.58% [(102/3946)] in our meta-analysis.

Hobbes's conceptions of the state of nature and the body politic are eerily relevant to the present political crises, especially in the United States. In a personal narrative that is both arch and absolutely serious, I reveal how a woman-empowering vision of a healthy global body politic can be teased out of Hobbes's political thought and used to combat the fatalistic view of humanity's inevitable descent into a chaotic state of nature during times of crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","Botting, Eileen Hunt",Hist.

268751,On the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality in Florida,2021,"BACKGROUND: The provision of Section 2302 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed pediatric patients who are enrolled in Medicaid to receive hospice care concurrently with curative treatment (i.e., concurrent hospice care). Because it is a relatively new model of care and very little is known about the characteristics of children with cancer who receive it, the purpose of the current study was to compare demographic, health, and community characteristics of children who received standard hospice care versus concurrent hospice care. PROCEDURE: This study was a retrospective, comparison study with national Medicaid files provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The sample included 1685 pediatric patients under the age of 20 who were diagnosed with cancer, were enrolled in hospice between 2011 and 2013, and received standard hospice care (n = 1008) or concurrent hospice care (n = 655). RESULTS: Children of non-Hispanic White race with multiple complex chronic conditions, mental/behavioral health problems technology dependence, and brain and orbital tumors were more likely to be enrolled in concurrent care than in standard hospice care. The proportion of children enrolled in concurrent care versus standard hospice care was larger in rural areas, low-income communities, and in the Southern states. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced uptake of concurrent care by traditionally underserved populations is promising. Concurrent hospice care, which allows for continued medical treatment and hospice care, could enhance access to hospice within these populations by offering a more blended model of care.","Svynarenko, Radion; Mack, Jennifer W; Lindley, Lisa C",Pediatr Blood Cancer,,502

We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site. The high affinity of 6D3 for the furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8. The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site.","Cheng, Mary Hongying; Porritt, Rebecca A; Rivas, Magali Noval; Krieger, James M; Ozdemir, Asli Beyza; Garcia, Gustavo; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Fries, Bettina C; Arditi, Moshe; Bahar, Ivet",,,502

A case study of a German university website during two waves of the pandemic,2021,"Studies on diabetes have long been hampered by a lack of authentic disease models that, ideally, should be unlimited and able to recapitulate the abnormalities involved in the development, structure, and function of human pancreatic islets under pathological conditions. Stem cell-based islet organoids faithfully recapitulate islet development in vitro and provide large amounts of three-dimensional functional islet biomimetic materials with a morphological structure and cellular composition similar to those of native islets. Thus, islet organoids hold great promise for modeling islet development and function, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes, providing an in vitro human organ model for infection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and contributing to drug screening and autologous islet transplantation. However, the currently established islet organoids are generally immature compared with native islets, and further efforts should be made to improve the heterogeneity and functionality of islet organoids, making it an authentic and informative disease model for diabetes. Here, we review the advances and challenges in the generation of islet organoids, focusing on human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet organoids, and the potential applications of islet organoids as disease models and regenerative therapies for diabetes.","Zhang, Xiaofei; Ma, Zhuo; Song, Eli; Xu, Tao",Protein Cell (Online),,502

Increasing frontline teams' quality improvement (QI) capability may increase the implementation readiness and success of EBI implementation. OBJECTIVES: Develop a QI training program (""Learn. Engage. Act. Process."" (LEAP)) and evaluate its impact on frontline obesity treatment teams to improve treatment delivered within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN: This was a pre-post evaluation of the LEAP program. MOVE! coordinators (N = 68) were invited to participate in LEAP; 24 were randomly assigned to four starting times. MOVE! coordinators formed teams to work on improvement aims. Pre-post surveys assessed team organizational readiness for implementing change and self-rated QI skills. Program satisfaction, assignment completion, and aim achievement were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: VHA facility-based MOVE! teams. INTERVENTIONS: LEAP is a 21-week QI training program. Core components include audit and feedback reports, structured curriculum, coaching and learning community, and online platform. MAIN MEASURES: Organizational readiness for implementing change (ORIC); self-rated QI skills before and after LEAP; assignment completion and aim achievement; program satisfaction. KEY RESULTS: Seventeen of 24 randomized teams participated in LEAP. Participants' self-ratings across six categories of QI skills increased after completing LEAP (p< 0.0001). The ORIC measure showed no statistically significant change overall; the change efficacy subscale marginally improved (p < 0.08), and the change commitment subscale remained the same (p = 0.66). Depending on the assignment, 35 to 100% of teams completed the assignment. Nine teams achieved their aim. Most team members were satisfied or very satisfied (81-89%) with the LEAP components, 74% intended to continue using QI methods, and 81% planned to continue improvement work. CONCLUSIONS: LEAP is scalable and does not require travel or time away from clinical responsibilities. While QI skills improved among participating teams and most completed the work, they struggled to do so amid competing clinical priorities.","Damschroder, Laura J; Yankey, Nicholas R; Robinson, Claire H; Freitag, Michelle B; Burns, Jennifer A; Raffa, Susan D; Lowery, Julie C",J. gen. intern. med,,502

273908,The impact of covid-19 on financial management: evidence from Romania,2021,"A number of recent retrospective studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater are associated with COVID-19 cases in the corresponding sewersheds. Implementing high-resolution, prospective efforts across multiple plants depends on sensitive measurements that are representative of COVID-19 cases, scalable for high throughput analysis, and comparable across laboratories. We conducted a prospective study across eight publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). A focus on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids enabled us to scale-up our measurements with a commercial lab partner. Samples were collected daily and results were posted to a website within 24-hours. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in daily samples correlated to incidence COVID-19 cases in the sewersheds; a 1 log10 increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in settled solids corresponds to a 0.58 log10 (4X) increase in sewershed incidence rate. SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals measured with the commercial laboratory partner were comparable across plants and to measurements conducted in a university laboratory when normalized by pepper mild mottle virus PMMoV RNA. Results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be detectable in settled solids for COVID-19 incidence rates > 1/100,000 (range 0.8 - 2.3 cases per 100,000). These sensitive, representative, scalable, and comparable methods will be valuable for future efforts to scale-up wastewater-based epidemiology. ImportanceAccess to reliable, rapid monitoring data is critical to guide response to an infectious disease outbreak. For pathogens that are shed in feces or urine, monitoring wastewater can provide a cost-effective snapshot of transmission in an entire community via a single sample. In order for a method to be useful for ongoing COVID-19 monitoring, it should be sensitive for detection of low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, representative of incidence rates in the community, scalable to generate data quickly, and comparable across laboratories. This paper presents a method utilizing wastewater solids to meet these goals, producing measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA strongly associated with COVID-19 cases in the sewershed of a publicly owned treatment work. Results, provided within 24 hrs, can be used to detect incidence rates as low as approximately 1/100,000 cases and can be normalized for comparison across locations generating data using different methods.","Wolfe, Marlene K; Topol, Aaron; Knudson, Alisha; Simpson, Adrian; White, Bradley J; Vugia, Duc J; Yu, Alexander T; Li, Linlin; Balliet, Michael; Stoddard, Pamela; Han, George S; Wigginton, Krista R; Boehm, Alexandria B",,,502

This study considers meeting the increased demand of the customers for an essential product of daily life like toilet paper during a pandemic is beyond the traditional economic objective, i.e., increase profit, of the manufacturers. Instead, this should be more about the social responsibility of all the manufactures to ensure that they can serve more customers. Motivated by this and taking toilet paper as an example of the product, we first analyzed the current scenario of the manufacturing and the demand for the product and then proposed some strategies to deal with this unprecedented risk and analyzed the results. We have compared the results, using hypothetical data, between the current scenario and proposed strategies. The result shows that sharing information and resources from all manufacturers to produce under a single brand, emergency sourcing, producing basic quality items, and packing in the smallest sizes have a significant positive impact on the service level.

Recent work suggests that images are more influential than text and often appear alongside fake text. To this end, several multimodal models have been proposed in recent years that use images along with text to detect fake news on social media sites like Twitter. However, the role of images is not well understood for claim detection, specifically using transformer-based textual and multimodal models. We investigate state-of-the-art models for images, text (Transformer-based), and multimodal information for four different datasets across two languages to understand the role of images in the task of claim and conspiracy detection.","Cheema, Gullal S.; Hakimov, Sherzod; Muller-Budack, Eric; Ewerth, Ralph",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09602v1.pdf,502

274979,Online Training of University Students as Taekwondo Referees during a Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"The extensive use of antibiotics in aquaculture has resulted in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, consequently, new antibacterial strategies or drugs with clear modes of action are urgently needed. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are currently widely considered as alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of infections in aquatic animals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of NKL-24, a truncated peptide derived from zebrafish NK-lysin, against Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results showed that NKL-24 had a potent antibacterial effect against V. parahaemolyticus via a membrane active cell-killing mechanism. The in vitro study showed that sub-lethal levels of NKL-24 obviously reduced bacterial swimming ability and downregulated the transcription of the selected genes associated with V. parahaemolyticus virulence. Studies on NKL-24 biosafety in hemocytes and in Yesso scallop have shown no adverse effects from this peptide. Bacteria challenge test results demonstrated that NKL-24 significantly decreased the mortality and inhibited bacterial growth in the scallop infected with V. parahaemolyticus, while further in vivo examination revealed that NKL-24 could enhance non-specific immune parameters. Moreover, NKL-24 was capable of modulating a series of V. parahaemolyticus-responsive genes in the scallop. These results suggest the protective action of NKL-24 against V. parahaemolyticus and the potential of this peptide as a promising candidate for aquaculture applications.","Shan, Zhongguo; Yang, Yanpeng; Guan, Ning; Xia, Xiaodong; Liu, Weidong",Fish Shellfish Immunol,,502

Patients with metabolic syndrome suffer from severe complications and a higher mortality rate due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We recently proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can hijack host mitochondrial function and manipulate metabolic pathways for their own advantage. The aim of the current study was to investigate functional mitochondrial changes in live peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19 and to decipher the pathways of substrate utilization in these cells and corresponding changes in the inflammatory pathways. We demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic alterations with an increase in glycolysis, and high levels of mitokine in PBMCs from patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 mitokine correlate with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. These data suggest that patients with COVID-19 have a compromised mitochondrial function and an energy deficit that is compensated by a metabolic switch to glycolysis. This metabolic manipulation by SARS-CoV-2 triggers an enhanced inflammatory response that contributes to the severity of symptoms in COVID-19. Targeting mitochondrial metabolic pathway(s) can help define novel strategies for COVID-19.","Ajaz, Saima; McPhail, Mark J; Singh, Keshav K; Mujib, Salma; Trovato, Francesca M; Napoli, Salvatore; Agarwal, Kosh",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,,502

The SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 2 112 844 deaths as of late January 2021. We compared genetic code preferences in 496 viruses, including 34 coronaviruses and 242 corresponding hosts, to uncover patterns that distinguish single- and 'promiscuous' multiple-host-infecting viruses. Based on a codon usage preference score, promiscuous viruses were shown to significantly employ nonoptimal codons, namely codons that involve 'wobble' binding to anticodons, as compared to single-host viruses. The codon adaptation index (CAI) and the effective number of codons (ENC) were calculated for all viruses and hosts. Promiscuous viruses were less adapted hosts vs single-host viruses (P-value = 4.392e-11). All coronaviruses exploit nonoptimal codons to infect multiple hosts. We found that nonoptimal codon preferences at the beginning of viral coding sequences enhance the translational efficiency of viral proteins within the host. Finally, coronaviruses lack endogenous RNA degradation motifs to a significant degree, thereby increasing viral mRNA burden and infection load. To conclude, we found that promiscuously infecting coronaviruses prefer nonoptimal codon usage to remove degradation motifs from their RNAs and to dramatically increase their viral RNA production rates.","Carmi, Gon; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Mukherjee, Sumit; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",FEBS j,,502
276393,Ensuring social acceptability of technological tracking in the COVID-19 context,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery. METHODS: A model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber was used. Three-port 25 gauge vitrectomy simulated surgery was performed with any visible aerosol production recorded using high-speed 4K camera. The following were assessed: (1) vitrector at maximum cut rate in static and dynamic conditions inside the model, (2) vitrector at air-fluid interface in a physical model, (3) passive fluid-air exchange with a backflush hand piece, (4) valved cannulas under air, and (5) a defective valved cannula under air. RESULTS: No visible aerosol or droplets were identified when the vitrector was used within the model. In the physical model, no visible aerosol or droplets were seen when the vitrector was engaged at the air-fluid interface. Droplets were produced from the opening of backflush hand piece during passive fluid-air exchange. No visible aerosol was produced from the intact valved cannulas under air pressure, but droplets were seen at the beginning of fluid-air exchange when the valved cannula was defective. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery with competent valved cannulas. In the physical model, no visible aerosol was generated by the high-speed vitrector despite cutting at the air-fluid interface.","Liyanage, Sidath; Ramasamy, Pathma; Elhaddad, Omar; Darcy, Kieren; Hudson, Andrew; Keller, Johannes",,,502

Advanced organ support for lung and heart offers the possibility to buy the time needed for recovery. However, remaining a bridging strategy, extracorporeal life support cannot act as the ultimate treatment for the underlying COVID-19 disease. Appropriate patient selection criteria addressed by experts and scientific organizations, such as Extracorporeal Life Support Organization and World Health Organization, may provide significant help in the difficult decision-making and to reduce mortality in patients with profound respiratory and/or cardiac failure due to COVID-19. Severe, systemic cytokine-mediated inflammation associated with the SARS-CoV-2 has also been described. Effects of crosstalk between coagulation and inflammatory pathways appear to significantly affect disease progression and lead to poor outcomes. Multiple therapeutic strategies, including antibody therapies (such as Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, Siltuximab), therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and blood purification techniques for direct removal of cytokines, including filtration, dialysis (diffusion), and adsorption are available. Further, we believe, that research should be facilitated and promoted, particularly under the guidance of recognized scientific societies or expert-based multicenter investigation, with rapid communication of critical and relevant information to enhance better appraisal of patient profiles, complications, and treatment modalities.","Swol, Justyna; Lorusso, Roberto",Artif Organs,,502

A small percentage of cases persist with prolonged positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for prolonged viral shedding amongst patient's basal clinical conditions. METHODS: We have evaluated all 513 patients attended in our hospital between 1 March and 1 July. We have selected all 18 patients with prolonged viral shedding and compared them with 36 sex-matched randomly selected controls. Demographic, treatment and clinical data were systematically collected. RESULTS: Global median duration of viral clearance was 25.5 days (n = 54; IQR, 22-39.3 days), 48.5 days in cases (IQR 38.7-54.9 days) and 23 days in controls (IQR 20.2-25.7), respectively. There were not observed differences in demographic, symptoms or treatment data between groups. Chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy were more common in patients with prolonged viral shedding (67%) compared with controls (11% and 25% respectively) (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003). The use of inhaled corticosteroids was also more frequent in case group (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis indicated that CRS (odds ratio [OR], 18.78; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 3.89-90.59; P < 0.001) was independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in URT samples, after adjusting for initial PCR Ct values. CONCLUSION: We found that chronic rhinosinusitis and atopy might be associated with increased risk of prolonged viral shedding. If confirmed in prospective trials, this finding might have clinical implications for quarantine duration due to increased risk of pandemic spread.","Recalde-Zamacona, B; Tomás-Velázquez, A; Campo, A; Satrústegui-Alzugaray, B; Fernández-Alonso, M; Iñigo, M; Rodríguez-Mateos, M; Di Frisco, M; Felgueroso, C; Bertó, J; Marín-Oto, M; Alcaide, A B; Zulueta, J J; Seijo, L; Landecho, M F",J Intern Med,,502

283549,An Evaluation of How Educators in Virtual Teams Perceive Charismatic Leadership During the COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China late in 2019. Nine months later (Sept. 23, 2020), the virus has infected > 31.6 million people around the world and caused > 971.000 (3.07 %) fatalities in 220 countries and territories. Research on the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, its mutants and their penetrance can aid future defense strategies. By analyzing sequence data deposited between December 2019 and end of May 2020, we have compared nucleotide sequences of 570 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, Europe, the US, and India to the sequence of the Wuhan isolate. During worldwide spreading among human populations, at least 10 distinct hotspot mutations had been selected and found in up to > 80 % of viral genomes. Many of these mutations led to amino acid exchanges in replication-relevant viral proteins. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome would also impinge upon the secondary structure of the viral RNA molecule and its repertoire of interactions with essential cellular and viral proteins. The increasing frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutation hotspots might select for dangerous viral pathogens. Alternatively, in a 29.900 nucleotide-genome, there might be a limit to the number of mutable and selectable sites which, when exhausted, could prove disadvantageous to viral survival. The speed, at which novel SARS-CoV-2 mutants are selected and dispersed around the world, could pose problems for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.","Weber, Stefanie; Ramirez, Christina; Doerfler, Walter",Virus Res,,502

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy recipients have a higher risk of mortality with COVID-19 owing to profound immune dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients. This single-center prospective study included all (n = 58) adult HCT/CAR-T recipients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the University of Kansas Medical Center between March 2020 and May 2021. Baseline and disease-related characteristics were ascertained from medical records. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Bivariate analyses, using the chi-square and t-test, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. The study included 58 HCT/CAR-T patients who acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, including recipients of allogeneic HCT (n = 32), autologous HCT (n = 23), and CAR-T therapy (n = 3). The median patient age was 58 years (range, 24 to 77 years), and 64% were males. The median time from HCT/CAR-T therapy to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 17.7 months (range, 0.2 to 201.9 months), and 22% of the patients acquired SARS-CoV-2 within the first 100 days post-HCT/CAR-T therapy. The primary hematologic disorders were plasma cell (36%), myeloid (38%), and lymphoid (26%) malignancies. Myeloablative conditioning was performed in 62% of patients. Donors were autologous (45%), matched sibling (15%), matched unrelated (21%), and haploidentical (19%). Prior history of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), active GVHD, and current immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was noted in 22%, 31%, and 36% of patients, respectively. Concurrent infections were observed in 19%. Lymphopenia (P = .049) and high serum ferritin concentration (P = .020) were associated with mortality. COVID-19 severity was mild in 50% of the patients, moderate in 22%, and severe in 28%. Clinical findings included pneumonia or abnormal chest imaging (in 50%), hypoxia (28%), intensive care unit admission (19%), and mechanical ventilation (10%). Therapies included remdesivir (in 41%), convalescent plasma (35%), dexamethasone (22%), monoclonal antibodies (19%), and tocilizumab (3%). The median duration of viral shedding (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR) was 7.7 weeks (range, 2 to 18.7 weeks), and 2 patients had a persistent infection for >5 months post-CAR-T therapy. After a median follow-up of 6.1 months (range, 0.5-13.6 months), the mortality rate was 16% in all patients and 28% in allogeneic HCT recipients. Among 9 patients who died, the median survival after SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23 days (range, 14 to 140 days). In survivors with moderate-severe COVID-19, the median time to recovery was 4.2 weeks (range, 1.1 to 24.7 weeks). Among allogeneic HCT recipients, 5 (16%) developed subsequent pulmonary chronic GVHD necessitating systemic steroids and additional IST. Significant predictors of COVID-19 severity included allogeneic HCT (odds ratio [OR], 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 10.8; P = .020), history of grade II-IV acute GVHD (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.10 to 18.86; P = .036) and concurrent IST (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 19.8; P = .004). HCT and CAR-T cell therapy recipients are at an increased risk of moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and higher mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings confirm the need for continuing vigilance with social distancing and masks, vaccination prioritization, close monitoring, and aggressive treatment of HCT/CAR-T therapy recipients.","Mushtaq, Muhammad Umair; Shahzad, Moazzam; Chaudhary, Sibgha Gull; Luder, Mary; Ahmed, Nausheen; Abdelhakim, Haitham; Bansal, Rajat; Balusu, Ramesh; DeJarnette, Shaun; Divine, Clint; Kribs, Robert; Shune, Leyla; Singh, Anurag K; Ganguly, Siddhartha; Abhyankar, Sunil H; McGuirk, Joseph P",,,502

Commitment of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using an online survey, with particular focus on their burdens and anxieties. This survey was distributed to students within a 2-week period in April and May 2020. Ultimately, 1241 participants were included in the analysis. During the pandemic, 67.9% (65.3% to 70.5%) of the participants reported that they had volunteered. Furthermore, 88.9% (86.9% to 90.5%) stated that they were against compulsory recruitment in this context. Students who volunteered (committed students) had a significantly lower anxiety index than non-committed students. Additionally, students were more concerned about infecting other patients and relatives than themselves. Higher levels of anxiety were related to lower levels of commitment. A mandatory assignment during the pandemic was rejected by the students and does not seem to be necessary due to the large number of volunteers.","Mihatsch, Lorenz; von der Linde, Mira; Knolle, Franziska; Luchting, Benjamin; Dimitriadis, Konstantinos; Heyn, Jens",J. med. ethics,,502

In particular, it has played an important role during the COVID-19 epidemic. One of the important composites of ECMO is membrane oxygenator, and the core composite of the membrane oxygenator is hollow fiber membrane, which is not only a place for blood oxygenation, but also is a barrier between the blood and gas side. However, the formation of blood clots in the oxygenator is a key problem in the using process. According to the study of the mechanism of thrombosis generation, it was found that improving the hemocompatibility is an efficient approach to reduce thrombus formation by modifying the surface of materials. In this review, the corresponding modification methods (surface property regulation, anticoagulant grafting, and bio-interface design) of hollow fiber membranes in ECMO are classified and discussed, and then, the research status and development prospects are summarized.","He, Ting; He, Jinhui; Wang, Zhaohui; Cui, Zhaoliang",Adv Compos Hybrid Mater,,502

Based on mask configuration, specific surgical wrap selected, and ply, the recommended filtration efficiency for isolation and surgical masks of 95% and 98%, respectively can be achieved. These alternative masks can allow for similar coverage and safety when hospital-grade isolation masks are in short supply.","Bayersdorfer, Jennifer; Giboney, Sue; Martin, Rosemary; Moore, Andria; Bartles, Rebecca",Am J Infect Control,,502
286755,When behavioural science can make a difference in times of COVID-19,2021,"To investigate the prognostic role and the major determinants of serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy -chain (pNfH) concentration across a large cohort of motor neuron disease (MND) phenotypes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum pNfH concentration in 219 MND patients consecutively enrolled in our tertiary MND clinic. A multifactorial analysis was carried out to investigate the major clinical determinants of serum pNfH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore the prognostic value of serum pNfH. Serum pNfH levels were not homogenous among MND phenotypes; higher concentrations in pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes were observed. C9orf72-MND exhibited higher pNfH concentrations compared to non-C9orf72 MND. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed mean MEP/cMAP and disease progression rate as the two major predictors of serum pNfH levels (R2 = 0.188; p &#8804; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant difference of survival among MND subgroups when divided into quartiles based on pNfH concentrations, log-rank X2 = 53.0, p &#8804; 0.0001. Our study evidenced that higher serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival. In Cox multivariate model, pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to the other factors influencing survival included in the analysis. pNfH differs among the MND phenotypes and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides supporting evidence of the role of pNfH as useful prognostic biomarker for MND patients. Neurofilament measurements should be considered in the future prognostic models and in clinical trials for biomarker-based stratification, and to evaluate treatment response.","Falzone, Yuri Matteo; Domi, Teuta; Agosta, Federica; Pozzi, Laura; Schito, Paride; Fazio, Raffaella; Del Carro, Ubaldo; Barbieri, Alessandra; Comola, Mauro; Leocani, Letizia; Comi, Giancarlo; Carrera, Paola; Filippi, Massimo; Quattrini, Angelo; Riva, Nilo",J Neurol,,502
287139,Disability and old age: the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The course of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 may be aggravated by bioaerosols containing other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, occurring mainly in the occupational environment. Hence, the diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 should address such a possibility in the anamnesis, treatment and final recommendations for avoiding of adverse exposure. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: As SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the respiratory system and the severe manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, diagnostics should include the following clinical and laboratory examinations: chest X-ray; high resolution computed tomography (HRCT); pulmonary function tests; arterial-blood gas test; genetic tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, in the future with the use of highly specific and sensitive nano-based biosensors; tests for the presence of specific immunity against the antigens of microorganisms causing other infectious or allergic pulmonary diseases (in the case of anamnestic indications). Because an universally accepted treatment for COVID-19 does not exist, the hitherto prescribed antiviral and immune-modulating drugs should be used be with caution. In many cases, a better alternative could be a safe supportive therapy, such as supplementation of the diet with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements. SUMMARY: The most important preventive measures against COVID-19 should include: vaccination; the use of filter or surgical masks; disinfection and sterilization; maintaining of well-functioning ventilation and air conditioning systems; reduction of the community air pollution which has been identified as an important factor increasing the COVID-19 severity. In the choice of preventive measures, the above should be considered for their potential efficacy against other bioaerosols as potential disease-aggravating agents.","Mackiewicz, Barbara; Lemieszek, Marta Kinga; Dutkiewicz, Jacek",Ann Agric Environ Med,,502
287205,"Persistent high PM2.5 pollution driven by unfavorable meteorological conditions during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China",2021,"In recent decades, the safety and health of workers in Europe has steadily improved, in no small part due to the implementation of the results of ergonomics research. However, European OSH systems are facing a number of challenges, which have been increasingly brought to the attention of policymakers and the public in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This article examines some of these central challenges to occupational safety and health from a European perspective. It is based on a position paper prepared by the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) together with other European OSH institutes from the research network PEROSH on the occasion of the EU Commission's consultation process for a new European OSH strategy. The article not only highlights the European specifics of many challenges. Rather, it also understands these challenges as strategic fields of action for ergonomics, in order to demonstrate the potential of ergonomics in the development of joint European OSH solutions-as basis for the solution of problems caused by globalisation.","Windel, Armin; Haus-Rybicki, Sebastian",Z Arbeitswiss,,502

After confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500â mg) or placebo, TID, for 5â days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation, and hospitalisation rate. Adverse events were also assessed.From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analysed. Median time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4-5)â days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms. Swabs collected were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in 29.9% of patients in the nitazoxanide arm versus 18.2% in the placebo arm (p=0.009). Viral load was also reduced after nitazoxanide compared to placebo (p=0.006). The percent viral load reduction from onset to end of therapy was higher with nitazoxanide (55%) than placebo (45%) (p=0.013). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different. No serious adverse events were observed.In patients with mild Covid-19, symptom resolution did not differ between nitazoxanide and placebo groups after 5â days of therapy. However, early nitazoxanide therapy was safe and reduced viral load significantly.","Rocco, Patricia R M; Silva, Pedro L; Cruz, Fernanda F; Junior, Marco Antonio C M; Tierno, Paulo F G M M; Moura, Marcos A; De Oliveira, Luís Frederico G; Lima, Cristiano C; Dos Santos, Ezequiel A; Junior, Walter F; Fernandes, Ana Paula S M; Franchini, Kleber G; Magri, Erick; de Moraes, Nara F; Gonçalves, José Mário J; Carbonieri, Melanie N; Dos Santos, Ivonise S; Paes, Natália F; Maciel, Paula V M; Rocha, Raissa P; de Carvalho, Alex F; Alves, Pedro Augusto; Modena, José Luiz P; Cordeiro, Artur T; Trivella, Daniela B B; Marques, Rafael E; Luiz, Ronir R; Pelosi, Paolo; Lapa E Silva, Jose Roberto",Eur. respir. j,,502

288256,“Evidence from the Pre COVID pandemic- for a greener recovery”,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 has spread to more than 200 countries and territories. But less is known about the knowledge, protection behavior and anxiety regarding the outbreak among the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted in China and abroad from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Socio-demographic information was collected and knowledge scores, practice scores, anxiety scores and perceived risk were calculated. General linear model and binary logistic regression were used to identify possible associations. RESULTS: We included 9,764 individuals in this study, and 156 (1.6%) were from Hubei Province. The average knowledge score was 4.7 (standard deviation, 1.0) (scored on a 6-point scale); 96.1% maintained hand hygiene, and 90.3% of participants had varying levels of anxiety. People in Hubei Province were the most anxious, followed by those in Beijing and Shanghai. People who had experienced risk behaviors did not pay more attention to wearing masks and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: The public had high awareness on knowledge of COVID-19 outbreak, and a high proportion of people practiced good hand hygiene behavior. Many people claimed anxiety, especially in heavily affected areas during pandemic, suggesting the importance of closing the gap between risk awareness and good practice and conduct psychological counseling to public and patients.","Han, Bingfeng; Zhao, Tianshuo; Liu, Bei; Liu, Hanyu; Zheng, Hui; Wan, Yongmei; Qiu, Jiayi; Zhuang, Hui; Cui, Fuqiang",J Epidemiol,,502
288257,“Evidence from the Pre COVID pandemic- for a greener recovery”,2021,"Acute ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and the most common cause of disability in adults worldwide. Despite advances in the understanding of stroke pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. In this study, we explored the interaction of Shrm4 and the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABAB ) in ischemic stroke. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced by filament insertion in Shrm4+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Baclofen was administered was used to activate GABAB in vivo during reperfusion. Neurological deficits, motor and memory functions, and infarct volume were determined in the various mouse groups. Furthermore, we also developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model in primary neurons to test Shrm4/GABAB interactions in vitro. Shrm4 was observed to decrease infarct volume and neuronal cell loss in penumbra, and rescue neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Notably, Shrm4 also increased pole climbing speed, reduced foot faults, and increased escape latency in the Morris water maze test, while reducing neuron autophagy through an interaction with GABAB receptors. GABAB activation using baclofen further reduced OGD-induced neuron damage in culture and stroke outcomes of MCAO, relative to Shrm4 alone. Taken together, Shrm4-mediated GABAB activation confers neuroprotection by reducing neuronal autophagy in acute ischemic stroke.","Yuan, Ya-Jing; Ye, Zhi; Yu, Hao; Chen, Yang; Wang, Yu-Wen; Zhao, Jun-Hua; Sun, Ji-Feng; Xu, Li-Ming",FASEB j,,502
288579,Investigating Whether Blood Type Is Linked to COVID-19 Risk,2020,"BACKGROUND: The clinical progress of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is often associated with severe pneumonia which may require intensive care, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The length of intensive care and the duration of these supportive therapies are clinically relevant outcomes. From the statistical perspective, these quantities are challenging to estimate due to episodes being time-dependent and potentially multiple, as well as being determined by the competing, terminal events of discharge alive and death. METHODS: We used multistate models to study COVID-19 patients' time-dependent progress and provide a statistical framework to estimate hazard rates and transition probabilities. These estimates can then be used to quantify average sojourn times of clinically important states such as intensive care and invasive ventilation. We have made two real data sets of COVID-19 patients (n = 24* and n = 53**) and the corresponding statistical code publically available. RESULTS: The expected lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay at day 28 for the two cohorts were 15.05* and 19.62** days, while expected durations of mechanical ventilation were 7.97* and 9.85** days. Predicted mortality stood at 51%* and 15%**. Patients mechanically ventilated at the start of the example studies had a longer expected duration of ventilation (12.25*, 14.57** days) compared to patients non-ventilated (4.34*, 1.41** days) after 28 days. Furthermore, initially ventilated patients had a higher risk of death (54%* and 20%** vs. 48%* and 6%**) after 4 weeks. These results are further illustrated in stacked probability plots for the two groups from time zero, as well as for the entire cohort which depicts the predicted proportions of the patients in each state over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The multistate approach gives important insights into the progress of COVID-19 patients in terms of ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and mortality. In addition to avoiding frequent pitfalls in survival analysis, the methodology enables active cases to be analyzed by allowing for censoring. The stacked probability plots provide extensive information in a concise manner that can be easily conveyed to decision makers regarding healthcare capacities. Furthermore, clear comparisons can be made among different baseline characteristics.","Hazard, Derek; Kaier, Klaus; von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Bugiera, Lars; Lambert, Jerome; Wolkewitz, Martin",BMC Med Res Methodol,,502
289041,The secondary effects of a pandemic: «social distancing» and digital activism,2020,"Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).","Kimball, Anne; Hatfield, Kelly M; Arons, Melissa; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Tanwar, Sukarma; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M; Methner, Mark; Harney, Josh; Jacobs, Jesica R; Carlson, Christina M; McLaughlin, Heather P; Stone, Nimalie; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Gant, Jessica; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Clark, Thomas A; Honein, Margaret A; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,502

However, the factors and mechanisms that control neural APA isoforms are not well understood. Here, we show that three ELAV/Hu RNA binding proteins (Elav, Rbp9, and Fne) have similar capacities to induce a lengthened 3' UTR landscape in an ectopic setting. These factors promote accumulation of chromatin-associated, 3' UTR-extended, nascent transcripts, through inhibition of proximal polyadenylation site (PAS) usage. Notably, Elav represses an unannotated splice isoform of fne, switching the normally cytoplasmic Fne toward the nucleus in elav mutants. We use genomic profiling to reveal strong and broad loss of neural APA in elav/fne double mutant CNS, the first genetic background to largely abrogate this distinct APA signature. Overall, we demonstrate how regulatory interplay and functionally overlapping activities of neural ELAV/Hu RBPs drives the neural APA landscape.","Wei, Lu; Lee, Seungjae; Majumdar, Sonali; Zhang, Binglong; Sanfilippo, Piero; Joseph, Brian; Miura, Pedro; Soller, Matthias; Lai, Eric C",Mol Cell,,502

In this study, ocular and periocular tissues from domestic and wild animal species, mainly from the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were evaluated between February 2012 and September 2015. The samples were analyzed grossly and microscopically. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed on some of the samples. The frequency, type of ocular alteration, affected animal species, and affected ocular or periocular tissues were recorded. One hundred eighty-eight ocular and periocular tissues from domestic and, occasionally, wild animals were examined. Nine animals presented two concurrent alterations, adding up to 197 alterations. Proliferative lesions were the most frequent (92), followed by traumatic (43), inflammatory (37), degenerative (18), developmental (4) and vascular/hemorrhagic diseases (3). The globe was the most affected structure (112), followed by eyelids (52), third eyelid (17), bulbar conjunctiva (14) and retrobulbar region (2). Neoplasms arising from periocular tissues were the most frequent alteration (60), possibly related to a more active surgical service and histopathologic evaluation request. Many animals presented ocular lesions that reflected systemic diseases, which were diagnosed by necropsy and examination of other organs. Particularly in cases of neoplasia, early detection and surgical treatment can prevent systemic involvement. Ocular histopathologic evaluation can provide better characterization and prognosis of the clinical-pathological condition of the patient as well.(AU)","Moreira, Matheus V.

The coronavirus 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) enzyme is essential for proteolytic maturation of the virus. This study was based on immunoinformatics and structural vaccinology strategies. The design of the multiepitope vaccine was built using helper T-cell and cytotoxic T-cell epitopes from the 3CL hydrolase protein along with an adjuvant to enhance immune response; these are joined to each other by short peptide linkers. The vaccine also carries potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes, and interferon-Î³-inducing epitopes. Epitopes of the constructed multiepitope vaccine were found to be antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxic, and covering large human populations worldwide. The vaccine construct was modeled, validated, and refined by different programs to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The resulting high-quality model was applied for conformational B-cell epitope selection and docking analyses with toll-like receptor-3 for understanding the capability of the vaccine to elicit an immune response. In silico cloning and codon adaptation were also performed with the pET-19b plasmid vector.

Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. Results: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. Conclusions: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur early, concomitantly with other symptoms and often persist after recovery, in some cases for months; whether a full recovery eventually occurs in all cases is not clear yet. OGD are good predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with a milder disease course.","Boscutti, A; Delvecchio, G; Pigoni, A; Cereda, G; Ciappolino, V; Bellani, M; Fusar-Poli, P; Brambilla, P",Brain Behav Immun Health,,502
292913,Virtual drug testing: redefining sample collection in a global pandemic,2020,"The pandemic of COVID-19 might be limited by vaccination. Society should be vaccinated to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to protect persons who are at high risk for complications. In Poland, the National Vaccination Program has been introduced, which is a strategy for planning activities to ensure safe and effective vaccinations among Polish citizens. It includes not only the purchase of an appropriate number of vaccines, their distribution but also monitoring of the course and effectiveness of vaccination and the safety of Poles. The national COVID-19 immunization program has been divided into four stages. Stage 0 covers the healthcare workers to be vaccinated first, as they are most at risk of being infected with the coronavirus. The study aims to prove the thesis that GIS statistical data on the incidence of COVID-19 post-vaccination reactions should be verified, as patients do not report their occurrence through the procedure indicated by GIS. In March 2021, an anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted using an electronic questionnaire among persons belonging to group zero of the National Vaccination Program. The survey consisted of 19 short questions concerning, inter alia, getting COVID-19, post-vaccination reactions after receiving the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, and motivation to proceed with vaccination. A total of 1678 complete responses were received. It has been shown that only a small number of post-vaccination reactions are reported to the Sanitary Inspection, which makes GIS statistics on the incidence of post-vaccination reactions in COVID-19 unreliable.

Since the time of writing, however, the pandemic in the United States has grown more severe, there have been significant accompanying economic disruptions (including large-scale unemployment and underemployment, with many organizations closing permanently), federal troops are being deployed in some cities, and a national movement spurred by the murder of George Floyd has prompted the country to again consider its legacy of race relations and racism. [...]the situation Rudolph etal. wrote about is even more chaotic today than they envisioned. [...]many employees in lower wage jobs may be experiencing cumulative stress due to many factors including physical illness, mental distress, and adverse impact. In line with the focal article, we believe that a discussion on the occupational health and safety for different employees, including those on the frontlines (i.e., nurses);those transitioning to working from home;and those experiencing furloughs, layoffs, and reduced hours, is necessary. [...]research should be conducted to determine the extent to which leaders have the ability to influence work stressors during a crisis (i.e., high workloads, hazardous work environments, building team cohesion and social support, enhancing communication strategies, fears of getting infected, negative emotions, and low perceived organizational support).","Rowley, Shannon Pineault Laura Dickson Marcus",Industrial and Organizational Psychology,,502

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea and hypogeusia/hyposmia. Among extrapulmonary signs associated with COVID-19, dermatological manifestations have been increasingly reported in the last few months. SUMMARY: The polymorphic nature of COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations led our group to propose a classification, which distinguishes the following six main clinical patterns: (i) urticarial rash, (ii) confluent erythematous/maculopapular/morbilliform rash, (iii) papulovesicular exanthem, (iv) chilblain-like acral pattern, (v) livedo reticularis/racemosa-like pattern, (vi) purpuric ""vasculitic"" pattern. This review summarizes the current knowledge on COVID-19-associated cutaneous manifestations, focusing on clinical features and therapeutic management of each category and attempting to give an overview of the hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms of these conditions.","Genovese, Giovanni; Moltrasio, Chiara; Berti, Emilio; Marzano, Angelo Valerio",Dermatology,,502

We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDING: To date, no randomized prospective studies have been published; recommendations are based on some observational studies, case reports, and expert opinions. The article provides an overview of the most important publications, presents the current results of the German Registry for PIMS and expert recommendations for treatment. SUMMARY: MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low. Patients usually recover within days, sequelae are reported only in a minority of cases.","Piekarski, Florian; Steinbicker, Andrea U; Armann, Jakob P",Curr. opin. anaesthesiol,,502

295447,Crisis communication on social media - lessons from Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The pattern of global COVID-19 has caused many to propose a possible link between susceptibility, severity and vitamin-D levels. Vitamin-D has known immune modulatory effects and deficiency has been linked to increased severity of viral infections. METHODS: We evaluated patients admitted with confirmed SARS-COV-2 to our hospital between March-June 2020. Demographics and outcomes were assessed for those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with normal (>50 nmol/L) and low (<50 nmol/L) vitamin-D. RESULTS: There were 646 SARS-COV-2 PCR positive hospitalisations and 165 (25.5%) had plasma vitamin-D levels. Fifty patients were admitted to ICU. There was no difference in vitamin-D levels of those hospitalised (34, IQR 18.5-66 nmol/L) and those admitted to the ICU (31.5, IQR 21-42 nmol/L). Higher proportion of vitamin-D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) noted in the ICU group (82.0 vs. 65.2%). Among the ICU patients, low vitamin D level (<50 nmol/L) was associated with younger age (57 vs. 67 years, p=0.04) and lower cycle threshold (CT) real time polymerase chain reaction values (RT-PCR) (26.96 vs. 33.6, p=0.02) analogous to higher viral loads. However, there were no significant differences in ICU clinical outcomes (invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation and hospital days) between patients with low and normal vitamin-D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the association of low vitamin-D levels with low CT values, there is no difference in clinical outcomes in this small cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. The complex relationship between vitamin-D levels and COVID-19 infection needs further exploration with large scale randomized controlled trials.","Orchard, Laurence; Baldry, Matthew; Nasim-Mohi, Myra; Monck, Chantelle; Saeed, Kordo; Grocott, Michael P W; Ahilanandan, Dushianthan",Clin Chem Lab Med,,502

AIM: To analyse the liver function in patients with COVID-19 and their association with respect to age, sex, severity of disease and clinical features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study done at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi. 91 patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study and divided into asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe groups. Liver function tests were compared among different severity groups. RESULTS: Of 91 patients with COVID-19, 70 (76.9%) had abnormal liver function. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin levels was 1-2 × ULN in 33(36.3%), 34(37.3%), 12(13.2%), 6(6.6%) cases and >2 × ULN in 20(22%), 18(19.8%), 7(7.7%) and 2 (2.2%) cases respectively. Mean AST and ALP levels among different severity groups of COVID-19 was statistically significant (p < 0.05) whereas mean ALT and total bilirubin levels was statistically non-significant (p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference between males and females with regard to abnormal liver function. Liver injury was seen in 64.3% cases of hypertension and 73.3% cases of diabetes. Fever, myalgia, headache and breathlessness were found to be correlated significantly with severity of disease. CONCLUSION: Liver injury is common in SARS-CoV-2 infection and is more prevalent in the severe disease group. Aspartate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase are better indicators of covid-19 induced liver injury than alanine transaminase and total bilirubin.","Kumar, Abhishek; Kumar, Piyush; Dungdung, Ajit; Kumar Gupta, Anitesh; Anurag, Aditya; Kumar, Abhinav",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,502
296092,The Impact of the Covid-19 on the Perception of DMOs About the Sustainability Within Destinations: A European Empirical Approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: Traditional radiology fellowships are usually one or two year clinical trainings in a specific area after completion of a four-year residency. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format, using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: The great majority of the applicants (99%) answered positively (agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms have superior quality than printed in paper. Eighty-two percent of the applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of the cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Also, most of the candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms (65%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of audiovisual content as part of the selection process for radiology fellowships is a new approach to evaluate the potential to enhance the applicant's experience during this process. This technology also allows for the evaluation of candidates without the necessity of in-person interactions. Further studies could streamline these methods in order to minimize work redundancy with traditional text tests or even evaluate the acceptance of using only audiovisual content using smartphones.","Godoy, Ivan Rodrigues Barros; Neto, Luís Pecci; Skaf, Abdalla; Leão-Filho, Hilton Muniz; Freddi, Tomás De Andrade Lourenço; Jasinowodolinski, Dany; Yamada, André Fukunishi",,,502

Amongst the emerging neurologic complications is sensorineural hearing loss. While several cases of hearing loss amongst COVID-19 patients have been reported, the management of these patients has yet to be discussed and determined. Herein we present cochlear implant outcomes for a patient who suffered from unilateral sensorineural hearing loss after a prolonged hospital course for COVID-19. METHODS: A patient who was hospitalized for COVID-19 for one month and subsequently developed unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss underwent cochlear implantation for single-sided deafness. His COVID-19 hospital course was reviewed in detail. Speech perception and audiometric assessments were used to evaluate cochlear implant outcomes. RESULTS: After cochlear implantation, the patient demonstrated improved speech perception on the implanted side and decreased tinnitus within 1 month of activation. CONCLUSIONS: Cochlear implantation may be an appropriate intervention for patients who suffer from severe sensorineural hearing loss following infection with COVID-19.","Asfour, Leena; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Roland, J Thomas",Cochlear Implants Int,,502

The processes that trigger organ damage in COVID-19 are incompletely understood. METHODS: Samples were donated from hospitalized patients. Sera, plasma, and autopsy-derived tissue sections were examined employing flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemistry. PATIENT FINDINGS: Here, we show that severe COVID-19 is characterized by a highly pronounced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) inside the micro-vessels. Intravascular aggregation of NETs leads to rapid occlusion of the affected vessels, disturbed microcirculation, and organ damage. In severe COVID-19, neutrophil granulocytes are strongly activated and adopt a so-called low-density phenotype, prone to spontaneously form NETs. In accordance, markers indicating NET turnover are consistently increased in COVID-19 and linked to disease severity. Histopathology of the lungs and other organs from COVID-19 patients showed congestions of numerous micro-vessels by aggregated NETs associated with endothelial damage. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19 is associated with excessive NET formation and vascular damage.

METHODS: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study by telephone with 1159 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 96 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were discharged from the endocrinology department of a hospital from January 1, 2019, to January 24, 2020. According to their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h postprandial BG (2hPBG) values, the patients were divided into the well-controlled BG group and the poorly controlled BG group. The main evaluation indicators included sociodemographic variables, health risk variables and adherence to self-management behaviors. RESULTS: In total, 74.46% of the T2DM patients and 64.89% of the T1DM patients had poor glycemic control. T2DM patients with poor glycemic control were more likely to be older (odds ratio (OR): 1.017 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.030]; P = 0.013), have fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 1.646 [95% CI 1.202-2.255]; P = 0.002), lack a BG meter at home (OR: 2.728 [95% CI 1.205-6.179]; P = 0.016), have a lower degree of medicationcompliance (OR: 1.627 [95% CI 1.076-2.460]; P = 0.021), and engage in less self-monitoring of BG (SMBG) per week (OR: 10.884 [95% CI 5.883-20.139]; P < 0.001). Fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 3.031 [95% CI 1.112-8.263]; P = 0.030) was a risk factor for glycemic control in T1DM. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic control among patients with T1DM and T2DM during home quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic is poor. Our results showed that more eduction, a higher frequency of SMBG, and improved medication compliance may contribute to glycemic control. Therefore, diabetic patients should be advised to increase the frequency of blood glucose measurements during home quarantine and be re-educated regarding the importance of medication compliance.","Tao, Jing; Gao, Lianlian; Liu, Qinghua; Dong, Kun; Huang, Jiaojiao; Peng, Xuemin; Yang, Yan; Wang, Hui; Yu, Xuefeng",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,502

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between COVID-19, frequent rheumatological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, and neurological IMIDs and immunosuppressants. METHODS: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study including all residents living within Capital Region of Denmark and Region Zealand from January 28th, 2020 until September 15th, 2020 with the only eligibility criterion being a test for SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction. Main outcomes included development of COVID-19, COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 was less common among patients with IMIDs than the background population (n = 328/20,513 (1.60%) and n = 10,792/583,788(1.85%), p < 0.01, respectively). However, those with IMIDs had a significantly higher risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization (31.1% and 18.6%, p < 0.01, respectively) and mortality (9.8% and 4.3%, p < 0.01, respectively), which were associated with patients older than 65 years, and presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, systemic steroids were independently associated with a severe course of COVID-19 (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.56 (95%CI 1.83-7.10), p < 0.01), while biologic therapies were associated with a reduced risk hereof (OR = 0.47 (95%CI 0.22-0.95), p = 0.04). Patients suspending immunosuppressants due to COVID-19 had an increased risk of subsequent hospitalization (OR = 3.59 (95%CI 1.31-10.78), p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study found a lower occurrence, but a more severe disease course, of COVID-19 among patients with IMIDs, which was associated with the use of systemic steroids for IMIDs and suspension of other immunosuppressants. This study emphasizes the importance of weighing risks before suspending immunosuppressants during COVID-19.","Attauabi, Mohamed; Seidelin, Jakob Benedict; Felding, Oluf Krautwald; Wewer, Mads Damsgaard; Vinther Arp, Laura Kirstine; Sarikaya, Melek Zahra; Egeberg, Alexander; Vladimirova, Nora; Bendtsen, Flemming; Burisch, Johan",J Autoimmun,,502

Following Self-Determination Theory, experienced competence, autonomy, and relatedness were assumed to relate to active learning behavior (i.e., engagement and persistence), and negatively relate to passive learning behavior (i.e., procrastination), mediated via positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation. Data were collected via online questionnaires in altogether eight countries from Europe, Asia, and North America (N = 25,305) and comparable results across countries were expected. Experienced competence was consistently found to relate to positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation, and, in turn, active learning behavior in terms of engagement and persistence.

There is currently a lack of nonspecific laboratory indicators as a quantitative standard to distinguish between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and an influenza A or B virus infection. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. Methods. A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) in China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Results. Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883-0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812-0.880; P = .0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768-0.843; P &lt; .0001), monocyte count (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739-0.817; P &lt; .0001), or age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610-0.699; P &lt; .0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. Conclusions. We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Using the covariance-based structural equation modeling method, we investigated the efficiency of a conceptual model of mobile-app-based business for SMEs. The results revealed that consumer choice behavior, perceived behavior control, subjective behavior control and attitude towards the mobile app all influence SMEs’ decision-making and business strategy. As such, SMEsneed a powerful mobile-app-based business network to succeed in the entrepreneurial business process. Using instrumental variable analysis, we discovered that increased mobile app usage significantly improves SMEs’ long-term efficiency. The analysis provides several theoretical and managerial ramifications.","Rakshit, Sandip Islam Nazrul Mondal Sandeep Paul Tripti",Journal of Business Research,,502

In a systematic quantitative review, we analyzed 11 studies of PIMS-TS, including 468 children reported before July 1, 2020. We found a myriad of clinical features, but we were able to describe common characteristics: previously healthy school-aged children, persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphopenia, and high inflammatory markers. Clinical syndromes such as myocarditis and Kawasaki disease were present in only one third of cases each one. Pediatric intensive care unit admission was frequent, although length of stay was less than 1 week, and mortality was low. Most patients received immunoglobulin or steroids, although the level of evidence for that treatment is low. The PIMS-ST was recently described, and the detailed quantitative pooled data will increase clinicians' awareness, improve diagnosis, and promptly start treatment. This analysis also highlights the necessity of future collaborative studies, given the heterogeneous nature of the PIMS-TS.","Bustos B, Raúl; Jaramillo-Bustamante, Juan Camilo; Vasquez-Hoyos, Pablo; Cruces, Pablo; Díaz, Franco",Pediatr. emerg. care,,502

Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was conducted via social media and email to ask psychiatrists working in Poland whether contact with nature, wild bird watching in particular, contributes to their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic-related isolation as well as which bird species they have spotted. Results: Contact with nature, bird watching in particular, had many positive effects on the well-being of doctors during the epidemic. It met the basic needs, such as the need for security and a relationship with the good, permanent and accessible world of nature, which allowed for stabilization of mental well-being. It was found that the notions of freedom associated with birds allow for the mental experience of relativizing limitations and restrictions during isolation. This has become a part of recently increasingly investigated and discussed trend, which assumes that contact with nature, birds in particular, is of great positive importance for mental health.

304768,Comment on “COVID-19’s Lockdown and Crime Victimization: The State of Emergency under the Abe Administration”,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Most patients with mild COVID-19 had to stay at home trying to implement an optimal quarantine. The aim of this study was to describe the COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain, how they managed the disease at home, focusing on differences by age, as well as differences in knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices, compared with the uninfected population. DESIGN: An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of individuals who were 14 years or older living in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown. The main variable was a COVID-19 case. Logistic regression models for COVID-19 cases were obtained using a backward stepwise procedure to assess the association between social variables, disease knowledge, attitudes, prevention practices and emotional impact. RESULTS: 3398 people completed the survey. Participants' mean age was 49.6 (SD=14.3). COVID-19 was significantly more prevalent among married people (5.3%) and those currently doing an on-site work (8.7%). Most of the COVID-19 cases stayed at home (84.0%) during the episode. There were significant age-based differences with regard to self-isolation conditions at home during the disease. COVID-19 cases showed better attitudes, practices and knowledge about disease symptoms and transmission than the uninfected population. COVID-19 cases also felt more depressed (adjusted OR: 3.46, 95% CI 1.45 to 8.26) and had better preventive behaviour than the uninfected population, such as always wearing a mask outside the home (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.30). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases found it difficult to comply with recommended home self-isolation conditions, with differences by age group. COVID-19 had an important impact on care dependency in non-hospitalised patients, who were mostly dependent on their families for care. It is necessary to reinforce social and health services and to be ready to meet the care needs of populations during the different waves or in future epidemics.","Romay-Barja, María; Pascual-Carrasco, Mario; De Tena-Dávila, María José; Falcón, María; Rodriguez-Blazquez, Carmen; Forjaz, Maria João; Ayala, Alba; Molina-de la Fuente, Irene; Burgos, Alfredo; Muñoz, Adolfo; Benito, Agustin",BMJ Open,,502

The aim of the paper. To provide clinical case descriptions and approaches to the management of patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as they are not addressed in the current clinical guidelines, and therefore are worthy of special attention. Among 224 patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19, five cases of pneumomediastinum without pneumothorax were identified. Of these, in two cases the pneumomediastinum developed during noninvasive lung ventilation (NLV) (one case) and invasive lung ventilation (one case). In three cases, spontaneous mediastinal emphysema was not associated with lung ventilation. By the time of publication, one case of pneumomediastinum was completed, and four patients remained hospitalized. All five patients were males aged from 52 to 84 years.

Within days, the 52-member contingent comprised of 36 doctors and 15 nurses (plus 1 logistics specialist), together with Italian colleagues, were receiving patients in an adjacent fi eld hospital established and equipped for this purpose. At the time, Lombardy was the epicenter of COVID-19 transmission in Europe. Many of the Cubans in Lombardy were Contingent veterans, having served in postdisaster and epidemic scenarios in Chile, Pakistan, Haiti and elsewhere since the founding of the emergency medical team in 2005. Importantly, some had worked fi ghting the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Even so, providing medical care during COVID-19 is a unique challenge, the likes of which had never before been seen by the Cuban team. Dr Carlos R. Pérez-Díaz, one of the Contingent's founding members, headed the team during its 60-day rotation in Lombardy, drawing on a wide array of professional experience. From 2006 to 2009, Dr Pérez-Díaz led the Cuban team posted at the Peltier Hospital in Djibouti, where he worked in the infectious disease department; in 2008, this team helped control a cholera outbreak that had spread to three countries. Following the 2010 earthquake in Chile, Dr Pérez-Díaz headed the team of Henry Reeve volunteers that provided free health services for 10 months in a tent hospital established to treat victims; he returned to Chile in 2015, again as head of the Henry Reeve Contingent, after severe fl ooding struck the Atacama region.","Coutin, Gisele; Gorry, Conner",MEDICC Rev,,502

To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.","Kotlar, Bethany; Gerson, Emily; Petrillo, Sophia; Langer, Ana; Tiemeier, Henning",Reprod Health,,502

Moreover, the impact of the disease on hemodialysis centers, the patients, and the health care workers is still not completely understood. Objective: We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting: A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients: A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients’ characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Methods: Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and χ2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Results: Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P =.4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P =.3). Advanced age, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were all found to be significantly related to death. Of the 18 infected health care professionals, 13 (72%) were symptomatic and 2 (11%) were hospitalized. There was no reported death among the health care workers. Limitations: Limited follow-up time compared with the course of the disease along with a small sample size. Conclusions: Patients treated with KRT show a high mortality rate secondary to COVID-19. CVD and age are shown to impact survival. Proactive measures must be taken to prevent the spread of the virus in such facilities.

However, sharing experiences is the best way for countries to learn real-time lessons and adapt to this rapidly changing pandemic. This commentary shares with the international community how an adaptive model of health system organization and responses helped Vietnam to break transmission of coronavirus. We find that an effective model is adaptive to time and context, and mobilizes and engages the wider society. We identify merging of different health system units into Center for Diseases Controls as a health system organization that saved massive resources. The early establishment of a formal committee responding to the pandemic helped unify every public health strategy. The mobilization of different stakeholders and communities added resources and facilitated a synchronous implementation of response strategies, even where those strategies involved significant personal or financial sacrifice. National training on Covid-19 treatment for healthcare professionals across the entire hospital system was useful to expand the health service availability. Quickly published response guidelines helped to activate every level of the health system and involve every sector of society.

307611,Lessons learned from COVID-19 response for disaster risk management,2021,"RATIONALE: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused urban and suburban hospitals to exceed their inpatient capacities, often requiring long periods of transfer diversion. This has had a dramatic impact on the rural hospitals of Georgia by forcing those facilities to care for critically ill patients that would have normally been transferred to referral hospitals for higher levels of care. Many rural facilities have the equipment to care for critically ill patients, but lack physicians trained and experienced in the management of critical illness. To mitigate this, Augusta University (AU) instituted a telemedicine program to provide critical care services to rural hospitals while keeping patients in their rural communities for optimal family and social support. METHODS: The telemedicine critical care program was started in three rural hospitals, but rapidly expanded to three more hospitals based on initial successes. These sites are staffed predominately by primary care physicians with no critical care trained physicians available. Telemedicine services were provided by AU Emergency Physicians with a Critical Care trained physician providing medical oversight. Telemedicine consults were initiated either in the ED or after the patient was admitted to the hospital. Evaluations were continued daily until the patient was discharged, transferred, or transitioned to comfort care. If a patient's care requirements exceeded the capability of a rural site despite critical care telemedicine involvement, AU accepted all transfers regardless of diversion status. RESULTS: From July 20, 2020 through December 20, 2020, 213 patients were evaluated and treated using the telemedicine program. The average length of consultation was 5.1 days. 70.0% of patients were discharged from the rural facilities and 10.3% were provided end-of-life care without transfer. Only 19.7% were transferred to the tertiary hospital. The transfer rate from the rural hospitals decreased by approximately 80% as compared to prior. Mortality and discharge outcomes amongst patients in the telemedicine program were no worse than those at the tertiary referral center. CONCLUSION: The telemedicine critical care program has been received enthusiastically by the participating rural hospitals, and additional sites are seeking to join. It has allowed these hospitals to safely care for substantially more complex patients while still guaranteeing expeditious transfer in the event local capability is exceeded. This approach provides for enhanced patient care and safety while keeping patients close to their families and communities. It has been instrumental in helping to resolve healthcare disparities between rural and suburban/urban Georgia during the COVID pandemic.","Bursey, M.; Lyon, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,502

Therefore, the current study aimed to determine different patterns of syndromic symptoms and sensitivity and specificity of each of them in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study . METHODS: In this study, the retrospective data of 1,539 patients suspected of COVID-19 were obtained from a local registry under the supervision of the officials at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out on syndromic symptoms, and the associations of some risk factors and latent subclasses were accessed using one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test. RESULTS: The LCA indicated that there were three distinct subclasses of syndromic symptoms among the COVID-19 suspected patients. The age, former smoking status, and body mass index were associated with the categorization of individuals into different subclasses. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of class 2 (labeled as ""High probability of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 67.43% and 76.17%, respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of class 3 (labeled as ""Moderate probability of PCR+"") in the diagnosis of COVID-19 were 75.92% and 50.23%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study showed that syndromic symptoms, such as dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, and anorexia, might be helpful in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients.","Hosseinzadeh, Ali; Rezapour, Maysam; Rohani-Rasaf, Marzie; Emamian, Mohammad Hassan; Talebi, Solmaz; Goli, Shahrbanoo; Chaman, Reza; Sheibani, Hossein; Binesh, Ehsan; Zare, Fariba; Khosravi, Ahmad",J Res Health Sci,,502

Some parents may object to mandatory vaccination policies, claiming exemptions based on medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. Individual schools, school systems, or local or regional governments have different policies with respect to whether, and what kind of, exemptions may be allowed. In the setting of the current pandemic, questions regarding the acceptability of exemptions have resurfaced, as schools and local governments struggle with how to safely return children to school. Anticipating that school attendance will be facilitated by the development of a vaccine, school systems will face decisions about whether to mandate vaccination and whether to permit exemptions. The American Academy of Pediatrics promulgates policy favoring the elimination of nonmedical exemptions generally in schools. This discussion considers whether schools should eliminate nonmedical exemptions to vaccination as proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics policy, ultimately concluding that broad elimination of exemptions is not justified and advocating a more nuanced approach that encourages school attendance while promoting vaccination and broader public health goals.","Paquette, Erin Talati",J Pediatr,,502

309759,Acute surgical-like abdomen as a gastrointestinal manifestation of COVID-19 infection: a case report in Colombia,2021,"AIMS: We aimed to assess whether expression of whole-blood RNA of sodium proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is associated with COVID-19 infection and outcome in patients presenting to the emergency department with respiratory infections. Furthermore, we investigated NHE1 and GLUT1 expression in the myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-blood quantitative assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA was performed using quantitative PCR in patients with respiratory infection upon first contact in the emergency department and subsequently stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA using PCR was also performed in left ventricular myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. NHE1 expression is up-regulated in whole blood of patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory infections at first medical contact in the emergency department (control: 0.0021 ± 0.0002, COVID-19: 0.0031 ± 0.0003, P = 0.01). The ratio of GLUT1 to NHE1 is significantly decreased in the blood of COVID-19 patients who are subsequently intubated and/or die (severe disease) compared with patients with moderate disease (moderate disease: 0.497 ± 0.083 vs. severe disease: 0.294 ± 0.0336, P = 0.036). This ratio is even further decreased in the myocardium of patients who deceased from COVID-19 in comparison with the myocardium of non-infected donors. CONCLUSIONS: NHE1 and GLUT1 may be critically involved in the disease progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 infection critically disturbs ion channel expression in the heart. A decreased ratio of GLUT1/NHE1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Mustroph, Julian; Hupf, Julian; Hanses, Frank; Evert, Katja; Baier, Maria J; Evert, Matthias; Meindl, Christine; Wagner, Stefan; Hubauer, Ute; Pietrzyk, Gabriela; Leininger, Simon; Staudner, Stephan; Vogel, Manuel; Wallner, Stefan; Zimmermann, Markus; Sossalla, Samuel; Maier, Lars S; Jungbauer, Carsten",ESC Heart Fail,,502

310728,Current progress on COVID-19 related to biosensing technologies: New opportunity for detection and monitoring of viruses,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the coronavirus strain has had massive global impact, and has interrupted economic and social activity. The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings. IE-EBReg shows good model for the COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia compared with the other models.","Al-Dawsari, Sarah R; Sultan, Khalaf S",Math Biosci Eng,,502

This study aimed to evaluate Cepheid Xpert® HCV Viral Load performance in comparison with the Roche Cobas® TaqMan® HCV Test using serum samples of HCV-infected patients in Indonesia. Viral load quantification was performed on 243 anti-HCV positive patients' samples using both Xpert HCV VL and Roche HCV tests, followed by HCV genotyping by reverse hybridization. Strength of the relationship between the assays was measured by Pearson correlation coefficient, while level of agreement was analyzed by Deming regression and Bland-Altman plot analysis using log10-transformed viral load values. Quantifiable viral load was detected in 180/243 (74.1%), with Xpert HCV VL sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 0.98, 1.00) and specificity of 98.4% (95% CI 0.91, 0.99) based on Roche HCV tests, while HCV genotypes were determined in 172/180 (95.6%) samples. There was a good correlation between both assays (r = 0.97, P < 0.001), overall and per genotype, with good concordance by Deming regression and a mean difference of -0.25 log10 IU/mL (95% CI -0.33, -0.18) by Bland-Altman plot analysis. Xpert HCV VL test was demonstrated as a POC platform with good performance for HCV diagnosis and treatment decision that would be beneficial for decentralized service in resource-limited areas. HCV testing sites, alongside additional GeneXpert modular systems distributed toward the fight against COVID-19, could ensure some continuity, once this pandemic is controlled.","Thedja, Meta Dewi; Wibowo, Dhita Prabasari; El-Khobar, Korri Elvanita; Ie, Susan Irawati; Setiawan, Lyana; Murti, Ignatia Sinta; Muljono, David Handojo",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,502

316130,COVID-19 in Grade 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease Patients,2020,"Spain is among the countries worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, with one of the highest rate of infections and deaths per million inhabitants. First positive was reported on late January 2020. Mid March, with 7000 confirmed cases, nationwide lockdown was imposed. Mid May the epidemic was stabilized and government eased measures. Here we model the dynamics of the epidemic in Spain over the whole span, and study the effectiveness of control measures. The model is also applied to Italy and Germany. We propose formulas to easily estimate the size of the outbreak and the benefit of early intervention. A susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was used to simulate the epidemic. The growth and transmission rates, doubling time, and reproductive number were estimated by least-mean-square fitting of daily cases. Time-series data were obtained from official government reports. We forecasted the epidemic curve after lockdown under different effectiveness scenarios, and nowcasted the trend by moving average sliding window. Exponential growth expressions were derived. Outbreak progression remained under the early growth dynamics. The basic reproductive number in Spain was 2.5â¯±â¯0.1 (95% CI 2.3-2.7), and the doubling time was 2.8â¯±â¯0.1 days (95% CI 2.6-3.0). Slight variations in measures effectiveness produce a large divergence in the epidemic size. The effectiveness in Spain was 68%, above control threshold (60%). During lockdown the reproductive number dropped to an average of 0.81â¯±â¯0.02 (95% CI 0.77-0.85). Estimated epidemic size is about 300,000 cases. A 7-days advance of measures yields a reduction to 38%. The dynamics in Spain is similar to other countries. Strong lockdown measures must be adopted if not compensated by rapid detection and isolation of patients, and even a slight relaxation would raise the reproductive number above 1. Simple calculations allow anticipating the size of the epidemic based on when measures are taken and their effectiveness. Spain acted late. Control measures must be implemented immediately in the face on an epidemic.","Guirao, Antonio",,,502

Our previous study has found that ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic and shows high sensitivity in identifying COVID-19 disease. In this study, by employing overlapping linear peptides, we characterized the IgG immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein that are seropositive in the sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The major immunogenic epitopes are localized at (1) N-termini alpha helix, (2) the resides spanning beta 2 and 3 sheets, and (3) the loop between beta 4 and 5 sheets. Additionally, hamster model infected by SARS-CoV-2 further validates the seropositivity of the linear epitopes in vivo, demonstrating a potential application of the linear peptide-based immunization strategy. Taken together, identification and validation of these B-cell linear epitopes will provide insights into the design of serological diagnostics and peptide-based vaccination approach against this pandemic virus of high priority.","Wang, Xiaohui; Lam, Joy-Yan; Chen, Linlei; Au, Shannon Wing-Ngor; To, Kelvin K W; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kok, Kin-Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,502

The situation in Sri Lanka changed with the rapid increase of personnel contracting COVID-19 in a naval base camp that housed more than 4000 people. This provided a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), while taking stringent, non-pharmacologic, public health measures to prevent spread. Our aim is to study the effectiveness and safety of HCQ for PEP among naval personnel with exposure to COVID-19-positive patients. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial carried out in the naval base camp and quarantine centers of the Sri Lanka Navy, Ministry of Defense, Sri Lanka. Navy personnel who are exposed to a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection but test negative for the virus on reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at recruitment will be randomized, 200 to each arm, to receive HCQ or placebo and monitored for the development of symptoms or rRT-PCR positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus for 14 days. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide high-quality evidence of the effectiveness and safety of HCQ as PEP for COVID-19. The study design is unique due to the circumstances of the outbreak in a confined area among otherwise healthy adults, at a relatively early stage of its spread.

He had severe respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio (P/F ratio) of 203. Electrocardiogram showed a heart rate (HR) of 56 beats/min, slight ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF, and mild saddle-back type ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level was slightly elevated. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, his HR remained within 50-70 beats/min. Case 2 was a 52-year-old Japanese woman. CT revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower left lung. Electrocardiogram showed a HR of only 81 beats/min, despite a body temperature of 39.2 °C, slight ST depression in leads V4, V5, V6, and a prominent U wave in multiple leads. She had an elevated cTnT and a P/F ratio of 165. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, her HR remained within 50-70 beats/min.

317475,"Safe management of full-capacity live/mass events in COVID-19 will require mathematical, epidemiological and economic modelling",2021,"INTRODUCTION: During the state of emergency caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Doctor-patient communication training for medical students at the University of Szeged was moved online. The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM: The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95 ± 0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06 ± 1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

(preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: International experience with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons, due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to obtain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. METHODS: Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2 mg per 10 mL) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during nonpowered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling after nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS: Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30 cm, extending to 66 cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all conditions tested. CONCLUSION: We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an ""aerosol-generating surgery"" to convey this unique risk, and this supports the need for protective personal protective equipment.","Workman, Alan D; Welling, D Bradley; Carter, Bob S; Curry, William T; Holbrook, Eric H; Gray, Stacey T; Scangas, George A; Bleier, Benjamin S",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,,502
318250,Optimization of Supply Chain Networks with Inclusion of Labor: Applications to COVID-19 Pandemic Disruptions,2021,"It has been proposed that the urgency of having a vaccine as a response to SARS-CoV-2 is so great, given the potential health, economic and social benefits that we should override the established steps in the research development process. In this article I argue that whilst there are some opportunities to expedite the production of a vaccine, it is a mistake to rush the research. We should retain the existing structures represented by clear and separate ‘phasing’ of trials. I offer three reasons for this view: the existing phases of trials is morally significant; rushing fails to appropriately weigh all of the relevant risks and benefits and consent is not sufficient for the justification of additional risk. Vaccines have played a central role in global health improvements and we should not endanger such achievements for an apparent short-term gain in response to a pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2.","Dawson, Angus",Res.

The case study design, which is frequently used in qualitative research, was used in the study. A semi-structured interview form was used to determine the views of Social Studies teachers on distant education. The data were collected in the spring semester of the 2020-2021 academic year and the content analysis method was used in the analysis of the data. The study group consists of 21 Social Studies teachers working in secondary schools affiliated to Afyonkarahisar center. The teachers generally have stated that they saw distant education as the best method to be applied in this process. In addition, teachers stated that they did not generally make use of distant education before the epidemic process, found face-to-face training sufficient, saw distant education as necessary and benefited during the epidemic process, and that they would not benefit from distant education because of the problems experienced and did not think it was effective after the epidemic process. Teachers have stated the general problems as lack of technical equipment, infrastructure and motivation.

Pandemics, including COVID-19, may influence changes to physical activity and sedentary behaviours among children. However, the role of parent anxiety related to COVID-19 on children's physical activity and sedentary behaviours has yet to be explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between parent COVID-19 anxiety and physical activity and sedentary behaviours among school-aged children (5-17 years) and; to describe these behaviour patterns among school-aged children in relation to the COVID-19 public health emergency response. Between April and June 2020, a random sample of adults (Calgary, Canada) completed an online questionnaire. This sample included 345 parents of at least one school-aged child (80.5% aged 5 to 11 years and 54.9% male). Approximately one-third of parents (35.7%) reported being extremely or very anxious about COVID-19. During this period, most children increased television watching (58.8%), computing or gaming (56.4%), and use of screen-based devices (75.9%). Not surprisingly, given the mandated closure of playgrounds, approximately one-half of children decreased playing at the park (52.7%) and in public spaces (53.7%). Children's physical activity at home either increased (48.8%) or remained unchanged (32.9%). Children of more anxious parents had fewer visits to the park and were more likely to spend &#8805;2 hours/day computing or gaming compared with children of less anxious parents.

319874,Impact of COVID-19 on SMEs and employment,2020,"Humans have always coexisted with viruses, with both positive and negative consequences. Evolutionary pressure on mammals has selected intrinsic properties of lactation and milk to support the relatively immunocompromised neonate from environmental pathogens, as well as support the normal development of diverse immune responses. Human milk supports both adaptive and innate immunity, with specific constituents that drive immune learning and maturation, and direct protection against microorganisms. Viruses constitute one of the most ancient pressures on human evolution, and yet there is a lack of awareness by both public and healthcare professionals of the complexity of human milk as an adaptive response beyond the production of maternal antibodies. This review identifies and describes the specific antiviral properties of human milk and describes how maternal support of infants through lactation is protective beyond antibodies.","Wedekind, Sophie I S; Shenker, Natalie S",,,502

321561,The management (or lack thereof) of COVID-19 in Brazil: implications for human rights and public health,2020,"To curb the spread of the coronavirus, China implemented lockdown policies on January 23, 2020. The resulting extreme changes in human behavior may have influenced the air pollutants concentration. However, despite these changes, hazy weather persisted in Shanghai and became a public issue. This study aims to investigate air pollutant mass concentration changes during the lockdown in Shanghai. Air pollutant mass concentration data and meteorological data during the pre-lockdown period and the level I response lockdown period were analyzed by statistical analysis and a Lagrangian particle diffusion model. The data was classified in three periods: P1 (pre-lockdown: 10 days before the Spring Festival), P2 (the first 10 days after lockdown: during the Spring Festival celebration), and P3 (the second 10 days after lockdown: after the Spring Festival). Data for the same period in 2019 were used as a reference. The results indicate that the Spring Festival holiday in 2019 resulted in a reduction in energy consumption, which led to a decrease in PM2.5 (26.4%) and NO2 (43.41%) mass concentration, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (31.39%) in P2 compared with P1. The integrated effect of the Spring Festival holiday and lockdown in 2020 resulted in a decrease in PM2.5 (36.5%) and NO2 (51.9%) mass concentrations, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (43.8%) in P2 compared with P1. After the Spring Festival, the mass concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 increased by 74.41%, 5.52%, and 53.28%, respectively in P3 compared with P2 in 2019. However, PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations in 2020 continued to decrease, by 14.74% and 4.61%, respectively, while NO2 mass concentration increased by 7.82% in P3 compared with P2. We also found that PM2.5 mass concentration is susceptible to regional transmission from the surrounding cities. PM2.5 and other gaseous pollutants show different correlations in different periods, while NO2 and O3 always show a strong negative correlation. The principal components before the Spring Festival in 2019 were O3 and NO2, and after the Spring Festival, they were PM2.5 and CO, while the principal components before the lockdown in 2020 were PM2.5 and CO, and during lockdown they were O3 and NO2.","Niu, Zhi; Hu, Tingting; Kong, Lin; Zhang, Wenqi; Rao, Pinhua; Ge, Dafeng; Zhou, Mengge; Duan, Yuseng",Air Qual Atmos Health,,502

The diagnosis can be challenging, especially in the ICU, where clinical symptoms as well as imaging are mostly nonspecific. Recently, Aspergillus lateral flow tests were developed to decrease the time to diagnosis of IPA. Several studies have shown promising results in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from hematology patients. We therefore evaluated a new lateral flow test for IPA in ICU patients. METHODS: Using left-over BALf from adult ICU patients in two university hospitals, we studied the performance of the Aspergillus galactomannan lateral flow assay (LFA) by IMMY (Norman, OK, USA). Patients were classified according to the 2008 EORTC-MSG definitions, the AspICU criteria, and the modified AspICU criteria, which incorporate galactomannan results. These internationally recognized consensus definitions for the diagnosis of IPA incorporate patient characteristics, microbiology and radiology. The LFA was read out visually and with a digital reader by researchers blinded to the final clinical diagnosis and IPA classification. RESULTS: We included 178 patients, of which 55 were classified as cases (6 cases of proven and 26 cases of probable IPA according to the EORTC-MSG definitions, and an additional 23 cases according to the modified AspICU criteria). Depending on the definitions used, the sensitivity of the LFA was 0.88-0.94, the specificity was 0.81, and the area under the ROC curve 0.90-0.94, indicating good overall test performance.

Methods: A follow-up system that includes over 200 IgG4-RD patients across the country during the past ten years. A total of ninety-one patients with IgG4-RD who live in Hubei, China were identified and responded to our survey. Medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, CT imaging, and treatment were obtained through a standardized data collection form, and then independently reviewed by two investigators. Results: 2 of 91 cases were infected with COVID-19. Both of them were classified as moderate type. The symptoms such as fever and cough and radiologic features were similar to other COVID-19 patients. Neither of them episode recurrent of IgG4-RD nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids. Besides, patient 2 took a long time for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid to turn negative. Conclusion: IgG4-RD patients may belongs to the susceptible population of COVID-19 infection, and thus need more careful personal protection.

325763,Divided We Survive? Multi-Level Governance and Policy Uncertainty During the First Wave of COVID-19 (preprint),2021,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are hormonally active compounds in the environment that interfere with the body's endocrine system and consequently produce adverse health effects. Despite persistent public health concerns, EDCs remain important components of common consumer products, thus representing ubiquitous contaminants to humans. While scientific evidence confirmed their contribution to the severity of Influenza A virus (H1N1) in the animal model, their roles in susceptibility and clinical outcome of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cannot be underestimated. Since its emergence in late 2019, clinical reports on COVID-19 have confirmed that severe disease and death occur in persons aged &#8805;65 years and those with underlying comorbidities. Major comorbidities of COVID-19 include diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, and kidney and liver diseases. Meanwhile, long-term exposure to EDCs contributes significantly to the onset and progression of these comorbid diseases. Besides, EDCs play vital roles in the disruption of the body's immune system. Here, we review the recent literature on the roles of EDCs in comorbidities contributing to COVID-19 mortality, impacts of EDCs on the immune system, and recent articles linking EDCs to COVID-19 risks. We also recommend methodologies that could be adopted to comprehensively study the role of EDCs in COVID-19 risk.","Adegoke, Elikanah Olusayo; Rahman, Md Saidur; Park, Yoo-Jin; Kim, Young Ju; Pang, Myung-Geol",Int. j. mol. sci.

In Uganda, limited access to personal protective equipment amidst lack of clarity on the extent of the community disease burden may exacerbate this situation. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among high-risk sub-populations, including healthcare workers, persons within the general population previously reporting experiencing key COVID-19 like symptoms and archived plasma specimens collected prior to confirmation of COVID-19 in Uganda. We collected venous blood from HCWs at selected health facilities and from population-cohort participants who reported specific COVID-19 like symptoms in a prior phone-based survey conducted during the first national lockdown (May-August 2020). Pre-lockdown plasma collected from individuals considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection was retrieved. Specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the CoronaChek rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG lateral flow test assay. IgM only positive samples were confirmed using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHITECT AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM) which targets the spike. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as either confirmed IgM, both IgM and IgG or sole IgG positivity. The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs was 21.1% [95%CI: 18.2-24.2]. Of the phone-based survey participants, 11.9% [95%CI: 8.0-16.8] had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Among 636 pre-lockdown plasma specimens, 1.7% [95%CI: 0.9-3.1] were reactive. Findings suggest a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and substantial exposure in persons presenting with specific COVID-19 like symptoms in the general population of South-central Uganda. Based on current limitations in serological test confirmation, it remains unclear whether pre-lockdown seropositivity implies prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Uganda.","Ssuuna, Charles; Galiwango, Ronald M; Kankaka, Edward Nelson; Kagaayi, Joseph; Ndyanabo, Anthony; Kigozi, Godfrey; Nakigozi, Gertrude; Lutalo, Tom; Ssekubugu, Robert; Wasswa, John Bosco; Mayinja, Anthony; Nakibuuka, Martina Cathy; Jamiru, Samiri; Oketch, John Baptist; Muwanga, Edward; Chang, Larry William; Grabowski, M.

330726,Masks in a Post COVID-19 World: A Better Alternative to Curtailing Influenza?,2021,"The current study examined the relevance of relationship functioning to partners' agreement or consensus about joint effort surrounding COVID-19 prevention. Interdependence theory has been widely used to understand how relationship partners influence health behavior, including how sexual minority male (SMM) couples regulate HIV risk. Couples with better relationship functioning tend to be more successful at negotiating joint (shared) goals and subsequently accomplishing them. The study recruited 134 cis-male, SARS-CoV-2 negative adults in relationships with cis-male partners from phone-based social networking applications. Participants completed an online survey assessing relationship functioning (Perceived Relationship Components Questionnaire), COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and risk perceptions. Partners' consensus around joint COVID-19 prevention effort was assessed using an adapted version of the Preferences for Sexual Health Outcomes scale. Path analyses indicated that consensus for joint prevention effort predicted social distancing (B = 0.23; p = .001) and the number of other COVID-19 prevention behaviors engaged in (B = 0.17; p = .003) above and beyond perceived risk and relationship functioning. Relationship satisfaction predicted higher levels of consensus for joint COVID-19 prevention effort (B = 0.40; p = .029). Findings suggest that the theoretical foundations of successful HIV prevention interventions that utilize joint goal formation may generalize to the prediction of COVID-19 prevention behavior and may be leveraged to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among SMM in relationships. Interventions that overlook the potential for dyadic regulation of health behavior may miss opportunities to capitalize on shared coping resources and fail to address relational barriers to prevention.","Starks, Tyrel J; Bosco, Stephen C; Doyle, Kendell M; Revenson, Tracey A",Arch. sex. behav,,502

330945,The Impacts of Covid-19: An Econometric Analysis of Crude Oil Prices and Rice Prices in the World,2020,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and accounts for the fourth leading cause of all cancer deaths. Scientific evidence has found that plant extracts seem to be a reliable choice due to their multitarget effects against HCC. Juniperus communis has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and has reported its anticancer properties. As a result, the purpose of the study was to investigate the anticancer effect and mechanism of JCo extract on HCC in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that J. communis extract (JCo extract) inhibited the growth of human HCC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, extensive apoptosis and suppressing metastatic protein expressions in HCC cells. Moreover, the combinational treatment of JCo and VP-16 was found to enhance the anti-cancer effect, revealing that JCo extract might have the potential to be utilized as an adjuvant to promote HCC treatment. Furthermore, in vivo study, JCo extract significantly suppressed HCC tumor growth and extended the lifespan with no or low systemic and pathological toxicity. JCo extract significantly upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and tumor suppressor p53, suppressed VEGF/VEGFR autocrine signaling, downregulated cell cycle regulatory proteins and MMP2/MMP9 proteins. Overall, our results provide a basis for exploiting JCo extract as a potential anticancer agent against hepatocellular carcinoma.","Huang, Nan-Chieh; Huang, Ru-Lai; Huang, Xiao-Fan; Chang, Kai-Fu; Lee, Chien-Ju; Hsiao, Chih-Yen; Lee, Shan-Chih; Tsai, Nu-Man",Biosci. rep,,502

However, sensitive populations submitted to longer periods of restrictions may experience detrimental effects in significant areas of their lifestyle, such as sexual activity. This study examines sexual activity during the COVID-19 confinement in Spain. A survey distributed through an institutional social media profile served to collect data, whereas chi-squared tests, t-tests, analyses of variance, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to assess differences among sample subgroups. A total of 71.3% adults (N = 536) (72.8% female) reported engaging in sexual activity with a weekly average of 2.39 times (SD = 1.80), with significant differences favoring males, middle age, married/in a domestic relationship (p < 0.001), employed (p < 0.005), medium-high annual household income, living outside the Iberian Peninsula, and smoking and alcohol consumption. Analyses adjusted for the complete set of control variables showed significant odds for a lower prevalence of weekly sexual activity in women (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.72). Interventions to promote sexual activity in confined Spanish adults may focus on groups with lower sexual activity.","López-Bueno, Rubén; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F; Gil-Salmerón, Alejandro; Grabovac, Igor; Tully, Mark A; Casaña, José; Smith, Lee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,502

For the provision of widespread use, surrogates for 12­lead ECG QTc assessment may be useful. This prospective observational study compared QTc duration assessed by artificial intelligence (AI-QTc) (Cardiologs®, Paris, France) on smartwatch single­lead electrocardiograms (SW-ECGs) with those measured on 12­lead ECGs, in patients with early stage COVID-19 treated with a hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin regimen. METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 who needed hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin therapy, received a smartwatch (Withings Move ECG®, Withings, France). At baseline, day-6 and day-10, a 12­lead ECG was recorded, and a SW-ECG was transmitted thereafter. Throughout the drug regimen, a SW-ECG was transmitted every morning at rest. Agreement between manual QTc measurement on a 12­lead ECG and AI-QTc on the corresponding SW-ECG was assessed by the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: 85 patients (30 men, mean age 38.3 ± 12.2 years) were included in the study. Fair agreement between manual and AI-QTc values was observed, particularly at day-10, where the delay between the 12­lead ECG and the SW-ECG was the shortest (-2.6 ± 64.7 min): 407 ± 26 ms on the 12­lead ECG vs 407 ± 22 ms on SW-ECG, bias -1 ms, limits of agreement -46 ms to +45 ms; the difference between the two measures was <50 ms in 98.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: In real-world epidemic conditions, AI-QTc duration measured by SW-ECG is in fair agreement with manual measurements on 12­lead ECGs. Following further validation, AI-assisted SW-ECGs may be suitable for QTc interval monitoring.

In search of a quick, safe and successful therapeutic agent; we screened various clinically approved drugs for the in-vitro inhibitory effect on 3CLPro which may be able to halt virus replication. The methods used includes protease activity assay, fluorescence quenching, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), Thermofluor® Assay, Size exclusion chromatography and in-silico docking studies. We found that Teicoplanin as most effective drug with IC50 ~ 1.5 µM. Additionally, through fluorescence quenching Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) for Teicoplanin was estimated as 2.5 × 105 L·mol-1, which suggests a relatively high affinity between Teicoplanin and 3CLPro protease. The SPR shows good interaction between Teicoplanin and 3CLPro with KD ~ 1.6 µM. Our results provide critical insights into the mechanism of action of Teicoplanin as a potential therapeutic against COVID-19. We found that Teicoplanin is about 10-20 fold more potent in inhibiting protease activity than other drugs in use, such as lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, atazanavir etc. Therefore, Teicoplanin emerged as the best inhibitor among all drug molecules we screened against 3CLPro of SARS-CoV-2.","Tripathi, Praveen Kumar; Upadhyay, Saurabh; Singh, Manju; Raghavendhar, Siva; Bhardwaj, Mohit; Sharma, Pradeep; Patel, Ashok Kumar",Int J Biol Macromol,,502

Plants lacking all four ROP genes comprised an unpatterned clump of spherical cells that were unable to form gametophores, demonstrating that ROP is essentially for spatial patterning at the cellular and tissue levels. The functional ROP fusion protein formed a steep gradient at the apical plasma membranes of growing tip cells. ROP also predicted the site of branch formation in the apical cell at the onset of mitosis, which occurs one to two cell cycles before a branch cell emerges. While FRAP studies demonstrated that ROP dynamics do not depend on the cytoskeleton, acute depolymerization of the cytoskeleton removed ROP from the membrane only in recently divided cells, pointing to a feedback mechanism between the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, and ROP.","Cheng, Xiaohang; Mwaura, Bethany W; Chang Stauffer, Sophia R; Bezanilla, Magdalena",Plant cell,,502
336722,Transforming library collections in a pandemic: the perspective from Edge Hill University,2021,"This article reports the outcome of a project to develop and assess a predictive model of vulnerability indicators for COVID-19 infection in Los Angeles County. Multiple data sources were used to construct four indicators for zip code tabulation areas: (1) pre-existing health condition, (2) barriers to accessing health care, (3) built environment risk, and (4) the CDC's social vulnerability. The assessment of the indicators finds that the most vulnerable neighborhoods are characterized by significant clustering of racial minorities. An overwhelming 73% of Blacks reside in the neighborhoods with the two highest levels of pre-existing health conditions. For the barriers to accessing health care indicator, 40% of Latinx reside in the highest vulnerability places. The built environment indicator finds that selected Asian ethnic groups (63%), Latinx (55%), and Blacks (53%) reside in the neighborhoods designated as high or the highest vulnerability. The social vulnerability indicator finds 42% of Blacks and Latinx and 38% of selected Asian ethnic group residing in neighborhoods of high vulnerability. The vulnerability indicators can be adopted nationally to respond to COVID-19. The metrics can be utilized in data-driven decision making of re-openings or resource distribution such as testing, vaccine distribution and other pandemic-related resources to ensure equity for the most vulnerable.","Ong, Paul M; Pech, Chhandara; Gutierrez, Nataly Rios; Mays, Vickie M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,502

338175,Meta-trends in global value chains and development: interacting impacts with COVID-19 in Africa,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested the protective effect of statins against the development of PUD although the results were inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim to summarise all available data. METHODS: A literature review was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to December 2017. Cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies that compared the risk of PUD among statins users versus non-users were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: A total of 3 studies (1 case-control and 2 retrospective cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The risk of PUD was numerically lower among statins-users compared with non-users with the pooled OR of 0.89. However, the result did not achieve statistical significance with 95% CI of 0.67-1.18. The between-study statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 80%). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the risk of PUD was numerically lower among statin users. However, the results did not reach statistical significance. More studies are still required to further characterise this potential protective effect.","Wijarnpreecha, Karn; Panjawatanan, Panadeekarn; Leelasinjaroen, Pornchai; Ungprasert, Patompong",,,502

339414,Government support to airlines in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Academics claim that past events hold important lessons for risk managers. This chapter is based on that premise, specifically on the possibility that those charged with meeting the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic can learn lessons from the successes and failures of those who met the challenge of the 1918–1919 Spanish flu pandemic. One of the most interesting aspects of the United States of America’s (USA’s) experience of the Spanish flu pandemic was the degree to which political agendas shaped local responses. Some cities prioritised public health over almost every other consideration. Others prioritised the local economy and the war effort. Cities that prioritised public health generally experienced less death and suffering than those that did not. Early Twentieth Century politics influenced how the Spanish flu pandemic proceeded. Today, New Millennium politics is shaping the COVID-19 pandemic. Plus-ça-change. During the early stages of the pandemic, some countries prioritised public health. Others did not. Regarding numbers of excess deaths attributable to COVID-19, there are sharp differences between the best and worst performing countries. Academics have long argued that Modernity is Janus-faced, gifting us technologies that, contingent on how they are used, either enhance or erode public safety. Consider, for example, nuclear fission and dynamite. It is a sad irony that one of Modernity’s greatest achievements—affordable air service—helped seed COVID-19 across the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic is an echo from the past. Dark Age dystopias—and mentalities—persist. The promissory note that is Modernity is being questioned as never before. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bennett, S.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,,502

340395,Exploring Strategic Directions of Pandemic Crisis Management: A Text Analysis of World Economic Forum COVID-19 Reports,2021,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the provision and use of healthcare services throughout the world. In Slovenia, an epidemic was officially declared between mid-March and mid-May 2020. Although all non-essential health care services were put on hold by government decree, oncological services were listed as an exception. Nevertheless, as cancer control depends also on other health services and additionally major changes in people's behaviour likely occurred, we aimed to analyse whether cancer diagnosis and management were affected during the COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia. Methods We analysed routine data for the period November 2019 through May 2020 from three sources: (1) from the Slovenian Cancer Registry we analysed data on pathohistological and clinical practice cancer notifications from two major cancer centres in Ljubljana and Maribor; (2) from the e-referral system we analysed data on all referrals in Slovenia issued for oncological services, stratified by type of referral; and (3) from the administrative data of the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana we analysed data on outpatient visits by type as well as on diagnostic imaging performed. Results Compared to the November 2019 - February 2020 average, the decrease in April 2020 was about 43% and 29% for pathohistological and clinical cancer notifications; 33%, 46% and 85% for first, control and genetic counselling referrals; 19% (53%), 43% (72%) and 20% (21%) for first (and control) outpatient visits at the radiotherapy, surgery and medical oncology sectors at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, and 48%, 76%, and 42% for X-rays, mammograms and ultrasounds performed at the Institute, respectively. The number of CT and MRI scans performed was not affected. Conclusions Significant drops in first referrals for oncological services, first visits and imaging studies performed at the Institute, as well as cancer notifications in April 2020 point to a possibility of a delayed cancer diagnosis for some patients during the first surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Slovenia. The reasons for the delay cannot be ascertained with certainty and could be linked to health-seeking behaviour of the patients, the beliefs and practices of doctors and/ or the health system management during the epidemic. Drops in control referrals and control visits were expected and are most likely due to the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana postponing non-essential follow-ups through May 2020.","Zadnik, Vesna; Mihor, Ana; Tomsic, Sonja; Zagar, Tina; Bric, Nika; Lokar, Katarina; Oblak, Irena",Radiol Oncol,,502

341705,Similarities and differences in managing the Covid-19 crisis and climate change risk,2020,"Patients with schizophrenia represent a vulnerable population who have been understudied in COVID-19 research. We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with schizophrenia and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50,750 patients were included, of whom 823 were schizophrenia patients (1.6%). The schizophrenia patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25.6% vs. 21.7%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.30 [95% CI 1.08-1.56], p = 0.0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23.7% vs. 28.4%; aOR 0.75 [95% CI 0.62-0.91], p = 0.0062) compared to controls. Significant interactions between schizophrenia and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (p = 0.0006 and p < 0.0001). Schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7.89%). schizophrenia patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13.93%) and schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (-15.44% and -5.93%, respectively). Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between schizophrenia patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of schizophrenia patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during and after hospitalization for reducing health disparities in this vulnerable population.","Fond, Guillaume; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Lançon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Boyer, Laurent",Ann. med.-psychol,,502
341758,Epistemic Responsibility in the Face of a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nosocomial outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can have devastating consequences from both a resource cost and patient healthcare perspective. Relying on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for identifying infected individuals may result in missed cases. Screening for antibodies after an outbreak can help to find missed cases and better illuminate routes of transmission. METHODS: In this study, we present the results of a serological screening of the healthcare workers (HCWs) on a ward for infectious diseases in Sweden with a point-of-care antibody test 8 weeks after an outbreak of COVID-19. In all, 107/123 (87%) of HCWs who were tested with RT-PCR in the outbreak investigation participated in this study on seroprevalence. Participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire entailing epidemiological data. The cohort was stratified by RT-PCR result and the resulting groups were compared to each other. RESULTS: Six (8%) HCWs who were tested RT-PCR negative during the outbreak investigation had developed specific IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These HCWs had all worked shifts with colleagues who later were tested RT-PCR positive during the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a serological follow-up screening after an outbreak may be used as a complement to virus detection in an outbreak situation. However, immunoglobulin (Ig) G-detection should also be performed at the start of an outbreak, to facilitate interpretation of the results.","Strand, Rasmus; Fernström, Nils; Holmberg, Anna; De Marinis, Yang; Fraenkel, Carl-Johan; Rasmussen, Magnus",Infect Dis (Lond),,502

There is little knowledge about the academic burnout among nursing students in these difficult circumstances, especially in traditional Chinese medicine universities, and the relationship between the burnout and their psychological capital and academic engagement. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to describe academic burnout and clarify the relationships between academic burnout, academic engagement, and psychological capital among nursing students in traditional Chinese medicine universities. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study. SETTING: The study sampled a four-year undergraduate traditional Chinese medicine university in Jian, Shandong Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sampling method was used to select 733 nursing students from April to June 2020. METHODS: The Academic Burnout Scale, the Positive Psychological Capital Scale, and the Academic Engagement Scale were used for data collection, in addition to social-demographic data. Path analysis was used to clarify the relationships among academic burnout, academic engagement and psychological capital. RESULTS: Of all the study participants, 39.29% had a certain degree of academic burnout. Academic engagement and psychological capital were negatively correlated with academic burnout among nursing students in traditional Chinese medicine university. Psychological capital was positively correlated with academic engagement. CONCLUSION: Nursing students had a certain degree of academic burnout. Academic engagement played a partial mediated role in the relationship between psychological capital and academic burnout.","Wang, Jinfang; Bu, Lingrui; Li, Yan; Song, Jie; Li, Na",Nurse Educ Today,,502

The urgent need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and enable continued development of effective countermeasures is aided by the production of laboratory tools that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 research. We previously created a directly accessible SARS-CoV-2 toolkit containing user-friendly reverse genetic (RG) infectious clones of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using K18-human ACE2 (hACE2) mice, we confirmed the validity of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses to reproduce the infection profile, clinical disease, and pathogenesis already established in mice infected with natural SARS-CoV-2 isolates, often patient derived. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice developed substantial clinical disease and weight loss by day 6 postinfection. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs and brains of infected K18-hACE2 mice, and infection resulted in viral pneumonia with considerable changes in lung pathology, as seen previously with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. In mice infected with RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2-mCherry, mCherry was detected in areas of lung consolidation and colocalized with clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2-assocated immunopathology. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses successfully recapitulated many of the features of severe COVID-19 associated with the K18-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With utility in vivo, the RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be valuable resources to advance numerous areas of SARS-CoV-2 basic research and COVID-19 vaccine development.IMPORTANCE To develop COVID-19 countermeasures, powerful research tools are essential. We produced a SARS-COV-2 reverse genetic (RG) infectious clone toolkit that will benefit a variety of investigations. In this study, we further prove the toolkit's value by demonstrating the in vivo utility of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates. RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 isolates reproduce disease signs and pathology characteristic of the K18-hACE2 mouse model of severe COVID-19 in infected mice. Having been validated as a model of severe COVID-19 previously using only natural SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients, this is the first investigation of RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses in K18-hACE2 mice. The RG-rescued SARS-CoV-2 viruses will facilitate basic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the preclinical development of COVID-19 therapeutics.","Liu, Xiang; Zaid, Ali; Freitas, Joseph R; McMillan, Nigel A; Mahalingam, Suresh; Taylor, Adam",mBio (Online),,502
345092,Guidance for Medical Ethicists to Enhance Social Cooperation to Mitigate the Pandemic,2021,"Due to the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies on inflammation and cardiovascular involvement, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 still remains uncertain. It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses.","Centurión, Osmar Antonio; Scavenius, Karina E; García, Laura B; Torales, Judith M; Miño, Luís M",,,502
345204,COVID-19 economic vulnerability and resilience indexes: Global evidence,2021,"As a potential transmission route for diseases, aerosols have an important impact on human health. At present, research concerning the biological components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is of increasing interest. However, previous research has mainly focused on serious pollution conditions, creating a knowledge gap regarding background atmospheric microbes. In this study, we observed the atmosphere of Huairou in Beijing for one year, analyzed the characteristics of the physiological metabolic activity of the microorganisms as an index to determine the air quality, and further explored the microbial communities. From January 2018 to January 2019, a total of 157 days of microbial activity data for PM2.5 and PM10 were obtained through the use of a modified fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis method. Our results showed that there was no significant difference between the microbial activity of PM2.5 and PM10, even though there was significant seasonal variation. At increasing pollution levels, the results showed that the microbial activity decreased at first, and then increased as the conditions worsened. The microbial community of PM2.5 was analyzed using the high-throughput sequencing method. There were significant seasonal differences in species richness and community diversity of bacteria in PM2.5, whereas there was variation only in its fungi species richness. Notably, the microbial community dominated by bacteria has a significant influence on microbial activity. From the perspective of microbial community composition, this study uncovered the possible causes of microbial activity variation and identified the key bacteria and fungi. These results will provide a theoretical basis for both improving air biological pollution predictions and ambient air quality evaluations.","Chen, Hanlin; Du, Rui; Zhang, Yongtao; Zhang, Sujian; Ren, Weishan; Du, Pengrui",Sci Total Environ,,502
345497,Digital Divide and Social Dilemma of Privacy Preservation,2021-10-06,"Background: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a genetically caused neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe disability. We assessed the feasibility of a telehealth program supporting gross motor skills in RTT.Methods: Five girls with RTT were assessed and a home-based exercise program developed in response to functional goals. Families then participated in monthly Skype sessions for 6 months, guided by a physiotherapist to monitor progress and adjust the program as necessary. Goal Attainment Scaling was used to evaluate progress and a parental satisfaction questionnaire was administered.Results: Four goals were established for each participant and progress was greater than would be expected in 16 of 20 goals. Parents evaluated the program as feasible and useful for their daughters.Discussion: A telehealth model of home-based intervention supported individuals with RTT to achieve gross motor skills and was found to be feasible. This model is important at present times during COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown.","Lotan, Meir; Downs, Jenny; Elefant, Cochavit",Dev Neurorehabil,,502
345741,Early-Responding Civil Society and a Late Coming State: Findings from Turkey during the Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic influences health care facilities world-wide. The flow rate, type, and severity of cases presented to emergency departments varied during the pandemic in comparison to the past years. However, this change has not been well-described among the cases of hospital admission due to toxic exposure. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Recognition of the pattern of toxic exposure among the cases refereed to Tanta Poison Control Center (TPCC; Tanta, Egypt) during the past five years, and furthermore, exploration of the impact of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of presented cases. METHODS: The current study is a five-year retrospective, comparative cross-sectional study carried out among acutely intoxicated patients admitted to TPCC during the spring months (March through May) of 2016-2020. A total of 1,916 patients with complete medical records were recruited. The type and manner of toxic exposure, demographic, clinical data, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The current study noted that there were delays in time from toxic exposure to emergency services during the lockdown period. This was reflected in significant lower recovery rates (884.8/1,000 population; z = -3.0) and higher death rates (49.4/1,000 population; z = 2.1) despite the marked decrease in the total number of hospital admissions in comparison to the past four years. The lockdown period showed significantly higher phosphides (z = 3.5; &#967;2 = 34.295; P <.001) and antipsychotics exposure (z = 3.6; &#967;2 = 21.494; P <.001) than the previous years. However, predominance of female exposure and intentional self-poisoning was maintained over the past five years, including the lockdown. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated lockdown greatly reformed the usual intoxication pattern of the cases admitted to emergency room. Also, it played a role in delaying time of hospital arrival, which was reflected as lower recovery rates and higher death rates.","Fayed, Manar M; Sharif, Asmaa F",Prehosp Disaster Med,,502
346026,Survey of Social Media Use for Surgical Education During Covid-19,2020,"The recent emergence and subsequent global spread of COVID-19 has forced a rapid shift to online and remote learning at veterinary schools. Students in a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine program were taught using a real-time online platform for one semester, with recorded synchronous lectures and tutorials, virtual laboratories, and clinical skills classes where possible. Students in all years of the program were surveyed twice, 8 weeks apart to assess their perceptions of online teaching and to identify challenges they experienced. Using a 10-point Likert scale, students agreed that they could achieve their learning outcomes using online learning with no more difficulty than with face-to-face teaching, allocating average scores of 7.6 and 8.2 at each time point. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the impact of online teaching on time-management of their learning due to the loss of travel time. They enjoyed aspects of teaching such as recorded lectures, online polls quizzes, and chat-boxes that allowed more student-focused learning. However, there were concerns about the reduction in face-to-face interactions including loss of classroom atmosphere and reduced interaction with peers. Students experienced technical problems in a median of 20% of lectures (range 10%-50%) at the first survey and 10% at the second (range 10%-50%). Increased use of strategies to optimize peer interactions is recommended to facilitate student learning using online platforms. Moving forward beyond the pandemic, allowing flexible time management and a shift toward student-centered learning using strategies such as flipped classrooms may be beneficial.","Parkes, Rebecca S V; Barrs, Vanessa R D",J Vet Med Educ,,502
346205,European Union Responses to the Covid-19 Pandemic: adaptability in times of Permanent Emergency,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spinal cord complications associated with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) are being widely reported. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize so far available pieces of evidence documenting de novo novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mediated spinal cord demyelinating diseases. Indeed, the spinal demyelinating disorders that have been reported in those patients who have suffered from COVID-19 rather than on the people already living with diagnosed or undiagnosed primary demyelinating disorders. METHODS: We used the existing PRISMA consensus statement. Data were collected from PubMed, NIH Litcovid, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases, as well as Pre-print servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, and pre-preints.org), until September 10, 2020, using pre-specified searching strategies. RESULTS: The 21 selected articles were all case reports and included 11 (52%) men and 10 (48%) women. The mean age was of 46.7â¯±â¯18.0. The neurological manifestations included weakness, sensory deficit, autonomic dysfunction and ataxia. In most cases, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis were found. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five (24%) patients, meanwhile in 13 (62%) patients, the testing was negative. Testing was not performed in two cases and, in one, data were unavailable. Nearly half of the cases (Nâ¯=â¯9) were associated with isolated long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), whereas a combination of both LETM and patchy involvement was found in two. Only five patients had isolated short segment involvement and two patchy involvement. Furthermore, concomitant demyelination of both brain and spine was reported in six patients. Concerning the prognosis, most of the patients improved and the mortality rate was low (Nâ¯=â¯2, <10%). CONCLUSION: Spinal cord demyelination should be added to the plethora of immune mediated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19.","Mondal, Ritwick; Deb, Shramana; Shome, Gourav; Ganguly, Upasana; Lahiri, Durjoy; Benito-León, Julián",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,502

The dissection room experience provides an opportunity for nurturing the principles of ethical practice among medical students early in the curriculum. When the exercise of human dissection is followed within the boundaries of ethics it effectively props an ideal example for the young minds to emulate in the future. Hence in every stage of dissection room activity precious human body needs to be handled in an ethical manner so as to set a standard for the students. The present review is an attempt to collate the recommendations documented by researchers as per ethical guidelines in the context of human dissection. The review highlights on the ethical norms which needs to be adhered to while receiving the human body of a donor and during preservation of the same. It reflects on ideal ethical behaviour in the dissection room during the act of dissection and finally emphasize on the respectful disposal of the human remains in an ethical manner. The intended purpose of this article is to support uniform adoption of the recommendations for ethical handling of human bodies used in anatomical dissection.,"Ghosh, Sanjib Kumar",Ann Anat,,502

347876,Factors Influencing Life Satisfaction of International Students in Mainland China,2020,"Introduction: effective and safe means of sample collection is a crucial component of testing for Covid-19. Uptake of testing is key to containing and controlling the spread of the virus. Scientists have been working on various strategies that will increase the uptake of testing for COVID-19. One such method involves the use of the drive-through sampling strategy. Methods: data was collected by both qualitative and quantitative methods. An eligibility form was filled online. While in-depth interviews were conducted for the qualitative aspect of the study. Results: 2,600 visits were recorded at the website, 2300 (88.46%) participants successfully registered for the test. 57.4% were found eligible of which 78.0% presented for the test. This Consisted of 78.0% drive-through and 22.0% walk-in. The average time for transiting through the drive-through site was 19.2 ± 4.6minutes while that of the walk-in was 28 ± 9.2min. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the qualitative component, respondents opined that maximum safety measures were deployed to protect both participants and health workers. Most said that the turnaround time for the sampling process was short. Conclusion: the sampling strategy although largely successful, is largely dependent on Internet penetrability, thus this sampling modality will be best utilized as an adjunct to established models of sample collection.","Amoo, Olufemi Samuel; Ohihoin, Aigbe Gregory; Musa, Adesola Zaidat; Idighe, Ifeoma; Ige, Fehintola; Giwa-Tubosun, Temie; Oloko, Sodiq; Abiola, Aisha; Ohihoin, Esther Ngozi; David, Agatha Ngozi; Salako, Abideen; Oladele, David; Gab-Okafor, Chidinma Muoghalu; Bamidele, Tajudeen Akanji; Aina, Oluwagbemiga Olanrewaju; Chukwu, Emelda; Odunukwe, Nkiruka Nnonyelum; Ezechi, Oliver Chukwujekwu; Audu, Rosemary Ajuma; Salako, Babatunde Lawal",Pan Afr Med J,,502

Ideological polarization - the extent to which political views are widely dispersed - is already strong among elites, but less so among the general public (McCarty, 2019, p. 50-68). Strong mutual distrust and hostility between Democrats and Republicans in the U.S., combined with the elites' already strong ideological polarization, could lead to increasing ideological polarization among the public. The paper addresses two questions: (1) Is there a level of ideological polarization above which polarization feeds upon itself to become a runaway process? (2) If so, what policy interventions could prevent such dangerous positive feedback loops? To explore these questions, we present an agent-based model of ideological polarization that differentiates between the tendency for two actors to interact (exposure) and how they respond when interactions occur, positing that interaction between similar actors reduces their difference while interaction between dissimilar actors increases their difference. Our analysis explores the effects on polarization of different levels of tolerance to other views, responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar actors, multiple ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and external shocks. The results suggest strategies for preventing, or at least slowing, the development of extreme polarization.","Axelrod, Robert; Daymude, Joshua J.; Forrest, Stephanie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06492v2.pdf,502
349382,Learning in the Time of Covid-19: Some Preliminary Findings,2021,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether asthma has an influence on contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or having worse outcomes from COVID-19 disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship between asthma and patients with COVID-19 with poor outcomes. METHODS: The pooled prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. The pooled effect size (ES) was used to evaluate the association between asthma and patients with COVID-19 with poor outcomes. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 worldwide was 8.3% (95% CI, 7.6-9.0) based on 116 articles (119 studies) with 403,392 cases. The pooled ES based on unadjusted effect estimates revealed that asthma was not associated with reduced risk of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (ES, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78-1.06). Similarly, the pooled ES based on unadjusted effect estimates revealed that asthma was not associated with the reduced risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (ES, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.73-1.05). However, the pooled ES based on adjusted effect estimates indicated that asthma was significantly associated with reduced risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (ES 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86). CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was similar to that in the general population, and asthma might be an independent protective factor for the death of patients with COVID-19, which suggests that we should pay high attention to patients co-infected asthma and COVID-19 and take locally tailored interventions and treatment. Further well-designed studies with large sample sizes are required to verify our findings.","Shi, Li; Xu, Jie; Xiao, Wenwei; Wang, Ying; Jin, Yuefei; Chen, Shuaiyin; Duan, Guangcai; Yang, Haiyan; Wang, Yadong",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,502

So, food safety must be a priority for these establishments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training intervention on the health and food safety knowledge, attitude, and self-reported practice (KAP) of restaurant food handlers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 159 restaurant food handlers in Tehran, Iran. The training intervention was developed based on the latest global guidelines. The KAP of the subjects was measured before and after the training. Fisher's exact test, paired t test, and repeated measures ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Data analysis was done using the IBM_SPSS software. The total knowledge scores of participants were low (17.6%), moderate (35.2%), and good (47.2%) before training, which were changed to 5% (low), 23.9% (moderate), and 71.1% (good) after training. The total pretraining attitude scores were 0.6, 77.4, 18.2, and 3.8% that were changed to 0% (strongly negative), 49.1% (negative), 33.3% (positive), and 17.6% (strongly positive), respectively. Also, the self-reported practice scores of the participants before training were 1.3, 56, and 42.7 that were changed to 0% (weak), 26.4% (acceptable), and 73.6% (desirable) after the intervention, respectively. Paired t test results showed a statistically significant increase in all scores. The interaction of training with age and education was statistically significant in increasing the knowledge and attitude scores of the participants by the repeated measures ANOVA. Improving the KAP of food handlers by health and food safety training can improve the status of restaurants and minimize the outbreak of pandemic diseases, including COVID-19, which is an effective step in community health. Thus, it is an urgent need for policymakers to design an online system of continuous food safety training for food handlers.","Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh; Salmani, Yeganeh; Esfarjani, Fatemeh",,,502

Seed germination is a crucial stage in the plant life cycle and is particularly important for turf establishment and management. Experiments have confirmed that melatonin can be a potential regulator signal in seeds. To determine the effect of exogenous melatonin administration and explore the its potential in regulating seed growth, we studied the concentrations of several hormones and performed a transcriptome analysis of zoysia seeds after the application of melatonin. The total antioxidant capacity determination results showed that melatonin treatment could significantly improve the antioxidant capacity of zoysia seeds. The transcriptome analysis indicated that several of the regulatory pathways were involved in antioxidant activity and hormone activity. The hormones concentrations determination results showed that melatonin treatment contributed to decreased levels of cytokinin, abscisic acid and gibberellin in seeds, but had no significant effect on the secretion of auxin in early stages. Melatonin is able to affect the expression of IAA (indoleacetic acid) response genes. In addition, melatonin influences the other hormones by its synergy with other hormones. Transcriptome research in zoysia is helpful for understanding the regulation of melatonin and mechanisms underlying melatonin-mediated developmental processes in zoysia seeds.","Dong, Di; Wang, Mengdi; Li, Yinreuizhi; Liu, Zhuocheng; Li, Shuwen; Chao, Yuehui; Han, Liebao",Sci Rep,,502

They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. METHODS: By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. RESULTS: It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. CONCLUSION: There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.","Zhen-Dong, Yang; Gao-Jun, Zhou; Run-Ming, Jin; Zhi-Sheng, Liu; Zong-Qi, Dong; Xiong, Xie; Guo-Wei, Song",J Infect,,502
353635,By the light of the corona (virus): revealing hegemonic masculinity and the double bind for men in responding to crises,2020,"Introduction: COVID-19, the new pandemic faced by the world, is a novel betacoronavirus causing severe respiratory coronavirus syndrome. Elderly patients, people with underlying chronic illnesses, cancer patients, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk and account for higher mortality rate. Unfortunately, there is no approved medication for treatment, till date, thereby supporting triage management and difficult decision-making. Thus, there should be a substantial increase in the palliative care in times of pandemic. There should be an increase in the availability of palliative care services in different care settings. Due to a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19, it has been reported on how palliative care is being delayed, discontinued, or deprioritized. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers occurring in providing the palliative care to the patients with nonmalignant illness. Methodology: A questionnaire was designed after studying previous work over palliative care and pandemic crisis and was distributed among the physicians, surgeons, and the residents; a total of 95 health-care workers were involved. The survey was done through mails. The response then was evaluated and analyzed. Results: As seen by the responses we got from the health-care workers, the main issue is the nonavailability of the personal protective equipment during this pandemic. Keeping the current scenario in mind, regarding COVID-19, the patients are at fear of coming to the hospital at first place, and even if they come then the fear of being alone haunts them. One of the biggest fears of the patient is dying alone, without being in contact with their loved ones. Conclusion: Palliative care should be an essential part of any health-care service in any humanitarian crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, effort should be made to remove the barriers and provide palliative care to the patient.","Jain, Tanya; Jain, Roopesh",Indian J. Palliative Care,,502
353792,The impact of COVID-19 on the travel and leisure industry returns: Some international evidence,2020,"Deep learning-based fluence map prediction(DL-FMP) method has been reported in the literature, which generated fluence maps for desired dose by deep neural network(DNN)-based inverse mapping. We hypothesized that DL-FMP is similar to general fluence map optimization(FMO) because it's theoretically based on a general inverse mapping. We designed four experiments to validate the generalizability of DL-FMP to other types of plans apart from the training data, which contained only clinical head and neck(HN) full-arc VMAT plans. The first three experiments quantified the generalizability of DL-FMP to multiple anatomical sites, different delivery modalities, and various degree of modulation(DOM), respectively. The fourth experiment explored the generalizability and stability to infeasible dose inputs. Results of the first experiment manifested that DL-FMP can generalize to lung, liver, esophagus and prostate, with gamma passing rates (GPR) higher than 95%(2%/2mm). The second experiment showed that DL-FMP can generalize to partial-arc plans and predict partial-arc fluences. GPR(3mm/3%) ranged from 96% to 99%. DL-FMP cannot generate fluence maps in discrete beam angles for IMRT input. But the predicted dose still agreed with ground truth dose with 93% GPR(5%/5mm). The third experiment demonstrated that DL-FMP can generalize to various DOMs, with GPRs(3%/3mm) ranged in 94%-98%. Moreover, the DOM of predicted fluence maps correlated to the optimality of the input dose accordingly.

In conclusion, we validated that DL-FMP can generalize to plans for multiple anatomical sites, plans of different delivery modalities and plans with various DOM. It can also make stable prediction for infeasible input.","Ma, Lin; Chen, Mingli; Gu, Xuejun; Lu, Weiguo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.15032v1.pdf,502

However, the industry in Ghana is yet to take off due to policy uncertainty and regulatory costs. The paper analyzed the key determinants and how they interact to impact the scaling up of wind energy in Ghana, using time series data, the vector auto regression (VAR) model from 2013 to 2019.There were four endogenous variables, grouped under policy, population growth, wind capacity, and electrification rate. The findings revealed the dynamic behavior of the variables from the VAR to a strongly significant positive correlation to deploying wind energy in Ghana. The impulse response functions (IRFs) equally exhibited a positive impact long-run trajectory growth of the variables after a shock to the system. The response of the first lags had differences of log policy and that of the log of GDP produced a curious result from the shock by taking a steady positive growth path in the short run and nosedived to a negative pathway in the long run. On the other hand, the interaction of the first differences of the lags of log wind capacity and log policy is quite instructive, as the headwind produced a negative relationship in the short run and to a positive growth path in the long run. This was anticipated, as the wind capacity installation of Ghana is expected to increase in the long run, when pipeline projects materialize.","Sun, Huaping; Khan, Abdul Razzaq; Bashir, Ahmed; Alemzero, David Ajene; Abbas, Qaiser; Abudu, Hermas",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,502

354812,Globalization and the Outbreak of COVID-19: An Empirical Analysis,2021,"Agent-based models (ABMs) are a flexible framework that are frequently used for modeling many biological systems, including cell migration, molecular dynamics, ecology, and epidemiology. Analysis of ABM dynamics can be challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements. Common approaches to ABM analysis include extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the ABM or the derivation of coarse-grained differential equation (DE) models to predict the expected or averaged output from an ABM. Both of these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive computation of complex ABMs may be infeasible, and coarse-grained DE models can fail to accurately describe ABM dynamics in certain parameter regimes. We propose that methods from the equation learning (EQL) field provide promising novel approaches for ABM analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from data science that aims to infer DE models directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods from EQL can be used to learn DE models from ABM simulations. We demonstrate that this framework is easy to use, requires few ABM simulations, and accurately predicts ABM dynamics in parameter regions where coarse-grained DE models fail to do so. We highlight these advantages through several case studies involving two ABMs that are broadly applicable to biological phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore cell biology experiments and a susceptible-infected-recovered model of infectious disease spread.","Nardini, John T.; Baker, Ruth E.; Simpson, Matthew J.; Flores, Kevin B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08255v1.pdf,502

355311,Audio Interview: Caring for Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs), which are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses, may cause infections in mammals and birds. Apart from the respiratory manifestations, CoVs are also responsible for infections of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous systems. Their propensity to recombine allows them to easily transmit and adapt to new hosts. The emergence of a new CoV in humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is attributed to a zoonotic origin, has provoked numerous studies to assess its pathogenicity for different animal species (pets, farm and wild animals). Available results indicate that numerous animal species are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. From April 2020, when the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in minks was reported in the Netherlands, to the end of January 2021, further outbreaks have been confirmed in Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United States, Greece, France, Canada, Lithuania and Poland. It has also been established that human-to-minks and minks-to-human transmission may occur. The results obtained to date indicate that the virus was originally introduced into the minks population by humans, possibly at the start of the pandemic and had been circulating in the population for several weeks before detection. Recent data indicate that minks are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the route or routes of virus transmission between farms, other than by direct contact with infected humans, have not been identified. In minks, infection can occur in clinical and subclinical form, making it possibly difficult to detect. Therefore, minks could represent potentially dangerous, not always recognized, animal reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. The current data indicate that further studies on minks and other Mustelidae are needed to clarify whether they may be a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, and if so, how and whether this can be prevented.","Pomorska-Mól, M; Wlodarek, J; Gogulski, M; Rybska, M",Animal,,502

Initial studies of vaccine were performed in adults. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many questions need to be answered about the ethics and feasibility of these trials. Given the harms of the COVID-19 pandemic and the now-known efficacy of the vaccines in adults and teens, the question of whether clinical equipoise exists for a placebo-controlled trial of vaccines in younger children remains. Parents may be reluctant to enroll children in these trials because they want their child to receive the vaccine or because they are worried about vaccines or clinical trials in general. One option for gathering data on tolerability and efficacy in children would be to use a nonrandomized trial to enroll parents willing to vaccinate their children and those who are hesitant. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an open-label trial that could provide guidance for future pandemics.

357759,"Lockdown poetry, healing and the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.","Zhao, Wei; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xingzhi; Yu, Qizhi; Liu, Jun",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,502

Like SARS-CoV, angiotencin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for the virus to make an entry into the cell. ACE2 is a part of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, which is expressed in several organs that opposes the angiotensin (Ang) II functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be approximately 3.4%; however, some comorbid conditions like underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of mortality. In addition, cardiovascular involvement as a complication of SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors that are expressed tremendously in the heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by acute respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia. Traditional risk factors could aggravate the process of COVID-19 infection that urges the triage of these high-risk patients for SARS-CoV2. Currently, there is no effective, proven treatment or vaccination for COVID-19, but many investigators are struggling to find a treatment strategy as soon as possible. Some potential medications like chloroquine by itself or in combination with azithromycin and some protease inhibitors used for the treatment of COVID-19 have cardiovascular adverse effects, which should be kept in mind while the patients taking these medications are being closely monitored.","Amirfakhryan, Hamideh; Safari, Fatemeh",Hell. j. cardiol,,502

We propose a general class of generalized hyperbolic skew Student's t distribution with stochastic volatility for the error term in the VAR model that allows us to take into account skewness and heavy tails. Tools for Bayesian inference and model selection using a Gibbs sampler are provided. In an empirical study, we present evidence of skewness and heavy tails for monthly macroeconomic variables.

To date no specific antiviral drug have been approved for COVID-19, so the treatment of the disease is mainly focused on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Moreover, there are no treatments of proven efficacy to reduce the progression of the disease from mild/moderate to severe/critical. An activation of the coagulation cascade leading to severe hypercoagulability has been detected in these patients, therefore early anticoagulation may reduce coagulopathy, microthrombus formation, and the risk of organ damages. The role of heparin in COVID-19 is supported by a lot of studies describing its pleiotropic activity but it must be proven in clinical trials. Several protocols have been designed to assess the risk-benefit profile of heparin (low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin) in hospitalized subjects. Although prophylactic doses may be adequate in most patients, it is important to wait the results of clinical trials in order to define the appropriate effective dose able to improve disease outcome.","Gozzo, Lucia; Viale, Pierluigi; Longo, Laura; Vitale, Daniela Cristina; Drago, Filippo",Front.

Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sample of older adolescents and young adults. DESIGN: Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). SETTING: The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. EXPOSURES: The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. MAIN OUTCOMES: The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesitancy. RESULTS: Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or mental health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.","Afifi, Tracie O; Salmon, Samantha; Taillieu, Tamara; Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley; Fortier, Janique; Driedger, S Michelle",Vaccine,,502

METHODS: We performed descriptive clinical follow-up (day (D) 7, D30 and D60) of 150 patients with noncritical COVID-19 confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR at Tours University Hospital from 17 March to 3 June 2020, including demographic, clinical and laboratory data collected from the electronic medical records and by phone call. Persisting symptoms were defined by the presence at D30 or D60 of at least one of the following: weight loss &#8805;5%, severe dyspnoea or asthenia, chest pain, palpitations, anosmia/ageusia, headache, cutaneous signs, arthralgia, myalgia, digestive disorders, fever or sick leave. RESULTS: At D30, 68% (103/150) of patients had at least one symptom; and at D60, 66% (86/130) had symptoms, mainly anosmia/ageusia: 59% (89/150) at symptom onset, 28% (40/150) at D30 and 23% (29/130) at D60. Dyspnoea concerned 36.7% (55/150) patients at D30 and 30% (39/130) at D60. Half of the patients (74/150) at D30 and 40% (52/130) at D60 reported asthenia. Persistent symptoms at D60 were significantly associated with age 40 to 60 years old, hospital admission and abnormal auscultation at symptom onset. At D30, severe COVID-19 and/or dyspnoea at symptom onset were additional factors associated with persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 2 months after symptom onset, two thirds of adults with noncritical COVID-19 had complaints, mainly anosmia/ageusia, dyspnoea or asthenia. A prolonged medical follow-up of patients with COVID-19 seems essential, whatever the initial clinical presentation.","Carvalho-Schneider, Claudia; Laurent, Emeline; Lemaignen, Adrien; Beaufils, Emilie; Bourbao-Tournois, Céline; Laribi, Saïd; Flament, Thomas; Ferreira-Maldent, Nicole; Bruyère, Franck; Stefic, Karl; Gaudy-Graffin, Catherine; Grammatico-Guillon, Leslie; Bernard, Louis",Clin. microbiol. infect,,502

The rapid spread in the UK of this new variant has caused other countries to be vigilant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We based our initial screening of B.1.1.7 on the dropout of the S gene signal in the TaqPath assay, caused by the 69/70 deletion. Subsequently, we confirmed the B.1.1.7 candidates by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: We describe the first three imported cases of this variant from London to Madrid, subsequent post-arrival household transmission to three relatives, and the two first cases without epidemiological links to UK. One case required hospitalization. In all cases, drop-out of gene S was correctly associated to the B.1.1.7 variant, as all the corresponding sequences carried the 17 lineage-marker mutations. CONCLUSION: The first identifications of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant in Spain indicate the role of independent introductions from the UK coexisting with post-arrival transmission in the community, since the early steps of this new variant in our country.","Buenestado-Serrano, Sergio; Recio, Raúl; Sola Campoy, Pedro J; Catalán, Pilar; Folgueira, M Dolores; Villa, Jennifer; Muñoz Gallego, Irene; de la Cueva, Víctor Manuel; Meléndez, M Angeles; Andrés Zayas, Cristina; Losa-García, Juan E; Goyanes, M José; Fraile Torres, Arturo; Von Wermitz, Andres; Fradejas-Villajos, Isabel; Del Arco, Carmen; Campelo-Gutiérrez, Carolina; González Bodi, Sara; López-Wolf, Daniel; Iglesias-Franco, Higinio; Pérez-Lago, Laura; Arce Arnaez, Araceli; Rodriguez Baena, Elena; Ordobas Gavin, María; Muñoz, Patricia; Delgado, Rafael; Cardeñoso, Laura; Viedma, Esther; García de Viedma, Darío",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

For achieving this goal, the United Nations focuses on state capacity development and associated determinants in emerging and developing countries. By focusing on this objective, this study evaluates and examines the liaison of state capacity, socio-economic conditions, private health expenditures, and demographic pressure to the quality of health and its accessibility in Pakistan from 1990 to 2019. This study investigates the policy implications and their consequences on Pakistan's health conditions during the last three decades. Moreover, during COVID-19, pandemic health governs policies in the year 2020 have also been considered by using the Health Containment Index and analyzed policy implication on combating COVID-19. By applied Ordinary Least Square and Fixed Effect estimations, results show that Pakistan's health conditions have been showing sluggish improvement in the last three decades. Prudent policy-making and adequate health spending have a strong significant impact on health quality and accessibility, while institutional corruption and demographic pressure have adversely affected Pakistan's health outcomes. This proposed study analyzed that policy enforcement has been fragile in Pakistan from 1990 to 2010. Furthermore, this study concludes that from the year 2010 to date with the 18th constitutional amendment to administration and public policies have fractionally improved Pakistan's health conditions. However, Pakistan still lacks the International standards and minimum criteria of health measures a far behind Sustainable Development. The present study concludes that a sound and effective policy enforcement by enhancing resource capacity, quality of institutional practices, and controlling socio-economic conditions will promote SDG of health quality in Pakistan.","Mohsin Abbas, Hafiz Syed Xu Xiaodong Sun Chunxia",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,502

This fMRI study assessed the extent to which early adolescents (n = 39, ages 12-14) conform to their parents' and peers' conflicting attitudes toward different types of behavior (unconstructive and constructive) and in response to different types of influence (negative and positive). Overall, adolescents exhibited low rates of conformity, sticking with their pre-existing attitudes 65 % of the time. When they did conform, adolescents were more likely to conform to their peers' attitudes towards constructive than unconstructive behaviors, exhibiting decreased activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus during peer conformity toward constructive over unconstructive behaviors. Adolescents were also more likely to conform when their parents and peers endorsed relatively more positive influence than negative influence, exhibiting increased activation in the temporoparietal junction when considering conforming to negative over positive influence. These results highlight early adolescents' ability to stick with their own opinions when confronted with opposing attitudes and conform selectively based on the social context.","Do, Kathy T; McCormick, Ethan M; Telzer, Eva H",Dev Cogn Neurosci,,502

In this study, we compared characteristics and outcomes of ESKD and non-ESKD patients admitted with COVID-19 to a large safety-net hospital. METHODS: We evaluated 759 adults (45 with ESKD) hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spring of 2020. We examined clinical characteristics, laboratory measures and clinical outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between ESKD status and outcomes. RESULTS: 73% of ESKD and 47% of non-ESKD patients identified as Black (p = 0.002). ESKD patients were older and had higher rates of comorbidities. Admission ferritin was approximately 6-fold higher in ESKD patients. During hospitalization, the rise in white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and C-reactive protein, and the decrease in platelet count and serum albumin were all significantly greater in ESKD patients. The in-hospital mortality was higher for ESKD [18% vs. 10%; multivariable adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95% CI, 0.48-4.70)], but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ESKD patients had more co-morbidities and more robust inflammatory response than non-ESKD patients. The odds ratio point estimate for death was higher in ESKD patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.","Kamel, Mohamed Hassan; Mahmoud, Hassan; Zhen, Aileen; Liu, Jing; Bielick, Catherine G; Mostaghim, Anahita; Lin, Nina; Chitalia, Vipul; Ilori, Titilayo; Waikar, Sushrut S; Upadhyay, Ashish",PLoS One,,502

The target respondents included Macao residents, who reside in the city and are aged 18 and above. Data collection was conducted during the epidemic period when human contact and gatherings were discouraged;thus, an online questionnaire survey is the ideal approach. Convenience sampling was adopted as the questionnaire weblink was sent through personal contacts in social media. The system recorded 282 responses;among which, 45 responses were incomplete and thus eliminated. Nine outliers were identified based on absolute z-scores greater than 3.29. Hence, a total of 228 responses were retained for analysis, which was performed using SPSS PROCESS model 80. The residents' positive evaluation of government performance in dealing with epidemic results in their anticipation of quick tourism recovery, because of their high self-efficacy in avoiding infection and high perceived ability of government to recover the local tourism industry;by contrast, it is not due to the alleviation of negative emotion that arises from epidemic.

371050,Researching Crime After a Disaster: What We Can Learn From a Large Survey in New Orleans After Hurricane Katrina,2020,"Previously, we showed that modulation of the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion boosts release rates supralinearly (Schotten, 2015). Here we show that mouse hippocampal synapses employ this principle to trigger Ca2+-dependent vesicle release and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We assess energy barrier changes by fitting release kinetics in response to hypertonic sucrose. Mimicking activation of the C2A domain of the Ca2+-sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), by adding a positive charge (Syt1D232N) or increasing its hydrophobicity (Syt14W), lowers the energy barrier. Removing Syt1 or impairing its release inhibitory function (Syt19Pro) increases spontaneous release without affecting the fusion barrier. Both phorbol esters and tetanic stimulation potentiate synaptic strength, and lower the energy barrier equally well in the presence and absence of Syt1. We propose a model where tetanic stimulation activates Syt1-independent mechanisms that lower the energy barrier and act additively with Syt1-dependent mechanisms to produce PTP by exerting multiplicative effects on release rates.","Huson, Vincent; Meijer, Marieke; Dekker, Rien; Ter Veer, Mirelle; Ruiter, Marvin; van Weering, Jan R T; Verhage, Matthijs; Cornelisse, Lennart Niels",eLife (Cambridge),,502

This enzyme is a promising antiviral target because catalytic mutations render viruses nonpathogenic. Here, we report a massive crystallographic screening and computational docking effort, identifying new chemical matter primarily targeting the active site of the macrodomain. Crystallographic screening of 2533 diverse fragments resulted in 214 unique macrodomain-binders. An additional 60 molecules were selected from docking more than 20 million fragments, of which 20 were crystallographically confirmed. X-ray data collection to ultra-high resolution and at physiological temperature enabled assessment of the conformational heterogeneity around the active site. Several fragment hits were confirmed by solution binding using three biophysical techniques (differential scanning fluorimetry, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, and isothermal titration calorimetry). The 234 fragment structures explore a wide range of chemotypes and provide starting points for development of potent SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain inhibitors.","Schuller, Marion; Correy, Galen J; Gahbauer, Stefan; Fearon, Daren; Wu, Taiasean; Díaz, Roberto Efraín; Young, Iris D; Carvalho Martins, Luan; Smith, Dominique H; Schulze-Gahmen, Ursula; Owens, Tristan W; Deshpande, Ishan; Merz, Gregory E; Thwin, Aye C; Biel, Justin T; Peters, Jessica K; Moritz, Michelle; Herrera, Nadia; Kratochvil, Huong T; Aimon, Anthony; Bennett, James M; Brandao Neto, Jose; Cohen, Aina E; Dias, Alexandre; Douangamath, Alice; Dunnett, Louise; Fedorov, Oleg; Ferla, Matteo P; Fuchs, Martin R; Gorrie-Stone, Tyler J; Holton, James M; Johnson, Michael G; Krojer, Tobias; Meigs, George; Powell, Ailsa J; Rack, Johannes Gregor Matthias; Rangel, Victor L; Russi, Silvia; Skyner, Rachael E; Smith, Clyde A; Soares, Alexei S; Wierman, Jennifer L; Zhu, Kang; O039,; Brien, Peter; Jura, Natalia; Ashworth, Alan; Irwin, John J; Thompson, Michael C; Gestwicki, Jason E; von Delft, Frank",Sci.

371689,The Strategy of Vaccination and Global Pandemic: How Framing May Thrive on Strategy During and After Covid-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Electrical stimulation of the upper airway dilator muscles is an emerging treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Invasive hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) has been accepted as treatment alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for selected patients, while transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) of the upper airway is being investigated as non-invasive alternative. METHODS: A meta-analysis (CRD42017074674) on the effects of both HNS and TES on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in OSA was conducted including published evidence up to May 2018. Random-effects models were used. Heterogeneity and between-study variance were assessed by I2 and &#964;2, respectively. RESULTS: Of 41 identified clinical trials, 20 interventional trials (n = 895) could be pooled in a meta-analysis (15 HNS [n = 808], 5 TES [n = 87]). Middle-aged (mean ± SD 56.9 ± 5.5 years) and overweight (body mass index 29.1 ± 1.5 kg/m2) patients with severe OSA (AHI 37.5 ± 7.0/h) were followed-up for 6.9 ± 4.0 months (HNS) and 0.2 ± 0.4 months (TES), respectively. The AHI improved by - 24.9 h-1 [95%CI - 28.5, - 21.2] in HNS (&#967;2 79%, I2 82%) and by - 16.5 h-1 [95%CI - 25.1, - 7.8] in TES (&#967;2 7%, I2 43%; both p < 0.001). The ESS was reduced by - 5.0 (95%CI - 5.9, - 4.1) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Both invasive and transcutaneous electrical stimulation reduce OSA severity by a clinically relevant margin. HNS results in a clinically relevant improvement of symptoms. While HNS represents an invasive treatment for selected patients with moderate to severe OSA, TES should be further investigated as potential non-invasive approach for OSA.","Ratneswaran, Deeban; Guni, Ahmad; Pengo, Martino F; Al-Sherif, Miral; He, Baiting; Cheng, Michael Cf; Steier, Joerg; Schwarz, Esther I",Sleep breath,,502
371690,The Strategy of Vaccination and Global Pandemic: How Framing May Thrive on Strategy During and After Covid-19,2021,"Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an unprecedented health crisis. The most common chronic illness among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is hypertension. Immune dysregulation plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the development of hypertension; however, the dynamic immunological characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension remain largely unclear. Methods: In total, 258 hypertensive patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. CD38+HLA-DR+ and CD38+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells, IFNÎ³+CD4+ and IFNÎ³+CD8+ T cells, the titers of IgG, IgM, and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and SARS-CoV-2 throat viral loads were measured weekly over 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Clinical outcomes were also monitored. Findings: CD4+ T lymphopenia was observed in 100% of the severe and critical cases. Compared with the surviving patients, the patients with fatal outcomes exhibited high and prolonged expression of CD38+HLA-DR+ and CD38+PD-1+ on CD8+ T cells, low expression of SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNÎ³+CD4+ and IFNÎ³+CD8+ T cells, low titers of IgG, IgM, and IgA against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and high SARS-CoV-2 viral load during the illness. In the surviving patients, the viral load was significantly inversely correlated with SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNÎ³+CD8+and IFNÎ³+CD4+ T cells, IgG, IgM, and IgA. Interpretation: T lymphopenia is common in critical or severe COVID-19 cases with hypertension. Prolonged activation and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells were associated with severe disease. The delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses may be insufficient for overcoming severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses.","Zeng, Qiang; Li, Yong-Zhe; Dong, Sheng-Yong; Chen, Zong-Tao; Gao, Xiang-Yang; Zhang, Han; Huang, Gang; Xu, Yang",Front Immunol,,502
371868,Challenges in medical waste management amid COVID-19 pandemic in a megacity Dhaka,2021,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) remains of global public health concern. Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. Over 70% of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-infected dromedaries are found in Africa but no zoonotic disease has been reported in Africa. We aimed to understand whether individuals with exposure to dromedaries in Africa had been infected by MERS-CoV. METHODS: Workers slaughtering dromedaries in an abattoir in Kano, Nigeria, were compared with abattoir workers without direct dromedary contact, non-abattoir workers from Kano, and controls from Guangzhou, China. Exposure to dromedaries was ascertained using a questionnaire. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were tested for MERS-CoV specific neutralising antibody and T-cell responses. FINDINGS: None of the participants from Nigeria or Guangdong were MERS-CoV seropositive. 18 (30%) of 61 abattoir workers with exposure to dromedaries, but none of 20 abattoir workers without exposure (p=0·0042), ten non-abattoir workers or 24 controls from Guangzhou (p=0·0002) had evidence of MERS-CoV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in PBMC. T-cell responses to other endemic human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, HKU-1, and NL-63) were observed in all groups with no association with dromedary exposure. Drinking both unpasteurised camel milk and camel urine was significantly and negatively associated with T-cell positivity (odds ratio 0·07, 95% CI 0·01-0·54). INTERPRETATION: Zoonotic infection of dromedary-exposed individuals is taking place in Nigeria and suggests that the extent of MERS-CoV infections in Africa is underestimated. MERS-CoV could therefore adapt to human transmission in Africa rather than the Arabian Peninsula, where attention is currently focused.

372427,Reimagining an Unfolding Case in the Online Clinical Arena,2020,"Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is growing concern that patients are forgoing necessary care. Emergency departments (ED) represent an important site of eye care. We analyzed patterns of ED visits at an eye-specific ED since the declaration of the public health crisis. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective, cross-sectional single center study, medical records of 6744 patients who presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear ED between March 1st and April 30th in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were studied. The primary outcome measures were total volume of ED visits, proportion of urgent ED visits, and proportion of surgical visits. Results: Overall, the median number of daily visits to the ED decreased by 18 visits per day since the declaration of public health guidelines (interquartile range, 9-24, p < 0.001). This accounted for a 32% decrease in the total volume of ED visits in 2020 compared to prior years during the study period (p < 0.001). There was a 9% increase in the proportion of primary diagnoses considered urgent (p = 0.002). The proportion of visits requiring urgent surgery increased by 39% (p = 0.004). Conclusion: The total number of eye-specific ED visits dropped compared to prior years while the proportion of urgent visits increased. Patients were likely more reluctant to seek eye care, deferring less urgent evaluation.","Moon, Jade Y; Miller, John B; Katz, Raviv; Ta, Thong; Szypko, Colleen; Garg, Itika; Lorch, Alice C; Gardiner, Matthew F; Armstrong, Grayson W",Clin Ophthalmol,,502

Several studies have pointed to their inadequacy, which is becoming a serious problem during the global crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a direct link between the leadership in the healthcare system and its performance, conditioned by the level of decisions of leaders of medical teams. It is they who determine the performance of healthcare delivery. The study published in this article contains the results from the examination of the dependence between crisis leadership and team performance in healthcare providers. The subject of the research is the impact of cognitive diversity and the quality of crisis-leadership decision-making on the performance of medical teams in the acute crisis phase. The study was conducted on a research sample of 216 healthcare providers after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia (April 2020). The respondents to the research sample involved team leaders in healthcare providers, who have been involved in managing the crisis. The study has justified the positive association between crisis leadership and team performance, which is mediated by cognitive diversity, supporting the quality of decision-making in crisis leadership. The results of the research have proven that the performance of the medical team in the acute crisis phase can be positively influenced through qualified decision-making in crisis leadership amplified by the usage of cognitive diversity.","Joniaková, Zuzana; Jankelová, Nadezda; Blstáková, Jana; Némethová, Ildikó",,,502

Here we established a dynamic transmission model via Python and realized comprehensive regulation of disease control measures. We classified government interventions into three categories and introduced three parameters as descriptions for the key points in disease control, these being intraregional growth rate, interregional communication rate, and detection rate of infectors. Our simulation predicts the infection by COVID-19 in the UK would be out of control in 73 days without any interventions; at the same time, herd immunity acquisition will begin from the epicentre. After we introduced government interventions, single intervention is effective in disease control but at huge expense while combined interventions would be more efficient, among which, enhancing detection number is crucial in control strategy of COVID-19. In addition, we calculated requirements for the most effective vaccination strategy based on infection number in real situation. Our model was programmed with iterative algorithms, and visualized via cellular automata, it can be applied to similar epidemics in other regions if the basic parameters are inputted, and is able to synthetically mimick the effect of multiple factors in infectious disease control.","Zhang, Yuxuan; Gong, Chen; Li, Dawei; Wang, Zhi-Wei; Pu, Shengda D; Robertson, Alex W; Yu, Hong; Parrington, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07190v1.pdf,502

MethodsWe determined IgG and NAb against SARS-CoV-2 variants one year following mild wild-type infection (n=104) and two-dose regimens with BNT162b2 (BNT/BNT) (n=67), ChAdOx1 (ChAd/ChAd) (n=82), or heterologous ChAdOx1 followed by BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT) (n=116). FindingsWild type spike IgG and NAb remained detectable in 80% (83/104) of unvaccinated participants one year post mild infection. The neutralizing capacity was similar against wild type (reference), Alpha (0.95 (0.92-0.98) and Delta 1.03 (0.95-1.11) but significantly reduced against Beta (0.54 (0.48-0.60)) and Gamma 0.51 (0.44-0.61). Similarly, BNT/BNT and ChAd/ChAd elicited sustained capacity against Alpha and Delta (1.01 (0.78-1.31) and 0.85 (0.64-1.14)) and (0.96 (0.84-1.09) and 0.82 (0.61-1.10) respectively), with reduced capacity against Beta (0.67 (0.50-0.88) and 0.53 (0.40-0.71)) and Gamma (0.12 (0.06-0.27) and 0.54 (0.37-0.80)). A similar trend was found following ChAd/BNT (0.74 (0.66-0.83) and 0.70 (0.50-0.97) against Alpha and Delta and 0.29 (0.20-0.42) and 0.13 (0.08-0.20) against Beta and Gamma). InterpretationPersistent neutralization of the wide-spread Alpha and Delta variants one year after wild-type infection may aid vaccine policy makers in low-resource settings when prioritizing vaccine supply. The reduced capacity of neutralizing Beta and Gamma strains, but not the Alpha and Delta strains following both infection and three different vaccine regimens argues for caution against Beta and Gamma-exclusive mutations in the efforts to optimize next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

It has been documented that many natural compounds display antiviral activities, including anti-SARS-CoV effect. The present study deals with compounds of Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database with known biological activity that probably impedes the activity of six essential enzymes of the virus. Promising drug-like compounds were identified, demonstrating better docking score and binding energy for each druggable targets. After an extensive screening analysis, three novel multi-target natural compounds were predicted to subdue the activity of three/more major drug targets simultaneously.

Secondly, Word2vec is applied to the classified texts resulting in Eurocentric, non-Eurocentric and global representations of the data for the three target languages. This comparative analysis demonstrates not only the efficacy of the classification method but also highlights geographic, temporal and linguistic differences in the disinformation-related media.

Italy thus became the first country in the world, with the exception of Hubei, to enact lockdown measures as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to contain it. Italy is also a seismically active area, and as such is monitored by a dense permanent network of seismic stations. We analyse continuous seismic data from many stations in northern and central Italy, and quantify the impact of the lockdown on seismic ambient noise, as a function of time and location. We find that the lockdown reduces ambient noise significantly in the 1-10 Hz frequency range; because natural sources of seismic noise are not affected by the lockdown, the seismic signature of anthropic noise can be characterised with unprecedented clarity, by simply comparing the signal recorded before and after the lockdown. Our results correlate well with independent evaluations of the impact of the lockdown (e.g., cell phone displacements), and we submit that ambient-noise seismology is a useful tool to monitor containment measures such as the coronavirus lockdowns.","Poli, Piero; Boaga, Jacopo; Molinari, Irene; Cascone, Valeria; Boschi, Lapo",Sci Rep,,502

Here we report the room temperature X-ray structure of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 3CL Mpro, revealing the ligand-free structure of the active site and the conformation of the catalytic site cavity at near-physiological temperature. Comparison with previously reported low-temperature ligand-free and inhibitor-bound structures suggest that the room temperature structure may provide more relevant information at physiological temperatures for aiding in molecular docking studies.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; O039,; Neill, Hugh M; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Stols, Lucy; Langan, Paul; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Coates, Leighton; Kovalevsky, Andrey",Nat Commun,,502
377683,"Confronting COVID: Crisis Leadership, Turbulence, and Self-Care",2021,"Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies.","Li, Tom; Liu, Yan; Li, Man; Qian, Xiaoning; Dai, Susie Y",PLoS One,,502

An extensive literature search was performed to identify papers on COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) in children, published between January 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020. There were 44 relevant papers on COVID-19 in children. The results showed that COVID-19 occurs in 0.39–12.3% of children. Clinical signs and symptoms are comparable to those in adults, but milder forms and a large percentage of asymptomatic carriers are found among children. Elevated inflammatory markers are associated with complications and linked to various co-infections. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans in children revealed structural changes similar to those found in adults, with consolidations surrounded by halos being somewhat specific for children with COVID-19. The recommended treatment includes providing symptomatic therapy, with no specific drug recommendations for children. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults. This review highlights that COVID-19 in children is similar to the disease in the adult population, but with particularities regarding clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, chest imaging, and treatment. The prognosis is much better for children compared to adults, but with the progression of the pandemic; the cases in children might change in the future.","Ciuca, Ioana M.",Risk Manage. Healthc.

METHODS We evaluated 397 patients who were follow-up and treated due to COVID-19 infections. The ages, genders, chronic diseases, ABO and Rh blood group antigens, admission rates to Intensive Care Units (ICU), and mortality rates of the patients were analyzed. FINDINGS The mean age of the 397 patients with COVID-19 was 47±17 years. In the blood group analysis of the patients, A Rh-positive (A +) was the most frequently seen blood type (176 patients, 44.3%) followed by O Rh-positive (0 +) (109 patients, 27,5%); 38 patients were Rh negative (Rh -) (9,6%). 53 of the patients (13,4%) were followed in ICU and 29 patients died (7,3%). Neither mortality nor admission to ICU was seen for Rh - group. The comparison of Rh groups concerning the need for ICU admission revealed a significantly high rate of ICU admission in the Rh + group (p=0,011), while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh antigen (p=0,069). CONCLUSION The most frequently seen blood type among COVID-19 patients was A +. The Rh + blood group was found in all cases who were admitted to ICU and had a death outcome. The Rh + blood group was found in a significantly high number of patients who were admitted to ICU, while no significant relationship was found between mortality and Rh blood group.","Yaylacamp,; 305,; Selçuk,; Dheir, Hamad; amp,; 304,; 351,; sever, Kubilay; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; 350,; enocak, Didar; Kocayigit, Havva; Guclu, Ertugrul; Suner, Kezban; Ekerbicer, Hasan; Koroglu, Mehmet",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,502

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving the administration of convalescent plasma to treat severe influenza. Healthcare databases were searched in February 2020. All records were screened against eligibility criteria, and the risks of bias were assessed. The primary outcome was the fatality rate. RESULTS: A total of 2861 studies were retrieved and screened. Five eligible RCTs were identified. Pooled analyses yielded no evidence that using convalescent plasma to treat severe influenza resulted in significant reductions in mortality (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.51-2·23; P = 0.87; I2 = 35%), number of days in the intensive care unit, or number of days on mechanical ventilation. This treatment may have the possible benefits of increasing hemagglutination inhibition titers and reducing influenza B viral loads and cytokine levels. No serious adverse events were reported. The included studies were generally of high quality with a low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of convalescent plasma appears safe but may not reduce the mortality, number of days in the intensive care unit, or number of days on mechanical ventilation in patients with severe influenza.","Xu, Zhiheng; Zhou, Jianmeng; Huang, Yongbo; Liu, Xuesong; Xu, Yonghao; Chen, Sibei; Liu, Dongdong; Lin, Zhimin; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Yimin",Crit Care,,502

The collective measures necessary to contain the pandemic infringe people’s autonomy severely, and thereby expose the contradictory polarisation between individual liberty and the ‘common good’ which has arisen. ‘Social distancing’ has long become an accompanying feature of globalisation and the crisis threatens to deepen social, economic and political divisions and to herald a retreat to more divisive measures. The professional experience social work and social pedagogy have in dealing with the underlying contradictions and their specific knowledge on how to constitute social solidarity in conditions of justice and equality are now more than ever relevant in the post-crisis reconstruction. Their core message is that personal autonomy can only be achieved in the context of fair structural conditions, and these professions have a vital role in promoting the constructive realignment of both spheres.","Aluffi Pentini, Anna; Lorenz, Walter",Eur.

378680,Between vulnerability and resistance: How a woman copes with dramatic implications of COVID-19 in Russia,2021,"A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a global threat to world health and economy. Its dimeric main protease (Mpro), which is required for the proteolytic cleavage of viral precursor proteins, is a good candidate for drug development owing to its conservation and the absence of a human homolog. Improving our understanding of Mpro behavior can accelerate the discovery of effective therapies to reduce mortality. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (100 ns) of 50 mutant Mpro dimers obtained from filtered sequences from the GISAID database were analyzed using root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, Rg, averaged betweenness centrality, and geometry calculations. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 Mpro essentially behaves in a similar manner to its SAR-CoV homolog. However, we report the following new findings from the variants: (1) Residues GLY15, VAL157, and PRO184 have mutated more than once in SARS CoV-2; (2) the D48E variant has lead to a novel ""TSEEMLN"""" loop at the binding pocket; (3) inactive apo Mpro does not show signs of dissociation in 100 ns MD; (4) a non-canonical pose for PHE140 widens the substrate binding surface; (5) dual allosteric pockets coinciding with various stabilizing and functional components of the substrate binding pocket were found to display correlated compaction dynamics; (6) high betweenness centrality values for residues 17 and 128 in all Mpro samples suggest their high importance in dimer stability-one such consequence has been observed for the M17I mutation whereby one of the N-fingers was highly unstable. (7) Independent coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations suggest a relationship between the rigidity/mutability and enzymatic function. Our entire approach combining database preparation, variant retrieval, homology modeling, dynamic residue network (DRN), relevant conformation retrieval from 1-D kernel density estimates from reaction coordinates to other existing approaches of structural analysis, and data visualization within the coronaviral Mpro is also novel and is applicable to other coronaviral proteins.","Sheik Amamuddy, Olivier; Verkhivker, Gennady M; Tastan Bishop, Özlem",J Chem Inf Model,,502

Herein, we aimed to investigate the reflections of our otherwise crowded emergency services' quietness in the period of normalization. METHODOLOGY: Our study retrospectively investigated three groups of patients: the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Restrictions' when the restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection; the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Normalization' when normalization attempts were made and the restrictions were lifted; and the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' exactly 1 year before the normalization period, which would reflect the normal functioning of the emergency service at that time. The three groups were compared with respect to the demographic characteristics and patient outcomes (death/hospitalization/discharge). RESULTS: A total of 69,474 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' whereas 21,278 patientswere admitted in the 'Period of Restrictions'. The number of emergency service admissions in the 'Period of Restrictions' was significantly lower (p<0.01). A total of 72,843 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Normalization'. There was no statistically significant difference between the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' and the 'Period of Normalization' in terms of the number of emergency service admissions (p=0.127). A total of 9,421 (13.5%) patients were hospitalized in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' and the corresponding figure for the 'Period of Normalization' was 19,876 (27.2%). A total of 24 (0.03%) patients died in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' while 172 (0.23%) patients died in the 'Period of Normalization'. The number of patients who were hospitalized and lost in the 'Period of Normalization' was significantly higher than that of patients who were hospitalized and lost in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' (p<0.01) CONCLUSION: In the period of COVID-19 pandemic, fear of getting infected and the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the disease have kept people out of hospitals. We believe that while the restrictions imposed on various activities have prevented thevirus from spreading, they also caused the course of non-COVID-19 diseases to worsen and mortality rates to rise. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the public should be informed about the importance of uninterrupted treatment/follow-up and 'Life-threatening Urgent Conditions' that should necessarily prompt hospital visit in possible pandemics.","Görmeli Kurt, Nazli; Çamci, Melih",Int J Clin Pract,,502

381351,COVID-19: Clinical and laboratory manifestations in novel coronavirus infection/ COVID-19: Manifestações clínicas e laboratoriais na infecção pelo novo coronavírus,2020,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing COVID-19, is rapidly spreading across sub-Saharan Africa. Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is often needed, particularly among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa is travel time to the nearest health-care facility. To inform the geographical targeting of additional health-care resources, we aimed to estimate travel time at a 1 kmâ×â1 km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest health-care facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We assembled a dataset on the geolocation of health-care facilities, separately for hospitals and any type of health-care facility and including both private-sector and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1 kmâ×â1 km resolution were obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest health-care facility for each 1 kmâ×â1 km grid using a cost-distance algorithm. Findings: 9·6% (95% CI 5·2-16·9) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of 6 h or longer, varying from 0·0% (0·0-3·7) in Burundi and The Gambia to 40·9% (31·8-50·7) in Sudan. For the nearest health-care facility of any type (whether primary, secondary, or tertiary care), 15·9% (95% CI 10·1-24·4) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time of 2 h or longer, ranging from 0·4% (0·0-4·4) in Burundi to 59·4% (50·1-69·0) in Sudan. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of 12 h or longer and to the nearest health-care facility of any type of 6 h or longer. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 years or older with the longest travel times was 348 min (IQR 240-576; equal to 5·8 h) for the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 41 min (34-54) in Burundi to 1655 min (1065-2440; equal to 27·6 h) in Gabon. Interpretation: Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and health-care facilities of any type can be used by policy makers and non-governmental organisations to help target additional health-care resources, such as makeshift hospitals or transport programmes to existing health-care facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows the locations of population groups most likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to health-care facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform the efforts of countries to improve physical access to care for conditions that are common among older adults in the region, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.

382129,Proposal to Increase the Level of Rural Business Activity after COVID-19,2021,"CONTEXT: Originally developed for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the antiviral combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is being repurposed for treating the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite minimal experience in this markedly different population and an in-vitro derived EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 several hundred-fold greater than for HIV. We present a case series including a case of severe hyponatremia and a 32-fold overdose raising safety and effectiveness concerns in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. FINDINGS: Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV patients, concentrations in COVID-19 patients were 3-fold greater (19.37 ± 10.12 mcg/mL versus 6.25 mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. Side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12), electrolyte imbalances (4/12), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12) and triglyceride elevations (2/12). CONCLUSION: No patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and effectiveness of LPV/r. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring for side effects and not necessarily attribute them to COVID-19.","Lepage, Marc-Antoine; Rozza, Nicholas; Kremer, Richard; Grunbaum, Ami",Clin Toxicol (Phila),,502

We aim to examine the impact of facility-based isolation compared to self-isolation at home on the continuing epidemic in the United States. METHODS: We developed a compartment model to simulate the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 and calibrated it to key epidemic measures in the United States from March to September. We simulated facility-based isolation strategies with various capacities and starting times under different diagnosis rates. The primary model outcomes included the reduction of new infections and deaths over two months from October onwards. We further explored different effects of facility-based isolation under different epidemic burdens by major US Census Regions, and performed sensitivity analyses by varying key model assumptions and parameters. RESULTS: We projected that facility-based isolation with moderate capacity of 5 beds per 10 000 total population could avert 4.17 (95% Credible Interval 1.65-7.11) million new infections and 16 000 (8000-23 000) deaths in two months compared with home-based isolation, equivalent to relative reductions of 57% (44-61%) in new infections and 37% (27-40%) in deaths. Facility-based isolation with high capacity of 10 beds per 10 000 population would achieve greater reduction of 76% (62-84%) in new infections and 52% (37-64%) in deaths when supported by the expanded testing with a 20% daily diagnosis rate. Delays in implementation would substantially reduce the impact of facility-based isolation. The effective capacity and the impact of facility-based isolation varied by epidemic stage across regions. CONCLUSION: Timely facility-based isolation for mild COVID-19 cases could substantially reduce the number of new infections and effectively curb the continuing epidemic compared to home-based isolation. The local epidemic burden should determine the effective scale of facility-based isolation strategies.","Chen, Simiao; Chen, Qiushi; Yang, Juntao; Lin, Lin; Li, Linye; Jiao, Lirui; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Wang, Chen; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Bärnighausen, Till",J. travel med,,502

383537,Exercise Anatomy: A Flexible Approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: The influence of various environmental factors on skin properties is well known. However, there is a lack of research into the effect of quarantine masks on skin properties, even though the use of masks has significantly increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of mask use on skin properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects used approved quarantine masks for 6 hours a day for 2 weeks. We measured eight skin biophysical parameters: temperature, redness, pore volume, texture, elasticity, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum content, and pH, and evaluated acne lesions before and after using quarantine masks. The evaluation was performed on the mask-wearing area of the face. RESULTS: Skin temperature, redness, and TEWL increased significantly after a 6-hour mask use, while the sebum content increased marginally. Skin elasticity was reduced by the use of masks over 1 and 2 weeks, whereas the pore volume and the number of acne lesions increased after a 2-week mask use. The skin changes caused by mask use showed sex-based differences in the skin elasticity (after 6 hours), redness, and roughness (after 2 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: The use of quarantine masks causes a change in the skin temperature, redness, and TEWL in the short term and in skin elasticity, pores, and acne in the long term. This study revealed that prolonged mask use could have negative effects on the skin.","Kim, Jongwook; Yoo, Suji; Kwon, Oh Sun; Jeong, Eui Taek; Lim, Jun Man; Park, Sun Gyoo",Skin res. technol,,502

However, there are few reports on the viral load in stools. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the stools of 13 patients with confirmed COVID-19 using as control the pepper mild mottle virus, which was proposed as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination of environmental water. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool samples from four patients (31%), among whom three presented diarrhea symptoms. One patient experiencing long-term diarrhea (22 days) had high levels of viral RNA in the stools (8.28 log10 copies/g). However, we could not isolate the SARS-CoV-2 in the stool of any patients, using VeroE6/TMPRESS2 cells for four weeks. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected in the stools of patients with the diarrhea symptoms. Further studies evaluating the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in stools and diarrhea symptoms in larger patient cohorts and upon adjusting for other causative factors and virus infectivity are still needed.","Akiyama, Yutaro; Kinoshita, Noriko; Sadamasu, Kenji; Nagashima, Mami; Yoshida, Isao; Kusaba, Yusaku; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Nagashima, Maki; Ishikane, Masahiro; Takasaki, Jin; Yoshimura, Kazuhisa; Ohmagari, Norio",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,502
386086,A Content Analysis of Coronavirus Tweets in the United States Just Prior to the Pandemic Declaration,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rapidly growing quantity of scientific publications from journal articles, preprints, and other sources. The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval (IR) methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.","Chen, Jimmy S; Hersh, William R",J Biomed Inform,,502
386145,Bibliometric evaluation of Latin American contributions on COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: The impetus to apply the lean method to creation of arteriovenous fistulae came with the pandemic restricting access to theatres. Here we present HADAP implemented in a dedicated procedure room in the Renal ward. Method: Between April and September 2020, 44 patients underwent ward-based arteriovenous fistula operations with no more than 3 people in the room - surgeon, runner and patient. The parameters assessed were duration of operation, complications, patency, patient and surgeon feedback and financial implications. Results: The service was predominantly registrar-led who created 91% of the fistulae. 95% operations were completed successfully with a 2- week primary patency of 73% and no surgical site infections. 40% of the procedures were radiocephalic fistulae. 14% procedures required surgical assistance by the runner. The average operating time reduced from 90 minutes for the first 10 cases to 50 minutes for the last 9. A structured questionnaire showed positive feedback from both patients and surgeons (4-5 out of 5). This service has cleared potentially 9 main theatre lists for more complex procedures. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the successful implementation of a novel operating environment allowing expedited care for renal failure patients. It has enhanced our ability to deliver a dialysis access program despite the challenges of COVID.","Shetty, S.; Chowdary, P.; Dabare, D.; Seet, C.; Ahmed, R.; Barlas, A.; Lindsey, B.",British Journal of Surgery,,502
386478,Travel Behaviour after the Pandemic: The Case of Bulgaria (preprint),2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused financial stress and disrupted daily life more quickly than any prior economic downturn and on a scale beyond any prior natural disaster. This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress and identify vulnerable groups using longitudinal data to account for pre-pandemic mental health status. Clinically significant psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 in a national probability sample of adults in the United States at two time points, February 2019 (T1) and May 2020 (T2). To identify increases in distress, psychological distress during the worst month of the past year at T1 was compared with psychological distress over the past 30-days at T2. Survey adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics at T1 (gender, age, race, and income) and census region at T2 with within-person increases in psychological distress. The past-month prevalence of serious psychological distress at T2 was as high as the past-year prevalence at T1 (10.9% vs. 10.2%). Psychological distress was strongly associated across assessments (X2(4)â¯=â¯174.6, pâ¯<â¯.0001). Increase in psychological distress above T1 was associated with gender, age, household income, and census region. Equal numbers of people experienced serious psychological distress in 30-days during the pandemic as did over an entire year prior to the pandemic. Mental health services and research efforts should be targeted to those with a history of mental health conditions and groups identified as at high risk for increases in distress above pre-pandemic levels.","Breslau, Joshua; Finucane, Melissa L; Locker, Alicia R; Baird, Matthew D; Roth, Elizabeth A; Collins, Rebecca L",Prev Med,,502

We investigated the safety of urgently initiated maternal telemedicine in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection. METHODS: This retrospective, single-institution study examined maternal telemedicine at the department of obstetrics of the Hokkaido University Hospital from March 4 to April 2, 2020. The physicians remotely examined the pregnant women from their homes using a visual communication system which kept communication confidential, performed prenatal checkup and administered medical care according to their various blood pressures, weights and cardiotocograms. RESULTS: Forty-four pregnant women received a total of 67 telemedicine interventions. Thirty-two pregnant women (73%) had complications, and 22 were primiparas (50%). Telemedicine interventions were provided 19 times at less than 26 weeks of gestation, 43 times between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation and 5 times after 37 weeks of gestation. There was one case with an abnormality diagnosed during the remote prenatal checkups, and the patient was hospitalized on the same day. However, there were no abnormal findings observed in mothers and children during the other 66 remote prenatal checkups and medical care.

386563,Revisiting the association between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility across 117 countries,2020,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 emerged as a public health crisis that disrupted normal patterns of health care in the New York City metropolitan area. In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS: 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS: The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","Mittel, Aaron M; Panzer, Oliver; Wang, David S; Miller, Steven E; Schaff, Jacob E; Hastie, Maya Jalbout; Sutherland, Lauren; Brentjens, Tricia E; Sobol, Julia B; Cabredo, Almarie; Hastie, Jonathan",,,502
387765,High-stakes crisis management in the Low Countries: Comparing government responses to COVID-19,2020,"Sertoli cells play a key role in spermatogenesis by supporting the germ cells throughout differentiation. The isolation of Sertoli cells is essential to study their functions. However, the close contact of Sertoli cells with other testicular cell types and the high proliferation of contaminating cells are obstacles to obtain pure primary cultures. Current rodent Sertoli cell isolation protocols result in enriched, rather than pure Sertoli cells. Therefore, novel approaches are necessary to improve the purity of Sertoli cell primary cultures. The goal of this study is to obtain pure mouse Sertoli cells using lineage tracing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We bred the Amh-Cre mouse line with tdTomato line to generate mice constitutively expressing red fluorescence specifically in Sertoli cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells isolated from prepubertal mice showed that 79% of cells expressed tdTomato, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; however, nearly all adherent cells were positive for vimentin. Most of the tomato-negative cells expressed &#945;-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), a peritubular myoid cell marker, but double-negative populations were also present. These findings suggest that vimentin lacks Sertoli cell-specificity and that &#945;-SMA is not adequate to identify all of the contaminating cells. Upon FACS sorting; however, virtually 100% of the cells were tdTomato positive, expressed vimentin, but not &#945;-SMA. Prepubertal mice yielded a higher number of Sertoli cells compared to adults, but both could be adequately sorted. In conclusion, our study shows that lineage tracing and sorting is an efficient strategy for acquiring pure populations of murine Sertoli cells.","Zomer, Helena D; Reddi, Prabhakara P",Mol. reprod. dev,,502
388033,Introduction: Surveillance and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Views from Around the World,2021,"Sweden has since the start of the pandemic a COVID-19 mortality rate that is 4 to 10 times higher than in the other Nordic countries. Also, measured as age-standardized all-cause excess mortality in the first half of 2020 compared to previous years Sweden failed in comparison with the other Nordic countries, but only among the elderly. Sweden has large socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality. Geographical, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequalities in mortality can be due to differential exposure to the virus, differential immunity, and differential survival. Most of the country differences are due to differential exposure, but the socioeconomic disparities are mainly driven by differential survival due to an unequal burden of comorbidity. Sweden suffered from an unfortunate timing of tourists returning from virus hotspots in the Alps and Sweden's government response came later and was much more limited than elsewhere. The government had an explicit priority to protect the elderly in nursing and care homes but failed to do so. The staff in elderly care are less qualified and have harder working conditions in Sweden, and they lacked adequate care for the clients. Sweden has in recent years diverged from the Scandinavian welfare model by strong commercialization of primary care and elderly care.","Diderichsen, Finn",Int J Health Serv,,502
388385,Distance learning policy in Indonesia for facing pandemic COVID-19: School reaction and lesson plans,2020,"Low levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections. Therefore, to maximize the nutritional defense against infections, a daily allowance of vitamins and trace elements for malnourished patients at risk of or diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be beneficial. Recent studies on COVID-19 patients have shown that vitamin D and selenium deficiencies are evident in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D improves the physical barrier against viruses and stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides. It may prevent cytokine storms by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines. Selenium enhances the function of cytotoxic effector cells. Furthermore, selenium is important for maintaining T cell maturation and functions, as well as for T cell-dependent antibody production. Vitamin C is considered an antiviral agent as it increases immunity. Administration of vitamin C increased the survival rate of COVID-19 patients by attenuating excessive activation of the immune response. Vitamin C increases antiviral cytokines and free radical formation, decreasing viral yield. It also attenuates excessive inflammatory responses and hyperactivation of immune cells. In this mini-review, the roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, and selenium in the immune system are discussed in relation to COVID-19.","Bae, Minkyung; Kim, Hyeyoung",Molecules (Basel),,502

METHODS: We extracted data on outpatient visits and respiratory infection visits, and tests of respiratory viruses (adenovirus (ADV), influenza A (FluA), influenza B (FluB) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) from electronic healthcare records in Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine during the COVID-19 outbreak (January-April, 2020), compared with those in 2018 and 2019 during the same periods. RESULTS: We found that outpatient visits in January, 2020 was comparable with those in 2018 and 2019, but decreased by 59.9% (288,003 vs. 717,983) and 57.4% (288,003 vs. 676,704), respectively during the period of February-April, 2020, as compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The total number of respiratory tract infections from January to April 2020 decreased by 65.7% (119,532 vs.348,762) and 59.0% (119,532 vs.291,557), respectively compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The proportion of respiratory tract infections during the outbreak also dropped compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019 (P<0.001). We also found significantly decreased number of completed tests for respiratory viruses and positive cases of ADV, FluA, FluB, and RSV during February-April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that outpatient visits and respiratory tract infections in children significantly decreased during COVID-19 outbreak. Adequate protective measures and isolation in children may help to prevent respiratory virus infections in children.","Zhu, Yueling; Li, Wei; Yang, Binbin; Qian, Ruiying; Wu, Fang; He, Xue; Zhu, Qinheng; Liu, Jinling; Ni, Yan; Wang, Jianbing; Mao, Shanshan",BMC Pediatr,,502

We sought to clinically assess commercial prototype SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays for use in screening for prior infection and convalescent plasma donation. DESIGN AND METHODS: Prototype SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays from Euroimmun were assessed utilizing remnant specimens. Specificity testing used specimens in their convalescent window for the common coronaviruses and other infectious diseases known to be associated with increased non-specificity in serologic assays. Sensitivity testing utilized serial specimens from molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 critically ill patients to assess seroconversion. Utilizing recombinant spike protein we also developed a competitive confirmation procedure to increase assay specificity. RESULTS: We determined specificity to be 97% and 81%, respectively, when indeterminate samples were considered positive and 99% and 86% when indeterminate samples were considered negative. We developed a new confirmation methodology to enhance the specificity of the assays with an anticipated specificity of 98% for IgA. Valuation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients determined median IgA seroconversion to be 8 days and IgG 10 days. Neither level nor timing of antibody response correlated with days on ventilation. End titer measurements indicate that validated improved assays may be capable of semi-quantitative measurement. CONCLUSIONS: We found these assays to be clinically acceptable for the high prevalence population tested, for instance, for convalescent plasma donation.","Wheeler, Sarah E; Shurin, Galina V; Keetch, Christian; Mitchell, Gretchen; Kattel, Gaurav; McBreen, Jeffrey; Shurin, Michael R",Clin. biochem,,502

METHODS: Four different platforms for automatic lung segmentation based on convolutional neural network (CNN), region-growing technique and atlas-based algorithm were considered. The platforms were tested using CT images of 55 COVID-19 patients with severe lung impairment. Four radiologists assessed the segmentations using a 5-point qualitative score (QS). For each CT series, a manually revised reference segmentation (RS) was obtained. Histogram-based quantitative metrics (QM) were calculated from CT histogram using lung segmentationsfrom all platforms and RS. Dice index (DI) and differences of QMs (&#916;QMs) were calculated between RS and other segmentations. RESULTS: Highest QS and lower &#916;QMs values were associated to the CNN algorithm. However, only 45% CNN segmentations were judged to need no or only minimal corrections, and in only 17 cases (31%), automatic segmentations provided RS without manual corrections. Median values of the DI for the four algorithms ranged from 0.993 to 0.904. Significant differences for all QMs calculated between automatic segmentations and RS were found both when data were pooled together and stratified according to QS, indicating a relationship between qualitative and quantitative measurements. The most unstable QM was the histogram 90th percentile, with median &#916;QMs values ranging from 10HU and 158HU between different algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: None of tested algorithms provided fully reliable segmentation. Segmentation accuracy impacts differently on different quantitative metrics, and each of them should be individually evaluated according to the purpose of subsequent analyses.","Berta, L; Rizzetto, F; De Mattia, C; Lizio, D; Felisi, M; Colombo, P E; Carrazza, S; Gelmini, S; Bianchi, L; Artioli, D; Travaglini, F; Vanzulli, A; Torresin, A",Phys Med,,502

The mortality rate of severely ill patients in the early stage is 32.5%. The exacerbation of the condition and death of patients are closely associated with inflammatory cytokine storms, which are caused by excessive activation of the immune and complement systems as well as the coinfection of other pathogens. However, the immunological characteristics and the mechanisms underlying inflammatory storms have not been well elucidated. Here, we analyzed the clinical and immunological characteristics of 71 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Based on the National Health Commission of China (NHCC) guidelines, patients were stratified into mild and severe types. We compared the clinical and laboratory data obtained from electronic medical records between the two types. In regard to the hematological parameters, COVID-19 patients showed decreased erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and complement C1q, whereas neutrophils, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly increased, especially in severe cases. We also found that CD3+ CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD19+ B lymphocytes, and CD16+ CD56+ NK cells in the peripheral blood of all patients were decreased. In addition, CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, and complement C1q in severely ill patients decreased more significantly. Additionally, interleukin 6 (IL-6) elevation was particularly prominent in all patients, especially in severe cases. These results suggest that CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, C1q as well as IL-6 may play critical roles in the inflammatory cytokine storm. The dysregulation of these aforementioned immune parameters, along with bacterial coinfection, were the important causes of exacerbation of the patients' condition and death. This study improves our understanding of the immune dysregulation of COVID-19 and provides potential immunotherapeutic strategies.IMPORTANCE The dysregulation of CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ CD56+ NK cells, C1q as well as IL-6, along with bacterial coinfection, were important causes of exacerbation of the patients' condition and death.","Wu, Yingjie; Huang, Xiaoxing; Sun, Jiaxing; Xie, Tian; Lei, Yufei; Muhammad, Jamal; Li, Xinran; Zeng, Xingruo; Zhou, Fuling; Qin, Hong; Shao, Liang; Zhang, Qiuping",MSphere,,502

The hallmark is elevated troponin, which occurs in 36% of COVID patients, with electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance being valuable tools to assist in diagnosis. Cardiac inflammation may occur secondary to direct cardiac invasion with the virus, or to intense cytokine storm, often encountered during the course of the disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and judicious use of beta-blockers are beneficial in management of myocarditis. Corticosteroids may be avoided during the very early phase of viral replication, but can be of clear benefit in hospitalized, critically ill patients.

Indeed, the world has been facing an un-preceded situation in the past couple of months following COVID-19 infestation and the associated high-mortality rates mainly attributed to sepsis and the associated multiple organ failures of particular concern; acute respiratory distress syndrome post lung injury. The current study provides evidence on the ameliorative impact of nifuroxazide, and FDA approved antidiarrheal drug in attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and myocarditis when administrated either in prophylactic or curative regimens. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in lung and heart histopathological characteristics and architecture with retraction of LPS-induced inflammatory-infiltration. This was associated with retraction in serum biomarkers of cellular injury of which; LDH, CK-MB, and ALP. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in both lung and heart oxidative status. Such positive outcomes were underlined by a significant inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on lung and heart contents of toll-like receptor (4) (TLR4)/the inflammasome NALPR3/interleukin- 1ß (IL-1ß). In conclusion: Nifuroxazide attenuates LPS-induced ALI and myocardial injury via interruption of TLR4/NALPR3/IL-1ß signaling.

Unfortunately, the state variables used (reaction enthalpy and Gibbs energy) do not take sufficient account of the conditions inside of cells, especially the crowding with macromolecules. METHODS: For this reason, the influence of crowding agents and various other parameters such as salt concentrations, pH and temperature on equilibrium position and reaction enthalpy of the glycolytic example reaction 9 (2-Phospoglycerate - > Phosphoenolpyruvate + H2O) was investigated. The conditions were chosen to be as close as possible to the cytosolic conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) MW = 20,000 g mol-1 (PEG 20,000) was used to analyze the influence of crowding with macromolecules. The equation of state electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT) was applied to consider the influence of crowding agents on the reaction equilibria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: For the reaction enthalpies and for the equilibria, it was found that the influence of salts and temperature is not pronounced while that of pH and PEG 20,000 concentration is considerable. Furthermore, it could be shown that under identical measurement conditions there are no differences between the van 't Hoff and the calorimetrically determined reaction enthalpy. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results show how important it is to consider the special cytosolic conditions when applying thermodynamic data in systems biology.","Vogel, Kristina; Greinert, Thorsten; Harms, Hauke; Sadowski, Gabriele; Held, Christoph; Maskow, Thomas",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,,502

There are currently no clinically available specific drugs for the treatment of this virus. The process of host invasion is the key to viral infection, and it is a mechanism that needs to be considered when exploring antiviral drugs. At present, studies have confirmed that angiotensin­converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the main functional receptor through which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS­CoV­2) invades host cells. Therefore, a number of studies have focused on this field. However, as ACE2 may play a dual role in mediating susceptibility and immunity to SARS­CoV­2 infection, the role of ACE2 in viral infection is controversial. Beginning with the physiological function of ACE2, the present review article summarizes the influence of the ACE2 content on the susceptibility to the virus and acute lung injury. Drug mechanisms were taken as the starting point, combined with the results of clinical trials, specifically elaborating upon and analyzing the efficacy of several ACE2­centered therapeutic drugs and their potential effects. In addition, the current status of ACE2 as a targeted therapy for COVID­19 is discussed in order to provide new insight into the clinical prevention and treatment of COVID­19.","Cai, Liyang; Guo, Xi; Cao, Yuchen; Ying, Peixi; Hong, Libing; Zhang, Yuxi; Yi, Guoguo; Fu, Min",Int J Mol Med,,502

Despite the current declining numbers globally, the direct effects of the pandemic on institutional practices and on personal stress and coping mechanisms remains unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of the pandemic on daily scheduling and work balances, its effects on stress, and to determine compliance with guidelines and to assess whether quarantining has led to other areas of increased productivity. METHODS: A trans-Atlantic convenience sample of paediatric urologists was created in which panellists (Zoom) discussed the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual units, as well as creating a questionnaire using a mini-Delphi method to provide current semi-quantitative data regarding practice, and adherence levels to recently published risk stratification guidelines. They also filled out a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire to assess contemporary pandemic stress levels. RESULTS: There was an 86% response rate from paediatric urologists. The majority of respondents reported near complete disruption to planned operations (70%), and trainee education (70%). They were also worried about the effects of altered home-lives on productivity (&#8804;90%), as well as a lack of personal protective equipment (57%). The baseline stress rate was measured at a very high level (PSS) during the pandemic. Adherence to recent operative guidelines for urgent cases was 100%. CONCLUSION: This study represents a panel discussion of a number of practical implications for paediatric urologists, and is one of the few papers to assess more pragmatic effects and combines opinions from both sides of the Atlantic. The impact of the pandemic has been very significant for paediatric urologists and includes a decrease in the number of patients seen and operated on, decreased salary, increased self-reported stress levels, substantially increased telemedicine usage, increased free time for various activities, and good compliance with guidelines and hospital management decisions.","O039,; Kelly, Fardod; Sparks, Scott; Seideman, Casey; Gargollo, Patricio; Granberg, Candace; Ko, Joan; Malhotra, Neha; Hecht, Sarah; Swords, Kelly; Rowe, Courtney; Whittam, Ben; Spinoit, Anne-Francoise; Dudley, Anne; Ellison, Jonathan; Chu, David; Routh, Jonathan; Cannon, Glenn; Kokorowski, Paul; Koyle, Martin; Silay, Mesrur Selcuk",J Pediatr Urol,,502

An Empirical Analysis of Short-Selling Bans during the Covid 19 Crisis,2020,"One of the main determinants of the spread of epidemics in human population centres is the degree of compliance with public health regulations. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between time perspective and compliance with public health regulations concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 500 adults (275 women, 225 men) aged 18 to 82 years. Sociodemographic surveys, surveys concerning knowledge about COVID-19 and compliance with public health regulations, the Polish Short Version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory, the Present-Fatalistic Scale, the Dark Future Scale, and the Carpe Diem Scale were used. Female gender and Carpe Diem were predictors of compliance with public health regulations. Men complied with public health regulations significantly less often than women. The results of our study suggest that in announcements communicating public health regulations concerning COVID-19 pandemic, emphasis should be placed on stressing the significance of focusing on 'here and now' and the importance of current behaviours for the future.","Sobol, Malgorzata; Blachnio, Agata; Przepiórka, Aneta",Soc Sci Med,,502

Cancer cervix is one of the common malignancies among women in developing and underdeveloped countries. Various challenges are being faced by patients and health-care providers to deliver optimal treatment under prescribed time frame. Faster delivery of whole treatment is desirable in the current pandemic. Overall treatment time in cancer cervix has prognostic value. Adoption of altered fractionation to delivered external beam radiation therapy could be a method for faster delivery of whole treatment. Altered fractionation such as hyperfractionation (HFX), hypofractionation, and accelerated fraction alone or with HFX has already been experimented for the past three decades. The total duration of treatment has been significantly reduced without addition of much toxicity. Few studies had also highlighted the feasibility of addition of chemotherapy to such fractionation schedule. However, prospective studies are still warranted to generate data to further support its use in the future.","Agrawal, D.

As the pandemic lingers, an epidemiological investigation that can be conducted efficiently in a timely manner can help decrease the burden on the health personnel and increase the usefulness of such information in decision making. To develop a new tool that can improve the current practice of epidemiological investigation by incorporating new technologies in digital platform and knowledge graphs. To meet the various needs of the epidemiological investigation, we decided to develop an e-Outbreak Platform that provides a semi-structured, multifaceted, computer-aided questionnaire for outbreak investigation. There are three major parts of the platform: (1) a graphic portal that allows users to have an at-glance grasp of the functions provided by the platform and then choose the one they need; (2) disease-specific questionnaires that can accommodate different formats of the information, including text typing, button selection, and pull-down menu; and (3) functions to utilize the stored information, including report generation, statistical analyses, and knowledge graphs displaying contact tracing. When the number of outbreak investigation increases, the knowledge graphs can be extended to encompass other persons appearing in the same location at the same time, i.e., constituting a potential contact cluster. The information extracted can also be used to display the tracing on a map in animation. Overall, this system can provide a basis for further refinement that can be generalized to a variety of outbreak investigations.","Chen, Wei J; Yang, Shih-Yi; Chang, Jung-Chih; Cheng, Wei-Che; Lu, Tzu-Pin; Wang, Yu-Neng; Juan, Ming-Hao; Hsu, Ruey-Tzer; Huang, Song-Ren; Tu, Jia-Jang; Wang, Pang-Chieh; Feng, Vincent W-S; Chang, Pei-Zen",Biomed J,,502

This paper reports on co-production undertaken by nursing students, early career nurses and researchers as part of a larger study to design an intervention to increase retention of early career nurses. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the co-production process in a UK university. Data were collected prospectively, concurrently and retrospectively via interview and questionnaire, between April 2018 and January 2019. Twelve co-production group members completed the questionnaire and six group members and facilitators were interviewed. Students and early career nurses reported personal benefit from participating; they developed and practised transferrable communication and problem-solving skills, believed they were able to make a difference, enjoyed contributing, found benefit from using the group as a reflective space and considered that co-production produced a credible intervention. Findings indicated co-production equipped participants to function more effectively in their nursing roles; incorporating co-production into the development of future interventions may prove beneficial.

In this case report, we present a case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis concurrent with COVID-19 pneumonia in a 41-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). He was promptly treated with steroids and hydroxychloroquine, as this was the recommended regional COVID-19 practice patterns at the time. He was treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and an insulin drip for his diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), cefepime and IV abelcet, along with three surgical debridements for the rhinocerebral mucormycosis. The pneumonia resolved during the course of his stay in the hospital. With prompt diagnosis and treatment of rhinocerebral mucormycosis, the patient was cleared for discharge and was instructed to complete his course of treatment with coumadin and IV abelcet at home. Saprophytic fungi cause rhinocerebral mucormycosis, a rare opportunistic infection of the sinuses, nasal passages, oral cavity and brain.

404116,Measuring the Labor Market at the Onset of the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"Dopamine receptors are abundant along the central nigrostriatal tract and are expressed as 5 subtypes in two receptor families. In PD, compensatory changes in dopamine receptors emerge as a consequence of the loss of dopamine nerve terminals or dopaminergic pharmacotherapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available PET and single-photon emission computed tomography studies that have investigated dopamine receptors in PD, PSP and MSA. The inclusion criteria were studies including human PET or single-photon emission computed tomography imaging; dopamine receptor tracers (D1-like or D2-like) and idiopathic PD, PSP, or MSA patients compared with healthy controls. The 67 included D2-like studies had 1925 patients. Data were insufficient for an analysis of D1-like studies. PD patients had higher striatal binding early in the disease, but after a disease duration of 4.36 years, PD patients had lower binding values than healthy controls. Striatal D2R binding was highest in unmedicated early PD patients and in the striatum contralateral to the predominant motor symptoms. PSP and MSA-P patients had lower striatal D2R binding than PD patients (14.2% and 21.8%, respectively). There is initial upregulation of striatal D2Rs in PD, which downregulate on average 4 years after motor symptom onset, possibly because of agonist-induced effects. The consistent upregulation of D2Rs in the PD striatum contralateral to the predominant motor symptoms indicates that receptor changes are driven by neurodegeneration and loss of striatal neuropil. Both PSP and MSA patients have clearly lower striatal D2R binding values than PD patients, which offers an opportunity for differential diagnostics. © 2021 The Authors.

Survey monkey questionnaire weblink was sent to 804 clinicians including consultant rheumatologists, speciality trainees, nurse specialists, and allied health professionals in 4 regions of the UK to evaluate personal effects of COVID-19 and redeployment, impact on current out-patient clinic activity, immunosuppressive drug use, and future rheumatology care. Response rate was 21%. One-fifth of the responders reported that their rheumatology departments were functioning less than 50% capacity during the pandemic. Two-third of responders felt anxious about the ill-effects of COVID-19 on their health and well-being, and one-third of them were redeployed. During the peak of the pandemic, 75% of clinicians stopped intravenous biologics. Although access to video consultation was available for up to three-fourths of the clinicians, the majority (90%) used this modality in less than 1 in 4 consultations. This survey highlights rheumatologists' perception in the delivery of future care and anxiety they faced. As demonstrated by this survey, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance did not influence clinician decision making in some aspects of patient care.

406882,National Pathology Exchange provides robust infrastructure to covid-19 response,2020,"Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid difficult times like COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing; however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to “serverless”, the burden of the server provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model. This work also develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism to comply with critical infrastructure requirements for the power grid, which can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their cloud services.","Zhang, Song; Luo, Xiaochuan; Litvinov, Eugene",Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,,502

METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective observational study included 35 patients admitted to a UK district general hospital with COVID-19 and evidence of cardiac involvement, that is, raised Troponin I levels or clinical evidence of heart failure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). All patients underwent echocardiography including speckle tracking for right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) providing image quality was sufficient (30 out of 35 patients). Upon comparison of patients who survived COVID-19 with non-survivors, survivors had significantly smaller RVs (basal RV diameter 38.2 vs 43.5 mm P = .0295) with significantly better RV function (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE): 17.5 vs 15.3 mm P = .049; average RVLS: 24.3% vs 15.6%; P = .0018). Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) maximal velocity was higher in survivors (2.75 m/s vs 2.11 m/s; P = .0045) indicating that pressure overload was not the predominant driver of this effect and there was no significant difference in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis of patients split into groups according to average RVLS above or below 20% revealed significantly increased 30-day mortality in patients with average RVLS under 20% (HR: 3.189; 95% CI: 1.297-12.91; P = .0195). CONCLUSION: This study confirms that RVLS is a potent and independent predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients with evidence of cardiac involvement.","Stockenhuber, Alexander; Vrettos, Apostolos; Androschuck, Vitaliy; George, Manju; Robertson, Calum; Bowers, Nicola; Clifford, Piers; Firoozan, Soroosh",Echocardiography,,502

408719,Laparoscopic and Robotic Urology Surgery during Global Pandemic COVID19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, hereby reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. METHODS: Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of Rt. RESULTS: Across all countries, the initial median estimate for Rt was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4-5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58-1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18-65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower Rt during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R0 > 5. Our results are consistent with evidence that recreational activities (including restaurant and bar visits) enable super-spreading events. Exiting from lockdown therefore requires continued physical distancing and tight control on this kind of activities.","Deforche, Koen; Vercauteren, Jurgen; Müller, Viktor; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke",BMC Public Health,,502

DesignCross-sectional study; 12 months follow-up. SettingResidents in Azienda USL Umbria 2. ParticipantsConsecutive subjects aged 15 to 75 who were discharged with the diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 from the hospitals of the AUSL Umbria 2, or resulted positive to a PCR test for Sars-Cov-2 infection with or without symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for antibodies targeting the Nucleocapside and Spike proteins were determined. ResultsOf 184 eligible subjects, 149 were available for evaluation: 17 were classified as Oligo/asymptomatic, 107 as Symptomatic, 25 as Hospital admitted. While fever resulted common to all the groups, headache or musculoskeletal pain was common to symptomatic participants whereas cough and dyspnea was present in all the hospital admitted. Participants with significant signs and symptoms were more likely to use antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, heparin and steroids. Compared to Oligo/asymptomatic participants, Symptomatic and Hospital admitted participants had higher levels of anti-S titers at every follow-up (median titer at 12 month follow-up: 29 vs 94 vs 116 respectively; P < 0.001). At 12 months follow-up, anti-S titers persisted above the threshold for at least 12 months in all Hospital admitted participants, in 90% of the Symptomatic participants and 83% in the oligo/asymptomatic participants; in 30% of participants the titer raised significantly probably due to reinfection. Anti-N antibody titer tended to decrease over time and in 62% of the entire cohort resulted negative. None of the participants reported clinical reinfection with Sars-Cov-2 virus. ConclusionAnti-S and anti-N antibody titers correlates well with disease severity. Anti-S antibodies persist for at least one year and most probably provide protection from reinfection.

Secondary question was ""Which is the evidence about surfaces decontamination and protection masks against airborne pathogens and directly transmitted viral pathogens causing respiratory infections?"" MATERIALS AND METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were used. Studies on surface decontamination and protective masks for SARS-CoV-2 in dental practice were considered. Studies on other respiratory viruses were considered for the secondary question. RESULTS: No studies are available for SARS-CoV-2. Four studies on surface disinfection against respiratory viruses were included. Ethanol 70% and sodium hypochlorite 0,5% seem to be effective in reducing infectivity by > 3log TCID. Four RCTs compared different types of masks on HCW. The single studies reported no difference for laboratory-diagnosed influenza, laboratory-diagnosed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness. A meta-analysis was not considered appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: There is lack of evidence on the efficacy of surface disinfection and protective masks to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory viruses in dentistry. However, the consistent use of respirator and routine surface disinfection is strongly suggested. There is urgent need of data on the efficacy of specific protection protocols for dental HCW against viral infections.","Barbato, Luigi; Bernardelli, Francesco; Braga, Giovanni; Clementini, Marco; Di Gioia, Claudio; Littarru, Crisitnano; Oreglia, Francesco; Raspini, Mario; Brambilla, Eugenio; Iavicoli, Ivo; Pinchi, Vilma; Landi, Luca; Sforza, Nicola Marco; Cavalcanti, Raffaele; Crea, Alessandro; Cairo, Francesco",Oral dis,,502

The case of medical supplies,2020,"Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Hubei, it has rapidly swept across the whole country and many overseas regions. At present, there are no specific drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 in modern medicine. Therefore, the therapy is mainly symptomatic for treatment. According to the instruction-spirit of “Following the development rules of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), inheriting the essence and keeping the integrity and innovation” and “attaching equal importance to TCM and Western medicine” by President Xi Jin-ping, many local hospitals has established and improved the cooperation mechanism between traditional and modern medicine. And many protocols on the prevention & treatment have been published. By retrieving these protocols, opinions of academicians and scholars, and clinical therapies reported by medical research institutions, we summarized the main prevention and cure methods of COVID-19, and found that the clinical application of integrative medicine protocols have obvious advantages in improving patient symptoms, shortening the course of disease, delaying the progress of disease, and reducing mortality.

410885,Knowledge and Experience: Spirituality In The Time of COVID-19,2021,"Capabilities in continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters of disease have never been more important than in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Soft, skin-mounted electronics that incorporate high-bandwidth, miniaturized motion sensors enable digital, wireless measurements of mechanoacoustic (MA) signatures of both core vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and underexplored biomarkers (coughing count) with high fidelity and immunity to ambient noises. This paper summarizes an effort that integrates such MA sensors with a cloud data infrastructure and a set of analytics approaches based on digital filtering and convolutional neural networks for monitoring of COVID-19 infections in sick and healthy individuals in the hospital and the home. Unique features are in quantitative measurements of coughing and other vocal events, as indicators of both disease and infectiousness. Systematic imaging studies demonstrate correlations between the time and intensity of coughing, speaking, and laughing and the total droplet production, as an approximate indicator of the probability for disease spread. The sensors, deployed on COVID-19 patients along with healthy controls in both inpatient and home settings, record coughing frequency and intensity continuously, along with a collection of other biometrics. The results indicate a decaying trend of coughing frequency and intensity through the course of disease recovery, but with wide variations across patient populations. The methodology creates opportunities to study patterns in biometrics across individuals and among different demographic groups.","Ni, Xiaoyue; Ouyang, Wei; Jeong, Hyoyoung; Kim, Jin-Tae; Tzaveils, Andreas; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Wu, Changsheng; Lee, Jong Yoon; Keller, Matthew; Mummidisetty, Chaithanya K; Patel, Manish; Shawen, Nicholas; Huang, Joy; Chen, Hope; Ravi, Sowmya; Chang, Jan-Kai; Lee, KunHyuck; Wu, Yixin; Lie, Ferrona; Kang, Youn J; Kim, Jong Uk; Chamorro, Leonardo P; Banks, Anthony R; Bharat, Ankit; Jayaraman, Arun; Xu, Shuai; Rogers, John A",Proc.

Patients and methods: This was a retrospective clinical observational study using data of male patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing between 1 March and 4 May 2020. Patients were categorised according to age groups and disease severity. Sociodemographic information and general clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and orchitis were collected. Results: We identified a total of 253 male patients, with a mean (range) age 43 (1–78) years. Patients were followed-up until their recovery or for 21 days. We did not observe any symptoms or signs of orchitis in any patient during follow-up across all age groups and different disease status. Conclusion: Although we did not identify any patients with COVID-19 with symptoms or signs of orchitis, such an association cannot be excluded, and further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis and exclude any association at a molecular level.

411544,"Understand role of insurance coverage, liability issues related to managing impact of pandemic on athletics",2020,"INTRODUCTION: An increasing global need for pharmacovigilance training cannot be met with classroom courses alone. Several e-learning modules have been developed by Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC). With distance learners and technological challenges such as poor internet bandwidth to be considered, UMC opted for the microlearning approach based on small learning units connected to specific learning objectives. The aim of this study was to evaluate how this e-learning course was received. METHODS: The course was evaluated through usage data and the results of two user surveys, one for modules 1-4, signal detection and causality assessment, and the other for module 5, statistical reasoning and algorithms in pharmacovigilance. The evaluation model used was based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A questionnaire was developed, divided into demographic profile, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, educational compatibility and behavioural intention. The two surveys were disseminated to 2067 learners for modules 1-4 and 1685 learners for module 5. RESULTS: Learners from 137 countries participated, predominantly from industry (36.6%), national pharmacovigilance centres (22.6%) and academia (16.3%). The overall satisfaction level was very high for all modules, with over 90% of the learners rating it as either 'excellent' or 'good'. The majority were satisfied with the learning platform, the course content and the lesson duration. Most learners thought they would be able to apply the knowledge in practice. Almost 100% of the learners would recommend the modules to others and would also study future modules. Suggested improvements were an interactive forum, more practical examples in the lessons and practical exercises. CONCLUSION: This e-learning course in pharmacovigilance based on microlearning was well received with a global coverage among relevant professional disciplines.","Hegerius, Anna; Caduff-Janosa, Pia; Savage, Ruth; Ellenius, Johan",Drug saf,,502

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, LILACS, and Web of Science for studies published up to April 27, 2020. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome, comprising mortality and severe COVID-19. We used a standardized data extraction form to collect information from published reports of eligible studies. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using I2 statistic and funnel plots, respectively. RESULTS: Nine studies including 6577 patients were selected for evaluation. The COVID-19 patients were 59.80% male and had comorbidities such as hypertension (51.51%), diabetes (30.3%), cardiovascular disease (16.66%), lung disease (15.99%), renal disease (7.49%), cancer (5.07%), and immunosuppression (1.8%). For patients with severe complications, the overall pooled event rates were 56.2% (random; 95% CI: 35.3-75.1; p = 0.015; I2 = 71.461) for obesity, 23.6% (random; 95% CI: 17.9-30.5; p = 0.000; I2 = 87.705) for type 2 diabetes, 45.9% (random; 95% CI: 38.0-53.9; p = 0.000; I2 = 90.152) for hypertension, 20.0% (random; 95% CI: 7.9-42.0; p = 0.000; I2 = 94.577) for smoking, 21.6% (random; 95% CI: 14.1-31.4%; p = 0.000, I2 = 92.983) for lung diseases, and 20.6% (random; 95% CI: 15.2-27.5; p = 0.000, I2 = 85.735) for cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity of measures taken to prevent infection, inform refugees, maintain social and health services, test for SARS-CoV­2 and quarantine positive cases. Effective intersectoral cooperation proved to be particularly important for coordination and implementation of measures. Need for support was expressed with regard to the improvement of infrastructure, opportunities to work with language interpreters and stronger involvement of local health experts. CONCLUSION: Amidst multiple actors and the complexity of structures and processes, the admission authorities have been taking on essential responsibilities related to infection control on an ad hoc basis, without being sufficiently positioned to do so. In order to further contain the pandemic, a strengthening of centralised, setting-specific recommendations and information as well as their translation through the pro-active involvement of the public health authorities at the local level are essential.","Biddle, Louise; Jahn, Rosa; Perplies, Clara; Gold, Andreas W; Rast, Eilin; Spura, Anke; Bozorgmehr, Kayvan",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,502

Different measures have been taken to slow the spread of the virus. Appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is one of these key measures. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated adherence of the general public to use of PPE and their knowledge regarding the rationale behind their use. METHODS: Two samples were chosen from public places (a subway station and a city store) in Tehran, Iran, one of the countries affected by COVID-19. Individuals were observed for appropriate use of PPE and interviewed regarding their knowledge on some basic self-protection information. RESULTS: Approximately, half of the 431 participants did not take any measures to ensure hand hygiene, while those who did not use respiratory protection were far fewer. A considerable number of individuals, however, did not use these PPE correctly. On the other hand, there was a gap in the knowledge of the general public regarding different aspects of protective measures. The majority of the participants were receptive towards education on preventive measurements through public media. CONCLUSION: Education is an important aspect in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, as it directly increases adherence of the general public to protective measures.","Jabbari, Parnian; Taraghikhah, Nazanin; Jabbari, Forouq; Ebrahimi, Saied; Rezaei, Nima",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,502

Although diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately applicable protocol. METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8. RESULTS: A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, although this may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. CONCLUSIONS: As it uses the standard protocols, reagents, and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for coronavirus disease 2019 would allow expanding current screening capacities, thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Tamar, Einat Shaer; Argoetti, Amir; Messer, Esther; Berenbaum, Dina; Shafran, Einat; Kuzli, Areen; Gandali, Nagham; Shkedi, Omer; Hashimshony, Tamar; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael; Halberthal, Michael; Geffen, Yuval; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Kishony, Roy",Clin Infect Dis,,502

413497,Reflections and discussions: tourism matters in the new normal post COVID-19,2020,"Generating appropriate motor commands is an essential brain function. To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits and other PD symptoms affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, resulting in different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than in healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes. Our findings support compensatory cerebellar functions in PD patients from the perspective of motor adaptation.","Takiyama, Ken; Sakurada, Takeshi; Shinya, Masahiro; Sato, Takaaki; Ogihara, Hirofumi; Komatsu, Taiki",Sci Rep,,502

The aim of the study is to investigate whether obesity impacts on COVID-19 morbidity. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in our Medical Unit were evaluated. Anthropometric parameters and past medical history were registered. Nasopharyngeal swab samples and biochemical analysis were obtained at admission and during hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients with (OB, 29) and without obesity (N-OB, 71) were similar in age, gender and comorbidities, with the exception of hypertension that was more frequent in OB group. At admission, inflammatory markers were higher in OB than N-OB group. OB group showed a worse pulmonary clinical picture, with lower PaO2 (57 ± 15 vs. 68 ± 14 mmHg, p = 0.042), and SaO2 (88 ± 6 vs. 92 ± 5%, p = 0.049) at admission consequently requiring higher volumes of oxygen (Fi02: 38 ± 15 vs. 29 ± 19%, p = 0.047) and a longer period to achieve oxygen weaning (10 ± 6 vs. 15 ± 7 days, p = 0.03). OB group also had positive swabs for longer time (19 ± 8 vs. 13 ± 7, days, p = 0.002), and required longer hospital stay (21 ± 8 vs. 13 ± 8, days, p = 0.0008). Partial least square regression analysis showed that BMI, age and CRP at admission were related to longer length of hospital stay, and time for negative swab. On the contrary, in this cohort, obesity did not predict higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with obesity affected by COVID-19 require longer hospitalization, more intensive and longer oxygen treatment, and they may have longer SARS-COV-2 shedding.","Moriconi, Diego; Masi, Stefano; Rebelos, Eleni; Virdis, Agostino; Manca, Maria Laura; De Marco, Salvatore; Taddei, Stefano; Nannipieri, Monica",Obes Res Clin Pract,,502

As the pandemic evolves, informed policy-making and strategic resource allocation relies on accurate forecasts. To predict the spread of the virus within US counties, we curated an array of county-level demographic and COVID-19-relevant health risk factors. In combination with the county-level case and death numbers curated by John Hopkins university, we developed a forecasting model using deep learning (DL). We implemented an autoencoder-based Seq2Seq model with gated recurrent units (GRUs) in the deep recurrent layers. We trained the model to predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R . For most counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the COVID-19 spread. We hope that our forecasts and model can help local governments in the continued fight against COVID-19.","Zhang-James, Y.; Hess, J.; Salkin, A.; Wang, D.; Chen, S.; Winkelstein, P.; Morley, C.

A falta de políticas nacionais para controle da pandemia levou as autoridades estaduais e municipais a implementarem medidas de saúde pública. O objetivo deste estudo é mostrar o efeito dessas medidas na epidemia. A maior incidência da COVID-19 entre os nove estados do Nordeste foi registrada em Sergipe, Paraíba e Ceará. O Piauí, a Paraíba e Ceará foram os que mais testaram. Muitos estados apresentavam alta proporção de pessoas em trabalho informal. Estados com aeroportos internacionais tiveram importante papel na entrada e disseminação inicial do vírus, em especial o Ceará. Todos os estados aplicaram medidas de distanciamento social, proibição de eventos públicos e fechamento de unidades de ensino. As respostas foram o aumento significativo de distanciamento social, em especial Ceará e Pernambuco, a queda do número de reprodução (Rt) e a separação da curva dos casos observados da curva dos casos esperados sem as intervenções não medicamentosas em todos os estados. A pobreza, a desigualdade e as altas taxas de trabalho informal fornecem pistas do porquê da intensidade da COVID-19 na região.

416241,Australian university and medical school life during the 1919 influenza pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Management of chronic wounds remains one of the major challenges for health professionals and patients. An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. METHOD: A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings. RESULTS: A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition. CONCLUSION: All the evidence provided suggest that these dressings provide clinicians with an evidence-based option for the management of chronic wounds; that the TLC-NOSF dressings are beneficial in promoting the healing process, reducing healing times, enhancing patients' HRQoL, and in allowing a more cost-effective procedure.","Nair, Harikrishna; Venkateshwaran, N; Seetharaman S, Selva; Deng, Wuquan; Uthaipaisanwong, Apinan; Galea, Emilio",J Wound Care,,502

417507,A Novel Analysis of COVID 19 Risk in India Incorporating Climatic and Socio-economic Factors,2021,"COVID-19 has been a public health emergency of international concern since early 2020. Reliable forecasting is critical to diminish the impact of this disease. To date, a large number of different forecasting models have been proposed, mainly including statistical models, compartmental models, and deep learning models. However, due to various uncertain factors across different regions such as economics and government policy, no forecasting model appears to be the best for all scenarios. In this paper, we perform quantitative analysis of COVID-19 forecasting of confirmed cases and deaths across different regions in the United States with different forecasting horizons, and evaluate the relative impacts of the following three dimensions on the predictive performance (improvement and variation) through different evaluation metrics: model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and the length of time series required for training. We find that if a dimension brings about higher performance gains, if not well-tuned, it may also lead to harsher performance penalties. Furthermore, model selection is the dominant factor in determining the predictive performance. It is responsible for both the largest improvement and the largest variation in performance in all prediction tasks across different regions. While practitioners may perform more complicated time series analysis in practice, they should be able to achieve reasonable results if they have adequate insight into key decisions like model selection.","Zhao, Yun; Wang, Yuqing; Liu, Junfeng; Xia, Haotian; Xu, Zhenni; Hong, Qinghang; Zhou, Zhiyang; Petzold, Linda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00174v1.pdf,502

Here, we reveal that CD26high T cells are epigenetically and transcriptionally distinct from TH17 cells. Of clinical importance, CD26high and TH17 cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) regressed large human tumors to a greater extent than enriched TH1 or TH2 cells. Only human CD26high T cells mediated curative responses, even when redirected with a suboptimal CAR and without aid by CD8+ CAR T cells.

Besides the shortcomings, new learning and teaching method was introduced globally. 48 Omani participants of this study were the first batch of learners who have experienced online learning and teaching for the first time in their life. Therefore, this study tried to understand their levels of motivation and perceptions of online learning. The study also tried to find out the gender difference and the motivational level among the participants. Participants were sent two questionnaires through the Google form, and their responses were analyzed accordingly. The study revealed that Omani students were motivated to exchange learning and teaching materials through online platforms, and the female ones showed slightly more interest in online classes. In addition, the students showed positive perceptions toward and willingness to continue using online platforms for the learning process. Since they are the first group of students with online learning experiences, the study can motivate the teachers to focus on more digital contexts of their study, help them to focus on the design and preparation of materials for the digital community, and curriculum developers can introduce more practical learning and teaching techniques suitable for online education.","Behforouz, Behnam Al Gaithi Ali Fekri Neda",Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,,502
419759,The Relationship between Endurance Involvement and Travel Behavior in Camping and the Moderating Effect of Place Attachment,2021,"Since December 2019, a series of highly infectious cases of unexplained pneumonia have been discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which have been confirmed as '2019 corona virus disease' caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 virus can invade many human systems including the lungs. Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Hereditary ataxia is a large group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and high mortality and disability. In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health. In order to standardize the management of patients during the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, the Specialized Committee of Neurogenetics of the Neurophysician Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association has formulated this consensus, with an aim to help patients to overcome the difficulties and pass the epidemic prevention period safely.","Jiang, Hong; Tang, Beisha",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,502

This study reports characteristics of coronavirus disease 19 CP (CCP) donors and their donations to the New York Blood Center (NYBC). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All CCP data from our first day of collection on March 26th through July 7th, 2020 are included in this retrospective analysis. Donor and donation data were extracted from NYBC electronic databases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was initially performed by the NY State Department of Health, and later by NYBC using Ortho and Abbott platforms. RESULTS: CCP donor age and ABO distributions were consistent with reported lower COVID-19 susceptibility in O blood types. CCP versus whole blood donors had similar on-site deferrals, but higher post-donation deferral rates. CCP versus routine plasmapheresis donations had higher vasovagal reactions but similar product rejection rates. Changes in antibody (Ab) test platforms resulted in significant changes in the percent of donors regarded as antibody positive. Donor correlates with higher anti-spike total Ig S/CO ratios were Hispanic ethnicity, overweight body mass index, and longer symptom duration; and with higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG S/CO ratios were male gender, older age, Hispanic ethnicity, and fewer days between symptom onset and first donation. DISCUSSION: We identify donor characteristics not previously reported to correlate with Ab titer. Our analysis should assist with donor outreach strategies, blood center operating logistics, and recruitment of high titer donors.","Jain, Saagar; Garg, Keshav; Tran, Sabrina M; Rask, Isabel L; Tarczon, Michael; Nandi, Vijay; Kessler, Debra A; Strauss, Donna; Sachais, Bruce S; Yazdanbakhsh, Karina; Rehmani, Shiraz; Luchsinger, Larry; Shi, Patricia A",Transfusion,,502

Using the health belief model, the current study examined ageism in interaction with other factors influencing intention to social distance. Methods: Threat of contracting COVID-19, benefits and barriers to social distancing, benevolent and hostile ageism, and intention to social distance were examined in 960 adults (M = 37.81 years, SD = 11.65). Results: Benevolent and hostile ageism were significant moderators for both perceived threat and barriers on intent to social distance; hostile ageism also moderated benefits on intent to social distance. Discussion: The current study demonstrates how ageism influences behavior during a pandemic. With initial reports of COVID-19 presenting older adults as a homogenous group, ageism negatively interacted with intention to social distance and may place older adults at greater risk.","Graf, Allyson S; Knepple Carney, Amy",J Aging Health,,502

420709,Analysis of hospital reviews through sentiment analysis: An approach to aid patients in the times of covid-19 pandemic,2021,"COVID-19 is a devastating pandemic in the history of humankind. It is a highly contagious flu that can spread from human to human. For being so contagious, detecting patients with it and isolating them has become the primary concern for healthcare professionals. However, identifying COVID-19 patients with a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can sometimes be problematic and time-consuming. Therefore, detecting patients with this virus from X-ray images of the chest can be a perfect alternative to the de-facto standard PCR test. This article aims at providing such a decision support system that can detect COVID-19 patients with the help of X-ray images. To do that, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, namely ModCOVNN, has been introduced. To determine whether the proposed model works with good efficiency, two CNN-based architectures – VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the detection task. The experimental results study of this study has proved that the proposed architecture has outperformed the other two models with 98.08% accuracy, 98.14% precision, and 98.4% recall. This result indicates that proper detection of COVID-19 patients with the help of X-ray images of the chest is possible using machine learning methods with high accuracy. This type of data-driven system can help us to overcome the current appalling situation throughout the world.","Reza, Ahmed Wasif; Sorna, Jannatul Ferdous; Rashel, Md.

As suggested by guidelines promoted by the General Office of National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (2020) (from Versions 1 to 6), discharged standards for COVID-19 were still dependent on viral real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests of respiratory specimens, showing that recovered COVID-19 patients with twice negative RT-PCR could meet discharge criteria. Here, we examined two cases in which nucleic acid test results were inconsistent with clinical and radiological findings, leading to suboptimal care.","Su, Jun-Wei; Wu, Wen-Rui; Lang, Guan-Jing; Zhao, Hong; Sheng, Ji-Fang",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,502
420763,The Potential Impacts of Pandemic Policing on Police Legitimacy: Planning Past the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed medical care worldwide. General surgery has been affected in elective procedures, yet the implications for emergency surgery are unclear. The current study analyzes the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 on appendicitis treatment in Germany. METHODS: Hospitals that provided emergency surgical care during the COVID-19 lockdown were invited to participate. All patients diagnosed with appendicitis during the lockdown period (10 weeks) and, as a comparison group, patients from the same period in 2019 were analyzed. Clinical and laboratory parameters, intraoperative and pathological findings, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1915 appendectomies from 41 surgical departments in Germany were included. Compared to 2019 the number of appendectomies decreased by 13.5% (1.027 to 888, p=0.003) during the first 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. The delay between the onset of symptoms and medical consultation was substantially longer in the COVID-19 risk group and for the elderly. The rate of complicated appendicitis increased (58.2 to 64.4%), while the absolute number of complicated appendicitis decreased from 597 to 569, (p=0.012). The rate of negative appendectomies decreased significantly (6.7 to 4.6%; p=0.012). Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality, however, did not change. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown had significant effects on abdominal emergency surgery in Germany. These seem to result from a stricter selection and a longer waiting time between the onset of symptoms and medical consultation for risk patients. However, the standard of emergency surgical care in Germany was maintained.","Willms, Arnulf G; Oldhafer, Karl J; Conze, Sophie; Thasler, Wolfgang E; von Schassen, Christian; Hauer, Thorsten; Huber, Tobias; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Günster, Simone; Bulian, Dirk R; Hirche, Zarah; Filser, Jörg; Stavrou, Gregor A; Reichert, Martin; Malkomes, Patrizia; Seyfried, Steffen; Ludwig, Tobias; Hillebrecht, Hans C; Pantelis, Dimitrios; Brunner, Stefanie; Rost, Wilm; Lock, Johan F",Langenbecks Arch Surg,,502

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and has been applied to different specimen types. Understanding the virus load and virus detection frequency in different specimen types is important to improve diagnosis and estimate the duration of potential infectivity. We conducted a retrospective single-center cohort study on hospitalized and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed the frequency of virus detection, virus load, and duration of the virus excretion in upper and lower respiratory specimens as well as stool and plasma. We found that the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the virus load, and duration of virus excretion was higher in lower respiratory tract (LRT) than in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens. The duration of virus excretion was longer in patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In conclusion, LRT specimens are the most appropriate specimen type for the detection and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We studied the physiologic effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS: Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and faceshield (FS); N95 FFR, SM, and FS; and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous electrocardiographic frequency-based heart rate (HR) variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing an SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS: Ten of 12 gastroenterologists (83%) reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine of these gastroenterologists (75%) had associated significant HR elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2) = 7.543, P = .004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of the N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratios and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effects in the N95 FFR stage. PAPR use was better tolerated but was associated with headache and elevated HR in 4 gastroenterologists (33%).

The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate numbers of admissions in incident and prevalent atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF) and to analyse care pathways in comparison to 2019. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of claims data of 74 German Helios hospitals was performed to identify consecutive patients hospitalized with a main discharge diagnosis of AF. A study period including the start of the German national protection phase (13 March 2020 to 16 July 2020) was compared to a previous year control cohort (15 March 2019 to 18 July 2019), with further sub-division into early and late phase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Numbers of admission per day (A/day) for incident and prevalent AF and care pathways including readmissions, numbers of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), electrical cardioversion (CV), and catheter ablation (CA) were analysed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in total AF admissions both in the early (44.4 vs. 77.5 A/day, IRR 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.61], P < 0.01) and late (59.1 vs. 63.5 A/day, IRR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96], P < 0.01) phases, length of stay was significantly shorter (3.3 ± 3.1 nights vs. 3.5 ± 3.6 nights, P < 0.01), admissions were more frequently in high-volume centres (77.0% vs. 75.4%, P = 0.02), and frequency of readmissions was reduced (21.7% vs. 23.6%, P < 0.01) compared to the previous year. Incident AF admission rates were significantly lower both in the early (21.9 admission per day vs. 41.1 A/day, IRR 0.53 [95% CI 0.48-0.58]) and late (35.5 vs. 39.3 A/day, IRR 0.90 [95% CI 0.86-0.95]) phases, whereas prevalent admissions were only lower in the early phase (22.5 vs. 36.4 A/day IRR 0.62 [95% CI 0.56-0.68]), but not in the late phase (23.6 vs. 24.2 A/day IRR 0.97 [95% CI 0.92-1.03]). Analysis of care pathways showed reduced numbers of TEE during the early phase [34.7% vs. 41.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [95% CI 0.64-0.86], P < 0.01], but not during the late phase (39.9% vs. 40.2%, OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-1.03], P = 0.26). Numbers of CV were comparable during early (40.6% vs. 39.7%, OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.94-1.25], P = 0.27) and late (38.6% vs. 37.5%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 0.98-1.14], P = 0.17) phases, compared to the previous year, respectively. Numbers of CA were comparable during the early phase (21.6% vs. 21.1%, OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.82-1.17], P = 0.82) with a distinct increase during the late phase (22.9% vs. 21.5%, OR 1.05 [95% CI 0.96-1.16], P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, AF admission rates declined significantly, with a more pronounced reduction in incident than in prevalent AF. Overall AF care was maintained during early and late pandemic phases with only minor changes, namely less frequent use of TEE. Confirmation of these findings in other study populations and identification of underlying causes are required to ensure optimal therapy in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ueberham, Laura; König, Sebastian; Pellissier, Vincent; Hohenstein, Sven; Meier-Hellmann, Andreas; Kuhlen, Ralf; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,,502
424311,"Electrochemical immunosensor platform based on gold-clusters, cysteamine and glutaraldehyde modified electrode for diagnosing COVID-19",2021,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells with immunosuppressive properties. In cancer patients, the expression of lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) on granulocytic MDSC identifies a subset of MDSC that retains the most potent immunosuppressive properties. The main objective of the present work was to explore the presence of LOX-1+ MDSC in bacterial and viral sepsis. To this end, whole blood LOX-1+ cells were phenotypically, morphologically, and functionally characterized. They were monitored in 39 coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19, viral sepsis) and 48 septic shock (bacterial sepsis) patients longitudinally sampled five times over a 3 wk period in intensive care units (ICUs). The phenotype, morphology, and immunosuppressive functions of LOX-1+ cells demonstrated that they were polymorphonuclear MDSC. In patients, we observed the significant emergence of LOX-1+ MDSC in both groups. The peak of LOX-1+ MDSC was 1 wk delayed with respect to ICU admission. In COVID-19, their elevation was more pronounced in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The persistence of these cells may contribute to long lasting immunosuppression leaving the patient unable to efficiently resolve infections.","Coudereau, Rémy; Waeckel, Louis; Cour, Martin; Rimmele, Thomas; Pescarmona, Rémi; Fabri, Astrid; Jallades, Laurent; Yonis, Hodane; Gossez, Morgane; Lukaszewicz, Anne-Claire; Argaud, Laurent; Venet, Fabienne; Monneret, Guillaume",J. leukoc. biol,,502

424726,Sustainable forest management and avoiding pandemic crisis,2020,"Abstract The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that pooling of 5 samples showed that CT variations were in the range of 1.0-4,5 units, with less likelihood of a false negative result. Results of the sample without nucleic acid ex-traction, was unsatisfactory, with a significant increase in CT values, and thus for risk of a false negative result. In conclusion, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries.","Farfan, Mauricio J.; Torres, Juan P.; ORyan, Miguel; Olivares, Mauricio; Gallardo, Pablo; Lastra, Jorge; Salas, Carolina",Rev. chil. infectol,,502
425345,La pandemia por el nuevo coronavirus covid-19./ [The novel coronavirus covid-19 pandemic],2020,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system that typically develops within 4 weeks after infection. In addition to conventional infectious diseases with which we are familiar, emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have also been suggested to be associated with GBS. GBS is mainly categorized into a demyelinating subtype known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and an axonal subtype known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Most patients who develop GBS after Zika virus infection or COVID-19 have AIDP. The concept of molecular mimicry between pathogens and human peripheral nerve components was established through studies of AMAN with anti-ganglioside GM1 antibodies occurring after Campylobacter jejuni infection. Although such mimicry between specific pathogens and myelin or Schwann cell components has not been clearly demonstrated in AIDP, a similarity of Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins to human proteins has been suggested. With the development of global commerce and travel, emerging infectious diseases will continue to threaten public health. From this viewpoint, the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs is important to prepare for and control emerging infectious diseases. Although a decrease in the number of patients after the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic increased the difficulty in conducting phase 3 trials for Zika virus vaccines, the efficacy and safety of new vaccines have recently been demonstrated for COVID-19. In general, vaccines can decrease the risk of infectious disease by stimulating the immune system, and discussions regarding an increased risk of autoimmune disorders, such as GBS, have been ongoing for many years. However, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit the administration of currently available vaccines, as only a trivial association or no association with GBS has been demonstrated.","Koike, Haruki; Chiba, Atsuro; Katsuno, Masahisa",,,502

426368,[Limitation of medical liability during the coronavirus pandemic],2020,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the coronavirus pandemic, identifying the infected individuals has become key to limiting its spread. Virus nucleic acid real-time RT-PCR testing has become the current standard diagnostic method but high demand could lead to shortages. Therefore, we propose a detection strategy using a one-step nested RT-PCR. METHODOLOGY: The nucleotide region in the ORF1ab gene that has the greatest differences between the human coronavirus and the bat coronavirus was selected. Primers were designed after that sequence. All diagnostic primers are species-specific since the 3´ end of the sequence differs from that of other species. A primer set also creates a synthetic positive control. Amplified products were seen in a 2.5% agarose gel, as well as in an SYBR Green-Based Real-Time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Amplification was achieved for the positive control and specific regions in both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique is flexible and easy to implement. It does not require a real-time thermocycler and can be interpreted in agarose gels, as well as adapted to quantify the viral genome. It has the advantage that if the coronavirus mutates in one of the key amplification nucleotides, at least one pair can still amplify, thanks to the four diagnostic primers.","Meza-Robles, Carmen; Barajas-Saucedo, Carlos E; Tiburcio-Jimenez, Daniel; Mokay-Ramírez, Karen A; Melnikov, Valery; Rodriguez-Sanchez, Iram P; Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L; Garza-Veloz, Idalia; Zaizar-Fregoso, Sergio A; Guzman-Esquivel, José; Ramirez-Flores, Mario; Newton-Sanchez, Oscar A; Espinoza-Gómez, Francisco; Delgado-Enciso, Osiris G; Centeno-Ramirez, Alba Sh; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,502
426634,Introduction to Business and Technical Communication and COVID-19: Communicating in Times of Crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed the characteristics of different respiratory viral infections. METHODS: Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in a fever clinic. RESULTS: Overall, 1860 patients were screened, and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, respectively. The COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with the epidemic area within 14 days and of clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever to the highest temperature was higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had a lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection groups, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. The COVID-19 group (83.33%) had a higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scans than Flu A and B virus infection groups. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of a specific respiratory virus; however, epidemic history was significant for the screening of COVID-19.","Li, Yan; Wang, Jiangshan; Wang, Chunting; Yang, Qiwen; Xu, Yingchun; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong; Liu, Jihai",Int J Infect Dis,,502

427095,COVID-19: a missed opportunity to reimagine the justice system for our people,2021,"BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia (PA)(OMIM#606054) is an inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, caused by defects in the propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme which encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a Chinese neonate diagnosed with suspected PA based on the clinical symptoms, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and brain imaging tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the proband. We detected only one heterozygous recurrent nonsense variant (c.937C > T, p.Arg313Ter) in the PCCA gene. When we manually checked the binary alignment map (BAM) diagram of PCCA gene, we found a heterozygous deletion chr13:100915039-100915132delinsAA (c.773_819 + 47delinsAA) (GRCh37.p13) inside the exon 10 in the PCCA gene. The results were validated by Sanger sequencing and qPCR method in the family: the variant (c.937C > T, p.Arg313Ter) was in the maternal allele, and the delins was in the paternal allele. When the mother was pregnant again, prenatal diagnosis was carried out through amniocentesis at 18 weeks gestation, the fetus carried neither of the two mutations. After birth, newborn screening was undertaken, the result was negative. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a recurrent c.937C > T and a novel c.773_819 + 47delinsAA mutations in the PCCA gene, which may be the genetic cause of the phenotype of this patient. Our findings expanded the spectrum of causative genotype-phenotype of the PCCA gene. For the cases, the NGS results revealed only a heterozygous mutation in autosomal recessive disease when the gene is associated with phenotypes, it is necessary to manually check the BAM diagram to improve the detection rate. Targeted NGS is an effective technique to detect the various genetic lesions responsible for the PA in one step. Genetic testing is essential for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in the family to avoid birth defects.","Wang, Hai-Rong; Liu, Yan-Qiu; He, Xue-Lian; Sun, Jun; Zeng, Fan-Wei; Yan, Cheng-Bin; Li, Hao; Gao, Shu-Yang; Yang, Yun",BMC Med Genet,,502

428788,Combined mobile-phone and social-media sampling for web survey on social effects of COVID-19 in spain,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has impacted the care of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. We aimed to provide an overall view of patients' perspectives, concerns, and expectations towards their treatment throughout the clinic lockdown during the pandemic; and to assess patients' levels of mental distress and its association with their confidence in resuming care. METHODS: An anonymous, validated, in-person paper questionnaire was distributed to adult orthodontic patients' post-lockdown at an academic institution. The survey focused on the clinical aspects and patients' perspectives regarding orthodontic treatment during the pandemic. The Kessler Mental Distress Scale (K10) was used to evaluate their psychological status. Survey responses were descriptively summarized and confidence in resuming care was compared between normal patients and patients with mental distress using Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients were surveyed from July to October 2020. Mean age of the participants was 29.30 (SD = 12.01) years and 62% were females. Emergencies during the closure (21%, 32/154) involved primarily irritation with protruding wires. Patients were neutral regarding tele-dentistry and preferred their current fixed appliances over clear aligners. Upon resuming care, 80.51% were extremely pleased with the restrictive protocols and with high level of confidence in resuming treatment. The average level of anxiety was low, and a modest association was found between mental distress and reduced confidence in resuming treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Few numbers of minor emergencies occurred during the clinic closure. Despite the rising interest in tele-dentistry, patients were neutral on considering this option to monitor treatment and were content with fixed appliances. Patients had high confidence levels to resume their care based on the protocols established upon reopening. The association of mental distress and confidence in resuming care is suggestive and needs further investigation.","Arqub, Sarah Abu; Voldman, Rebecca; Ahmida, Ahmad; Kuo, Chia-Ling; Godoy, Lucas Da Cunha; Nasrawi, Yousef; Al-Khateeb, Susan N; Uribe, Flavio",Prog Orthod,,502

Therefore, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, a global pandemic outbreak on March 11, 2020. Regrettably, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still remaining as a bottleneck. Nevertheless, the old-style public health measures namely isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment are playing the pivotal role in managing COVID-19. To reinforce the old-style public health measures, an IoT paradigm is introduced in this research work. The proposed IoT paradigm can 1) examine infected people at transport terminals to reduce spatial spread due to regional travel;2) ensure social distance and face masks in public places;3) remote health monitoring of the elderly and those in quarantine;4) overcome the lack of human resources available to care for a population in crisis. It has been envisioned that the efficient development and implementation of the proposed IoT paradigm at every region can manage the current state of affairs, prevent further outbreaks across geographical regions, resume economic activities and provide adequate emergency infrastructure. © 2021 IEEE.","Vishnu, S.; Jino Ramson, S.

The overall design of the study includes a review of contemporary literature and field survey for data collection and analysis. Discourse of literature coupled with expert opinion has been employed for identification of issues. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is used for the determination of intra-issue relationships and analyzing the underlying structure. Cross impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC analysis) is used as a technique for classifying issues on the basis of driving-dependence power. Results of the literature show that there are 21 major issues faced by the students taking online classes. ISM shows that lack of institutional guidelines, lack of regulators' guidelines, stress of pandemic situation, and abrupt (not planned) start of online classes are the most critical issues. MICMAC analysis reveals that there is no autonomous issue, 4 (i.e., connectivity issue, shy to use technology, lack of institutional guidelines, and stress of pandemic situation) are independent, 6 other issues are dependent, and the remaining 11 are linking. This is a valuable study having practical implications for regulators, students, parents, and society to understand the current problem. It is an original attempt that contributes toward literature in the form of a structural model and a diagram of classification of issues.","Shaukat, M. Z.; Niazi, A. A. K.; Qazi, T.

430023,Impact of Covid-19 on clinical care and lived experience of systemic sclerosis: An international survey from EURORDIS-Rare Diseases Europe,2021,"BACKGROUND: Current methods of communication between the point of injury and receiving medical facilities rely on verbal communication, supported by brief notes and the memory of the field medic. This communication can be made more complete and reliable with technologies that automatically document the actions of field medics. However, designing state-of-the-art technology for military field personnel and civilian first responders is challenging due to the barriers researchers face in accessing the environment and understanding situated actions and cognitive models employed in the field. OBJECTIVE: To identify design insights for an automated sensing clinical documentation (ASCD) system, we sought to understand what information is transferred in trauma cases between prehospital and hospital personnel, and what contextual factors influence the collection, management, and handover of information in trauma cases, in both military and civilian cases. METHODS: Using a multi-method approach including video review and focus groups, we developed an understanding of the information needs of trauma handoffs and the context of field documentation to inform the design of an automated sensing documentation system that uses wearables, cameras, and environmental sensors to passively infer clinical activity and automatically produce documentation. RESULTS: Comparing military and civilian trauma documentation and handoff, we found similarities in the types of data collected and the prioritization of information. We found that military environments involved many more contextual factors that have implications for design, such as the physical environment (eg, heat, lack of lighting, lack of power) and the potential for active combat and triage, creating additional complexity. CONCLUSIONS: An ineffectiveness of communication is evident in both the civilian and military worlds. We used multiple methods of inquiry to study the information needs of trauma care and handoff, and the context of medical work in the field. Our findings informed the design and evaluation of an automated documentation tool. The data illustrated the need for more accurate recordkeeping, specifically temporal aspects, during transportation, and characterized the environment in which field testing of the developed tool will take place. The employment of a systems perspective in this project produced design insights that our team would not have identified otherwise. These insights created exciting and interesting challenges for the technical team to resolve.","Novak, Laurie Lovett; Simpson, Christopher L; Coco, Joseph; McNaughton, Candace D; Ehrenfeld, Jesse M; Bloos, Sean M; Fabbri, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,,502

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the lockdown on ophthalmic training programs across India. Methods: An online survey was sent across to trainee ophthalmologists across India through various social media platforms. Results: In all, 716 trainees responded; the average age was 29.1 years. Results showed that majority of the respondents were enrolled in residency programs (95.6%; 685/716) and the others were in fellowship programs. About 24.6% (176/716) of the trainees had been deployed on 'COVID-19 screening' duties. Nearly 80.7% (578/716) of the trainees felt that the COVID-19 lockdown had negatively impacted their surgical training. Furthermore, 54.8% (392/716) of the trainees perceived an increase in stress levels during the COVID-19 lockdown and 77.4% (554/716) reported that their family members had expressed an increased concern for their safety and wellbeing since the lockdown began. In all, 75.7% (542/716) of the respondents felt that online classes and webinars were useful during the lockdown period. Conclusion: Our survey showed that majority ophthalmology trainees across the country felt that the COVID-19 lockdown adversely affected their learning, especially surgical training. While most found online classes and webinars useful, the trainees' perceived stress levels were higher than normal during the lockdown. Training hospitals should take cognizance of this and reassure trainees; formulate guidelines to augment training to compensate for the lost time as well as mitigate the stress levels upon resumption of regular hospital services and training. Going ahead, permanent changes such as virtual classrooms and simulation-based training should be considered.","Mishra, Deepak; Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Gandhi, Rashmin Anilkumar; Gogate, Parikshit J; Mathur, Satanshu; Bhushan, Prashant; Srivastav, Tanmay; Singh, Hemendra; Sinha, Bibhuti P; Singh, Mahendra Kumar",Indian J Ophthalmol,,502

The disease caused by 2019-nCoV has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19”. Due to the rising number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infected cases and widespread detection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 2019-nCoV as a threatening health concern, and urgent robust actions are of supreme interest to tackle this global health emergency. Owing to this new emergence, we know relatively little about 2019-nCoV, which is a highly pathogenic human pathogen. To completely overcome this life-threatening 2019-nCoV pathogen, further in-depth studies are needed to gain insight and complete understanding about its fast mode spread, replication, and pathogenesis. Since the first appearance and detection of 2019-nCoV and COVID-19, respectively, the current literature lacks the global perspective and replication cycle of 2019-nCoV. Thus, herein, an effort has been made to cover this literature gap.

Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","Cashman, Dylan; Xu, Shenyu; Das, Subhajit; Heimerl, Florian; Liu, Cong; Humayoun, Shah Rukh; Gleicher, Michael; Endert, Alex; Chang, Remco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02865v1.pdf,502

432279,Fallout of covid-19 pandemic on the iraqi economy and the means of addressing,2021,"Impacts from the coronavirus pandemic have depressed market returns to corn and soybean farmers in the Midwest, extending pressures that have existed since 2013 and which were made worse by trade disputes with China. Without large ad hoc Federal aid, income on Midwest grain farms would have been quite low and the ongoing cash flow crunch much worse. Farmland prices have not adjusted downward, in part due to continuing ad hoc Federal aid, but also because interest rates have been historically very low. The financial (solvency) position of Midwest grain farms is surprisingly strong because of the strength in land values. However, the financial condition of Midwest row-crop agriculture could deteriorate markedly if recent and large infusions of ad hoc Federal aid dissipates or if interest rates rise sharply.","Schnitkey, Gary D; Paulson, Nicholas D; Irwin, Scott H; Coppess, Jonathan; Sherrick, Bruce J; Swanson, Krista J; Zulauf, Carl R; Hubbs, Todd",,,502
432590,Network model and analysis of the spread of Covid-19 with social distancing,2020-06-16,"OBJECTIVES: To gauge specific knowledge around clinical features, transmission pathways and prevention methods, and to identify factors associated with poor knowledge to help facilitate outbreak management in Syria during this rapid global rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Web-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: This study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 10 years into the Syrian war crisis. The Arabic-language survey was posted on various social media platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram and Facebook targeting various social groups. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4495 participants completed the survey. Participants with a history of COVID-19 infection, residing outside Syria or who did not fully complete the survey were excluded from the study. The final sample of 3586 participants (completion rate=79.8%) consisted of 2444 (68.2%) females and 1142 (31.8%) males. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: First, knowledge of COVID-19 in four areas (general knowledge; transmission pathways; signs and symptoms; prevention methods). Second, factors associated with poor knowledge. RESULTS: Of the 3586 participants, 2444 (68.2%) were female, 1822 (50.8%) were unemployed and 2839 (79.2%) were college educated. The study revealed good awareness regarding COVID-19 (mean 75.6%, SD ±9.4%). Multiple linear regression analysis correlated poor mean knowledge scores with male gender (ß=-0.933, p=0.005), secondary school or lower education level (ß=-3.782, p<0.001), non-healthcare occupation (ß=-3.592, p<0.001), low economic status (ß=-0.669, p<0.040) and >5 household members (ß=-1.737, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed some potentially troubling knowledge gaps which underscore the need for a vigorous public education campaign in Syria. This campaign must reinforce the public's awareness, knowledge and vigilance towards precautionary measures against COVID-19, and most importantly aid in controlling the worldwide spread of the disease.","Mohsen, Fatema; Bakkar, Batoul; Armashi, Humam; Aldaher, Nizar",BMJ Open,,502

Following an abrupt shift from in-person study to remote classes, supervision, clinical work, and training analyses, the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research polled its psychotherapy and psychoanalysis trainees to assess their initial experience of remote training. Most candidates found the technical aspects of online learning easy and were satisfied with remote training overall. Across all programs, most trainees considered class length and reading load about right and felt their class participation was unaffected, though they found it harder to concentrate. Most found it no harder to start a training case, felt the shift to remote supervision had no negative effect, and were satisfied with seeing their training analyst remotely. Most trainees preferred in-person classes, clinical work, and training analyses to those offered remotely, yet in light of the health risks they said they were less likely to continue training in fall 2020 if in-person work resumed. Trainees suggested several modifications of teaching techniques to improve their participation and concentration in class. These findings' implications for the debate regarding remote training in psychoanalysis are explored.","Richardson, Justin; Cabaniss, Deborah; Cherry, Sabrina; Halperin, Jane; Vaughan, Susan",J Am Psychoanal Assoc,,502

The disease has been spreading rapidly across the globe, with the largest burden falling on China, Europe, and the United States. COVID-19 is a new clinical syndrome, characterized by respiratory symptoms with varying degrees of severity, from mild upper respiratory illness to severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, aggravated by thrombosis in the pulmonary microcirculation. Three main phases of disease progression have been proposed for COVID-19: an early infection phase, a pulmonary phase, and a hyperinflammation phase. Although current understanding of COVID-19 treatment is mainly derived from small uncontrolled trials that are affected by a number of biases, strong background noise, and a litany of confounding factors, emerging awareness suggests that drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 (antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and antibodies) should be evaluated in relation to the pathophysiology of disease progression. Drawing upon the dramatic experiences taking place in Italy and around the world, here we review the changes in the evolution of the disease and focus on current treatment uncertainties and promising new therapies.","Romagnoli, Stefano; Peris, Adriano; De Gaudio, A Raffaele; Geppetti, Pierangelo",Physiol Rev,,502

434448,Statistical Analytics and Regional Representation Learning for COVID-19 Pandemic Understanding,2020-08-08,"BACKGROUND: A mechanistic understanding of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and diligent tracking of ongoing mutagenesis are of key importance to plan robust strategies for confining its transmission. Large numbers of available sequences and their dates of transmission provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze evolutionary adaptation in novel ways. Addition of high-resolution structural information can reveal the functional basis of these processes at the molecular level. Integrated systems biology-directed analyses of these data layers afford valuable insights to build a global understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Here we identify globally distributed haplotypes from 15,789 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and model their success based on their duration, dispersal, and frequency in the host population. Our models identify mutations that are likely compensatory adaptive changes that allowed for rapid expansion of the virus. Functional predictions from structural analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports, the Asp614Gly mutation in the spike glycoprotein (S) likely reduced transmission and the subsequent Pro323Leu mutation in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase led to the precipitous spread of the virus. Our model also suggests that two mutations in the nsp13 helicase allowed for the adaptation of the virus to the Pacific Northwest of the USA. Finally, our explainable artificial intelligence algorithm identified a mutational hotspot in the sequence of S that also displays a signature of positive selection and may have implications for tissue or cell-specific expression of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide valuable insights for the development of drugs and surveillance strategies to combat the current and future pandemics.","Garvin, Michael R; T Prates, Erica; Pavicic, Mirko; Jones, Piet; Amos, B Kirtley; Geiger, Armin; Shah, Manesh B; Streich, Jared; Felipe Machado Gazolla, Joao Gabriel; Kainer, David; Cliff, Ashley; Romero, Jonathon; Keith, Nathan; Brown, James B; Jacobson, Daniel",Genome Biol,,502

This study describes a comparative analysis of the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns over the North China Plain (NCP) from November 2018 to April 2019 based on EMI products. Validation of satellite products based on a cross-correlation analysis with data from four ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy sites provided good correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.78 to 0.88. The distribution and monthly averaged tropospheric NO2 columns revealed high pollution exposure levels during winter (November–January) and a decrease from February onward in the NCP. Moreover, a typical pollution event was analyzed in detail in combination with wind field statistics. The results indicated that variations of NO2 concentrations in Beijing and Tianjin were highly correlated with the wind direction from 22.5–45.0 degrees west of south, especially during times of high NO2 amounts. These findings highlight that the EMI payload on the GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite is useful for remote sensing of regional and global NO2 detection.","Yang, Dongshang Luo Yuhan Zeng Yi Si Fuqi Liang Xi Zhou Haijin Liu Wenqing",Atmosphere,,502

The aim of this study is to identify high-risk phenotypes of diabetes associated with COVID-19 severity and death. METHODS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review and meta-analysis on observational studies investigating phenotypes in individuals with diabetes and COVID-19-related death and severity. Four different databases were searched up to 10 October 2020. We used a random effects meta-analysis to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) with 95% CI. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by the GRADE tool. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles, including 17,687 individuals, met our inclusion criteria. For COVID-19-related death among individuals with diabetes and COVID-19, there was high to moderate certainty of evidence for associations (SRR [95% CI]) between male sex (1.28 [1.02, 1.61], n = 10 studies), older age (>65 years: 3.49 [1.82, 6.69], n = 6 studies), pre-existing comorbidities (cardiovascular disease: 1.56 [1.09, 2.24], n = 8 studies; chronic kidney disease: 1.93 [1.28, 2.90], n = 6 studies; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 1.40 [1.21, 1.62], n = 5 studies), diabetes treatment (insulin use: 1.75 [1.01, 3.03], n = 5 studies; metformin use: 0.50 [0.28, 0.90], n = 4 studies) and blood glucose at admission (&#8805;11 mmol/l: 8.60 [2.25, 32.83], n = 2 studies). Similar, but generally weaker and less precise associations were observed between risk phenotypes of diabetes and severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Individuals with a more severe course of diabetes have a poorer prognosis of COVID-19 compared with individuals with a milder course of disease. To further strengthen the evidence, more studies on this topic that account for potential confounders are warranted.

METHODS: After clinical and MRI examination, 16 out of 59 consecutive patients with moderate or severe instability after simple elbow dislocation were addressed to surgical treatment. There were 14 men and 2 women. The mean age was 39.6 years (range 16-69 years). RESULTS: MRI showed full-thickness lesion of MCL in 9/16 patients (53.3%) and partial lesion in 6/16 patients (40%), and in 1 case, the MCL was considered intact. On the lateral side, MRI showed complete injury of LCL in 7/16 patients (46.6%) and partial injury in 7/16 patients (40%). No lesions of LCL were observed in 2 patients (13.4%). MCL was surgically explored in all the patients. We observed 10/16 full-thickness lesions (62.5%) and 6/16 partial lesions (37.5%). LCL was surgically explored in 11/16 patients. We observed 6/11 full-thickness lesions (54.6%) and 5/11 partial lesions (45.4%). In 3 cases, associated soft tissue injuries were detected. The rate of concordance between MRI and surgical findings was 87.5% (14/16 cases) on the medial side and 90.9% (10/11 cases) on the lateral side. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that MRI is a reliable and useful tool to investigate collateral ligaments and soft tissue injuries around the elbow and to plan the most adequate surgical treatment.","Dutto, E; Artiaco, S; Gallo, A; Borré, A; Sard, A; Battiston, B",Musculoskelet. surg.

METHODS: From 5/15-6/1/2020, Bhutanese and Burmese refugee community leaders were invited to complete an anonymous, online survey and shared the link with other community members who were English-proficient, &#8805;18 years old, and currently living in the USA. We identified characteristics associated with pandemic-related discrimination and stress applying ordinal logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 218 refugees from 23 states, nearly one third of participants reported experiencing at least one type of discrimination, and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of pandemic-related stress. Having had COVID-19, having a family member with COVID-19, and being an essential worker were associated with discrimination. Discrimination, financial crisis, and female gender were associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing pandemic-related discrimination should remain a priority, as should the promotion of social support and coping strategies. Noting that this is a nonrepresentative sample, we recommend that larger national studies tracking experiences with pandemic-related discrimination and stress include Asian American subgroups with limited English proficiency.","Zhang, Mengxi; Gurung, Ashok; Anglewicz, Philip; Baniya, Kalpana; Yun, Katherine",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,502

439671,Teleworking in the context of the Covid-19 crisis,2020,"The emerging-market and developing economies face a multitude of grave challenges as they confront the COVID-19 pandemic, including a critical lack of budgetary space. In this context, many policymakers and economic analysts have highlighted the need to bolster the lending capacity of international financial institutions. But for most of the world’s poorest economies, further borrowing would push their debt to unsustainable levels. Accordingly, the latest projections of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) show the advanced economies widening their budget deficits by 11.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to provide fiscal stimulus and help combat the pandemic. By contrast, the lowest-income economies are expected to expand their deficits by a mere 2.2%. What many of these countries require is not more lending but greater assistance in the form of grants. Providing additional grants makes sense from an ethical perspective and would lead to more sustainable economic development, while also benefitting the advanced economies by boosting global economic growth. In this policy brief, we estimate the cost of providing the world’s poorest economies with grants sufficient to allow them to undertake just half the fiscal expansion being implemented in the advanced economies. Our results indicate that this comes out to a very manageable US$308 billion, or 0.6% of the combined GDP of the advanced economies. © 2021 The Author(s).

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence, time of onset, and duration of anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection and the association of anosmia with other symptoms and eosinophil count. Material and Methods: Two hundred patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic were assessed for olfaction with a nonirritant odor. The presence of anosmia was recorded, and a questionnaire integrating the anosmia reporting tool was filled. Patients with anosmia/hyposmia were followed telephonically at 7 and 14 days for resolution of anosmia and other symptoms. The presence of anosmia was correlated with eosinophil count. Results: Of the 200 COVID-19 patients, 87% were symptomatic. More than half of the patients had fever (56%). Anosmia was observed in 30% of the patients and hyposmia in 4% of patients. In 41% of the patients, olfactory loss was reported before diagnosis. The mean duration of anosmia was 7.8 (± 5) days;97% of patients recovered with a resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks. Ageusia was the most commonly and significantly associated symptom with anosmia (66%, n = 45) followed by sore throat (41%), and rhinorrhea (28%). The symptoms in both the sexes were comparable. Absolute eosinophil count of &lt;40/μL was observed in 59 patients (29.5%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 0 in 17 patients (8.5%). Among the 68 anosmic patients, 36 (47%) patients had eosinopenia, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: Anosmia is an early and sometimes the only symptom in approximately one-third of the patients with COVID-19 infection. Eosinophil count should be checked in anosomic patient with suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Objective tools for olfactory and gustatory assessment should be brought into practice for early and prompt diagnosis to control the spread of the disease. © 2021 Journal of Anaesthesiology Clinical Pharmacology Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Kumar, V.; Singla, S.; Gupta, N.; Bharati, S.

A rapid virtual audit of COVID-19 press briefings in LMICs,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and we are still compiling new findings to decipher and understand SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy No reports encompass any conclusive confirmation of vertical transmission Nevertheless, cases of fetal distress and multiple organ failure have been reported, as well as rare cases of fetal demise While clinicians and scientists continue to seek proof of vertical transmission, they miss the greater point, namely the cause of preterm delivery In this review, we suggest that the cause might not be due to the viral infection but the fetal exposure to maternal inflammation or cytokine storm that translates into a complication of COVID-19 This statement is extrapolated from previous experience with infections and inflammation which were reported to be fatal by increasing the risk of preterm delivery and causing abnormal neonatal brain development and resulting in neurological disorders like atypical behavioral phenotype or autistic syndrome Given the potentially fatal consequences on neonate health, we highlight the urgent need for an animal model to study vertical transmission The preclinical model will allow us to make the link between SARS-COV-2 infection, inflammation and long-term follow-up of child brain development","Joma, Mohamed Fovet Claire-Maelle Seddiki Nabila Gressens Pierre Laforge Mireille",Vaccines,,502

However, long-term quarantine and especially full lockdown is an extremely expensive measure. To explore the possibility of controlling and suppressing the COVID-19 epidemic at the lowest possible cost, we apply optimal control theory. In this paper, we create two controlled Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) type models describing the spread of COVID-19 in a human population. For each model, we solve an optimal control problem and find the optimal quarantine strategy that ensures the minimal level of the infected population at the lowest possible cost. The properties of the corresponding optimal controls are established analytically using the Pontryagin maximum principle. The optimal solutions, obtained numerically, validate our analytical results. Additionally, for both controlled models, we find explicit formulas for the basic reproductive ratios in the presence of a constant control and show that while the epidemic can be eventually stopped under long-term quarantine measures of maximum strength (full lockdown), the strength of quarantine can be reduced under the optimal quarantine policies. The behavior of the appropriate optimal solutions and their dependence on the basic reproductive ratio, population density, and the duration of quarantine are discussed, and practically relevant conclusions are made.","Grigorieva, Ellina V; Khailov, Evgenii N; Korobeinikov, Andrei",Studies in applied mathematics,,502

Although environmental factors, such as those influencing the survival of viruses and their transmission between species including humans, play important roles in PHERSs, little attention has been given to these factors. This study describes and elucidates the roles of environmental factors in future PHERSs. To improve countries' capability to respond to public health emergencies associated with viral infections such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of environmental factors should be considered before, during, and after the responses to such emergencies. More specifically, to prevent pandemic outbreaks, we should strengthen environmental and wildlife protection, conduct detailed viral surveillance in animals and hotspots, and improve early-warning systems. During the pandemic, we must study the impacts of environmental factors on viral behaviors, develop control measures to minimize secondary environmental risks, and conduct timely assessments of viral risks and secondary environmental effects with a view to reducing the impacts of the pandemic on human health and on ecosystems. After the pandemic, we should further strengthen surveillance for viruses and the prevention of viral spread, maintain control measures for minimizing secondary environmental risks, develop our capability to scientifically predict pandemics and resurgences, and prepare for the next unexpected resurgence. Meanwhile, we should restore the normal life and production of the public based on the ""One Health"" concept, that views global human and environmental health as inextricably linked. Our recommendations are essential for improving nations' capability to respond to global public health emergencies.","Wang, Xiaolei; Wu, Fengchang; Zhao, Xiaoli; Zhang, Xiao; Wang, Junyu; Niu, Lin; Liang, Weigang; Leung, Kenneth Mei Yee; Giesy, John P",,,502

METHODS: We report two infant cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yichang, Hubei, China. The younger of the two is only 5-months old. We recorded their clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, laboratory examination, and treatment in detail. In addition, we provide computed tomographic images of their chest, which are the most serious imaging manifestation among the infants recorded so far. RESULTS: Although both of them eventually recovered and were discharged from the hospital, they were complicated with varying degrees of liver and myocardial injury. In addition, one of them was complicated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should consider the potential risks of developing severe illness of infants infected by SARS-CoV-2 and take them seriously.","Li, Anni; Zhou, Xiaolin; Lu, Wei; Zhou, Yuanhong; Liu, Qiang",Immun Inflamm Dis,,502

First studies report an impact on mental health of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compared the impact of the pandemic on two culturally and economically similar European countries: the UK and Germany. METHODS: Participants (UK = 241, German = 541) completed an online-survey assessing COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, mental health using the Symptom-Check-List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. RESULTS: We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on health, financial situation and families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, and higher prevalence. Interestingly, German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. CONCLUSION: As 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive and dysthymic symptoms as well as anxieties, it specifically shows the need for tailored intervention systems to support large proportions of the general public.","Knolle, Franziska; Ronan, Lisa; Murray, Graham K",BMC Psychol,,502

A major portion of the population has become susceptible to this strain. Scientists are pushing their limits to formulate a vaccine against Covid-19 with the least side effects. Although the recent discoveries of vaccines have shown some relief from the covid infection rate, however, physical fatigue, mental abnormalities, inflammation and other multiple organ damages are arising as post-Covid symptoms. The long-term effects of these symptoms are massive. Patients with such symptoms are known as long-haulers and treatment strategy against this condition is still unknown. In this study, we tried to explore a strategy to deal with the post-Covid symptoms. We targeted three human proteins namely ACE2, Interleukin-6, Transmembrane serine protease and NRP1 which are already reported to be damaged via Covid-19 proteins and upregulated in the post-Covid stage. Our target plant in this study is Cannabis (popularly known as 'Ganja' in India). The molecular docking and simulation studies revealed that Cannabidiol (CBD) and Cannabivarin (CVN) obtained from Cannabis can bind to post-Covid symptoms related central nervous system (CNS) proteins and downregulate them which can be beneficial in post-covid symptoms treatment strategy. Thus we propose Cannabis as an important therapeutic plant against post-Covid symptoms.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Studies on patient trajectories and outcomes among hospitalised patients infected with B.1.1.7 are essential for hospital capacity planning. MethodsUsing linked individual-level data from national registries, we conducted a cohort study on cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Norway hospitalised between 21 December 2020 and 25 April 2021. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios using survival analysis to examine the association between B.1.1.7 and time from symptom onset to hospitalisation, and length of stay (LoS) in hospital and an intensive care unit compared to non-VOC. We calculated adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression to examine the association between B.1.1.7 and mortality (up to 30 days post discharge) compared to non-VOC. ResultsWe included 946 B.1.1.7 patients and 157 non-VOC. The crude median time from symptom onset to hospitalisation was 8 days (IQR: 5-10) for B.1.1.7 and 8 days (IQR: 4-11) for non-VOC. The crude median LoS in hospital was 5.0 days (IQR: 2.6-10.0) for B.1.1.7 patients and 5.1 days (IQR: 2.5-9.9) for non-VOC. Fifty-four (6%) B.1.1.7 patients died, compared to 14 (9%) non-VOC. There was no difference in the unadjusted or adjusted estimates of our outcome measures for B.1.1.7 and non-VOC patients.

The case of Spain,2021,"Our aim was to analyze the prevalence of unhealthy movement behavior clusters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to investigate whether changes in the number of unhealthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine were associated with mental health indicators. Data of 38,353 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior research were used. For movement behaviors, participants reported the frequency and duration of physical activity and daily time on TV viewing and computer/tablet use before and during the pandemic period. Participants also reported the frequency of loneliness, sadness (feeling sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety feelings (feeling worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period. Sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, country region, and time adhering to the quarantine were used as correlates. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression models for the data analysis. The prevalence of all movement behavior clusters increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cluster of all three unhealthy movement behaviors increased from 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9-5.4) to 26.2% (95% CI: 24.8-27.7). Younger adults, people with higher academic achievement, not working or working at home, and those with higher time in quarantine presented higher clustering. People that increased one and two or three unhealthy movement behaviors were, respectively, more likely to present loneliness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.21-1.65] and OR = 1.71 [95% CI: 1.42-2.07]), sadness (OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.06-1.48] and OR = 1.73 [95% CI: 1.42-2.10]), and anxiety (OR = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.13-1.57] and OR = 1.78 [95% CI: 1.46-2.17]) during the COVID-19 quarantine. Clustering of unhealthy movement behaviors substantially increased and was associated with poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah C; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,502

447769,Pandemic: Looking Back and Thinking Ahead,2020,"Causal inference is one of the most fundamental problems across all domains of science. We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two observed discrete symbolic sequences X and Y. We present a framework which relies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from sequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one sequence compresses the other sequence. We infer X causes Y if the grammar inferred from X better compresses Y than in the other direction. To put this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions without demanding temporal structures. We evaluate these models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present two unique applications of the proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using numerous sequences, we show that our models capture causal information exchanged between genome sequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues in sequence analysis to investigate the evolution of virulence and pathogenicity in future applications.","Sy, Pranay; Nagaraj, Nithin",J Biomed Inform,,502

447909,"Air pollution in post-COVID-19 world: the final countdown of modern civilization? : Comment on: ""COVID-19 and air pollution: the worst is yet to come""",2021,"Large differences in COVID-19 death rates exist between countries and between regions of the same country. Some very low death rate countries such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, or the Balkans have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods. Although biases exist when examining ecological studies, fermented vegetables or cabbage have been associated with low death rates in European countries. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As a result of SARS-CoV-2 binding, ACE2 downregulation enhances the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 R) axis associated with oxidative stress. This leads to insulin resistance as well as lung and endothelial damage, two severe outcomes of COVID-19. The nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is the most potent antioxidant in humans and can block in particular the AT1 R axis. Cabbage contains precursors of sulforaphane, the most active natural activator of Nrf2. Fermented vegetables contain many lactobacilli, which are also potent Nrf2 activators. Three examples are: kimchi in Korea, westernized foods, and the slum paradox. It is proposed that fermented cabbage is a proof-of-concept of dietary manipulations that may enhance Nrf2-associated antioxidant effects, helpful in mitigating COVID-19 severity.","Bousquet, Jean; Anto, Josep M; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Haahtela, Tari; Fonseca, Susana C; Iaccarino, Guido; Blain, Hubert; Vidal, Alain; Sheikh, Aziz; Akdis, Cezmi A; Zuberbier, Torsten",Allergy,,502

448044,The Challenges and Rewards of Teledentistry,2021,"BACKGROUND: Social media has been widely used for health-related purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous reviews have summarized social media uses for a specific health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent comprehensive review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. METHODS: The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2006 and 2020 in 12 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After coding the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. RESULTS: This study summarized 10 social media uses for various health purposes by health institutions, health researchers and practitioners, and the public. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used for various health purposes. Several new usages have emerged since 2013 including advancing health research and practice, social mobilization, and facilitating offline health-related services and events. Research gaps exist regarding advancing strategic use of social media based on audience segmentation, evaluating the impact of social media in health interventions, understanding the impact of health identity development, and addressing privacy concerns.","Chen, Junhan; Wang, Yuan",J Med Internet Res,,502

448611,"Emerging challenges in urban waste management in Tehran, Iran during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Complement system plays a dual role; physiological as well as pathophysiological. While physiological role protects the host, pathophysiological role can substantially harm the host, by triggering several hyper-inflammatory pathways, referred as ""hypercytokinaemia"". Emerging clinical evidence suggests that exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), tricks the complement to aberrantly activate the ""hypercytokinaemia"" loop, which significantly contributes to the severity of the COVID19. The pathophysiological response of the complement is usually amplified by the over production of potent chemoattractants and inflammatory modulators, like C3a and C5a. Therefore, it is logical that neutralizing the harmful effects of the inflammatory modulators of the complement system can be beneficial for the management of COVID19. While the hunt for safe and efficacious vaccines were underway, polypharmacology based combination therapies were fairly successful in reducing both the morbidity and mortality of COVID19 across the globe. Repurposing of small molecule drugs as ""neutraligands"" of C5a appears to be an alternative for modulating the hyper-inflammatory signals, triggered by the C5a-C5aR signaling axes. Thus, in the current study, few specific and non-specific immunomodulators (azithromycin, colchicine, famotidine, fluvoxamine, dexamethasone and prednisone) generally prescribed for prophylactic usage for management of COVID19 were subjected to computational and biophysical studies to probe whether any of the above drugs can act as ""neutraligands"", by selectively binding to C5a over C3a. The data presented in this study indicates that corticosteroids, like prednisone can have potentially better selectively (Kd â¼ 0.38 µM) toward C5a than C3a, suggesting the positive modulatory role of C5a in the general success of the corticosteroid therapy in moderate to severe COVID19.","Das, Aurosikha; Rana, Soumendra",Comput Biol Chem,,502

This resulted in uncertainty in the food business and caused food supply shocks. According to some scientists, business people, and politicians, this situation is a forerunner and warning for humanity to change its lifestyle by focusing on sustainable measures to prevent natural ecosystems damage. In line with this, the present review article focused on the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on horticultural production and some prevention measures. It has been scientifically confirmed that the postharvest losses of fruits and vegetables reach around 10-15% in developed countries and about 20-40% in developing countries, higher in some specific crops. It is believed that reducing these losses can help the world fight food supply shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic and customary conditions to reduce the pressure on natural resources. Therefore, the present paper aimed to highlight some critical handling practices against food supply shocks.","Kahramanoglu, Ibrahim; Rengasamy, Kannan R R; Usanmaz, Serhat; Alas, Turgut; Helvaci, Murat; Okatan, Volkan; Askin, Mehmet A; Wan, Chunpeng",Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,,502

Determination of the level and structure of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 among the population of the Murmansk region against the background of the incidence of COVID-19. Materials and methods. The study was carried out according to a unified method for determining the seroprevalence of the population, developed by Rospotrebnadzor with the participation of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute. A total of 3117 volunteers were examined, distributed into 7 age groups. The content of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was determined by ELISA using a set of reagents for analyzing human serum or plasma for the presence of specific immunoglobulins of class G to the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus produced by the FBUN GNCPMiB Rospotrebnadzor (Obolensk) in accordance with the instructions for application. Results. The level of population immunity in the Murmansk region as a whole was 31,2%. The highest seroprevalence was found among children aged 1–6 and 7–13 years (35.6% and 44,1%, respectively), the lowest among the elderly population aged 60–69, as well as 70 and more years (20,4% and 20,9%, respectively). In the cities of the Murmansk region. the herd level of immunity varied from 19,6% (Kola city) to 46,1% (Kandalaksha city). It was not possible to find a reliable relationship between the incidence of the population of the cities of the Murmansk region and seroprevalence. The highest level of seroprevalence was noted among office workers (38,0%), the lowest among transport workers (19,5%). In the presence of contacts with patients with COVID-19, seropositivity increased 1,4 times compared to the average population value. The level of specific humoral immunity in convalescents after COVID-19 is 64,1%, which is 2,2 times higher than the average for half-day.

457561,A Pretext for Regression? The Gendered Institutional Response to COVID-19 in the Country of Football,2020,"PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic response has required planning for the safe provision of care. In Australia, privately practising midwives are an important group to consider as they often struggle for acceptance by the health system. BACKGROUND: There are around 200 Endorsed Midwives eligible to practice privately in Australia (privately practising midwives) who provide provide the full continuum of midwifery care. AIM: To explore the experience of PPMs in relation to the response to planning for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was distributed through social media and personal networks to privately practising midwives in Australia in April 2020. RESULTS: One hundred and three privately practising midwives responded to the survey. The majority (82%) felt very, or well informed, though nearly half indicated they would value specifically tailored information especially from professional bodies. One third (35%) felt prepared regarding PPE but many lacked masks, gowns and gloves, hand sanitiser and disinfectant. Sixty four percent acquired PPE through social media community sharing sites, online orders, hardware stores or made masks. Sixty-eight percent of those with collaborative arrangements with local hospitals reported a lack of support and were unable to support women who needed transfer to hospital. The majority (93%) reported an increase in the number of enquiries relating to homebirth. CONCLUSION: Privately practising midwives were resourceful, sought out information and were prepared. Support from the hospital sector was not always present. Lessons need to be learned especially in terms of integration, support, education and being included as part of the broader health system.","Homer, Caroline S E; Davies-Tuck, Miranda; Dahlen, Hannah G; Scarf, Vanessa L",Women and birth (Online),,502

Our study aims to examine the incidence and risk factors of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of adult COVID-19 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia admitted to a regional tertiary care hospital. SPI was defined as microorganisms identified on the respiratory tract with or without concurrent positive blood culture results for the same microorganism obtained at least 48 h after admission. RESULTS: Thirteen out of 244 (5%) had developed SPI during hospitalization. The median of the nadir lymphocyte count during hospitalization was significantly lower in patients with SPI as compared to those without SPI [0.4 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.5) versus 0.6 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.9)]. Patients with lower nadir lymphocyte had an increased risk of developing SPI with odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.47, p = 0.04) per 0.1 K/uL decrement in nadir lymphocyte. The baseline median inflammatory markers of CRP [166.4 mg/L vs. 100.0 mg/L, p = 0.01] and d-dimer (18.5 mg/L vs. 1.4 mg/L, p<0.01), and peak procalcitonin (1.4 ng/mL vs. 0.3 ng/mL, p<0.01) and CRP (273.5 mg/L vs. 153.7 mg/L, p<0.01) during hospitalization were significantly higher in SPI group. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 5%. Lower nadir median lymphocyte count during hospitalization was associated with an increased OR of developing SPI. The CRP and d-dimer levels on admission, and peak procalcitonin and CRP levels during hospitalization were higher in patients with SPI.","Chong, Woon H; Chieng, Hau; Tiwari, Anupama; Beegle, Scott; Feustel, Paul J; Ghalib, Sana; Al-Tarbsheh, Ali Hani; Jain, Esha; Mullins, Jeannette; Keenan, Megan; Chopra, Amit",Am. j. med. sci,,502

463188,"The perception of COVID-19 and avoidance behavior in Turkey: the role of income level, gender and education",2021,"We present scientific perspectives on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and global food security. International organizations and current evidence based on other respiratory viruses suggests COVID-19 is not a food safety issue, i.e., there is no evidence associating food or food packaging with the transmission of the virus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), yet an abundance of precaution for this exposure route seems appropriate. The pandemic, however, has had a dramatic impact on the food system, with direct and indirect consequences on lives and livelihoods of people, plants, and animals. Given the complexity of the system at risk, it is likely that some of these consequences are still to emerge over time. To date, the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic have been substantial including restrictions on agricultural workers, planting, current and future harvests; shifts in agricultural livelihoods and food availability; food safety; plant and animal health and animal welfare; human nutrition and health; along with changes in public policies. All aspects are crucial to food security that would require ""One Health"" approaches as the concept may be able to manage risks in a cost-effective way with cross-sectoral, coordinated investments in human, environmental, and animal health. Like climate change, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be most acutely felt by the poorest and most vulnerable countries and communities. Ultimately, to prepare for future outbreaks or threats to food systems, we must take into account the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and a ""Planetary Health"" perspective.","Mardones, Fernando O; Rich, Karl M; Boden, Lisa A; Moreno-Switt, Andrea I; Caipo, Marisa L; Zimin-Veselkoff, Natalia; Alateeqi, Abdulaziz M; Baltenweck, Isabelle",Front Vet Sci,,502

Dry matter intake, live we ight gain and feed conversion of beef heifers fed TMR containing grass silage were measured. The small particle size in the forage did not increase either wet or DM silages bulk densities, did not reduce the porosity and did not change the unloading losses. The forage wilting was not enough to reduce the DM density due to the compensatory effect established by the higher DM content, which presented the highest losses. No significant differences were observed for treatments on animal DM intake (2.4%BW), body weight gain (1.03 kg animal-1 day-1) and feed conversion (7.91 kg MS kg-1 BWG). Treatments in the ensiling of Tanzania grass did not prevent unloading losses and did not improve animal performance.","Fátima Paziani, Solidete; Gustavo Nussio, Luiz; Vaz Pires, Alexandre; Leonardo Ribeiro, José; Zopollatto, Maity; Schmidt, Patrick",Acta Sci.

Stress-related reactions, if prolonged, may result in mental health problems. We examined the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in a multinational study and explored the effects of government responses to the outbreak. We sampled 18,171 community adults from 35 countries/societies, stratified by age, gender, and region of residence. Across the 35 societies, 26.6% of participants reported moderate to extremely severe depression symptoms, 28.2% moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms, and 18.3% moderate to extremely severe stress symptoms. Coronavirus anxiety comprises two factors, namely Perceived Vulnerability and Threat Response. After controlling for age, gender, and education level, perceived vulnerability predicted higher levels of negative emotional symptoms and psychological distress, whereas threat response predicted higher levels of self-rated health and subjective well-being. People in societies with more stringent control policies had more threat response and reported better subjective health. Coronavirus anxiety exerts detrimental effects on subjective health and well-being, but also has the adaptive function in mobilizing safety behaviors, providing support for an evolutionary perspective on psychological adaptation.","Chen, Sylvia Xiaohua; Ng, Jacky C K; Hui, Bryant P H; Au, Algae K Y; Wu, Wesley C H; Lam, Ben C P; Mak, Winnie W S; Liu, James H",Sci Rep,,502

Thus, health care providers need to evaluate each BC treatment and in-hospital visit to minimize pandemic-associated risks while maintaining adequate treatment efficacy. Here we present a set of guidelines regarding available options for BC patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the lack of evidence about COVID-19 infection, these recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion, medical organizations' and societies' recommendations, and some published evidence. We consider this a useful tool to facilitate medical decision making in this health crisis situation we are facing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This work presents a set of guidelines regarding available options for breast cancer (BC) patient management and treatment by BC subtype in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

468220,Impact of Social Distancing and Travel Restrictions on Non-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Non-COVID-19) Respiratory Hospital Admissions in Young Children in Rural Alaska,2021,"Rationale: Higher levels of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lower respiratory system compliance have each been associated with increased mortality in severe coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). IL-6 levels are associated with disease severity and mortality in non-COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between IL-6 and respiratory mechanics in COVID-19-related ARDS. Methods: This retrospective cohort study took place at two Columbia University Irving Medical Center hospitals. We identified patients age &gt;18 years with laboratory confirmed COVID-19, who were intubated from March 1st through April 30th, 2020, and met the Berlin definition of ARDS. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Outcomes were censored at 90 days after intubation. For patients without IL-6 levels recorded on the initial day of intubation, serum samples were obtained from the Columbia University Biobank and tested using the Quantikine Human IL-6 Immunoassay. IL-6 values were log-transformed. The primary outcome was respiratory system compliance. Secondary outcomes were calculated ventilatory ratio, PaO2:FiO2 ratio, and mortality. Linear regression and logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. Results: During the study period, 483 patients had COVID-19-associated ARDS. Median time of follow up was 37 days (IQR 11-90). At 90 days, 260 (53.8%) patients were deceased, 206 (42.7%) had been discharged, and 17 (3.5%) were still admitted. Two hundred sixteen (44.7%) patients had available data on respiratory system compliance and serum IL-6 levels from the initial day of mechanical ventilation. The median IL-6 value was 204.1 pg/ml (IQR 110-469.7). Median compliance was 25.5 ml/cmH2O (IQR 21.4-33.3), median ventilatory ratio was 1.96 (IQR 1.51-2.57), and median PaO2:FiO2 ratio was 134 (IQR 87-196). In unadjusted linear regression, higher IL-6 was associated with lower respiratory system compliance (log [IL-6] coefficient-1.80, p = 0.001) (Figure 1). This relationship remained significant when adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (coefficient-2.43, p&lt;0.001). There was no significant association between IL-6 and ventilatory ratio (0.76 p=0.08) or PaO2:FiO2 ratio (-6.15 p=0.06). Higher IL-6 was associated with higher odds of death at 90 days (OR 1.35 per unit increase in log [IL-6], p-value 0.022) when adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, race, ethnicity, and SOFA score. Conclusion: In COVID-19-associated ARDS, higher levels of IL-6 were associated with lower respiratory system compliance even adjusting for measured confounders. Higher IL-6 was also associated with higher mortality.","Furfaro, D.; Cummings, M. J.; Abrams, D.; Fountain, J. H.; Thompson, A.; Gomez Merchan, L.; Murn, M.; Rosen, A.; Beitler, J.

Deep learning methodologies constitute a main approach for chest CT scan analysis and disease prediction. However, large annotated databases are necessary for developing deep learning models that are able to provide COVID-19 diagnosis across various medical environments in different countries. Due to privacy issues, publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are highly difficult to obtain, which hinders the research and development of AI-enabled diagnosis methods of COVID-19 based on CT scans. In this paper we present the COV19-CT-DB database which is annotated for COVID-19, consisting of about 5,000 3-D CT scans, We have split the database in training, validation and test datasets. The former two datasets can be used for training and validation of machine learning models, while the latter will be used for evaluation of the developed models. We also present a deep learning approach, based on a CNN-RNN network and report its performance on the COVID19-CT-DB database.","Kollias, Dimitrios; Arsenos, Anastasios; Soukissian, Levon; Kollias, Stefanos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07524v2.pdf,502

470523,An Optimal Lockdown Relaxation Strategy for Minimizing the Economic Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"This essay explores the intersections of race, weather and climate. Earth science construes weather as the temperature and precipitation that impacts environments. Thinking about how this applies to bodies has come into vogue in trying to understand the disproportionate number of COVID-19 infections and deaths for Blacks and Latinx people. Arline Geronimus pioneered this in 1992 when she transposed the notion of ?weathering? from its standard meaning of a process that decays wood onto the cumulative racism experienced by Black women resulting in excessive maternal death. Her ?weathering hypothesis? tracks the assemblage of negative health outcomes for all African Americans caused by dangerous work environments and polluted neighborhoods. My essay shows how these embodied health effects are linked to larger histories of burning fossil fuels. We now know burning coal and oil transforms the climate by increasing the ratio of CO2 molecules. We also know that this shifting climate determines specific weather outcomes. However, we don?t yet have a full picture of the racial dynamic undergirding this. As a corollary to weathering, this essay proposes a ?climating hypothesis? to help expose the power that Euro-descendant whites have wielded for centuries to intervene in the earth?s climate.","Driscoll, Mark",Cultural Dynamics,,502

This study examined whether a commercial LAMP assay can reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly in respiratory samples without having to extract nucleic acids (NA) beforehand. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS, n = 220) were tested by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and with the LAMP assay. For RT-PCR, NA were investigated. For LAMP, NA from 26 NPS in viral transport medium (VTM) were tested. The other 194 NPS were analyzed directly without prior NA extraction (140 samples in VTM; 54 dry swab samples stirred in phosphate buffered saline). Ten NPS were tested directly by LAMP using a sous-vide cooking unit. The isothermal assay demonstrated excellent specificity (100%) but moderate sensitivity (68.8%), with a positive predictive value of 1 and a negative predictive value of 0.65 for direct testing of NPS in VTM. The use of dry swabs, even without NA extraction, improved the analytical sensitivity; up to 6% of samples showed signs of inhibition. LAMP could be performed successfully with a sous-vide cooking unit. This technique is very fast, requires little laboratory resources, and can replace rapid antigen tests or verify reactive rapid tests on-site.","Anastasiou, Olympia E; Holtkamp, Caroline; Schäfer, Miriam; Schön, Frieda; Eis-Hübinger, Anna Maria; Krumbholz, Andi",Viruses,,502

473015,How did Wuhan residents cope with a 76-day lockdown?,2020,"New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo-monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock-decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through-volume functionalization of intricate, pre-designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure-function relationships are explored in a pharma-important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building-blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.","Mannering, Jamie; Stones, Rebecca; Xia, Dong; Sykes, Daniel; Hondow, Nicole; Flahaut, Emmanuel; Chamberlain, Thomas W; Brydson, Rik; Cairns, Gareth A; Menzel, Robert",Adv Mater,,502

473921,Chinese adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment: The contribution of mothers’ attachment style and adolescents’ attachment to mother,2020,"As we move through 2020, our world has been transformed by the spread of COVID-19 in many aspects. A large number of cities across the world entered ""sleep mode"" sequentially due to the stay-at-home or lockdown policies. This study exploits the impact of pandemic-induced human mobility restrictions, as the response to COVID-19 pandemic, on the urban air quality across China. Different from the ""traditional"" difference-in-differences analysis, a human mobility-based difference-in-differences method is used to quantify the effect of intracity mobility reductions on air quality across 325 cities in China. The model shows that the air quality index (AQI) experiences a 12.2% larger reduction in the cities with lockdown. Moreover, this reduction effect varies with different types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO decreased by 13.1%, 15.3%, 4%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively). The heterogeneity analysis in terms of different types of cities shows that the effect is greater in northern, higher income, more industrialized cities, and more economically active cities. We also estimate the subsequent health benefits following such improvement, and the expected averted premature deaths due to air pollution declines are around 26,385 to 38,977 during the sample period. These findings illuminate a new light on the role of a policy intervention in the pollution emission, while also providing a roadmap for future research on the pollution effect of COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Meichang; Liu, Feng; Zheng, Meina",Air Qual Atmos Health,,502

However, severe adverse effects have been reported for some of these repurposed drugs. Recently, several in silico studies have identified compounds that are potential inhibitors of the main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. An essential step of drug development is the careful evaluation of toxicity, which has a range of associated financial, temporal and ethical limitations. In this study, a number of in silico tools were used to predict the toxicity of 19 experimental compounds. A range of web-based servers and applications were used to predict hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, and other potential adverse effects. The compounds were assessed based on the consensus of results, and were labelled as positive or negative for a particular toxicity endpoint. The compounds were then categorised into three classes, according to their predicted toxicity. Ten compounds (52.6%) were predicted to be non-mutagenic and non-hERG inhibitors, and exhibited zero or low level hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, from the consensus of results, all 19 compounds were predicted to be non-mutagenic and negative for acute oral toxicity. Overall, most of the compounds displayed encouraging toxicity profiles. These results can assist further lead optimisation studies and drug development efforts to combat Covid-19.","Bhat, Varsha; Chatterjee, Jhinuk",Altern Lab Anim,,502

474669,Platforms and the pandemic: A case study of fashion rental platforms during COVID‐19,2020,"Understanding the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis helps in the rapid therapeutic target identification. Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploring the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the similarity in codon usage patterns, we propose a computational scheme to recreate the host-viral protein-protein interaction network. We use host proteins from seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work towards understanding the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. Further, extensive analysis is performed to understand the host PPI network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among them, non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S), are the most influential proteins in interacting with multiple host proteins. While ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be the worst affected during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several proteins participating in multiple pathways are highly central in host PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins. We observe many potential targets (host proteins) from the affected pathways associated with the various drug molecules, including Arsenic trioxide, Dexamethasone, Hydroxychloroquine, Ritonavir, and Interferon beta, which are either under clinical trial or in use during COVID-19.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Chakraborty, Subhadip; Roy, Swarup",J Biomed Inform,,502
475037,Pandemic Now and Then: A Historical Perspective of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Adopted In Covid-19,2021,"Pending the availability of vaccines to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the current solution is ""social distancing"" with a reduction of dental treatments to those assessed as urgent and emergency cases. These treatments also involve Early Childhood Caries (ECC) due to the fact that this disease affects preschool children (a vulnerable population) and, in addition, shows a propensity to evolve into more serious complications (dental pain, infections). A narrative review was carried out to support a protocol for treating ECC with efficacious and safe (in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission) procedures. Protocol involves criteria for patients' selection remotely (telemedicine), and well-detailed criteria/equipment and hygiene procedures to combat against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care. MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments. For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment. The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.","Cianetti, Stefano; Pagano, Stefano; Nardone, Michele; Lombardo, Guido",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,502

477187,Working together during the Covid-19 crisis,2020,"Broadening access to both computational and educational resources is critical to diffusing machine-learning (ML) innovation. However, today, most ML resources and experts are siloed in a few countries and organizations. In this paper, we describe our pedagogical approach to increasing access to applied ML through a massive open online course (MOOC) on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML). We suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an attractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and globally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete, self-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a collaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google) produced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how to develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly available on the edX MOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed for learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to real-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical considerations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of TinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To facilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the courses, we launched a standalone website, a forum, a chat, and an optional course-project competition. We also released the course materials publicly, hoping they will inspire the next generation of ML practitioners and educators and further broaden access to cutting-edge ML technologies.","Reddi, Vijay Janapa; Plancher, Brian; Kennedy, Susan; Moroney, Laurence; Warden, Pete; Agarwal, Anant; Banbury, Colby; Banzi, Massimo; Bennett, Matthew; Brown, Benjamin; Chitlangia, Sharad; Ghosal, Radhika; Grafman, Sarah; Jaeger, Rupert; Krishnan, Srivatsan; Lam, Maximilian; Leiker, Daniel; Mann, Cara; Mazumder, Mark; Pajak, Dominic; Ramaprasad, Dhilan; Smith, J.

The UNESCO World Heritage site ""Venice and its Lagoon"", is one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Mass tourism increases marine litter, water traffic emissions, solid waste, and sewage release. Plastic marine litter is not only a major aesthetic problem diminishing tourists experience of Venice, it also leaches contaminants into the seawater. Since there is a dearth in the literature regarding microplastic leachable compounds and overtourism related pollutants, the project studied the Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) molecular fingerprint of volatile lagoon water pollutants, to gain insight into the extent of this phenomenon in August 2019. The chromatographic analyses enabled the identification of 40 analytes related to the presence of polymers in seawater, water traffic, and tourists habits. In Italy, on the 10th March 2020, the lockdown restrictions were enforced to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice came to a halt, and the ever-growing presence of tourists suddenly ceased. This situation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the environmental effects of restrictions on VOCs load in the Lagoon. 17 contaminants became not detectable after the lockdown period. The statistical analysis indicated that the amounts of many other contaminants significantly dropped. The presence of 9 analytes was not statistically influenced by the lockdown restrictions, probably because of their stronger persistence or continuous input in the environment from diverse sources. Results signify a sharp and encouraging pollution decrease at the molecular level, concomitant with the anthropogenic stress release, even if it is not possible to attribute quantitatively the VOCs load variations to specific sources (e.g., tourists' habits, urban water traffic, plastic pollution).","Cecchi, Teresa",Sci Total Environ,,502

480701,The role of nurse managers during the new coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Purpose of Review: The goal of this review is to provide a timely overview on efforts to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Recent Findings: Previous research efforts to develop a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine in the years following the 2003 pandemic have opened the door for investigators to design vaccine concepts and approaches for the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor. Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration. Besides this, a COVID-19 vaccine target product profile must address vaccinating at-risk human populations including frontline healthcare workers, individuals over the age of 60, and those with underlying and debilitating chronic conditions. Among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines, recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Summary: Each current vaccine strategy has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is paramount that multiple strategies be advanced quickly and then evaluated for safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the safety studies to minimize undesired immunopotentiation will become the most significant bottleneck in terms of time.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Strych, Ulrich; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Curr Trop Med Rep,,502
480734,Decreasing work-related movement during a pandemic. Location analytics and the implications of the digital divide,2021,"The recognition of ACE2 by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein mediates host cell entry. The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,502

Such situations require multidisciplinary crisis management teams (CMTs) at different administrative levels. However, most existing CMTs are trained for rather local and temporary emergencies but not for international and long-lasting crises. Moreover, CMT members in a pandemic face additional demands due to unknown characteristics of the disease and a highly volatile environment. To support and ensure the effectiveness of CMTs, we need to understand how CMT members can successfully cope with these multiple demands. Connecting teamwork research with the job demands and resources approach as starting framework, we conducted structured interviews and critical incident analyses with 144 members of various CMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Content analyses revealed both perceived demands as well as perceived resources in CMTs. Moreover, structuring work processes, open, precise and regular communication, and anticipatory, goal-oriented and fast problem solving were described as particularly effective behaviors in CMTs. We illustrate our findings in an integrated model and derive practical recommendations for the work and future training of CMTs.","Thielsch, Meinald T; Röseler, Stefan; Kirsch, Julia; Lamers, Christoph; Hertel, Guido",Applied psychology,,502

In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concen, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the e, or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to reported infected populations at the beginning of the first peak of the pandemic to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the individual regions (CCAA). The aim of this model it's to evaluate the confinement rate at the first stages of the epidemic outbreak in order to evaluate the scenarios that minimize the incidence but also the mortality. Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1 , 5 percent of the population, and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4 M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100 k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid and Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than half the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre-and post-intervention also begins to suggest a substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions. At last we show the real evolution of the pandemic up to the end of May and the beginning of July in order to calculate the real confinement rate from data to compare with the scenarios formulated at March.","López, Leonardo; Rodó, Xavier",Results Phys,,502

Home spirometers were distributed as part of objective patient assessment. Our aim was to assess patient satisfaction with the telehealth service in CF multidisciplinary clinic via online survey. Methods: All patients of the CF service were invited to complete an online survey designed to assess satisfaction with telehealth, which was undertaken through the consumer organization Cystic Fibrosis South Australia. A quantitatively driven concurrent mixed-methods design was chosen, with statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows v.26 and coding of unstructured responses to generate themes for thematic analysis. Results: To date 57 from a cohort of 160 patients (35.6%) completed the survey, with some item non-responses. 37/57 (64.9%) of participants were aged ≤35yo, 42/53 (80.7%) had 2 telehealth appointments, and 46/53 (86.7%) found it easy/very easy to access. 18/48 (37.5%) of participants had problems with audio/visual dropout. Despite this 48/52 (92.3%) felt satisfied or very satisfied that the CF team were engaged in their care via telehealth, with just under half utilizing a home spirometer at the time of the survey. 38/50 (76%) found that telehealth was more convenient than an in-person appointment with significant time saved. The thematic analysis added context and depth to analysis of the quantitative data by identification of six key themes of convenience, ease of access, maintaining the therapeutic relationship, comprehensive care, safety, and patient centred care. Conclusion: Most patients reported high satisfaction with telehealth and would like a hybrid clinic with the option of telehealth or in person review for clinics into the future.","Yeo, S.; Chapman, S.; Taylor, P.; Langrehr, J.; Lange, D.; Morton, J.",Respirology,,502

The COVID-19 pandemic created a new threat to this common ""slow to learn and adapt"" model in healthcare. We describe how UPMC committed to a rapid learning health system (LHS) model to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsAn observational cohort study was conducted among 11,429 hospitalized patients from 22 hospitals (PA, NY) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (March 19, 2020 - June 6, 2021). Sociodemographic and clinical data were captured from UPMC electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Patients were grouped into four time-defined patient ""waves"" based on nadir of daily hospital admissions, with wave 3 (September 20, 2020 - March 10, 2021) split at its zenith due to high volume with steep acceleration and deceleration. Outcomes included changes in clinical practice (e.g., use of corticosteroids, antivirals, and other therapies) in relation to timing of internal system analyses, scientific publications, and regulatory approvals, along with 30-day rate of mortality over time. ResultsMean (SD) daily number of hospital admissions was 26 (28) with a maximum 7-day moving average of 107 patients. System-wide implementation of the use of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab occurred within days of release of corresponding seminal publications and regulatory actions. After adjustment for differences in patient clinical profiles over time, each month of hospital admission was associated with an estimated 5% lower odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted OR = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.92 - 0.97, p < .001). ConclusionsIn our large LHS, near real-time changes in clinical management of COVID-19 patients happened promptly as scientific publications and regulatory approvals occurred throughout the pandemic. Alongside these changes, patients with COVID-19 experienced lower adjusted 30-day mortality following hospital admission over time.","McCreary, Erin J.; Kip, Kevin E; Bariola, J.

Next, we shall pay attention to age-structure modeling to emphasis the role of age-group individuals on the disease spread. A Model with constant delay is also formulated to show the impact of the latency period on the severity of COVID-19. Since there is evidence that for COVID-19 disease, important relationships exist between what is happening in the host and what is occurring at the population level, we shall link the basic model to in-host dynamics through the so-called threshold-type delay models.

Their diagnosis and treatment create severe impact on the quality of life (QOL). We chose to study such patients because we were already reporting these cancers to the Indian Council of Medical Research as part of project titled ""Pattern of care and survival studies."" Aims: The aim of the study is to assess and compare QOL of H and N cancer patients before and after the completion of cancer-directed treatment (CDT). Settings and Design: The present study was a hospital-based study conducted in the tertiary care hospital of Jammu with longitudinal study design. Subjects and Methods: All newly diagnosed HNC patients registered with the Department of Radiotherapy and ENT on inpatient or outpatient basis were included over a period of 6 months. Each patient was followed for 4-6 weeks after the completion of CDT. QOL was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ C30) (general) and EORTC QLQ H and N-35 (specific) questionnaires. Statistical Analysis: Paired t-test was calculated to compare pre- and postmean scores. Pre- and post-Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient was also calculated. Results: The most frequent site was larynx followed by the oral cavity. Regarding both EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire and Global health status and EORTC H and N-35 specific questionnaires, the mean scores across all domains showed worsening of QoL from their baseline. The worsening was more severe in emotional function (functional scale), while physical, cognitive, and social functions were comparatively less affected. Pain, swallowing, speech, and mouth problems were most worsened. Conclusions: QoL showed worsening after CDT in all domains due to acute and subacute adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in treatment course.","Bashir, Abroo; Kumar, Dinesh; Dewan, Deepika; Sharma, Rahul",J Cancer Res Ther,,502

483563,Tracking and modeling public perceptions toward the reality of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria,2021,"Background: A pneumonia outbreak of unknown etiology took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and spread quickly worldwide in December 2019. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified a novel beta-coronavirus called 2019-nCoV, now officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) that is responsible for the pandemic. The coronavirus COVID-19 affected 215 countries and territories around the world and more than 99 hundred thousand people at present (Nature Nanotechnology, 2020). At present, there are no specific vaccines or treatments available for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. At this time the experts recommend precautions such as social distancing, hand washing, and wearing face masks to reduce disease transmission. This review article aims to improve the readers' awareness towards the important role of mobile technology for SARS-CoV-2. Methodology: To achieve this objective, we performed a COVID-19 literature review from various sources that include data from the published articles as well as World Health Organization reports on coronavirus disease and how mobile technology is useful to fight against this disease. Results: Mobile technology can be helpful in mapping disease spread and provides an easy way to provide awareness that promotes safety and adoption of necessary precautions to mitigate and stop community transmission. Conclusion: The spread rate of COVID-19 is very high and until now no vaccines are available to control this disease. To this end we should leverage other avenues such as digital technologies to protect ourselves from this disease. Mobile technology such as smartphones are playing an important role in this pandemic, by launching apps to track coronavirus infected people.

The results show that the social representation is organized around five potentially central descriptive, anxiety-provoking and globally negative elements. But death and contagion are the only stable and structuring elements. The other elements vary according to the reason attributed to the object of fear. Depending on how individuals attribute the origin of the virus, social representations of it vary not only in terms of their content but also in terms of their structure. These results indicate how important it is to consider the perceptions that individuals share about the human (vs non-human) and intentional (vs unintentional) origin of an object of fear in the analysis of their representation of that object.","Rateau, Patrick; Tavani, Jean Louis; Delouvée, Sylvain",Health (London),,502
483681,The impact of social capital and collaborative knowledge creation on e-business proactiveness and organizational agility in responding to the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"At present, COVID-19 is raging all over the world. Many comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.91-3.74) and hypertension (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.76-3.00), have been shown to worsen the patient's condition. However, whether cardio-cerebrovascular disease will affect COVID-19 remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we collected studies from PubMed, Wed of Science and CNKI (Chinese) to July 25, which reported COVID-19 patients with and without cardio-cerebrovascular disease as well as their severity and mortality. The random-effect model meta-analysis was used to analyze them and get overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and the Begg's and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias. Thirty-one studies with 23,632 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed an OR of 3.004 (95% CI = 2.097-4.303) for COVID-19 severity and an OR of 5.587 (95% CI = 2.810-11.112) for COVID-19 mortality. Compared with cardiovascular disease, the subgroup analysis indicated that cerebrovascular disease was more likely to increase the severity (OR = 3.400, 95% CI = 1.569-7.368) and mortality (OR = 23.477, 95% CI = 3.050-180.735) of COVID-19. Therefore, it can be inferred that cardio-cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increase in the risk of severe illness and death among COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis showed that cardio-cerebrovascular disease has a significant relation with severe and death outcomes of COVID-19. Nurses should pay special attention to COVID-19 patients with the cardio-cerebrovascular disease.","Yu, Jia-Ning; Wu, Bing-Bing; Yang, Jie; Lei, Xiao-Ling; Shen, Wang-Qin",Biol Res Nurs,,502

Thus, new ideas for an appropriated assessment of patients' condition and clinical treatment are of utmost importance. Therefore, in this study, the laboratory parameters of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were evaluated to identify the correlation between cytokine expression and other laboratory parameters. METHODS: A retrospective and single-center study was performed in Wuhan, involving 83 severe or critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory parameters in ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2 were collected. The association between parameters was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 66 years (IQR, 57-73), and 55 (66%) were men. Among the 83 patients, 61 (73%) had 1 or more coexisting medical condition. The median concentration of IL-2R, IL-6, IL8, IL10, and TNF&#945; were above the normal range, without IL-1ß. A significant negative correlation between IL-6 and platelet count was discovered (r2 = -0.448, P < 0.001) as well as a significant correlation between IL-6 and other platelet parameters. Finally, a correlation between multiple cytokines and coagulation indicators was found, pro-inflammatory factors were found to be more associated to coagulation parameters, with the highest correlation between IL-6 and the International normalized ratio (INR) (r2 = 0.444, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, IL-6 seems more relevant in the evaluation of the condition of COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Dong; Zhou, Xiang; Yan, Songxin; Tian, Ran; Su, Longxiang; Ding, Xin; Xiao, Meng; Chen, Yu; Zhao, Hua; Chen, Huan; Zhang, Hongmin; Li, Zunzhu; Li, Qi; Xu, Yingchun; Yan, Xiaowei; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Clin Chim Acta,,502

Data sources: We will conduct searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. The search will cover the period until the day before submission to a journal. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We will include randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Randomized trials evaluating the sexual transmission of other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and non-randomized studies in COVID-19 will be searched if no direct evidence from randomized trials is found or if the direct evidence provides a low to a very low level of certainty for critical outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen each study for eligibility, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses and use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit the review if the conclusions change or if there are substantial updates.

Therefore, we explored real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination on subsequent infection in IBD patients with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration with IBD diagnosed prior to 12/18/20, the start date of the VHA patient vaccination program. IBD medication exposures included 5-aminosalicylic acid, thiopurines, anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, tofacitinib, methotrexate, and corticosteroid use. We used inverse probability weighting and Cox regression with vaccination status as a time-updating exposure, and computed vaccine effectiveness from incidence rates. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 14,697 patients, 7,321 of whom received at least one vaccine dose (45.2% Pfizer, 54.8% Moderna). The cohort had median age 68 years, was 92.2% male, 80.4% white, and 61.8% with ulcerative colitis. In follow-up data through April 20, 2021, unvaccinated individuals had the highest raw proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection (197 [1.34%] versus 7 [0.11%] fully vaccinated). Full vaccination status, but not partial vaccination status, was associated with a 69% reduced hazard of infection relative to an unvaccinated status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.56, p<0.001), corresponding to an 80.4% effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Full vaccination (>7 days after the 2nd dose) against SARS-CoV-2 infection has an approximately 80.4% effectiveness in a broad IBD cohort with diverse exposure to immunosuppressive medications. These results may serve to increase patient and provider willingness to pursue vaccination in these settings.","Khan, Nabeel; Mahmud, Nadim",Gastroenterology,,502

Several significant decisions were made to postpone or cancel major swimming events by FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation). Swimmers were no longer allowed to continue their usual training in swimming pools and were confined to their homes. These unusual circumstances may represent a good opportunity to strengthen different areas of swimmer preparation and potentially enhance performance when resuming regular aquatic training. We searched major databases for relevant information, and the present article provides practical information on home-based training for swimmers of all ages. The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences on the swimming community have created a myriad of challenges for swimmers around the world, including maintaining their fitness level and preparing to return optimally and safely to pool training and competitions. Unfortunately, the mental consequences that might arise after the pandemic may also have an impact.

Consequently, people's mobility and physical activity are limited in addition to a negative psychosocial effect. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 crisis on short-term weight loss and the remission of obesity-associated comorbidities in patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: A case-control study was conducted comparing percentage of total weight loss (%TWL), excess weight lost (%EWL), and the remission rate of obesity-related comorbidities at the first postoperative year between patients who underwent primary SG between June 2019 and October 2019 (1-year postoperative period affected by COVID-19 lockdown; COV-group), and a control group operated between June 2018 and October 2018 (1-year postoperative period not affected by COVID-19 lockdown; CONTROL-group). RESULTS: In total, 45 patients from COV-group were compared to 57 patients from CONTROL-group. Demographic data were similar between groups. The follow-up rate at 1 year was 100%. The mean %TWL and %EWL was lower at 28.2 ± 12.7% and 67.6 ± 23.5% in COV-group patients compared to 34.3 ± 14.1% and 78.3 ± 27.2% in CONTROL-group patients at 1 year from SG (p=0.025 and p=0.036, respectively). The remission rate of obesity-related comorbidities at 1 year from SG including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was 57.1%, 60.0%, 71.4%, and 41.7% in COV-group and 66.7%, 72.4%, 85.3%, and 52.9% in CONTROL-group, respectively, without any statistically significant difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on weight loss in the first year after SG. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results, and we are expecting for a longer follow-up to evaluate the long-term impact on weight loss and comorbidities.","El Moussaoui, Imad; Navez, Julie; El Moussaoui, Kamal; Barea-Fernandez, Marie; Schaeken, Anne; Closset, Jean",Obes. surg,,502

The pandemic has underlined the severity of known challenges in research and surfaced new ones, but also accelerated the adoption of innovations and manifested new opportunities. This review considers early trends emerging from meta-research on COVID-19. In particular, it focuses on the following topics: i) mapping COVID-19 research; ii) data and machine learning; iii) research practices including open access and open data, reviewing, publishing and funding; iv) communicating research to the public; v) the impact of COVID-19 on researchers, in particular with respect to gender and career trajectories. This overview finds that most early meta-research on COVID-19 has been reactive and focused on short-term questions, while more recently a shift to consider the long-term consequences of COVID-19 is taking place. Based on these findings, the author speculates that some aspects of doing research during COVID-19 are more likely to persist than others. These include: the shift to virtual for academic events such as conferences; the use of openly accessible pre-prints; the `datafication' of scholarly literature and consequent broader adoption of machine learning in science communication; the public visibility of research and researchers on social and online media.","Colavizza, Giovanni",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02961v1.pdf,502

We hypothesized that firearm purchases and violence would increase surrounding the pandemic. This study determined the impact of COVID-19 and shelter-in-place (SIP) orders on firearm purchases and incidents in the United States (US) and New York State (NYS). METHODS: Scatterplots reflected trends in firearm purchases, incidents, and deaths over a 16-month period (January 2019 to April 2020). Bivariate comparisons of SIP and non-SIP jurisdictions before and after SIP (February 2020 vs. April 2020) and April 2020 vs. April 2019 were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The incidence of COVID-19 in the US increased between February and April 2020 from 24 to 1 067 660 and in NYS from 0 to 304 372. When comparing February to March to April in the US, firearm purchases increased 33.6% then decreased 22.0%, whereas firearm incidents increased 12.2% then again increased by 3.6% and firearm deaths increased 23.8% then decreased in April by 3.8%. In NYS, comparing February to March to April 2020, firearm purchases increased 87.6% then decreased 54.8%, firearm incidents increased 110.1% then decreased 30.8%, and firearm deaths increased 57.1% then again increased by 6.1%. In both SIP and non-SIP jurisdictions, April 2020 firearm purchases, incidents, deaths, and injuries were similar to April 2019 and February 2020 (all P = NS). DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease 2019-related stressors may have triggered an increase in firearm purchases nationally and within NYS in March 2020. Firearm incidents also increased in NYS.

493184,Professionalism revisited during the pandemics of our time: COVID-19 and racism,2021,"Cholesterol has been reported in a number of studies to play an essential role in the effectiveness of viral infection in mammal cells. The main characteristic of cholesterol that is involved in viral infection is its capability to afford negative curvature to the membrane. This faculty of cholesterol has to do with the necessary steep curvature that the host cell membrane undergoes in the primary processes of viral infection. In particular, for RNA enveloped viruses, membrane curvature is involved in two mechanisms of the viral infection, which are virus and host cell membrane fusion for viral genome release and virus reproduction scaffold build-up. Low cholesterol diets have been shown to reduce or even suppress virus infection efficiency in murine models or cell cultures;but to what extent a diet-based lowering of the blood cholesterol level may help preventing virus infection still lacks enough scientific evidence. The use of statins in individuals with hypercholesterolemia has been recommended in the recent COVID-19 outbreak.

493630,Identity of a disease social epistemology and epidemiology in light of covid-19,2020,"Alterations in environmentally sensitive epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) influence axonal regeneration in the spinal cord following sharp injury. Conventional DNA methylation detection methods using sodium bisulphite treatment do not distinguish between methylated and hydroxymethylated forms of cytosine, meaning that past studies report a composite of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). To identify the distinct contributions of DNA methylation modifications to axonal regeneration, we collected spinal cord tissue after sharp injury from untreated adult F3 male rats with enhanced regeneration of injured spinal axons or controls, derived from folate- or water-treated F0 lineages, respectively. Genomic DNA was profiled for genome-wide 5hmC levels, revealing 658 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs). Genomic profiling with whole genome bisulphite sequencing disclosed regeneration-related alterations in composite 5mC + 5hmC DNA methylation levels at 2,260 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). While pathway analyses revealed that differentially hydroxymethylated and methylated genes are linked to biologically relevant axon developmental pathways, only 22 genes harbour both DhMR and DMRs. Since these differential modifications were more than 60 kilobases on average away from each other, the large majority of differential hydroxymethylated and methylated regions are unique with distinct functions in the axonal regeneration phenotype. These data highlight the importance of distinguishing independent contributions of 5mC and 5hmC levels in the central nervous system, and denote discrete roles for DNA methylation modifications in spinal cord injury and regeneration in the context of transgenerational inheritance.","Madrid, Andy; Borth, Laura E; Hogan, Kirk J; Hariharan, Nithya; Papale, Ligia A; Alisch, Reid S; Iskandar, Bermans J",Epigenetics,,502

A large percentage of chronically mentally ill individuals have low HL. They are also at increased risk for hospital readmission and poor self-management skills. This study examined the HL of adult patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder, investigated the relationship between HL and psychiatric hospital readmission, and identified differences in readmission rates between HL groups. A prospective, exploratory, descriptive research design was used to examine readmission rates among 30 adult patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder: 16 men (mean age = 37 years, SD ± 12.16) and 14 women (mean age = 41.36 years, SD ± 12.51). The study used an HL questionnaire at or near discharge, and 2- and 4-weeks postdischarge readmissions were tracked. HL strongly correlated with 2-week and total readmissions. The findings support the feasibility of assessing HL further in this patient population, validate the procedure for subsequent studies, and provide preliminary data on the relationship between HL and readmission. The findings may also be useful for patient education, discharge planning, and policy making. [J Contin Educ Nurs. 2021;52(2):90-99.].","Lewin, Edna M",J Contin Educ Nurs,,502

495859,Equity and fairness in a pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus confers a risk of significant coagulopathy, with the resulting development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), potentially contributing to the morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","Obi, Andrea T; Barnes, Geoffrey D; Napolitano, Lena M; Henke, Peter K; Wakefield, Thomas W",J.

BACKGROUND: New Zealand's nursing workforce is becoming increasingly multicultural as foreign nurses make up an essential part of the New Zealand health workforce. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the contributions that nurses have made in providing front-line services to the public. However, little has been documented about challenges and experiences of this minority ethnic group-Chinese nurses-who have been working as registered nurses in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study used an anonymous online questionnaire and a thematic approach to establishing understandings of the experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity in working through the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 51 Chinese nurses completed this survey. A self-explanatory checklist for reporting results of Internet e-surveys (CHERRIES) was used for the purpose of the quality of this online survey. RESULTS: The result showed that 47.06% participants (n = 24) reported negative experiences including racial discrimination, workplace bullying and judgement, while 52.94% (n = 27) participants reported positive working experiences including supports received in the workplace and positive recognition by the pubic in New Zealand. CONCLUSION: Ethnic minority nurses are key assets to the New Zealand health system. It is important to understand their experiences and challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure they are supported and protected from any physical and emotional injury. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID-19 has brought additional challenges and concerns to nurses who are working on the front line of health services. Having knowledge of nurses' working experiences will help with their job satisfaction and has potential implications for the sustainability of the New Zealand nursing workforce and retention strategies to address nursing workforce shortages which is foreseeable in New Zealand.","Song, Jenny; McDonald, Christine",J. clin. nurs,,502

TAVR offers many advantages, however, the safe anchoring of the transcatheter heart valve (THV) in the patients anatomy is key to a successful procedure. In this paper, we develop and apply a novel immersogeometric fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for the modeling and simulation of the TAVR procedure to study the anchoring ability of the THV. To account for physiological realism, methods are proposed to model and couple the main components of the system, including the arterial wall, blood flow, valve leaflets, skirt, and frame. The THV is first crimped and deployed into an idealized ascending aorta. During the FSI simulation, the radial outward force and friction force between the aortic wall and the THV frame are examined over the entire cardiac cycle. The ratio between these two forces is computed and compared with the experimentally estimated coefficient of friction to study the likelihood of valve migration.","Wu, Michael C H; Muchowski, Heather M; Johnson, Emily L; Rajanna, Manoj R; Hsu, Ming-Chen",Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering,,502

METHODS: We collected data from 400 toilet facilities that were open to the public: all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around other parts of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. RESULTS: Of the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for handwashing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19-related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used for contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic handwashing signage in 1.8%. The handwashing water had 'no-touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets, and 18.5% of toilets had no-touch bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage that would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). This new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47;95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water, at the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey. CONCLUSIONS: Although handwashing is probably a much less critical COVID-19 control intervention than reducing aerosol transmission, it should still be strongly supported. Yet this survey found multiple deficiencies with handwashing amenities at public toilets and only modest improvements since a previous survey.","Wilson, N.; Thomson, G.",New Zealand Medical Journal,,502

SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard but requires a certified laboratory infrastructure with high-cost equipment and trained personnel. However, for large-scale testing, diagnostics should be fast, cost-effective, widely available, and deployed for the community, such as serological tests based on lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for IgM/IgG detection. We evaluated three different commercial point-of-care (POC) LFIAs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in capillary whole blood of 100 healthcare workers (HCW) from São Paulo university hospital previously tested by RT-PCR: (1) COVID-19 IgG/IgM BIO (Bioclin, Brazil), (2) Diagnostic Kit for IgM/IgG Antibody to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Livzon, China), and (3) SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo, China).

500808,A Big-Data Driven Approach to Analyzing and Modeling Human Mobility Trend under Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported developing commonly in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and could increase the risk of poor outcomes in these patients. We design this study to explore the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) on predicting AKI and construct risk score for predicting AKI in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between January 30 and February 24, 2020, were included. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to identify the strongest predictors of AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to find independent risk factors for AKI and construct risk score using odds ratio (OR) value of those risk factors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was calculated to evaluate the predictive value of single PCT level and the constructed risk score. RESULTS: Among 389 included COVID-19 patients, 28 (7.2%) patients developed AKI. LASSO regression showed hypertension, saturation of arterial oxygen (SaO2 ), PCT, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were the strongest predictors for AKI. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, only SaO2 (<0.001), PCT (p = 0.004), and BUN (p = 0.005) were independently associated with development of AKI in COVID-19 patients. The AUC of single PCT and constructed risk score was 0. 881 and 0.928, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCT level is correlated with AKI in COVID-19 patients. The efficient risk score consisted of SaO2 , PCT, and BUN is readily accessible for physicians to evaluate the possibility of AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Ruo Ran; He, Min; Kang, Yan",J Clin Lab Anal,,502

501967,An interaction effect of perceived government response on COVID-19 and government agency's use of ICT in building trust among citizens of Pakistan,2021,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is one of the typical treatments used for patients with prostate cancer (PCa). ADT, however, may fail when PCa develops castration-resistance. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a critical enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis, is found to be upregulated in PCa. Since enzalutamide and ADT are frequently used for the treatment of PCa, this study aimed to unravel the underlying mechanism of combination of orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, and enzalutamide using PC3 cell line; and orlistat and castration in PC3 tumor-bearing animal model. Cytotoxicity was determined by AlamarBlue assay. Drug effects on the cell cycle and protein expressions were assayed by the flow cytometry and Western blot. Electromobility shift assay was used to evaluate the NF-&#954;B activity. The tumor growth delay, expressions of the signaling-related proteins, and histopathology post treatments of orlistat and castration were evaluated in PC3 tumor-bearing mouse model. The results showed that orlistat arrested the PC3 cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of enzalutamide synergistically. Pretreatment with orlistat combined with castration inhibited the tumor growth significantly compared with those of castration and orlistat treatments alone in PC3 tumor-bearing mice. Combination treatment reduced both fatty acid synthase and NF-&#954;B activities and their downstream effector proteins. The present study demonstrated the synergistic effects of orlistat combined with enzalutamide in vitro and castration in vivo on human prostate cancer.","Tyan, Yeu-Sheng; Lee, Yen-Po; Chuang, Hui-Yen; Wang, Wei-Hsun; Hwang, Jeng-Jong",Biosci. rep,,502

We, therefore, estimated the incidence of reactivation among individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and determined its predictors. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with COVID-19 were followed up for at least 14 days after two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results obtained &#8805;24â¯h apart, and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 109 patients, 29 (27%) experienced reactivation, and seven (24%) of these were symptomatic. The mean period for the real-time PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive results was 17 days. Compared with patients without reactivation, those with reactivation were significantly younger and more likely to have a lymphocyte count of <1500/µL (odds ratio [OR]: 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.94) and two or fewer symptoms (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07-0.55) during the initial episode.

Methods: This study prospectively enrolled 594 patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed RSV, hMPV, or influenza infections over three consecutive influenza seasons at a tertiary hospital in China. Results: While certain clinical features were of value as predictors of infection type, none exhibited good predictive performance as a means of discriminating between these three infections (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve < 0.70).

The outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei province in China. The patients presented clinical symptoms of dry cough, fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging. By February 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognized and designated this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 uses the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), used by SARS-CoV to infect humans. One hypothesis of SARSCoV-2 origin indicates that it is likely that bats serve as reservoir hosts for SARSCoV-2, being the intermediate host not yet determined. The predominant route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from human to human. As of May 10th 2020, the number of worldwide confirmed COVID-19 cases is over 4 million, while the number of global deaths is around 279.000 people.

504088,Covid-19 Pandemic and Food Waste: An Empirical Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: To minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission, an ambulant screening protocol for COVID-19 in patients before admission to the hospital was implemented, combining the SARS CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal swab, a chest computed tomography (CT) and assessment of clinical symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluatethe diagnostic yield and the proportionality of this pre-procedural screeningprotocol. METHODS: In this mono-centre, prospective, cross-sectional study, all patients admitted to the hospital between 22nd April 2020 until 14th May 2020 for semi-urgent surgery, haematological or oncological treatment, or electrophysiological investigationunderwent a COVID-19 screening 2 days before their procedure. At a 2-week follow-up, the presence of clinical symptoms was evaluated by telephone as a post-hoc evaluation of the screening approach.Combined positive RT-PCR assay and/or positive chest CT was used as gold standard. Post-procedural outcomes of all patients diagnosed positive for COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: In total,528 patients were included of which 20 (3.8%) were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive and 508 (96.2%) as COVID-19 negative. 11 (55.0%) of COVID-19 positive patients had only a positive RT-PCR assay, 3 (15.0%) had only a positive chest CT and 6 (30%) had both a positive RT-PCR assay and chest CT. 10 out of 20 (50.0%) COVID-19 positive patients reported no single clinical symptom at the screening. At 2 week follow-up, 50% of these patients were still asymptomatic. 37.5% of all COVID-19 negative patients were symptomatic at screening. In the COVID-19 negative group without symptoms at screening, 78 (29.3%) patients developed clinical symptoms at a 2-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that routine chest CT and assessment of self-reported symptoms have limited value in the preprocedural COVID-19 screening due to low sensitivity and/or specificity.","Stessel, Björn; Callebaut, Ina; Polus, Fréderic; Geebelen, Laurien; Evers, Stefan; Ory, Jean-Paul; Magerman, Koen; Souverijns, Geert; Braeken, Geert; Ramaekers, Dirk; Cox, Janneke",Ann Med,,502

However, the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we identify a gene regulatory and character identity network defining the deutocerebral-tritocerebral boundary (DTB) in Drosophila This network comprises genes homologous to those directing midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) formation in vertebrates and their closest chordate relatives. Genetic tracing reveals that the embryonic DTB gives rise to adult midbrain circuits that in flies control auditory and vestibular information processing and motor coordination, as do MHB-derived circuits in vertebrates. DTB-specific gene expression and function are directed by cis-regulatory elements of developmental control genes that include homologs of mammalian Zinc finger of the cerebellum and Purkinje cell protein 4 Drosophila DTB-specific cis-regulatory elements correspond to regulatory sequences of human ENGRAILED-2, PAX-2, and DACHSHUND-1 that direct MHB-specific expression in the embryonic mouse brain. We show that cis-regulatory elements and the gene networks they regulate direct the formation and function of midbrain circuits for balance and motor coordination in insects and mammals. Regulatory mechanisms mediating the genetic specification of cephalic neural circuits in arthropods correspond to those in chordates, thereby implying their origin before the divergence of deuterostomes and ecdysozoans.","Bridi, Jessika C; Ludlow, Zoe N; Kottler, Benjamin; Hartmann, Beate; Vanden Broeck, Lies; Dearlove, Jonah; Göker, Markus; Strausfeld, Nicholas J; Callaerts, Patrick; Hirth, Frank",Proc.

505217,Unprecedented Crisis Calls for Unprecedented Policy Responses,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is suspected that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at greater risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to disability and immunotherapy. The relationship between MS and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uncertain. The aim of the study was to collect and analyze this relationship. METHODS: All MS patients of the Neurological Outpatient Clinic in Zabrze, Poland, were regularly questioned for the symptoms of COVID-19 and contact with an infected person. Patients that presented with COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed contact with an infected person were referred for the COVID-19 test. All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 41) were included in the analysis. Medical records of the study group were analyzed. Patient condition was monitored in the outpatient clinic after recovery. In 26 subjects, additional examinations, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroneurography (ENG), electroencephalography (EEG), color duplex Doppler (CDD), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) and psychological assessment were performed following recovery. RESULTS: Only one patient required hospitalization during COVID-19 infection, whereas 87.80% of patients did not require treatment for COVID-19. In all patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were below 10 mg/L. In 2.44% of patients, oxygen partial pressure was below 95%. In most MS patients, the results of further examinations after COVID-19 infection were similar to those prior to infection. Psychological assessment revealed that anxiety was found in 42.31% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: A mild course of COVID-19 in MS patients seems common despite disease-modifying drug treatment and disability. Self-isolation is recommended to reduce the number of infected patients. COVID-19 infection did not worsen the course of MS in most subjects. Patients with MS may require additional psychological support during the pandemic due to their susceptibility to anxiety.","Nowak-Kiczmer, Maria; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Niedziela, Natalia; Adamczyk, Bozena; Wierzbicki, Krzysztof; Bartman, Wojciech; Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,502

The results are based on a comprehensive literature search of all literature on this topic and our own experience in the treatment of patients with smell and taste disorders since the beginning of the pandemic. Current study results indicate that clinically less affected Covid-19 patients without inpatient treatment and who do not require ventilation often have disorders of the chemosensory system. In young patients and women in particular, they seem to be an indicator of a favorable prognosis for the course of the disease. Smell disorders can appear early, as the sole symptom or together with other symptoms of Covid-19 disease. It has not yet been clarified whether ageusia can occur independently or whether it is also felt in the context of anosmia. In the pandemic, the new occurrence of anosmia without congestion/obstruction/runny nose is probably an expression of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 and should always give rise to quarantine and testing for SARS-CoV-2. The smell disorder in Covid-19 mostly seems to be temporary;It is not yet possible to conclusively assess whether there is usually a full restitution.

Die Ergebnisse basieren auf einer umfassenden Literaturrecherche samtlicher Literatur zu diesem Thema und eigenen Erfahrungen in der Behandlung von Patienten mit Riech- und Schmeckstorungen seit dem Beginn der Pandemie. Bisherige Studienergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass klinisch gering betroffene Covid-19-Patienten ohne stationare Behandlungs- und Beatmungspflicht haufig Storungen der Chemosensorik aufweisen. Insbesondere bei jungen Patienten und Frauen scheinen sie ein Indikator einer gunstigen Prognose des Krankheitsverlaufs zu sein. Riechstorungen konnen fruh, isoliert oder als eines von mehreren Symptomen einer Covid-19-Erkrankung auftreten. Ob eine Ageusie eigenstandig auftreten kann oder aber im Rahmen der Anosmie mit empfunden wird, ist noch nicht geklart. In der Pandemie ist das neue Auftreten einer Anosmie ohne Kongestion/Obstruktion/Schnupfen wahrscheinlich Ausdruck einer Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 und sollte stets zu Quarantane und Testung auf SARS-CoV-2 Anlass geben. Die Riechstorung bei Covid- 19 scheint meist vorubergehend zu sein;ob es regelhaft zu einer vollstandigen Restitution kommt, kann noch nicht abschliesend beurteilt werden.

The dynamics consists of a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model based on the logarithmic Caputo fractional derivative. We find an approximate analytical solution for this model which represents an upper bound for the fractional SI dynamics on a network. This upper bound is expressed in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function of the adjacency matrix of the network of inter-amino acids interactions. We consider some network descriptors based on these Mittaf-Leffler matrix functions which account for the""circulability""and""transmissibility""of the perturbations across the residues of a protein. We then apply this model and descriptors to the analysis of the communication effects produced by inhibitors of the main protease of COVID-19. We find that the perturbation produced by strong inhibitors of the protease are propagated up to 60{\AA} away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of intra-protein communication. These findings may help to the design of drug candidates against this new coronavirus.","Abadias, Luciano; Estrada-Rodriguez, Gissell; Estrada, Ernesto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11260v1.pdf,502

In this case study, we present an 8-year-old girl presenting with HSP-induced myocarditis and thrombus in the right atrium and HSP nephritis. To date, 15 cases of HSP-related cardiac involvement have been reported in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. These cases, together with our case, are included in this review. We excluded those patients with other rheumatologic diseases (acute rheumatic fever, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Kawasaki disease) accompanied by HSP. Three were children and 13 were adults and all were male except our case. This review revealed tachyarrhythmia, chest pain, dyspnea, murmur, and heart failure as the major signs. Cardiac tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and imaging methods (echocardiography in all patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three, cardiac biopsy in one, and post-mortem necropsy in three) showed that the cardiac involvements were pericardial effusion, intra-atrial thrombus, myocarditis, coronary artery changes, myocardial ischemia, infarction and necrosis, subendocardial hemorrhage, and left ventricular dilatation. Kidney involvement was not observed in three patients. As the treatment, high-dose prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, oral corticosteroid, azathioprine, nadroparin calcium, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics were used. Eleven patients (all three children and eight of the adults) had a complete cardiac recovery. Cardiac involvement in adults was more likely to be fatal.

These considerations should include how to manufacture billions of doses of high-quality vaccines, support for vaccine purchase, coordination of supply, the equitable distribution of vaccines and the logistics of global vaccine delivery, all of which are a prelude to a massive vaccination campaign targeting people of all ages. Furthermore, additional scientific questions about the vaccines remain that should be answered to improve vaccine efficacy, including questions regarding the optimization of vaccination regimens, booster doses, the correlates of protection, vaccine effectiveness, safety and enhanced surveillance. The timely and coordinated execution of these post-efficacy tasks will bring the pandemic to an effective, and efficient, close.","Kim, Jerome H; Marks, Florian; Clemens, John D",Nat Med,,502
508706,Share mobile and social-media data to curb COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study sought to understand issues facing people with epilepsy (PWE) during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 20-question survey that used SeziureTracker.com, sent to eligible PWE and their caregivers on May 6th, 2020. Questions about demographics and medical history were used to calculate COVID mortality risk odds ratios (OR) compared to a low baseline risk group. RESULTS: In total, 505 responses were collected. Of these, 71% reported no change in seizure rates and 25% reported an increase in seizures, which they attributed primarily to disrupted sleep (63%) and decreased exercise (42%). Mortality risks from COVID-19 had median OR of 1.67, ranging 1.00-906.98. Fear about hospitalization (53%) and concern for loved ones (52%) were prominent concerns. Of the respondents, 5% reported stopping or reducing anti-seizure medications due to problems communicating with doctors, access or cost. Lower-risk COVID patients reported more fear of hospitalization (55% versus 38%, p<0.001) and anxiety about medication access (43% versus 28%, p=0.03) compared with higher-risk COVID patients. Increased anxiety was reported in 47%, and increased depression in 28%. Ten percent without generalized convulsions and 8% with did not know anything about epilepsy devices (VNS, RNS, DBS). SIGNIFICANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to PWE, including increased seizure rates, problems with access and cost of life-saving medications. Those with lower COVID-19 risk may have been marginalized more than those with higher risk. Efforts to protect PWE during major public health emergencies should take these findings into account.","Casassa, Charles; Moss, Robert; Goldenholz, Daniel M",Epileptic Disord,,502
508778,Role of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for COVID-19 in Cruise Tourists’ Decision-Making Process: An Extended Model of Goal-Directed Behavior,2021,"The proteoglycan versican (VCAN) plays a complex role in cancer. The expression of this molecule has been related to invasion and progression in malignant mixed tumors, such as carcinoma in mixed tumors (CMT) of the canine mammary gland. In addition, its interaction with surface cell receptors EGFR, HER-2 and CD44 in malignant epithelial cells may be responsible for proliferation and cellular motility in early stages of cancer. We comparatively evaluated the expression of this proteoglycan and its receptors in in situ and invasive areas of simple carcinomas (SC) and CMT to investigate similarities and differences between these histological types. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-VCAN, anti-CD44, anti-EGFR and anti-HER-2 antibodies in 32 cases of SC or CMT. VCAN was highly expressed in stroma adjacent to invasive areas in SC and CMT. CMTs presented comparatively higher expression of VCAN in stroma adjacent to in situ and in invasive areas than in corresponding areas in SCs. In CMT, EGFR and HER-2 expressions were higher in situ compared to invasive areas. In contrast, increased CD44 and EGFR expression was found in invasive areas in SC compared to CMT. These results indicate that versican expression is similarly associated with invasiveness in SC and CMT, however higher levels were seen in CMT suggesting that the presence of myoepithelial proliferation in this tumor type participates in stromal composition and promoting an increase in the expression of versican.","Figuerêdo, S H; Neto, R S Carmo; Ferreira, E; Cassali, G D; Estrela-Lima, A; Damasceno, K A",Res Vet Sci,,502

509405,La continuité pédagogique à l'épreuve du Covid-19,2020,"COVID-19 has proven to be particularly challenging given the complex pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Early data have demonstrated how the host response to this novel coronavirus leads to the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, massive endothelial damage, and generalized vascular manifestations. While SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, other organ systems are also affected. SARS-CoV-2 relies on 2 host cell receptors for successful attachment: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2. Clinicopathologic reports have demonstrated associations between severe COVID-19 and viral coagulopathy, resulting in pulmonary embolism; venous, arterial, and microvascular thrombosis; lung endothelial injury; and associated thrombotic complications leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Viral coagulopathy is not novel given similar observations with SARS classic, including the consumption of platelets, generation of thrombin, and increased fibrin degradation product exhibiting overt disseminated intravascular coagulation-like syndrome. The specific mechanism(s) behind the thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients has yet to be fully understood. Parenteral anticoagulants, such as heparin and low-molecular-weights heparins, are widely used in the management of COVID-19 patients. Beyond the primary (anticoagulant) effects of these agents, they may exhibit antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects. Direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are also useful in the management of these patients. Tissue plasminogen activator and other fibrinolytic modalities may also be helpful in the overall management. Catheter-directed thrombolysis can be used in patients developing pulmonary embolism. Further investigations are required to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated thrombotic complications.","Kipshidze, Nickolas; Dangas, George; White, Christopher J; Kipshidze, Nodar; Siddiqui, Fakiha; Lattimer, Christopher R; Carter, Charles A; Fareed, Jawed",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,502
509962,Leadership and governance in a crisis: some reflections on COVID-19,2020,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate the advantages of preoperative digital design of skin flaps to repair fingertip defects during the COVID-19 pandemic. We combined digital design with a 3D-printed model of the affected finger for preoperative communication with fingertip defect patients under observation in a buffer ward. Methods: From December 2019 to January 2021, we obtained data from 25 cases of 30 fingertip defects in 15 males and 10 females, aged 20-65 years old (mean 35 ± 5 years). All cases were treated by digitally designing preoperative fingertip defect flaps combined with a 3D-printed model. Preoperative 3D Systems Sense scanning was routinely performed, 3-matic 12.0 was used to measure the fingertip defect area ranging from 1.5 cm × 3.5 cm to 2.0 cm × 5.0 cm, and the skin flap was designed. The flap area was 1.6 cm × 3.6 cm to 2.1 cm × 5.1 cm. CURA 15.02.1 was used to set parameters, and the 3D model of the affected finger was printed prior to the operation. Full-thickness skin grafts were taken from donor areas for repair. Results: No vascular crises occurred in any of the 25 cases, and all flaps survived. The postoperative follow-up occurred over 3-12 months. All patients were evaluated 3 months after operation according to the trial standard of hand function evaluation of the Chinese Hand Surgery Society. The results showed that 20 cases had excellent outcomes (80%), four cases had good outcomes (16%), and one case had a fair outcome (4%). The excellent and good rate was 96%. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fingertip defects were treated with preoperative digital design of fingertip defect flaps combined with 3D printing. Precision design saves surgery time and improves the success rate of surgery and the survival rates of skin flaps. In addition, 3D model simulations improve preoperative communication efficiency, and the personalized design improves patient satisfaction.","Lu, Hui; Peng, Hanshu; Peng, Ze; Liu, Dingxi; Wu, Qimei; Liu, Rong",Biomed Res Int,,502

In this work, we aim to discover drugs capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 through interaction modeling and statistical methods. Currently, many drug discovery approaches follow the typical protein structure-function paradigm, designing drugs to bind to fixed three-dimensional structures. However, in recent years such approaches have failed to address drug resistance and limit the set of possible drug targets and candidates. For these reasons we instead focus on targeting protein regions that lack a stable structure, known as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions are essential to numerous biological pathways that contribute to the virulence of various viruses. In this work, we discover eleven new SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates targeting IDRs and provide further evidence for the involvement of IDRs in viral processes such as enzymatic peptide cleavage while demonstrating the efficacy of our unique docking approach.","Mudide, Anish; Alterovitz, Gil",Pac Symp Biocomput,,502

512193,"Agriculture, transportation, and the COVID-19 crisis",2020,"INTRODUCTION: An epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5-92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8-74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9-80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0-30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7-51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1-9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2-21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Cardona-Ospina, Jaime A; Gutiérrez-Ocampo, Estefanía; Villamizar-Peña, Rhuvi; Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer; Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo; Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Franco-Paredes, Carlos; Henao-Martinez, Andrés F; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Lagos-Grisales, Guillermo J; Ramírez-Vallejo, Eduardo; Suárez, Jose A; Zambrano, Lysien I; Villamil-Gómez, Wilmer E; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J; Rabaan, Ali A; Harapan, Harapan; Dhama, Kuldeep; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Kataoka, Hiromitsu; Ahmad, Tauseef; Sah, Ranjit",Travel Med Infect Dis,,502

516282,Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on International Capital Markets,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This paper uses a social media platform, Reddit, to identify real-time experiences of people who use drugs during the COVID-19 lock-down. METHODS: Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related ""subreddits,"" communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users' posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time. RESULTS: The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809âposts/comments (3756âposts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256âposts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%). CONCLUSIONS: During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery. As the pandemic progresses, providers and policymakers should consider these experiences among people who use drugs during the early stage of the pandemic.","El-Bassel, Nabila; Hochstatter, Karli R; Slavin, Melissa N; Yang, Chenghao; Zhang, Yudong; Muresan, Smaranda",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,502
516506,The effect of COVID-19 on consumer shopping behaviour: Generational cohort perspective,2021,"Introduction: Although many vaccines are in development and clinical trials, and at least seven vaccines have been distributed worldwide, the world has faced a huge challenge in line with the willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in a different country including Ethiopia. However, no study has been conducted on the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, and determinants of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the adult population in Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 492 study participants from March 1 to March 15, 2021. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit study participants. Six skilled and qualified data collectors had participated to gather the data using a pretested structured-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant association. Results: This study revealed that the level of good knowledge, positive attitude and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively. Moreover, having an age ≥ 46 years with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.36 [95% CI, 1.09– 5.39], attended secondary and above education adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.52– 4.39], having a chronic disease adjusted odds ratio of 3.14 [95% CI, 1.21– 8.14], and having good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine adjusted odds ratio 2.59 [95% CI, 1.67– 4.02] were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: In this study, the level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and intention to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were 74%, 44.7%, and 62.6%, respectively.

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been implicated in an autosomal dominant form of PD with variable penetrance. The identification of a common LRRK2 variant (p.Gly2019Ser) in dementia with Lewy bodies indicated its potential role in Parkinsonian disorder. The current study was aimed to identify the p.Gly2019Ser variant in Indian patients with Parkinsonian disorder. Methods: The patient group consisting of 412 classical PD patients, 107 PD patients with cognitive impairment, 107 patients with Parkinson plus syndrome and 200 unrelated controls were recruited from eastern part of India. The allele representing p.Gly2019Ser variant was screened by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results: The p.Gly2019Ser variant was identified in an East Indian young-onset female PD patient in a heterozygous state having several motor and autonomic problems without disturbed cognition. Her younger brother, sister and elder son harbouring the same mutation were asymptomatic carriers for the variant. However, the influence of DNM3 on decreased disease onset in this family was not clear. Interpretation & conclusions: Identification of the p.Gly2019Ser variant in only one patient among a large number of Indian patients (n=626) with Parkinsonian disorder in our study suggests a limited role of the LRRK2 variant towards disease pathogenesis.","Sadhukhan, Dipanwita; Biswas, Arindam; Bhaduri, Arunima; Sarkar, Neelanjana; Biswas, Atanu; Das, Shyamal K; Banerjee, Tapas K; Ray, Kunal; Ray, Jharna",Indian J Med Res,,502
517368,Nestlé South Africa: leading multi-stakeholder partnership response in the COVID-19 context,2020,"Brain function relies on vesicular release of neurotransmitters at chemical synapses. The release probability depends on action potential-evoked presynaptic Ca2+ entry, but also on the resting Ca2+ level. Whether these basic aspects of presynaptic calcium homeostasis show any consistent trend along the axonal path, and how they are controlled by local network activity, remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of the recently advanced FLIM-based method to monitor presynaptic Ca2+ with nanomolar sensitivity. We find that, in cortical pyramidal neurons, action potential- evoked calcium entry (range 10-300 nM), but not the resting Ca2+ level (range 10-100 nM), tends to increase with higher order of axonal branches. Blocking astroglial glutamate uptake reduces evoked Ca2+ entry but has little effect on resting Ca2+ whereas both appear boosted by the constitutive activation of group 1/2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. We find no consistent effect of transient somatic depolarisation or hyperpolarisation on presynaptic Ca2+ entry or its basal level. The results unveil some key aspects of presynaptic machinery in cortical circuits, shedding light on basic principles of synaptic connectivity in the brain.","Tyurikova, Olga; Zheng, Kaiyu; Nicholson, Elizabeth; Timofeeva, Yulia; Semyanov, Alexey; Volynski, Kirill; Rusakov, Dmitri A",J. neurochem,,502

In this paper, a mathematical model has been used to explore the role of government and individuals reaction to the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The proposed framework incorporates all the relevant biological factors as well as the effects of individual behavioral reaction and government action such as travel restrictions, social distancing, hospitalization, quarantine and hygiene measures. Understanding the dynamics of this highly contagious SARS-CoV-2, which at present does not have any therapy assist the policy makers on evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures currently being implemented. Moreover, policy makers can have insights on short-and-long term dynamics of the disease. The proposed conceptual framework was combined with data on cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in South Africa, March 2020 to early May 2020.

Informatics approaches are needed to better understand the role of individual and community risk factors for COVID-19. We developed an informatics method to integrate SARS-CoV-2 data with multiple neighborhood-level factors from the American Community Survey and opendataphilly.org. We assessed the spatial association between neighborhood-level factors and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, separately across all patients and across asymptomatic patients. We found that neighborhoods with higher proportions of individuals with a high-school degree and/or who were identified as Hispanic/Latinx were more likely to have higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates, after adjusting for other neighborhood covariates. Patients from neighborhoods with higher proportions of individuals receiving public assistance and/or identified as White were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Our approach and its findings could inform future public health efforts.","Boland, M. R.; Liu, J.; Balocchi, C.; Meeker, J.; Bai, R.; Mellis, I.; Mowery, D. L.; Herman, D.",AMIA ...

Although a method foreseeing microvascular dysfunction has not been defined yet, studies conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have demonstrated the presence of endotheliitis. With this study, we aimed to investigate the microvascular circulation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC). METHODS: Thirty-one patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 25 of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 6 with MIS-C and 58 healthy peers were included in the study. NVC was performed in eight fingers with 2 images per finger and 16 images were examined for the morphology of capillaries, presence of pericapillary edema, microhemorrhage, avascular area, and neoangiogenesis. Capillary length, capillary width, apical loop, arterial and venous width, and intercapillary distance were measured from three consecutive capillaries from the ring finger of the non-dominant hand. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed significantly more capillary ramification (p < 0.001), capillary meandering (p = 0.04), microhemorrhage (p < 0.001), neoangiogenesis (p < 0.001), capillary tortuosity (p = 0.003). Capillary density (p = 0.002) and capillary length (p = 0.002) were significantly lower in the patient group while intercapillary distance (p = 0.01) was significantly longer compared with healthy volunteers. Morphologically, patients with MIS-C had a higher frequency of capillary ramification and neoangiogenesis compared with COVID-19 patients (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Abnormal capillary alterations seen in COVID-19 and MIS-C patients indicate both similar and different aspects of these two spectra of SARS-CoV-2 infection and NVC appears to be a simple and non-invasive method for evaluation of microvascular involvement.","Çakmak, Figen; Demirbuga, Asuman; Demirkol, Demet; Gümüs, Süheyla; Torun, Selda Hancerli; Kayaalp, Gülsah Kavrul; Ömeroglu, Rukiye Eker; Somer, Ayper; Uysalol, Metin; Yildiz, Raif; Ayaz, Nuray Aktay",Microvasc Res,,502

METHODS: IRB approval was obtained to allow a retrospective review of adult patients who presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of fever, cough, dyspnea or hypoxia and had a chest X-ray between 12 March 2020 and 26 March 2020. The initial chest X-ray was graded on a scale of 0-3 with grade 0 representing no alveolar opacities, grade 1: < 1/3 alveolar opacities of the lung, Grade 2: 1/3 to 2/3 lung with alveolar opacities and grade 3: > 2/3 alveolar opacities of the lung. Past medical history of diabetes and hypertension, initial oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing results, intubation, and outcome were also collected. RESULTS: Four hundred ten patient chest X-rays were reviewed. Oxygen saturation and X-ray grade were both significantly associated with the length of stay in hospital, the hazard ratio (HR) of discharge was 1.05 (95% CI [1.01, 1.09], p = 0.017) and 0.61 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73], p < 0.001), respectively. In addition, oxygen saturation and X-ray grade were significant predictors of intubation (odds ratio (OR) of intubation is 0.88 (95% CI [0.81, 0.96], p = 0.004) and 3.69 (95% CI [2.25, 6.07], p < 0.001).

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. We, therefore, examined the effect of isolation measures during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April) on diet (24-h recall) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns in third-year biomedical students. Findings were compared with students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. In females, but not males, energy intake was ~20% greater during the pandemic, and snacking frequency and energy density of consumed snacks also increased compared with 2018 and 2019. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes during the pandemic with ~30% fewer students achieving ""sufficient"" levels of activity, defined by at least 150 min over at least five sessions, compared with the previous two years. In a follow-up study six to eight weeks later (14-18% response rate), during gradual easing of nationwide restrictions albeit continued gym closures and online learning, higher energy intake in females and reduced physical activity levels in both sexes persisted. These data demonstrate the health impacts of isolation measures, with the potential to affect long-term diet and activity behaviours.","Gallo, Linda A; Gallo, Tania F; Young, Sophia L; Moritz, Karen M; Akison, Lisa K",Nutrients,,502

They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement).

(Special Focus: Impacts of COVID-19 on agriculture and rural poverty in China.),2020,"Using the SRQR EQUATOR checklist, we review the gendered burdens and impacts of SARS-CoV-2. Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of the outbreak on women, and how the gendered flaws in the current response strategies could be avoided in managing future global crises.","Ayittey, Foster Kofi; Dhar, Bablu Kumar; Anani, Gideon; Chiwero, Nyasha Bennita",Health Care Women Int,,502

This is despite differences in the extent of disease prevalence China reported a case fatality rate of ~5%, India ~2.5%, with parts of Europe witnessing much higher rates (~11-15%). A wide range of the APOBEC3B indel frequency is reported across global populations, including India, with fixation of the insertion allele in Africa. High frequency of the insertion allele was seen in malaria-endemic regions across India and the deletion allele was significantly associated with severity of disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Interestingly, geographic distribution of the protective allele in India presents a striking overlay with low-incidence COVID-19 regions. A recent study indicates that one of the consequences of APOBEC3B deletion is the facilitation of Alu insertion in the ACE1 (angiotensin converting enzyme 1) gene across global populations. The deletion allele is a risk factor for essential hypertension, diabetic nephropathy and has also been reported in the progression of pneumonia in SARS patients with hypoxemia advancing to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Researchers argue these might also explain the higher impact of the disease in Europe compared to China and Japan. Would the presence of this allele influence morbidity in elderly COVID 19 patients? ACE2 counterbalances the actions of ACE1, and there is evidence that increase in ACE1 expression leads to greater pro duction of angiotensin II, which in turn serves as a negative regulator of ACE2. In light of the above observations, we propose inclusion of APOBEC3B and ACE1 indel polymorphisms in genetic screening, triaging and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Saman, Habib Mitali Mukerji",Current Science,,502

AIM: To understand nursing home leader’s motivations for participating in a research study and perceptions of the process and value. METHODS: After a feasibility study of tuned lighting in a nursing home, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with six facility leaders. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and independently coded by four investigators. RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) The importance of the nursing home’s culture and context: the facility had stable leadership, clear processes for prioritizing and implementing new initiatives, and an established interest in the study’s topic. (2) The importance of leader’s belief in the value of the intervention: leaders perceived research generally and the intervention specifically as positively impacting their facility and residents. (3) The importance of ongoing collaboration and flexibility throughout the study period: leaders served as champions to catalyze the project and overcome implementation barriers. CONCLUSION: Nursing home leader’s perspectives about their participation in a feasibility study underscore the importance of establishing strong researcher–provider partnerships, understanding the environment in which the intervention will be implemented, and employing pragmatic methods that allow for flexibility in response to real-world implementation barriers. We recommend eliciting qualitative information to understand the environment in which an intervention will be implemented and to engage opinion leaders who can inform the protocol and champion its success.","Baier, Rosa R.; McCreedy, Ellen; Uth, Rebecca; Gifford, David R.; Wetle, Terrie",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01847-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811623/,502

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out of patients consecutively admitted to Doctor Peset University Hospital, Valencia (Spain) for COVID‐19 from 11 March to 28 April 2020. Every case was diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by serology test to detect antibodies. Demographic details, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings on admission and complications of each case were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: The dataset comprised 340 patients. Of them, 152 (44.6%) were aged >70 years. Comorbidities were more common in the older groups. Confusion was more common in older adults, whereas typical symptoms of COVID‐19, such as fever, cough and myalgia, were less common. Oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air, neutrophilia, D‐dimer >0.5 μg/mL, creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase ≥250 U/L and elevation of creatine kinase were higher in the older adult groups. Complications during hospitalization, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (53.3% vs 33.2%, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (11.8% vs 5.3%; P = 0.030) and mortality (28.9% vs 6.5%; P < 0.001) were more common in patients aged >70 years. Oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air on admission was a predictor of mortality (odds ratio 11.65, 95% confidence interval 3.26–41.66, P < 0.001) in patients aged >70 years.

594242,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on food priorities. Results from a preliminary study using social media and an online survey with Spanish consumers,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND: Current studies of asthma history on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes are limited and lack consideration of disease status. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based study to assess asthma disease status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in relation to COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 61,338) in a large, diverse integrated health care system were identified. Asthma/COPD history, medication use, and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Asthma patients were categorized into those with and without clinical visits for asthma 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and labeled as active and inactive asthma, respectively. Primary outcomes included COVID-19–related hospitalizations, intensive respiratory support (IRS), and intensive care unit admissions within 30 days, and mortality within 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Logistic and Cox regression were used to relate COVID-19 outcomes to asthma/COPD history. RESULTS: The cohort was 53.9% female and 66% Hispanic and had a mean age of 43.9 years. Patients with active asthma had increased odds of hospitalization, IRS, and intensive care unit admission (odds ratio 1.47-1.66; P < .05) compared with patients without asthma or COPD. No increased risks were observed for patients with inactive asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with increased risks of hospitalization, IRS, and mortality (odds ratio and hazard ratio 1.27-1.67; P < .05). Among active asthma patients, those using asthma medications had greater than 25% lower odds for COVID-19 outcomes than those without medication. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asthma who required clinical care 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 or individuals with COPD history are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Proper medication treatment for asthma may lower this risk.","Huang, Brian Z.; Chen, Zhanghua; Sidell, Margo A.; Eckel, Sandrah P.; Martinez, Mayra P.; Lurmann, Fred; Thomas, Duncan C.; Gilliland, Frank D.; Xiang, Anny H.",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389242/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219821008345; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2021.07.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219821008345,502
594859,Student assessment of online tools to foster engagement during the COVID-19 quarantine,2020-12-01,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory illness, although increasing evidence indicates that infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can affect multiple organ systems (1). Data that examine all in-hospital complications of COVID-19 and that compare these complications with those associated with other viral respiratory pathogens, such as influenza, are lacking. To assess complications of COVID-19 and influenza, electronic health records (EHRs) from 3,948 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (March 1-May 31, 2020) and 5,453 hospitalized patients with influenza (October 1, 2018-February 1, 2020) from the national Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the United States,* were analyzed. Using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, complications in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were compared with those in patients with influenza. Risk ratios were calculated and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions; proportions of complications were stratified among patients with COVID-19 by race/ethnicity. Patients with COVID-19 had almost 19 times the risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than did patients with influenza, (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 18.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.40-28.00), and more than twice the risk for myocarditis (2.56; 1.17-5.59), deep vein thrombosis (2.81; 2.04-3.87), pulmonary embolism (2.10; 1.53-2.89), intracranial hemorrhage (2.85; 1.35-6.03), acute hepatitis/liver failure (3.13; 1.92-5.10), bacteremia (2.46; 1.91-3.18), and pressure ulcers (2.65; 2.14-3.27). The risks for exacerbations of asthma (0.27; 0.16-0.44) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0.37; 0.32-0.42) were lower among patients with COVID-19 than among those with influenza. The percentage of COVID-19 patients who died while hospitalized (21.0%) was more than five times that of influenza patients (3.8%), and the duration of hospitalization was almost three times longer for COVID-19 patients. Among patients with COVID-19, the risk for respiratory, neurologic, and renal complications, and sepsis was higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) patients, patients of other races, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) patients compared with those in non-Hispanic White (White) patients, even after adjusting for age and underlying medical conditions. These findings highlight the higher risk for most complications associated with COVID-19 compared with influenza and might aid clinicians and researchers in recognizing, monitoring, and managing the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations. The higher risk for certain complications among racial and ethnic minority patients provides further evidence that certain racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19 and that this disparity is not solely accounted for by age and underlying medical conditions.","Cates, Jordan; Lucero-Obusan, Cynthia; Dahl, Rebecca M.; Schirmer, Patricia; Garg, Shikha; Oda, Gina; Hall, Aron J.; Langley, Gayle; Havers, Fiona P.; Holodniy, Mark; Cardemil, Cristina V.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6942e3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090987/,502

The clinical application and real-life experiences of using ceftobiprole for bloodstream infections, including infective endocarditis, are limited but nevertheless promising. In addition, extended-spectrum ceftobiprole activity, including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has theoretical advantages for use as empirical therapy in bacteremia potentially caused by a broad spectrum of microorganisms, such as catheter-related bacteremia. In the future, the desirable approach to sepsis and severe infections will be administered to patients according to their clinical situation, the intrinsic host characteristics, the susceptibility profile, and local epidemiology, while the “universal antibiotic strategy” will no longer be adequate.","Lupia, Tommaso; Pallotto, Carlo; Corcione, Silvia; Boglione, Lucio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567771/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10020170,502

Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.

With high CAP numbers in China and growing access to PICUs, factors associated with severe CAP need to be determined to optimize care. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively determine PICU CAP admission features and outcomes. METHODS: A 4 year prospective study of CAP aged 1 month to <14 years admitted to PICU, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, China. All were managed in a standard manner. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were collected systematically. All received antibiotics. RESULTS: Eight hundred ten (7%) of 10,836 CAP hospital admissions needed PICU. Seven hundred seven (87%) were enrolled. PICU CAP children were young (76% ≤ 12 months) and 33% had co‐morbid conditions; 21% congenital heart disease.21% required mechanical ventilation. The average length of PICU stay was 5 days (range, 3–27). The case fatality rate was 5.8%. Viruses were detected in 38%, RSV 24%; bacteria in 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7%, Haemophilus influenza b 4%, Mycoplasma 11%. On single factor analysis, PICU admission respiratory rate >70/min, grunting/groaning, head nodding, cyanosis, and anemia were associated with respiratory failure and with fatality. On multivariate analysis only presence of congenital heart disease, Trisomy 21 and immunodeficiency correlated with fatality; not microbe nor PICU findings. CONCLUSIONS: Young age and underlying congenital heart disease were associated factors for PICU support in CAP in China. Early referral if altered sensorium, high respiratory rate, head nodding, grunting and anemia, and universal access to conjugated vaccines may decrease morbidity and mortality.

Various in vitro studies revealed that only the dimer of the matured 3CL(pro) is active. However, as the internally encoded 3CL(pro) gets matured from the replicase polyprotein by autolytic cleavage at both the N-terminal and the C-terminal flanking sites, it is unclear whether the polyprotein also needs to dimerize first for its autocleavage reaction. We constructed a large protein containing the cyan fluorescent protein (C), the N-terminal flanking substrate peptide of SARS 3CL(pro) (XX), SARS 3CL(pro) (3CLP), and the yellow fluorescent protein (Y) to study the autoprocessing of 3CL(pro) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In contrast to the matured 3CL(pro), the polyprotein, as well as the one-step digested product, 3CLP-Y-His, were shown to be monomeric in gel filtration and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. However, dimers can still be induced and detected when incubating these large proteins with a substrate analog compound in both chemical cross-linking experiments and analytic ultracentrifuge analysis. We also measured enzyme activity under different enzyme concentrations and found a clear tendency of substrate-induced dimer formation. Based on these discoveries, we conclude that substrate-induced dimerization is essential for the activity of SARS-3CL(pro) in the polyprotein, and a modified model for the 3CL(pro) maturation process was proposed. As many viral proteases undergo a similar maturation process, this model might be generally applicable.","Li, Chunmei; Qi, Yifei; Teng, Xin; Yang, Zongchang; Wei, Ping; Zhang, Changsheng; Tan, Lei; Zhou, Lu; Liu, Ying; Lai, Luhua",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20489209/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819891421; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.095851; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925819891421,502

However, there have been relatively few detailed characterizations of their pharmacokinetics (PK). The aim of this study was to develop imaging methods and pharmacokinetic models to aid the future development of a novel family of brain MRI molecular contrast agents. An efficient near-infrared (NIR) imaging method was established to monitor VHH and VHH conjugated nanoparticle kinetics in mice using a hybrid approach: kinetics in blood were assessed by direct sampling, and kinetics in kidney, liver, and brain were assessed by serial in vivo NIR imaging. These studies were performed under “basal” circumstances in which the VHH constructs and VHH-conjugated nanoparticles do not substantially interact with targets nor cross the blood brain barrier. Using this approach, we constructed a five-compartment PK model that fits the data well for single VHHs, engineered VHH trimers, and iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to VHH trimers. The establishment of the feasibility of these methods lays a foundation for future PK studies of candidate brain MRI molecular contrast agents.","Su, Shiran; Esparza, Thomas J.; Nguyen, Duong; Mastrogiacomo, Simone; Kim, Joong H.; Brody, David L.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445399/,502

Our goal was to describe our findings in patients with severe ARDS due to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (sCOVID-19) treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO). METHODS: We retrospectively examined all patients treated with vv-ECMO for severe ARDS due to acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RESULTS: In total, 13 patients were treated with vv-ECMO in our medical centre. The mean patient age was 48.1 years. Most patients were obese (69%) and male (85%). All patients were mechanically ventilated before ECMO. The mean time from intubation to proning was 16.6 h; the time from start of prone therapy to vv-ECMO implantation was 155.1 h. The mean total ECMO run time was 358 h. Significant reduction of positive end-expiratory pressure (P = 0.02), peak pressure (P = 0.001) and minute volume (P = 0.03) could be achieved after implantation of vv-ECMO. All patients showed an inflammatory response. Overall mortality was 30.7%: 1 patient died of mesenteric ischaemia; 3 patients died of multiple organ failure. A worse prognosis was seen in patients with highly elevated concentrations of interleukin-6.

The objective of this study was to determine if flavonoids and other polyphenols with B-ring 3′,4′-hydroxylation inhibit recombinant human (rh)ACE2 activity. rhACE2 activity was assessed with the fluorogenic substrate Mca-APK(Dnp). Polyphenols reduced rhACE2 activity by 15–66% at 10 μM. Rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, tamarixetin, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid inhibited rhACE2 activity by 42–48%. Quercetin was the most potent rhACE2 inhibitor among the polyphenols tested, with an IC(50) of 4.48 μM. Thus, quercetin, its metabolites, and polyphenols with 3′,4′-hydroxylation inhibited rhACE2 activity at physiologically relevant concentrations in vitro.","Liu, Xiaocao; Raghuvanshi, Ruma; Ceylan, Fatma Duygu; Bolling, Bradley W.",J Agric Food Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c05064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33179911/,502

METHODS: This was a nested case-control study. A questionnaire was distributed to the study cohort two weeks after the Hajj period and was self-administered by all recruited subjects. In addition, the medical records of study subjects were reviewed at Al-Hada Hospital for the same period in order to document ARI. RESULTS: The attack rate for ARI among study subjects during Hajj season or within two weeks of returning was 25.6% (64/250). Logistic regression analysis of factors related to acquiring ARI revealed that contact with pilgrims imposed an extremely high risk of infection (adjusted OR 13.2, 95% CI 1.5–117.6). Moreover, non-use of alcohol-based hand disinfection carried a more than 8-fold risk of acquiring ARI compared to those who always used alcohol for hand disinfection (adjusted OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.2–32.2). Smoking was also a predictor of ARI in our cohort and influenza vaccination was associated with a 30% reduction in ARI compared to unvaccinated subjects, although this finding was not statistically significant. Unexpectedly, the logistic regression model showed that Saudi nationals were three times more likely to acquire ARI than non-Saudis (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–8.4).

608763,Trends and applications of resilience analytics in supply chain modeling: systematic literature review in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-30,"INTRODUCTION: : The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been affecting the health and economic, as well as social, life of the entire globe since the end of 2019. The virus causes COVID-19, with a wide range of symptoms among the infected individuals, from asymptomatic infection to mortality. This, along with a high infection rate, prompted efforts to investigate the potential mechanisms of the different clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2 among the infected populations. HYPOTHESIS: : One of the possible mechanisms that has been reported is the ABO blood system polymorphism. Indeed, one of the major proposed mechanisms is the presence of naturally occurring anti-A antibodies in individuals of groups O and B, which could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: : This article aimed to review the published data on the potential effect of the ABO blood group system on the susceptibility to COVID-19 and the disease progression and outcomes. RESULTS: : The reviewed data suggest that individuals of blood group A are at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may develop severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas blood group O is considered protective against the infection, to some extent. However, some of the available studies seem to have been influenced by unaccounted confounders and biases. CONCLUSION: : Therefore, further appropriately controlled studies are warranted to fully investigate the possible association between the ABO blood groups and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.","Shibeeb, Sapha; Khan, Aisha",Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531137921001346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2021.07.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137921001346?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541459/,502

Their administration has been proposed to treat several viral and immunomediated diseases as an immunomodulatory therapy. Due to its availability, recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-α) has been studied in relation to feline retrovirosis, both in vitro and in vivo. However, IFNs are species-specific and antibodies have been shown to develop in response to the high rHuIFN-α doses necessary for an effective therapy. A recombinant feline IFN has been developed, which has been characterized as interferon-omega (rFeIFN-ω), designed to overcome these problems. Nonetheless, very few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in cats naturally infected with FIV or FeLV. In an initial study, we here demonstrated that rFeIFN-ω can dramatically improve the clinical condition of infected cats, and induce improvement of hematologic parameters. Minor changes or no change was observed for hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load, viremia and RT activity, suggesting that the overall effect of IFN was on innate immunity. More studies are needed in order to better understand its in vivo mechanisms.","Doménech, Ana; Miró, Guadalupe; Collado, Victorio M.; Ballesteros, Natalia; Sanjosé, Leticia; Escolar, Elena; Martin, Sonsoles; Gomez-Lucia, Esperanza",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242711002054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21719116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242711002054,502

Despite the little information on the psychological impact on international students, we aimed to assess the psychological outcomes and associated factors among international students currently living in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 28, 2020 to June 12, 2020 on 402 full-time international students across 26 provinces in China. The frequency of symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, psychological distress, loneliness, and fear was assessed with the English versions of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) scales, respectively. Results: The prevalence of symptoms of depression (73.4%), anxiety (76.6%), stress (58.5%), insomnia (77.6%), psychological distress (71.4%), loneliness (62.4%), and fear (73.1%) among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic was shown. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms of all psychological outcomes was significantly associated with 26–30-year-old students, students who lived with roommates, and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Participants in the central region reported significantly moderate to extremely severe symptom levels of all the psychological outcomes except fear symptoms. Univariate analysis indicated that a significant association of all psychological outcomes was found among 26–30-year-old students and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Multivariate analysis showed that Engineering, Business, Social Sciences and Law, and Language students were significantly associated with the symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fear. Participants staying in China for shorter than 2 years were associated with a higher risk of all psychological outcomes except psychological distress and loneliness symptoms. Conclusions: We found a higher prevalence of psychological outcomes and risk factors among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We immediately appealed to university authorities, mental health professionals, and government officials to provide mental health interventions and strategies for their international students, particularly young, central region students, living with roommates, different study backgrounds, and short time staying during the pandemic.","Alam, Md.

METHODS: As of May 2020, analysis was conducted on all subjects who could confirm their history of claims related to COVID-19 in the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in Korea. Using this dataset, we compared the short-term prognosis of COVID-19 infection according to the use of DPP-4i and RAS blockade. Additionally, we validated the results using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea dataset. RESULTS: Totally, data of 67,850 subjects were accessible in the HIRA dataset. Of these, 5,080 were confirmed COVID-19. Among these, 832 subjects with DM were selected for analysis in this study. Among the subjects, 263 (31.6%) and 327 (39.3%) were DPP-4i and RAS blockade users, respectively. Thirty-four subjects (4.09%) received intensive care or died. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.362 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.135 to 0.971), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.599 (95% CI, 0.251 to 1.431). These findings were consistent with the analysis based on the NHIS data using 704 final subjects. The adjusted odds ratio for severe treatment among DPP-4i users was 0.303 (95% CI, 0.135 to 0.682), and that for RAS blockade users was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.391 to 1.682).

METHODS: In this study, 800, 170, and 171 pairs of ultra-low-dose and full-dose CT images were used as input/output as training, test, and external validation set, respectively, to implement the full-dose prediction technique. A residual convolutional neural network was applied to generate full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images. The quality of predicted CT images was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scores ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned reflecting subjective assessment of image quality and related COVID-19 features, including ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving (CP), consolidation (CS), nodular infiltrates (NI), bronchovascular thickening (BVT), and pleural effusion (PE). RESULTS: The radiation dose in terms of CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) was reduced by up to 89%. The RMSE decreased from 0.16 ± 0.05 to 0.09 ± 0.02 and from 0.16 ± 0.06 to 0.08 ± 0.02 for the predicted compared with ultra-low-dose CT images in the test and external validation set, respectively. The overall scoring assigned by radiologists showed an acceptance rate of 4.72 ± 0.57 out of 5 for reference full-dose CT images, while ultra-low-dose CT images rated 2.78 ± 0.9. The predicted CT images using the deep learning algorithm achieved a score of 4.42 ± 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the deep learning algorithm is capable of predicting standard full-dose CT images with acceptable quality for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 positive patients with substantial radiation dose reduction. KEY POINTS: • Ultra-low-dose CT imaging of COVID-19 patients would result in the loss of critical information about lesion types, which could potentially affect clinical diagnosis. • Deep learning–based prediction of full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 could reduce the radiation dose by up to 89%. • Deep learning algorithms failed to recover the correct lesion structure/density for a number of patients considered outliers, and as such, further research and development is warranted to address these limitations.

This multicenter observational study was conducted between 1 April and 31 December 2020 in Istanbul. Members of the Istanbul branch of the Turkish Pediatric Nephrology Association were asked to report all confirmed cases of COVID-19 who were on RRT, as well as the number of prevalent RRT patients under the age of 20. A total of 46 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported from 12 centers, of which 17 were dialysis patients, and 29 were KTx recipients. Thus, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was 9.3% among dialysis patients and 9.2% among KTx recipients over a 9-month period in Istanbul. Twelve KTx recipients and three dialysis patients were asymptomatic (p = 0.12). Most of the symptomatic patients in both the dialysis and KTx groups had a mild respiratory illness. Only two patients, one in each group, experienced a severe disease course, and only one hemodialysis patient had a critical illness that required mechanical ventilation.

616450,A novel distance learning ergonomics checklist and risk evaluation methodology: A case of Covid‐19 pandemic,2021-05-10,"The main-protease (M(pro)) catalyzes a crucial step for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The recent SARS-CoV-2 presents the main protease (M(CoV2)(pro)) with 12 mutations compared to SARS-CoV (M(CoV1)(pro)). Recent studies point out that these subtle differences lead to mobility variances at the active site loops with functional implications. We use metadynamics simulations and a sort of computational analysis to probe the dynamic, pharmacophoric and catalytic environment differences between the monomers of both enzymes. So, we verify how much intrinsic distinctions are preserved in the functional dimer of M(CoV2)(pro), as well as its implications for ligand accessibility and optimized drug screening. We find a significantly higher accessibility to open binding conformers in the M(CoV2)(pro) monomer compared to M(CoV1)(pro). A higher hydration propensity for the M(CoV2)(pro) S2 loop with the A46S substitution seems to exercise a key role. Quantum calculations suggest that the wider conformations for M(CoV2)(pro) are less catalytically active in the monomer. However, the statistics for contacts involving the N-finger suggest higher maintenance of this activity at the dimer. Docking analyses suggest that the ability to vary the active site width can be important to improve the access of the ligand to the active site in different ways. So, we carry out a multiconformational virtual screening with different ligand bases. The results point to the importance of taking into account the protein conformational multiplicity for new promissors anti M(CoV2)(pro) ligands. We hope these results will be useful in prospecting, repurposing and/or designing new anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma","Rocha, Rafael E. O.; Chaves, Elton J.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the safety net hospital for San Francisco through April 8, 2020. Each patient had ≥15 days of follow-up. Among 26 patients, the median age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43 to 62), 65% were men, and 77% were Latinx. Mechanical ventilation was initiated for 11 (42%) patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and 20 patients (77%) overall. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20). Patients were managed with lung protective ventilation (tidal volume ≤8 ml/kg of ideal body weight and plateau pressure ≤30 cmH(2)O on 98% and 78% of ventilator days, respectively). Prone positioning was used for 13 of 20 (65%) ventilated patients for a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 2 to 10). Seventeen (65%) patients were discharged home, 1 (4%) was discharged to nursing home, 3 (12%) were discharged from the ICU, and 2 (8%) remain intubated in the ICU at the time of this report.

It represents the possibility of developing psychosis starting from a personality characterized by sensitivity, scrupulousness, and fear of judgment of others. The presentation of the following clinical case highlights how the overlap between this clinical entity and mood disorders leads to characteristic psychopathology, which has not been sufficiently detailed. In particular, the delusions, which always starts from the idea of reference and the shame in the face of the judgment of others, takes on characteristics of guilt during the depressive phases and persecutory themes during the activation phases. This clinical observation, which obviously needs to be confirmed on a larger scale, encourages a renewed interest in the concept of Kretschmer's Sensitive Delusion of Reference and creates the possibility of intersecting multiple psychopathological levels, for a more complete perspective on the individual case.","Esposito, Cecilia Maria; Fiorentini, Alessio; Callari, Antonio; Galeazzi, Gian Maria; Brambilla, Paolo",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552517/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.712552,502
618163,Reinventing the wheel in ARDS: Awake proning in COVID-19,2020-07-03,"BACKGROUND: Management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is critically dependent on quick and reliable identification of the virus in clinical specimens. Detection of viral RNA by a colorimetric reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a simple, reliable and cost-effective assay, deployable in resource-limited settings (RLS). Our objective was to evaluate the intrinsic and extrinsic performances of RT-LAMP in RLS. METHODS: This is a multicenter prospective observational study of diagnostic accuracy, conducted from October 2020 to February 2021 in four African Countries: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria; and in Italy. We enroled 1657 individuals who were either COVID-19 suspect cases, or asymptomatic and presented for screening. RNA extracted from pharyngeal swabs was tested in parallel by a colorimetric RT-LAMP and by a standard real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FINDINGS: The sensitivity and specificity of index RT LAMP compared to standard RT-PCR on 1657 prospective specimens from infected individuals was determined. For a subset of 1292 specimens, which underwent exactly the same procedures in different countries, we obtained very high specificity (98%) and positive predictive value (PPV = 99%), while the sensitivity was 87%, with a negative predictive value NPV = 70%, Stratification of RT-PCR data showed superior sensitivity achieved with an RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) below 35 (97%), which decreased to 60% above 35. INTERPRETATION: In this field trial, RT-LAMP appears to be a reliable assay, comparable to RT-PCR, particularly with medium-high viral loads (Ct < 35). Hence, RT-LAMP can be deployed in RLS for timely management and prevention of COVID-19, without compromising the quality of output.","Baba, Marycelin Mandu; Bitew, Molalegne; Fokam, Joseph; Lelo, Eric Agola; Ahidjo, Ahmed; Asmamaw, Kominist; Beloumou, Grace Angong; Bulimo, Wallace Dimbuson; Buratti, Emanuele; Chenwi, Collins; Dadi, Hailu; D'Agaro, Pierlanfranco; De Conti, Laura; Fainguem, Nadine; Gadzama, Galadima; Maiuri, Paolo; Majanja, Janet; Meshack, Wadegu; Ndjolo, Alexis; Nkenfou, Celine; Oderinde, Bamidele Soji; Opanda, Silvanos Mukunzi; Segat, Ludovica; Stuani, Cristiana; Symekher, Samwel L.; Takou, Desire; Tesfaye, Kassahun; Triolo, Gianluca; Tuki, Keyru; Zacchigna, Serena; Marcello, Alessandro",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476394/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537021003813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021003813; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101101,502
619703,Advancing the Adoption of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in the United States,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and mortality of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic show marked geographic variation. The presence of several subtypes of the coronavirus and the genetic differences in the populations could condition that variation. Thus, the objective of this study was to propose variants in genes that encode proteins related to the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells as possible targets for genetic associations studies. METHODS: The allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11A, cathepsin L (CTSL), and elastase (ELANE) genes were obtained in four populations from the American, African, European, and Asian continents reported in the 1000 Genome Project. Moreover, we evaluated the potential biological effect of these variants using different web-based tools. RESULTS: In the coding sequences of these genes, we detected one probably-damaging polymorphism located in the TMPRSS2 gene (rs12329760) that produces a change of amino acid. Furthermore, forty-eight polymorphisms with possible functional consequences were detected in the non-coding sequences of the following genes: three in ACE2, seventeen in TMPRSS2, ten in TMPRSS11A, twelve in ELANE, and six in CTSL. These polymorphisms produce binding sites for transcription factors and microRNAs. The minor allele frequencies of these polymorphisms vary in each community; indeed, some of them are high in specific populations. CONCLUSION: In summary, using data of the 1000 Genome Project and web-based tools, we propose some polymorphisms, which, depending on the population, could be used for genetic association studies.","Vargas-Alarcón, Gilberto; Posadas-Sánchez, Rosalinda; Ramírez-Bello, Julian",Life Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520310651?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835700/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520310651; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118313,502
620075,Strict Physical Distancing May Be More Efficient: A Mathematical Argument for Making Lockdowns Count,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: The International Health Regulations (IHR) are a legally binding instrument designed to improve Global Health Security by limiting the cross boarder spread of health risks. All 196 signatories to the IHR (2005) are required to report progress towards IHR core capacity implementation through an annual multi-sectoral self-assessment process known as the State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR). This mandatory process sits alongside the voluntary, external, peer-reviewed Joint External Evaluations (JEE) as two core components of the IHR monitoring and evaluation framework. JEEs are intended to occur once every 4–5 years following a voluntary request from the member state. This means that interim monitoring of IHR core capacity compliance, can be challenging and additional data sources are required. The outputs of the SPAR process represent one such source. Although the JEE and SPAR tools are intended to be complimentary, there has been no publicly available mapping of JEE indicators to SPAR indicators in order to inform progress on IHR compliance. RESULTS: This paper mapped JEE indicators to SPAR indicators and found a high level of correlation suggesting the SPAR process offers a method for countries and technical assistance programmes to monitor progress on IHR compliance and identify gaps in between JEE visits. However, coverage was not complete, and several gaps were identified most notably in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and vaccinations. CONCLUSION: Enhancing alignment between JEE and SPAR could offer a more consistent and complete way of assessing compliance with IHR.

The mechanism consist on the existence of vulnerable proteins (VPs), which are (i) mainly expressed outside the lungs; (ii) their perturbations is known to produce human diseases; and (iii) can be perturbed directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These VPs are perturbed by other proteins, which are: (i) mainly expressed in the lungs, (ii) are targeted directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (iii) can navigate outside the lungs as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iv) can activate VPs via subdiffusive processes inside the target organ. Using bioinformatic tools and mathematical modeling we identifies 26 VPs and their 38 perturbators, which predict extracellular damages in the immunologic endocrine, cardiovascular, circulatory, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, neurologic, dermatologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and metabolic systems, as well as in the eyes. The identification of these VPs and their perturbators allow us to identify 27 existing drugs which are candidates to be repurposed for treating extrapulmonary damage in severe COVID-19 patients. After removal of drugs having undesirable drug-drug interactions we select 7 drugs and one natural product: apabetalone, romidepsin, silmitasertib, ozanezumab, procaine, azacitidine, amlexanox, volociximab, and ellagic acid, whose combinations can palliate the organs and systems found to be damaged by COVID-19.

621896,Beyond good and bad: Challenging the suggested role of emotions in customer experience (CX) research,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Indigenous people in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand experience an increased burden of chronic diseases compared to non-Indigenous people in these countries. Lack of necessary services and culturally relevant care for Indigenous people contributes to this burden. Many Indigenous communities have implemented systems, such as virtual care, to improve chronic disease management. Virtual care has extended beyond videoconferencing to include more advanced technologies, such as remote biometric monitoring devices. However, given the historical and ongoing Western intrusion into Indigenous day to day life, these technologies may seem more invasive and thus require additional research on their acceptability and utility within Indigenous populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to present the protocol for a scoping review, which aims to map existing evidence. This study is based on the following guiding research question: What are the characteristics of virtual care use by Indigenous adult populations in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand? The subquestions are related to the technology used, health conditions and nature of the virtual care, cultural safety, and key concepts for effective use. METHODS: This scoping review protocol is informed by the methodology described by the Joanna Briggs Institute and is supplemented by the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. A search for published and gray literature, written in English, and published between 2000 and present will be completed utilizing electronic databases and search engines, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Indigenous Peoples of North America, Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Informit, and Native Health Database. Search results will be uploaded to the review software, Covidence, for title and abstract screening before full-text screening begins. This process will be repeated for gray literature. Upon completion, a data abstraction tool will organize the relevant information into categorical formations. RESULTS: The search strategy has been confirmed, and the screening of titles and abstracts is underway. As of October 2020, we have identified over 300 articles for full-text screening. CONCLUSIONS: Previous reviews have addressed virtual care within Indigenous communities. However, new virtual care technologies have since emerged; subsequently, additional literature has been published. Mapping and synthesizing this literature will inform new directions for research and discussion.

We present data from a cohort of 267 hospitalized, severe COVID-19 patients who received CCP. No transfusion-related complications were reported, indicating the overall safety of CCP therapy. Patients who eventually died from COVID-19 received CCP significantly later (3.95 versus 5.22 days after hospital admission) and had higher interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (28.9 pg/ml versus 102.5 pg/ml) than those who survived. In addition, CCP-transfusion caused a significant reduction in the overall inflammatory status of the patients regardless of the severity of disease or outcome, as evidenced by decreasing C-reactive protein, IL6 and ferritin levels. We conclude that, CCP-transfusion is a safe and effective supplementary treatment modality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients characterized by better expected outcome if applied as early as possible. We also observed that, IL-6 may be a suitable laboratory parameter for patient selection and monitoring of CCP therapy effectiveness.","Fodor, E.; Muller, V.; Ivanyi, Z.; Berki, T.; Kuten, O.

622647,Correlation of student performance on clerkship with quality of medical chart documentation in a simulation setting,2021-03-15,"PURPOSE: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a widely used self-report questionnaire to screen depression. Its psychometric property has been tested in many populations including health care workers. We used Rasch measurement theory to examine the psychometric properties of PHQ-9 regarding item difficulty, item fit and the differences between subgroups of respondents classified by sex, age, education and alcohol user status, based on the same overall location of participants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 3204 health care workers of Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital participated and were administered the PHQ-9. Rating scale Rasch measurement modeling was used to examine the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9. RESULTS: The data fitted well to the Rasch model and no violations of the assumption of unidimensionality were observed. All 9 items could form a unidimensional construct of overall depressive severity. Suicidal ideation was the least endorsed while sleep problem was the most. No disordered category and threshold of the rating response were observed. No locally dependent items were observed. No items were found to show differential item functioning across age, sex, education and alcohol consumption. The item-person Wright map showed that the PHQ-9 did not target well with the sample, and a wide gap suggesting few or no items exist to differentiate participants at a certain ability level among the PHQ-9 items. CONCLUSION: The PHQ-9 can be used as a screening questionnaire for major depressive disorder as its psychometric property was verified based on Rasch measurement model. The findings are generally consistent with related studies in other populations. However, the PHQ-9 may be unsuitable for assessing depressive symptoms among health care workers who have low levels of depression.","Jiraniramai, Surin; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Angkurawaranon, Chaisiri; Jiraporncharoen, Wichuda; Wongpakaran, Nahathai",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33854319/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s271987,502

Initially, case reports drew an association between COVID-19 and abnormal coagulation parameters. Subsequently, cross-sectional studies found a high prevalence of thrombosis among ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients. For that reason, certain studies tried to explain the pathogenic mechanisms of thrombosis, one of which was the emergence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL). Although aPL have been found positive in very few patients, their association with thrombotic events stays debatable. Given the thrombotic manifestations of COVID-19 and the potential role of aPL, the catastrophic form of APS (CAPS) might be a major fatal phenomenon. However, to date, there has been no clear association of CAPS to COVID-19. Moreover, since infections, including viral respiratory similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are considered main etiologies for CAPS, it could be possible that SARS-CoV-2 can induce CAPS although no evidence is currently found. High quality studies are needed to develop a clear idea on the pathogenic role of aPL in the progression of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients, and how such patients could be fit into a thromboprophylaxis plan.","El Hasbani, Georges; Taher, Ali T; Jawad, Ali; Uthman, Imad",Clin Med Insights Arthritis Musculoskelet Disord,https://doi.org/10.1177/1179544120978667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328777/,502

There are limited data on clinical, radiological, and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to assess clinical manifestations and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic article search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for studies that discussed pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020, and April 20, 2020, with no restriction on language. Articles were independently evaluated by two expert authors. We included all retrospective studies that reported the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. Results: Forty-seven articles were assessed for eligibility; 13 articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Data is reported for 235 pregnant women with COVID-19. The age range of patients was 25–40 years, and the gestational age ranged from 8 to 40 weeks plus 6 days. Clinical characteristics were fever [138/235 (58.72%)], cough [111/235 (47.23%)], and sore throat [21/235 (8.93%)]. One hundred fifty six out of 235 (66.38%) pregnant women had cesarean section, and 79 (33.62%) had a vaginal delivery. All the patients showed lung abnormalities in CT scan images, and none of the patients died. Neutrophil cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, ALT, and AST were increased but lymphocyte count and albumin levels were decreased. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples were taken to test for SARS-CoV-2 but all found negativ results. Recent published evidence showed the possibility of vertical transmission up to 30%, and neonatal death up to 2.5%. Pre-eclampsia, fetal distress, PROM, pre-mature delivery were the major complications of pregnant women with COVID-19. Conclusions: Our study findings show that the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of the general populations. The possibility of vertical transmission cannot be ignored but C-section should not be routinely recommended anymore according to latest evidences and, in any case, decisions should be taken after proper discussion with the family. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings with a larger number of sample sizes and a long-term follow-up period.","Islam, Md.

It is comprised of ten sentinel sites which send weekly notifications of acute respiratory illness (ARI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to the Office of the National Epidemiologist. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, meetings of the National Pandemic Planning Committee and the Technical Command Committee were convened. The pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented as a result of these meetings form the basis of the results presented in this paper. RESULTS: On June 3, 2009, Barbados reported its first case of 2009 H1N1. From June until October 2009, there were 155 laboratory confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1, with one additional case occurring in January 2010. For the outbreak period (June-October 2009), the surveillance team received reports of 2,483 ARI cases, compared to 412 cases for the same period in 2008. The total hospitalization rate due to SARIs for the year 2009 was 90.1 per 100,000 people, as compared to 7.3 per 100,000 people for 2008. Barbados’ pandemic response was characterized by a strong surveillance system combining active and passive surveillance, good risk communication strategy, a strengthened public and private sector partnership, and effective regional and international collaborations. Community restriction strategies such as school and workplace closures and cancellation of group events were not utilized as public health measures to delay the spread of the virus. Some health care facilities struggled with providing adequate isolation facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The number of confirmed cases was small but the significant surge in ARI and SARI cases indicate that the impact of the virus on the island was moderate. As a result of 2009 H1N1, virological surveillance has improved significantly and local, regional and international partnerships have been strengthened.","Sobers-Grannum, Natasha; Springer, Karen; Ferdinand, Elizabeth; John, Joy St",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143820/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-s1-s10,502

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was performed up to August 19, 2020.We included studies that reported infections with COVID-19 and symptoms of otolaryngology. The retrieved data from the respective studies were evaluated and summarized. The study's immediate result was to assess the combined prevalence of otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the secondary result was to determine the exacerbation of COVID-19 infection in patients with otorhinolaryngological symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies with 16,478 patients were included. Olfactory dysfunction, sneezing and sputum production were the 3 most prevalent otorhinolaryngological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence amongst the prevalent symptoms was 47% (95% CI 29–65; range 0–98; I(2) = 99.58%), 27% (95% CI 11–48; range 12–40; I(2) = 93.34%), and 22% (95% CI 16–30; range 2–56; I(2) = 97.60%), respectively. The proportion of severely ill patients with sputum production and shortness of breath was significantly higher among patients with COVID-19 infections (OR 1.66 [95% CI 1.08–2.54]; P = 0.02, I(2) = 51% and 3.29 [95% CI 1.57–6.90]; P = 0.002, I(2) = 49%, respectively).

This feature makes it a suitable molecular target for diagnostic applications. In this study the full length codon optimized NP gene and its subfragment gene segment was cloned in a bacterial expression vector. The full length NP could be expressed in E. coli at very high level within inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were successfully solubilized, purified under denaturing conditions employing IMAC column and refolded. The non-glycosylated NP was used to immunize mice for hybridoma development. The polyclonal antiserum from animals immunized with this recombinant NP protein was found to specifically recognize the NP and its subfragments, thus demonstrating the immunogenic nature of the recombinant protein. The NP antigen or a subfragment could be useful for developing a sensitive serum diagnostic assay to monitor SARS-CoV outbreaks by detecting the early human anti-SARS antibodies. In addition, the availability of the NP fragments could facilitate epitope mapping of anti-NP monoclonals for identifying suitable sandwich pairs.","Das, Dipankar; Suresh, Mavanur R.",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093406002412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16904198/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093406002412,502

This study aimed to investigate the factors potentially involved in the level of PTSD of Nurses exposed to COVID-19 in China. In this cross-sectional study, male and female Nurses (n = 202) exposed to COVID-19 from HuBei China were included in the final sample. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C) questionnaire and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used for evaluation. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis and spearman correlation test were performed to assess the association between various factors associated with PTSD. The incidence of PTSD in Nurses exposed to COVID-19 was 16.83%, the PCL-C score was 27.00 (21.00–34.00), and the highest score in the three dimensions was avoidance dimension 9.50 (7.00–13.25); multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that job satisfaction and gender were independently associated with lower PCL-C scores (both P < .001); PCL-C scores were correlated with positive coping (r = −0.151, P = .032), negative coping (r = 0.154, P = .029).

Among all the sources of noise pollution, the noise generated by road vehicle traffic significantly affects the quality of urban environments. Concerning the recent imposition of COVID-19 societal lockdown, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the changes in noise pollution levels before, during, and after lockdown phase in different residential, commercial, industrial, and silence zones of the city of Kanpur, India. Utilizing data collected from portable environmental sensors, the average noise levels before lockdown and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown, except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Results further indicated that the impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%), industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period, it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase. Even the risk of sleep disturbance in the residential zone was found to reduce from 37.96% during pre-lockdown to 14.72% during lockdown phase.

This study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between optical density ratio (ODR) measured on bulk tank milk with an indirect Ostertagia ostertagi ELISA and reproduction/mortality parameters. Data were collected between 2008 and 2010 from monitoring carried out on 1643 dairy herds (Normandy, Western France). ODR values of 3 samples from each farm taken from November 2008 to 2010 were averaged and then transformed into a categorical variable. Reproductive and mortality data were obtained from 1444 herds using cow records from government databases. Statistical analysis was carried out using ordinary logistic regression (OLR). The outcome variables were the case–control status of a herd for reproductive factors, age at first calving and inter-calving intervals, and mortality ratios of various age classes. The effect of the categorical ODR variable was studied and several potential confounder herd factors were used to improve the model fit. A significant relationship was found between high Ostertagia ODR levels and a late age at the first calving (>34.5 months) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.94, p < 0.001). No significant relationship was observed with OLR for inter-calving intervals although bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR levels had longer inter-calving intervals than herds with low ODR level (first inter-calving interval in herds with low vs. high ODR levels = 412 days vs. 422 days, p < 0.001; other inter-calving intervals = 408 days vs. 413 days, p < 0.01). A high ODR level was also associated with high mortality of calves between 0 and 30 days of life (mortality ratio > 6%) (OR = 1.43, p < 0.05) and between 91 and 365 days (ratio > 3%) (OR = 1.72, p < 0.01). No significant relationship was observed with multivariate approach for mortalities in other classes by age, but bivariate analysis showed that herds with high ODR level had higher mortalities than herds with low ODR levels (mortality between 31 and 90 days in herds with low vs. high ODR levels = 1.89% vs. 2.91%, p < 0.001; mortality after 365 days = 1.67% vs. 2.93%, p < 0.001).

631907,COVID-19 and Employment: Insights from the Sub-Saharan African Experience,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing declines in childhood immunization rates. We examined potential COVID-19-related changes in pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use, subsequent impact on childhood and adult pneumococcal disease rates, and how those changes might affect the favorability of PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised adults aged ≥65 years. METHODS: A Markov model estimated pediatric disease resulting from decreased PCV13 use in children aged <5 years; absolute decreases from 10 to 50% for 1–2 years duration were examined, assuming no catch-up vaccination and that decreased vaccination led to proportionate increases in PCV13 serotype pneumococcal disease in children and seniors. Integrating pediatric model output into a second Markov model examining 65-year-olds, we estimated the cost effectiveness of older adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies while accounting for potential epidemiologic changes from decreased pediatric vaccination. RESULTS: One year of 10–50% absolute decreases in PCV13 use in <5-year-olds increased pneumococcal disease by an estimated 4–19% in seniors; 2 years of decreased use increased senior rates by 8–38%. In seniors, a >53% increase in pneumococcal disease was required to favor PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors at a $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, which corresponded to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of >50% over a 2-year period. In sensitivity analyses, senior PCV13 vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 receipt were within plausible ranges, despite model assumptions favoring PCV13 use in seniors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to be both substantial and prolonged to make heightened PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors economically favorable.","Smith, Kenneth J.; Wateska, Angela R.; Nowalk, Mary Patricia; Lin, Chyongchiou J.; Harrison, Lee H.; Schaffner, William; Zimmerman, Richard K.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167834/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21007738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21007738,502
633515,Massive Multiplexing Can Deliver a $1 Test for COVID-19,2020-05-08,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Several biological functions, more or less sustained by experimental evidence, have been proposed for vitamin D and in addition to its role in bone health, its optimal status has also been related with a reduced risk of allergy, obesity, and respiratory tract infections. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, vitamin D levels have been put into relation with both the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. The results from different studies are, however, not conclusive, since several variables impact on this relationship. In this study, we investigated the impact of the stringent confinement during the March–April 2020 lockdown on vitamin D levels and the relationship with the recorded sun exposure in the considered area (Milano, Italy). Furthermore, we investigated the eventual relationship between vitamin D levels and SARS-CoV-2 infection in different age groups throughout the pandemic, including the first and second wave, as well as the lockdown and between-lockdown periods. Taken together, our data suggest that 25-(OH)D levels are neither related with sun exposure nor with SARS-CoV-2 infection. ABSTRACT: Background. We investigated the changes in 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25-(OH)D] concentrations values, during the first and the second pandemic waves and the impact of the lockdown periods, with their different approaches to home confinement, among different age groups. Methods. Daily cloud-modified vitamin D UV dose (UVDVC), for the area of interest (Milano, Italy), was obtained. Single-center 25-(OH)D determinations from 40,996 individuals in a 2019 (pre-pandemic), 32,355 individuals from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (containing the first pandemic wave) and 27,684 individuals from 1 June to 30 November 2020 (containing the second wave) were compared to investigate both the effect of the lockdown on vitamin D status and the association between 25-(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Results. No direct association was found between UVDVC, 25-(OH)D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The stringent confinement implemented during the first wave lockdown has not had any effect on 25-(OH)D status, although some peculiar time-restricted profile behaviors can be deduced, possibly due to vitamin D supplementation habits and features of those patients who presented to the hospital during the lockdown period. Conclusions. Although our data do not suggest any direct relationship between 25-(OH)D status, sun exposure, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, an indirect protective role cannot be excluded.","Ferrari, Davide; Locatelli, Massimo; Faraldi, Martina; Lombardi, Giovanni",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10030237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808612/,502

Although mortality is low, infection with IBV results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries. Despite the economic importance of IBV and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection, significant gaps in our knowledge exist. The aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain. The air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment, so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions. Both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of the virus produced significant lesions; however, the lesions progressed more rapidly in the birds receiving the pathogenic strain. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in birds infected with the pathogenic strain of virus, IBV spike protein is detected first in the ciliated cells lining the air sac. These preliminary data provide important clues regarding potential mechanisms for IBV tissue tropism and spread and show that the nature of the virus isolate influences the early progression of IBV infection.","Bezuidenhout, A.; Mondal, S.P.; Buckles, E.L.",J Comp Pathol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997511000259; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997511000259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21420689/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.01.011,502

A functional effect of the mini-conversion was introduction of the C1 epitope into HLA-B*46:01, making it an exceptional HLA-B allotype that is recognized by the C1-specific natural killer cell receptor KIR2DL3. High-resolution mass spectrometry showed that HLA-B*46:01 has a low diversity peptidome that is distinct from those of its parents. A minority (21%) of HLA-B*46:01 peptides, with common C-terminal characteristics, form ligands for KIR2DL3. The HLA-B*46:01 peptidome is predicted to be enriched for peptide antigens derived from Mycobacterium leprae.

Data from prior to the pandemic are needed to provide robust assessments of the impact of COVID‐19 on vulnerable children. METHOD: The present study capitalises on an ongoing study of primary school children (4–8 years) identified as ‘at‐risk’ for mental health problems by teachers. We collected mental health and socio‐economic data prior to the pandemic and re‐assessed this cohort (n = 142) via researcher‐led video calls during the pandemic to evaluate the social and emotional impacts of COVID‐19 for these families. RESULTS: Mental health problems, particularly anxiety, increased significantly in these children. Parental mental health difficulties (anxiety and depression) were also prevalent. There were higher reports of financial stress during lockdown amongst low‐income families previously identified as living in poverty, prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Financial strain was found to indirectly predict increases in child mental health problems through parental mental health. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the pandemic exacerbated mental health problems in already vulnerable children. These negative outcomes were explained by financial stress (e.g., lost employment, loss of income and inability to pay bills), which was negatively linked to parental mental health.","Adegboye, Dolapo; Williams, Ffion; Collishaw, Stephan; Shelton, Katherine; Langley, Kate; Hobson, Christopher; Burley, Daniel; van Goozen, Stephanie",JCPP advances,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcv2.12005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485985/,502

Comorbidities might increase the risk for less favourable outcomes, but it has been reported that patients with antecedents of asthma or allergic diseases were under-represented among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Aiming to compare the clinical evolution of patients with antecedents of asthma or allergic diseases and patients without these antecedents, we analyzed a series of 113 consecutive patients with Covid-19 in a regional hospital in Spain. We collected and analyzed the putative effect of the 16 most common co-morbidities, previous treatment with 33 drug classes, symptoms, radiological, and laboratory findings at admission and drug therapy after admission. Predictors of long hospital stays were older age (P = 0.002), low oxygen saturation (P = 0.001) and bilateral radiological findings at admission (P = 0.023). Predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission were the previous use of calcium-channel blockers (P = 0.005), proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.017), low oxygen saturation (P = 0.002), high leukocyte count (P = 0.011), and high D-dimer values (P = 0.005). Predictors of mortality were older age (P = 0.001), antecedents of cerebrovascular disorders (P = 0.034), previous use of oral anticoagulants (P = 0.009) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (P = 0.003), and increased levels of interleukin-6 (P = 0.001).

The aviation industry maintains that the probability of contracting the illness is small based on reported cases, modelling and data from aerosol dispersion experiments conducted on-board aircraft. METHODS: Using experimentally derived aerosol dispersion data for a B777–200 aircraft and a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation we estimate inflight infection probability for a range of scenarios involving quanta generation rate and face mask efficiency. Quanta generation rates were selected based on COVID-19 events reported in the literature while mask efficiency was determined from the aerosol dispersion experiments. RESULTS: The MID-AFT cabin exhibits the highest infection probability. The calculated maximum individual infection probability (without masks) for a 2-hour flight in this section varies from 4.5% for the ‘Mild Scenario’ to 60.2% for the ‘Severe Scenario’ although the corresponding average infection probability varies from 0.1% to 2.5%. For a 12-hour flight, the corresponding maximum individual infection probability varies from 24.1% to 99.6% and the average infection probability varies from 0.8% to 10.8%. If all passengers wear face masks throughout the 12-hour flight, the average infection probability can be reduced by approximately 73%/32% for high/low efficiency masks. If face masks are worn by all passengers except during a one-hour meal service, the average infection probability is increased by 59%/8% compared to the situation where the mask is not removed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis has demonstrated that while there is a significant reduction in aerosol concentration due to the nature of the cabin ventilation and filtration system, this does not necessarily mean that there is a low probability or risk of in-flight infection. However, mask wearing, particularly high-efficiency ones, significantly reduces this risk.","Wang, Zhaozhi; Galea, Edwin R; Grandison, Angus; Ewer, John; Jia, Fuchen",J Travel Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615383/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taab023,502
642668,Changes of Laboratory Cardiac Markers and Mechanisms of Cardiac Injury in Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative evidence suggests that Brexit has had a severe and negative impact on European doctors, with many medical staff leaving the UK. This study provides a detailed examination of European doctors’ feelings towards Brexit, their intentions to leave the UK, and factors that may contribute to their potential decisions to migrate. METHODS: An online questionnaire which included three optional free-text questions explored self-identifying UK-based, European doctors’ views of Brexit. The three questions prompted responses on how Brexit has impacted their personal lives, their professional lives, and their future migration decisions. Fifty-nine doctors participated in the questionnaire with 52 (88.1%) providing one or more responses to the three free-text questions. Twenty-seven doctors provided answers to all three free-text questions (51.9% of included sample). Thematic analysis was used to analyse this qualitative data. RESULTS: Brexit was reported by the majority of participants to have a profound impact, although some respondents felt it was too soon to assess the potential consequences. Five themes emerged including: feeling unwelcome in the UK, Brexit as racism, uncertainty on legal ability to work, strain on relationships, and in contrast, a current lack of concern about Brexit. CONCLUSIONS: To mitigate the adverse personal and professional impact of Brexit, healthcare providers should provide financial and legal support to doctors applying for settlement in the UK, ensure they are addressing issues of racial and ethnic inequality in hiring, promotion, and pay, and work towards making clinical work environments inclusive for all staff and patients.

There is a scarcity of data on the consequences of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infections in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from emerging countries. METHODS. Here, we present a cohort study of 13 transplant centers in India including 250 KTR (226 living and 24 deceased donors) with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 positivity from March 23, 2020, until September 15, 2020. We detailed demographics, immunosuppression regimen, clinical profile, treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS. Median age of transplant recipients was 43 years, and recipients presented at a median of 3.5 years after transplant. Most common comorbidities (94%) included arterial hypertension (84%) and diabetes (32%); presenting symptoms at the time of COVID-19 included fever (88%), cough (72%), and sputum production (52%). Clinical severity ranged from asymptomatic (6%), mild (60%), and moderate (20%) to severe (14%). Strategies to modify immunosuppressants included discontinuation of antimetabolites without changes in calcineurin inhibitors and steroids (60%). Risk factors for mortality included older age; dyspnea; severe disease; obesity; allograft dysfunction before COVID-19 infection; acute kidney injury; higher levels of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 level, and procalcitonin; chest X-ray abnormality, and intensive care unit/ventilator requirements. Overall patient mortality was 11.6% (29 of 250), 14.5% (29 of 200) in hospitalized patients, 47% (25 of 53) in intensive care unit patients, and 96.7% (29 of 30) in patients requiring ventilation. KTRs with mild COVID-19 symptoms (n = 50) were managed as outpatients to optimize the utilization of scarce resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS. Mortality rates in COVID-19-positive KTR appear to be higher than those in nonimmunosuppressed patients, and high mortality was noted among those requiring intensive care and those on ventilator.","Kute, Vivek B.; Bhalla, Anil K.; Guleria, Sandeep; Ray, Deepak S.; Bahadur, Madan M.; Shingare, Ashay; Hegde, Umapati; Gang, Sishir; Raju, Sreebhushan; Patel, Himanshu V.; Jain, Siddharth; Godara, Suraj; Modi, Pranjal; Gumber, Manoj; Engineer, Divyesh P.; Dalal, Sonal; Darji, Prakash; Balwani, Manish; Patel, Ansy H.; Mishra, Vineet V.",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350674/,502

Evidence from Thailand’s tax return data,2021-08-16,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of myocardial injury biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 patients that were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to February 15, 2020. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that cTnI-ultra had the highest area under the curve (AUC) at 0.855, with a sensitivity of 67.3% and a specificity of 88.7% for the prediction of in-hospital mortality. Patients with higher troponin I-ultra (cTnI-ultra), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were associated with higher mortality, compared to those who lower levels. The multivariable cox regression indicated that age (hazard ratio (HR) 3.450, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.627–7.314, P = 0.001), coronary heart disease (HR 1.855, 95% CI 1.006–3.421; P = 0.048), elevated cTnI-ultra (HR 3.083, 95% CI 1.616–5.883, P = 0.001), elevated CK-MB (HR 2.907, 95% CI 1.233–6.854; P = 0.015), and elevated NT-proBNP (HR 5.776, 95% CI 2.272–14.682; P < 0.001) were associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: cTnI-ultra might be the best predictor of in-hospital mortality among myocardial injury biomarkers.

Yet, there are vast differences in how quickly governments implemented NPIs. In this paper, we analyze the role of public attention, measured as the share of daily Google searches in a country related to COVID-19, in the timing of the NPI responses. We first show that public attention depends strongly on whether there are cases in own country. We then show that countries with high levels of public attention are more likely to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions, even after controlling for the number of cases and deaths. Finally, we show that the extent to which a government responds to public attention is highly dependent on the country's institutional quality. The positive effect of public attention on policy implementation is driven entirely by countries with good institutions.","Aksoy, C.

The study aims to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume in Scotland. Secondary objectives are to measure the success of restarting elective services and model the time required to bridge the gap left by the first period of suspension. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Scottish Arthroplasty Project dataset. All patients undergoing elective THAs and TKAs during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020 were included. A negative binomial regression model using historical case-volume and mid-year population estimates was built to project the future case-volume of THA and TKA in Scotland. The median monthly case volume was calculated for the period 2008 to 2019 (baseline) and compared to the actual monthly case volume for 2020. The time taken to eliminate the deficit was calculated based upon the projected monthly workload and with a potential workload between 100% to 120% of baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the period 2008 to 2019, primary TKA and THA volume fell by 61.1% and 53.6%, respectively. Since restarting elective services, Scottish hospitals have achieved approximately 40% to 50% of baseline monthly activity. With no changes in current workload, by 2021 there would be a reduction of 9,180 and 10,170 for THA and TKA, respectively. Conversely, working at 120% baseline monthly output, it would take over four years to eliminate the deficit for both TKA and THA. CONCLUSION: This national study demonstrates the significant impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on overall THA and TKA volume. In the six months after resuming elective services, Scottish hospitals averaged less than 50% normal monthly output. Loss of operating capacity will increase treatment delays and likely worsen overall morbidity.

644415,Path to Advanced Healthcare in the Wake of COVID-19,2020-04-30,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a public health concern that causes acute lower respiratory tract infection. So far, no vaccine candidate under development has reached the market and the only licensed product to prevent RSV infection in at-risk infants and young children is a monoclonal antibody (Synagis(®)). Polyclonal human anti-RSV hyper-immune immunoglobulins (Igs) have also been used but were superseded by Synagis(®) owing to their low titer and large infused volume. Here we report a new drug class of immunoglobulins, derived from human non hyper-immune plasma that was generated by an innovative bioprocess, called Ig cracking, combining expertises in plasma-derived products and affinity chromatography. By using the RSV fusion protein (F protein) as ligand, the Ig cracking process provided a purified and concentrated product, designated hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG, composed of at least 15-20% target-specific-antibodies from normal plasma. These anti-RSV Ig displayed a strong in vitro neutralization effect on RSV replication. Moreover, we described a novel prophylactic strategy based on local nasal administration of this unique hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG solution using a mouse model of infection with bioluminescent RSV. Our results demonstrated that very low doses of hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG can be administered locally to ensure rapid and efficient inhibition of virus infection. Thus, the general hyper-enriched Ig concept appeared a promising approach and might provide solutions to prevent and treat other infectious diseases. IMPORTANCE: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the major cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children, and is also recognized as a cause of morbidity in the elderly. There are still no vaccines and no efficient antiviral therapy against this virus. Here, we described an approach of passive immunization with a new class of hyper-enriched anti-RSV immunoglobulins (Ig) manufactured from human normal plasma. This new class of immunoglobulin plasma derived product is generated by an innovative bioprocess, called Ig cracking, which requires a combination of expertise in both plasma derived products and affinity chromatography. The strong efficacy in a small volume of these hyper-enriched anti-RSV IgG to inhibit the viral infection was demonstrated using a mouse model. This new class of immunoglobulin plasma-derived products could be applied to other pathogens to address specific therapeutic needs in the field of infectious diseases or even pandemics, such as COVID-19.","Jacque, Emilie; Chottin, Claire; Laubreton, Daphné; Nogre, Michel; Ferret, Cécile; de Marcos, Sandrine; Baptista, Linda; Drajac, Carole; Mondon, Philippe; De Romeuf, Christophe; Rameix-Welti, Marie-Anne; Eléouët, Jean-François; Chtourou, Sami; Riffault, Sabine; Perret, Gérald; Descamps, Delphyne",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.683902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163482/,502

While immunological correlates of disease severity have been identified, how they act together to determine the outcomes is unknown. Here, using a new mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyze diverse clinical datasets and predict that a subtle interplay between innate and CD8 T-cell responses underlies disease heterogeneity. Our model considers essential features of these immune arms and immunopathology from cytokines and effector cells. Model predictions provided excellent fits to patient data and, by varying the strength and timing of the immune arms, quantitatively recapitulated viral load changes in mild, moderate, and severe disease, and death. Additionally, they explained several confounding observations, including viral recrudescence after symptom loss, prolonged viral positivity before cure, and mortality despite declining viral loads. Together, a robust conceptual understanding of COVID-19 outcomes emerges, bearing implications for interventions.","Chatterjee, B.; Singh Sandhu, H.; Dixit, N.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests itself through a wide spectrum of symptoms that can evolve to severe presentations as pneumonia and several non-respiratory complications. Increased susceptibility to COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality have been linked to associated comorbidities as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and, recently, to obesity. Similarly, individuals living with obesity are at greater risk to develop clinical complications and to have poor prognosis in severe influenza pneumonia. Immune and metabolic dysfunctions associated with the increased susceptibility to influenza infection are linked to obesity-associated low-grade inflammation, compromised immune and endocrine systems, and to high cardiovascular risk. These preexisting conditions may favor virological persistence, amplify immunopathological responses and worsen hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 as well. In this review we highlight the main factors and the current state of the art on obesity as risk factor for influenza and COVID-19 hospitalization, severe respiratory manifestations, extrapulmonary complications and even death. Finally, immunoregulatory mechanisms of severe influenza pneumonia in individuals with obesity are addressed as likely factors involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Andrade, Fernanda B.; Gualberto, Ana; Rezende, Camila; Percegoni, Nathércia; Gameiro, Jacy; Hottz, Eugenio D.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816341/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.638852,502

No study to date has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in a large, urban emergency medical services (EMS) system. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007. Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. χ(2) tests were performed to compare the difference. RESULTS: Seven thousand thirty-two cases of ACS were identified by the EMS system physicians during the 2-year study period, including 536 cases of acute myocardial infarction. A significant variation of circadian distribution of ACS was observed in both 24-hour (P < .001) and 2-hour (P < .001) interval time course. Two peaks were observed in the morning from 0800 to 1000 and approaching midnight from 2200 to 2400. Increases of 50% and 60.8% in the morning and evening peaks were found, respectively, when compared with the early morning baseline (nadir). No significant difference was found among the accumulated cases in 2 years on each day in a week (P = .203). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that, in the Beijing metropolitan area, the presentation of ACS has significant circadian rhythm characterized by 2 peaks within 24 hours, the morning peak is 0800 to 1000, and the late evening peak is 2200 to 2400.

649761,The propagation of economic impacts through supply chains: The case of a mega-city lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19,2020-09-15,"Life education, also known as life and death education, is an important subject in Taiwan with institutions (e.g., high school) offering degree programs and courses that focus on quality learning and implementation of life education. What is interesting from the perspective of Taiwanese education is that the teaching of life education also incorporates a number of Eastern-derived and conceptualized tenets, for example, Buddhist teaching and the importance of spiritual wisdom. This premise contends then that life education in Taiwan, in general, is concerned with the promotion, fulfillment, and cherishing of quality life experiences (e.g., personal contentment, happiness). One example of life education, which resonates with other spiritual beliefs and religious faiths (e.g., Hinduism), is related to spiritual cultivation and the enlightenment of life wisdom. Our own teaching of the subject, likewise, places emphasis on the goal of teaching students to seek meaningful understanding of and appreciation for three major, interrelated components of life education: life wisdom, life practice, and life care. It has been acknowledged, to a certain degree, that life education has made meaningful contributions, such as the creation and facilitation of a civil, vibrant society, and that many Taiwanese individuals show dignity, respect for elders, and reverence for spiritual and religious faiths. For example, aside from high-quality hospice care, many Taiwanese engage in different types of benevolent acts (e.g., providing spiritual advice to someone who is dying), where possible. Life education is a beneficial subject for teaching and learning as its theoretical understanding may help individuals cope with pathologies and negative conditions and life experiences. One negative life experience, in this case, is the ultimate fate of humankind: death. Approaching death and/or the onset of grief is something that we all have to experience. How does one approach death? It is not easy feat, and of course, grief for a loved one is personal, and some of us struggle with this. We contend that spiritual cultivation and enlightenment, arising from life education, may assist us with the topic of death (e.g., the possibility of transcendence beyond the realm of life). More importantly however, from our own teaching experiences and research development, we strongly believe and rationalize that the subject of life education could, indeed, coincide with and support the paradigm of positive psychology (Seligman, 1999, 2010; Seligman and Csíkszentmihályi, 2000). Forming the premise of the present conceptual analysis article, we propose that a person’s “spiritual and enlightened self,” reflecting the convergence of three major aspects of life education (i.e., philosophical reflection, enrichment of personal well-being, and spiritual cultivation), would result in the initiation and creation of a number of virtues and positive characteristics, for example, having a positive outlook in life, having a perceived sense of spirituality, showing compassion, forgiveness, etc. These virtues and quality characteristics, from our philosophical reasoning, are equivalent to those qualities that the paradigm of positive psychology advocates for. In summary, we conceptualize that the subject of life education, from the perspective of Taiwanese education, may intertwine with the paradigm of positive psychology. A person’s spiritual and enlightened self, or his/her “holistic self,” from our rationalization, is the ultimate optimal life experience that he/she may have, enabling him/her to address the gamut of life conditions and experiences. The distinctive nature of life education in this case, as a point of summary, is that it incorporates spiritual beliefs and religious faiths (e.g., Buddhist faith), encouraging a person to seek nature and divine–human relationships, as well as to contemplate and to explore the complex nature of his/her inner self. The notion of Buddhist samsâra, for example, as “evidence” of spirituality, entailing the endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, may provide a person with hope into the afterlife. Such esoteric discourse, we contend, is positive and optimistic, allowing individuals to discard the dividing line between life and death.","Phan, Huy P.; Ngu, Bing H.; Chen, Si Chi; Wu, Lijuing; Lin, Wei-Wen; Hsu, Chao-Sheng",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.580186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117246/,502
649792,The foundations of a policy for the use of social robots in care,2020-09-06,"Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus that causes sporadic fatal disease in cats characterized by vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation and effusive pleuritis/peritonitis. Histologic changes in lymphoid tissues include lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid depletion, histiocytosis, and granuloma formation. Although viremia occurs, histologic lesions are not found uniformly throughout lymphoid tissues. We used experimental infection of cats with a highly pathogenic FIPV isolate, UCD8, to study histologic lesions, virus replication, and cytokine expression in multiple lymphoid tissues during the effusive phase of disease. Viral RNA was found in 76% of central tissues (mediastinal lymph node, spleen, mesenteric lymph node) examined, as compared to 27% of peripheral tissues (popliteal lymph node, cervical lymph node, femoral bone marrow). All tissues positive for virus replication also demonstrated lymphoid depletion. Generally, affected tissues had lower levels of IL-4 and IL-12–p40 mRNA and higher levels of IL-10 mRNA. Although no differences in IFN-γ or TNF-α mRNA were measured, TNF-α protein expression was greater in affected tissues and demonstrated a shift in the source of TNF-α from macrophages to lymphocytes. Together, these results colocalize FIPV replication, lymphocyte depletion in tissues, and alterations in cytokine transcription and translation. A possible role for TNF-α in the previously described FIPV-induced lymphocyte apoptosis is also suggested.","Dean, Gregg A.; Olivry, Thierry; Stanton, Christine; Pedersen, Niels C.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14637034/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113503002918; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113503002918,502

650857,Facilitating Communication in the Academic Environment During the Pandemic Using TeamSTEPPS Tools,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulation is imperative to inform local public health response. However, it has been hindered by limited access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and testing infrastructure. In regions with limited testing capacity, routinely collected health data might be leveraged to identify geographical locales experiencing higher than expected rates of COVID-19-associated symptoms for more specific testing activities. METHODS: We developed syndromic surveillance tools to analyse aggregated health facility data on COVID-19-related indicators in seven low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Liberia. We used time series models to estimate the expected monthly counts and 95% prediction intervals based on 4 years of previous data. Here, we detail and provide resources for our data preparation procedures, modelling approach and data visualisation tools with application to Liberia. RESULTS: To demonstrate the utility of these methods, we present syndromic surveillance results for acute respiratory infections (ARI) at health facilities in Liberia during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through August 2020). For each month, we estimated the deviation between the expected and observed number of ARI cases for 325 health facilities and 15 counties to identify potential areas of SARS-CoV-2 circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic surveillance can be used to monitor health facility catchment areas for spikes in specific symptoms which may indicate SARS-CoV-2 circulation.

A total of 372 tissues or serum samples collected from pigs distributed in 9 provinces/municipalities of China during the period from February 2011 to November 2012 were assayed for T. gondii antigens and antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, while the PCR was designed for the detection of the PRRSV, CSFV and PCV-2, respectively. The total positive rate of T. gondii, PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 9.14% (34/372), 50.00% (186/372), 37.10% (138/372) and 3.23% (12/372), respectively. Among the 34 T. gondii positive samples, 26 samples were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and viruses, while the remaining eight samples were infected with T. gondii alone. In addition, the co-infection rate of T. gondii with PRSSV, T. gondii with PRSSV and CSFV, T. gondii with PRSSV and PCV-2, T. gondii with CSFV and PCV-2, T. gondii with PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 1.61% (6/372), 4.03% (15/372), 0.27% (1/372), 0.27% (1/372) and 0.81% (3/372), respectively. The results of the present survey revealed that PRRSV and CSFV were the common pathogens co-existing with porcine toxoplasmosis in China, and both of them could increase the chances of T. gondii infection in pig. This is the first report of T. gondii co-infections with viruses in pigs. It is very important to understand the interactions of parasite and virus, and can be used as reference data for the control and prevention of co-infections of T. gondii and viruses in pigs.","WANG, Shuai; ZHANG, Meng; LIU, Xin-chao; LIN, Tao; YANG, Han-chun; YUAN, Shi-shan; ZHAO, Guang-wei; IA, Hassan; YAN, Ruo-feng; SONG, Xiao-kai; XU, Li-xin; LI, Xiang-rui",Journal of Integrative Agriculture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288950/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311915610449; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(15)61044-9; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095311915610449,502

A study of socially responsible SMEs during economic crisis,2020-08-04,"The etiology and clinical course of bipolar disorder are considered to be determined by genetic and environmental factors. Although the kindling hypothesis emphasizes the impact of environmental factors on initial onset, their connection to the outcome and clinical course have been poorly established. Hence, there have been numerous research efforts to investigate the impact of environmental factors on the clinical course of illness. Our aim is to outline recent research on the impact of environmental determinants on the clinical course of bipolar disorder. We carried out a computer‐aided search to find publications on an association between environmental factors, life events, and the clinical course of bipolar disorder. Publications in the reference lists of suitable papers have also been taken into consideration. We performed a narrative overview on all eligible publications. The available body of data supports an association between environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar disorder. These factors comprise prenatal, early‐life, and entire lifespan aspects. Given varying sample sizes and several methodological limitations, the reported quality and extent of the association between environmental factors and the clinical course of bipolar disorder should be interpreted with utmost caution.

Small molecules targeting this assembly are being investigated as drug candidates to contrast SARS-CoV-2. In this context, chloroquine, an antimalarial agent proposed as a repurposed drug to treat coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), was hypothesized to bind RBD among its other mechanisms. Similarly, artemisinin and its derivatives are being studied as potential antiviral agents. In this work, we investigated the interaction of artemisinin, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin and chloroquine with RBD by means of computational tools and in vitro. Docking studies showed that the compounds interfere with the same region of the protein and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the stability of the predicted complexes. Bio-layer interferometry showed that chloroquine dose-dependently binds RBD (KD = 35.9 µM) more efficiently than artemisinins.","Ribaudo, Giovanni; Coghi, Paolo; Yang, Li Jun; Ng, Jerome P.

There is also a lack of studies comparing clinical characteristics of the non-influenza pathogens with influenza and amongst themselves. METHODS: From May 2009 through October 2012, 7733 consenting cases of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) (temperature [greater than or equal to]37.5degreesC with cough or sorethroat) and controls in the Singapore military had clinical data and nasal washes collected prospectively. Nasal washes underwent multiplex PCR, and the analysis was limited to viral mono-infections. RESULTS: 49% of cases tested positive for at least one virus, of whom 10% had multiple infections. 53% of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of influenza-like illness (ILI), of whom 52% were positive for at least one virus. The most frequent etiologies for mono-infections among FRI cases were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (13%), Influenza B (13%) and coxsackevirus (9%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of ILI for influenza among FRI cases were 72%, 48%, 40% and 69% respectively. On logistic regression, there were marked differences in the prevalence of different symptoms and signs between viruses with fever more prevalent amongst influenza and adenovirus infections than other viruses. CONCLUSION: There are multiple viral etiologies for FRI and ILI with differing clinical symptoms in the Singapore military. Influenza and coxsackevirus were the most common etiology for FRI, while influenza and adenoviruses displayed the most febrile symptoms. Further studies should explore these differences and possible interventions.","Tan, Xin Quan; Zhao, Xiahong; Lee, Vernon J; Loh, Jin Phang; Tan, Boon Huan; Koh, Wee Hong Victor; Ng, Sock Hoon; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Cook, Alex Richard",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735158/,502

Its haemagglutinin showed epitope structures that were not recognized by the immune system of children and young adults as a memory response. The pandemic influenza virus consisted of quasispecies with a mixture of genome parts from human, avian, and American and Eurasian swine origin. This new virus caused all symptoms typically for influenza as abrupt onset, fever >39°C, sore throat with all signs of inflammation, myalgia and arthralgia. In summer 2009 all infections in Europe were mild, while until winter there was a higher lethality in Brazil, Mexico and Argentine; but still in winter 2009 in Europe the pathogenic action of the circulating virus was mild. European isolates showed a neuraminidase inhibitor resistance of around 10%. Prevention of spread of the novel influenza virus H1N1 2009 is mainly by hygienic measurements as: avoid contact to infected, distance from infected, hand disinfection, protection of eye and nose mucous membranes, avoid aerosol formation during blowing the nose and sneezing. It is recommended to use single way tissue handkerchiefs and to depose them in a covered waste reservoir. For further prevention of influenza virus transmission three different vaccines are available in Europe since October 2009. This virus or at least some genomic parts will persist in the human population for the next 2 years.","Guertler, Lutz G.",DoctorConsult - The Journal.

A Rapid Virtual Audit of COVID-19 Press Briefings in LMICs,2020-07-29,"Major life events like COVID-19 have the potential to change how people think about and use transport systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an extended period of disruption in peoples’ lives and could result in long-term changes towards travel attitudes, and use of transport services. There has previously been little research available on changes towards travel attitudes and use of domestic travel as a result of pandemics. To investigate the changes in attitudes to travel resulting from COVID-19 we distributed a survey to 787 respondents in Australia and New Zealand asking about car use, car sharing, public transport, and air travel before, during, and after COVID-19 travel restrictions. The results showed attitudes towards travel were negatively affected, particularly attitudes towards public transport and international air travel. Further, although respondents indicated some recovery in attitudes when asked to consider when travel restrictions were removed, they did not recover to the levels of positivity seen pre-COVID. There were slight differences between the two countries in their post-COVID attitudes, possibly due to their different experience of travel restriction. Both countries, however, may be useful as a preview for the rest of the world given the early cessation of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the survey.","Thomas, Francene M.F.; Charlton, Samuel G.; Lewis, Ioni; Nandavar, Sonali",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221001299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226890/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221001299?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100423,502

However, a proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 may never receive a diagnostic test, while many of those who are tested may receive a false negative result. Consequently, cases reported through testing of symptomatic individuals represent only a fraction of the total number of infections, and this proportion is expected to vary depending on changes in natural factors and variability in test-seeking behaviour. Here we combine a number of data sources from England to estimate the proportion of infections that have resulted in a positive diagnosis. Using published estimates of the incubation period distribution and time-dependent test sensitivity, we estimate SARS-CoV-2 incidence from daily reported diagnostic test data. By calibrating this estimate against surveillance data we find that approximately 25% of infections were consistently reported through diagnostic testing before November 2020. This percentage increased through the final months of 2020, predominantly in regions with a large presence of the the UK variant of concern (VOC), before falling rapidly in the last two weeks of January 2021. These changes are not explained by variation in rates of lateral flow device or PCR testing, but are consistent with there being an increased probability for the VOC that infection will result in an eventual positive diagnosis.","Colman, E.; Enright, J.; Puspitarani, G.

659770,Virtual Teams in Times of Pandemic: Factors That Influence Performance,2021-02-17,"Background. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which can be fatal and is responsible for a global pandemic. Variants with increased transmissibility or the potential to evade immunity have emerged and represent a threat to global pandemic control. Variants of concern (VOC) can be identified by sequencing of viral RNA, or by more rapid methods for detection of subsets of signature mutations. Methods. We developed a multiplex, real-time RT-PCR assay (cobas SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1) for the qualitative detection and differentiation of three key SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the viral spike protein: del 69-70, E484K and N501Y. Analytical sensitivity and accuracy were evaluated at three testing sites using clinical specimens from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to several different lineages, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Results. The limit of detection for E484K was between 180 and 620 IU/mL for the three different isolates tested. For N501Y, the LOD was between 270 and 720 IU/mL (five isolates), while for del 69-70, it was 80 - 92 IU/mL (two isolates). Valid test results were obtained with all clinical specimens that were positive using routine diagnostic tests. Compared to sequencing (Sanger and next-generation), test results were 100% concordant at all three loci; no false positive or false negative results were observed. Conclusions. Data collected at three independent laboratories indicates excellent performance and concordance of cobas SARS-CoV-2 Variant Set 1 with sequencing. New sets of primers and probes that target additional loci can be rapidly deployed in response to the identification of other emerging variants.","Bier, C.; Edelmann, A.; Theil, K.; Schwarzer, R.; Deichner, M.; Gessner, A.; Hiergeist, A.; Rentschler, U.; Gohl, P.; Kuchta, A.; Manohar, C.; Santini, C.; Duncan, D.; Canchola, J.; Sun, J.; Spier, G.; Simon, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.21254713; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.05.21254713v1?rss=1,502

Methods: In this prospective study, 206 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from regional medical institutions between December 20, 2019, and April 10, 2020. We collated a range of data to derive and validate a predictive model for COVID-19 progression, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and cytokine levels. Variation analysis, along with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Boruta algorithms, was used for modeling. The performance of the derived models was evaluated by specificity, sensitivity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Results: We used the LASSO algorithm and logistic regression to develop a model that can accurately predict the risk of progression to severe COVID-19. The model incorporated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interleukin (IL)-6, expectoration, fatigue, lymphocyte ratio (LYMR), aspartate transaminase (AST), and creatinine (CREA). The model yielded a satisfactory predictive performance with an AUC of 0.9104 and 0.8792 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The final model was then used to create a nomogram that was packaged into an open-source and predictive calculator for clinical use. The model is freely available online at https://severeconid-19predction.shinyapps.io/SHINY/. Conclusion: In this study, we developed an open-source and free predictive calculator for COVID-19 progression based on ALT, IL-6, expectoration, fatigue, LYMR, AST, and CREA. The validated model can effectively predict progression to severe COVID-19, thus providing an efficient option for early and personalized management and the allocation of appropriate medical resources.","Meng, Zirui; Wang, Minjin; Zhao, Zhenzhen; Zhou, Yongzhao; Wu, Ying; Guo, Shuo; Li, Mengjiao; Zhou, Yanbing; Yang, Shuyu; Li, Weimin; Ying, Binwu",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.663145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113636/,502

One of the consequences of exposure to disasters/pandemics is an increase in alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine what predisposing (distal) and pandemic‐related (proximal) factors were associated with increased drinking in the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: On 1 April 2020, 5158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid‐19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre‐pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID‐19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self‐reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health‐care worker were not associated with increased drinking. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre‐pandemic drinking behavior. Second, they indicate what behaviors/factors accompany increased alcohol use and provide targets for psychosocial and psychoeducational supports to address these proximal factors.","Neill, Erica; Meyer, Denny; Toh, Wei Lin; van Rheenen, Tamsyn Elizabeth; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric Josiah; Rossell, Susan Lee",Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/pcn.13099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602150/,502

Appropriate application of real-time PCR in such studies requires the use of a stably expressed 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of starting template between samples. RESULTS: We sought to identify appropriate genes for use as internal controls in experimental treatments with estrogen by analyzing the expression of eight functionally distinct 'housekeeping' genes (18S ribosomal RNA [18S rRNA], ribosomal protein l8 [rpl8], elongation factor 1 alpha [ef1a], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [g6pd], beta actin [bactin], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [gapdh], hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 [hprt1], and tata box binding protein [tbp]) following exposure to the environmental estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE(2)), in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Exposure to 10 ng/L EE(2 )for 21 days down-regulated the expression of ef1a, g6pd, bactin and gapdh in the liver, and bactin and gapdh in the gonad. Some of these effects were gender-specific, with bactin in the liver and gapdh in the gonad down-regulated by EE(2 )in males only. Furthermore, when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh were used for normalization, the hepatic expression of two genes of interest, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome P450 1A (cyp1a) following exposure to EE(2 )was overestimated. CONCLUSION: Based on the data presented, we recommend 18S rRNA, rpl8, hprt1 and/or tbp, but not ef1a, g6pd, bactin and/or gapdh, as likely appropriate internal controls in real-time PCR studies of estrogens effects in fish. Our studies show that pre-validation of control genes considering the scope and nature of the experiments to be performed, including both gender and tissue type, is critical for accurate assessments of the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in fish.","Filby, Amy L; Tyler, Charles R",BMC Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17288598/,502

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate sleep amount and sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID-19 for those working from home with minor household dependents. METHODS: We developed the “Anonymous Survey on Confinement during the COVID-19 Pandemic”, a national survey for individuals ≥18 years of age hosted on the Penn Medicine Clinical Research website from May 16th to November 11th, 2020. This 200 question survey captured demographics and multiple dimensions of health and well-being, including stress, sleep, eating behaviors, and coping activities. Respondents who indicated they were working from home were stratified by whether they were living with ≥1 minor dependent vs no dependents. Separate ordinal logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between living with a minor dependent and sleep amount (less, same, more) and disturbed quality (none, less, same, more) during, compared to before, COVID-19 controlled for age, sex, ethnicity, and annual income. RESULTS: A total of 232 respondents (n=182 no dependents, n=50 dependents, 84.9% Caucasian) reported working from home, the majority of which had been in confinement (95.7%). Respondents with dependents were younger (mean age 38.9±13.5 vs 47.4±18.0, p=0.002) and mostly female (86% vs 76.9%, p=0.03). On average, reported days worked/week (3.5±2.4 days) and hours worked/day (5.5±4.17 hours) were similar regardless of dependents. Comparing those without to those with minor dependents, there were no significant differences in log odds of getting enough sleep (β=-0.38, p=0.25) or worse sleep quality (β=0.41, p=0.22) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID-19. Respondents with dependents reported a higher log odds of taking longer to fall asleep during COVID-19 (β=0.71, p=0.045), and higher stress (β=-0.65, p=0.04). CONCLUSION: In this mostly Caucasian female sample of people working from home, having minor dependents in the household did not significantly impact sleep amount or quality compared to no minor household dependents. However, respondents with dependents reported longer time to fall asleep and were more stressed.

663833,Responding to COVID‐19: The Case of Spain,2020-11-18,"1. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are recognized as having significant social, economic and ecological costs, threatening human health, food security, wildlife conservation and biodiversity. We review the processes underlying the emergence of infectious disease, focusing on the similarities and differences between conceptual models of disease emergence and biological invasions in general. 2. Study of the IUCN's list of the world's worst invaders reveals that disease is cited as a driver behind the conservation, medical or economic impact of nearly a quarter of the species on the data base. 3. The emergence of novel diseases in new host species are, in essence, examples of invasions by parasites. Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites. 4. The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where host–parasite co‐evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts. 5. Similar opportunities and constraints on control and management occur at the different phases of invasions and disease emergence. However, exploitation of host immune responses offers additional control opportunities through contact control and vaccination against EIDs.

Here we report 6 cases (3 male and 3 female) of first-episode psychosis (FEP) admitted to our hospital in the second month of national lockdown. All patients underwent routine laboratory tests and a standardized assessment of psychopathology. Hospitalization was required due to the severity of behavioral abnormalities in the context of a full-blown psychosis (the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] = 75.8 ± 14.6). Blood tests, toxicological urine screening, and brain imaging were unremarkable, with the exception of a mild cortical atrophy in the eldest patient (male, 73 years). All patients were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) throughout their stay, but 3 presented the somatic delusion of being infected. Of note, all 6 cases had religious/spiritual delusions and hallucinatory contents. Despite a generally advanced age (53.3 ± 15.6), all patients had a negative psychiatric history. Rapid discharge (length of stay = 13.8 ± 6.9) with remission of symptoms (BPRS = 27.5 ± 3.1) and satisfactory insight were possible after relatively low-dose antipsychotic treatment (Olanzapine-equivalents = 10.1 ± 5.1 mg). Brief psychotic disorder/acute and transient psychotic disorder diagnoses were confirmed during follow-up visits in all 6 cases. The youngest patient (female, 23 years) also satisfied the available criteria for brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms. Although research on larger populations is necessary, our preliminary observation suggests that intense psychosocial stress associated with a novel, potentially fatal disease and national lockdown restrictions might be a trigger for FEP.","D′Agostino, Armando; D’Angelo, Simone; Giordano, Barbara; Cigognini, Anna Chiara; Chirico, Margherita Lorenza; Redaelli, Cristiana; Gambini, Orsola",Schizophr Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761196/; https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbaa112,502

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how raising a child with rare congenital surgical diseases impacts the mental health of both mothers and fathers. METHODS: The potential predictors of maternal and paternal mental health in a German sample of 210 parents of children with rare congenital surgical diseases were investigated. Parents were investigated cross-sectionally utilizing standardized psychometric questionnaires that assessed factors attributed to parental adaptation within the Double ABCX model. RESULTS: Stressor pile-up, family functioning, perceived stress, and mental health were positively associated with mothers and fathers. However, further analyses revealed that family functioning, social support, and perceived stress fully mediated the positive association between stressor pile-up and mental health in mothers, but not fathers. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that parental adaptation to a rare congenital surgical disease in their children may be improved by increased intra- and extrafamilial resources and decreased perceived family-related stress in mothers, but not fathers. Our results may help to identify gender-specific factors that may guide clinicians and future interventions.","Boettcher, Johannes; Zapf, Holger; Fuerboeter, Mareike; Nazarian, Rojin; Reinshagen, Konrad; Wiegand-Grefe, Silke; Boettcher, Michael",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01998-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503547/,502
665405,COVID-19 provides an opportunity to advance a sustainable UK fisheries policy in a post-Brexit brave new world,2020-07-10,"Staphylococcus aureus is part of the common flora on the skin and mucous membranes of mammals and approximately 20–30% of humans are persistently colonized, mainly by mostly susceptible human-adapted isolates. In contrast, colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus is rare (approximately 1%), predominantly transient and associated with prior contact to the health care system. Additionally, in recent years livestock-associated S. aureus clones contributed to colonization in humans, especially in those working in close contact to farm animals. A considerable percentage of colonizing S. aureus isolates is equipped with enterotoxin genes. Humans carrying enterotoxigenic isolates represent a contamination source when handling food, thus generating a continuous risk of S. aureus food intoxication. Molecular characterization of isolates colonizing humans and obtained from food, respectively, enables the tracing of food-related outbreaks back to the source of food intoxication. We will summarize current knowledge about the S. aureus population colonizing humans, including those in close contact to animals and food, respectively. Additionally, we will review data on the molecular characterization of S. aureus isolates related to staphylococcal foodborne disease and the elucidation of staphylococcal foodborne outbreaks. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a common foodborne disease, mediated by the ingestion of enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus. For several outbreaks of foodborne S. aureus disease, colonized personnel could be identified as the source of food contamination. However, because of the widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains as human colonizers and the often transient nature of colonization, the source of contamination cannot always be identified unambiguously. Therefore, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important requirement to prevent food contamination by both human colonization and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.","Strommenger, Birgit; Layer, Franziska; Werner, Guido",Staphylococcus aureus,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128096710000097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096710000097,502
666319,For a prefigurative pandemic politics: Disrupting the racial colonial quarantine,2020-09-04,"The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has caused major outbreaks in many parts of the world. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.","Rao, Shitao; Lau, Alexandria; So, Hon-Cheong",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031237,502

The utilization of high-throughput sequencing to detect microbial and/or viral genetic material in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung tissue samples has amplified the ability to identify and quantify specific microbial and viral populations. In stable IPF, higher microbial burden is associated with worse prognosis but no specific microbe has been identified to contribute to this. Additionally, no causative relation has been established. Regarding viral infections, although in the past they have been associated with IPF, causation has not been proved. Although in the past the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) was not considered in patients with overt infection, this was amended in the last few years and infection is considered a cause for exacerbation. Besides this, a higher microbial burden has been found in the lungs of patients with AE-IPF and an association with higher morbidity and mortality has been confirmed. In contrast, an association of AE-IPF with viral infection has not been established. Despite the progress during the last decade, a comprehensive knowledge of the microbiome and virome in IPF and their role in disease pathogenesis are yet elusive. Although association with disease severity, risk for progression and mortality has been established, causation has not been proven and the potential use as a biomarker or the benefits of antimicrobial therapeutic strategies are yet to be determined.","Ntolios, Paschalis; Tzilas, Vassilios; Bouros, Evangelos; Avdoula, Eleni; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Bouros, Demosthenes; Steiropoulos, Paschalis",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9040442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924195/,502

People higher in psychological entitlement typically try to avoid behaviors that might cause themselves harm, but their high expectations, lack of concern about others, and distrust of authority figures could affect their perceptions of the threat of the coronavirus and their views on the benefits of following the health guidelines. Across three studies (N = 1004, online samples from the United States), people higher in psychological entitlement reported less compliance with the health guidelines of the COVID-19 pandemic than people lower in psychological entitlement. Moreover, people higher in psychological entitlement believed that the threat of the virus was overblown and were less concerned about harming others, views that may partly explain their noncompliance. People higher in psychological entitlement were also more likely to report that they had contracted COVID-19, and thus their refusal to follow the health guidelines may have had negative consequences for them. An appeal to self-image concerns did not lead individuals higher in entitlement to be more likely to comply with the health guidelines.","Zitek, Emily M.; Schlund, Rachel J.",Pers Individ Dif,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110491; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920306826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162631/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920306826?v=s5,502

Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, the COOH- terminal cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 was found to be sufficient for localization of the chimeric proteins to the TGN. Deletion analysis identified an 11-amino acid segment containing the critical sequence, YQRL, as being sufficient for TGN localization. TGN localization was abrogated by mutation of the tyrosine or leucine residues in this sequence to alanine, or of the arginine residue to aspartate. In addition to specifying TGN localization, the 11-amino acid segment was active as an internalization signal, although the property of internalization alone was insufficient to confer TGN localization. Overexpression of chimeric proteins containing TGN localization determinants resulted in their detection at the plasma membrane and in intracellular vesicles, and abolished detection of endogenous TGN38. These results suggest that discrete cytoplasmic determinants can mediate protein localization to the TGN, and reveal a novel role for tyrosine-based motifs in this process.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436587/,502

While doctoral students' emotional burdens received much attention, their supervisors' emotional experiences remain under-explored. Moreover, while teacher education research stressed the importance of teacher emotion regulation, empirical studies on doctoral supervisors' emotion regulation barely exist. The current qualitative study explored 17 computer science supervisors' emotions unfolding in doctoral supervision and their emotion regulation strategies. Semi-structured interviews revealed the supervisors' wide-ranging emotions, with their negative emotions more diverse and common than positive ones. The supervisors also regulated their emotions through multiple strategies within antecedent-focused and response-focused approaches. As one of the initial studies on doctoral supervisors' emotion and emotion regulation in their own right, the current study not only uncovers the complexity of the emotion-laden dimension of supervision, but also highlights the need for all stakeholders to attend to supervisors' psychological well-being in tandem with their students'.","Han, Ye; Xu, Yueting",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.651859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262503/,502

672749,Reactivation of IgA vasculitis after COVID-19 vaccination,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Heavy media use has been linked to sleep problems in children, which may also extend to the infancy period. While international parent-advisory agencies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (2016), advise no screen time before 18 months, parents often do not follow this recommendation. Research on Italian infants’ early access to media is sparse, and only very few studies have investigated links with sleeping habits. METHOD: To address this gap, we examined concurrent associations between parent-reported surveys of child technology use and sleeping patterns. The Italian version of the 60 item Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Survey, developed as part of a larger international study, (Barr et al., 2020), the Brief Screening Questionnaire for Infant Sleep Problems (BISQ) Sadeh, 2004) were completed online by 264 Italian parents of 8- to 36-month-olds and a subset (n = 134) completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Abidin, 1995) between April 2017 and April 2018. RESULTS: More devices located in the child’s room and the more time spent watching TV or using an iPad were associated with less hours of sleep at night. Furthermore, more time spent watching TV or using a smartphone, as well as the number of devices in the room was associated with going to sleep later at night. Instrumental media use was associated with less sleep. CONCLUSION: Like other countries, Italian infants have high levels of exposure to media, and differences in media patterns were associated with sleep patterns. Cultural factors influence both instrumental reasons for media use and sleep practices. Further research should explore how media use may serve to regulate emotion as a function of both contextual factors and individual differences.","Bellagamba, Francesca; Presaghi, Fabio; Di Marco, Martina; D’Abundo, Emilia; Blanchfield, Olivia; Barr, Rachel",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.589664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828502/,502

However, for convalescent patients, the corroboration of molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples was unsatisfactory. Objectives: The aim of the present work was to assess the concordance level of SARS-CoV-2 detection between paired sampling of NPSs and saliva collected with Salivette(®) at two time points, with ten days of interval. Results: A total of 319 paired samples from 145 outpatients (OP) and 51 healthcare workers (HW) were collected. Unfortunately, at day ten, 73 individuals were lost to follow-up, explaining some kinetic missing data. Due to significant waiting rates at hospitals, most of the patients ate and/or drank while waiting for their turn. Consequently, mouth washing was systematically proposed prior to saliva collection. None of the HW were diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS or saliva specimens at both time points (n = 95) by RT-qPCR. The virus was detected in 56.3% (n = 126/224) of the NPS samples from OP, but solely 26.8% (n = 60/224) of the paired saliva specimens. The detection of the internal cellular control, the human RNase P, in more than 98% of the saliva samples, underlined that the low sensitivity of saliva specimens (45.2%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection was not attributed to an improper saliva sample storing or RNA extraction. Conclusions: This work revealed that mouth washing decreased viral load of buccal cavity conducting to impairment of SARS-CoV-2 detection. Viral loads in saliva neo-produced appeared insufficient for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2. At the time when saliva tests could be a rapid, simple and non-invasive strategy to assess large scale schoolchildren in France, the determination of the performance of saliva collection becomes imperative to standardize procedures.","Costa, Monique Melo; Benoit, Nicolas; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Million, Matthieu; Pradines, Bruno; Granjeaud, Samuel; Almeras, Lionel",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441446/,502

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 21 patients clinically suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent chest CT more than 3 days after the symptom onset: six patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 15 patients proved uninfected. Using a Likert scale and its receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, two radiologists (R1/R2) evaluated the diagnostic performance of the five CT criteria: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO)-predominant lesions, (2) GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, (3) bilateral GGO-predominant lesions; (4) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions, and (5) bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without nodules, airway abnormalities, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: All patients confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia had bilateral GGO- and peripheral-predominant lesions without airway abnormalities, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. The five CT criteria showed moderate to excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging 0.77–0.88 for R1 and 0.78–0.92 for R2. The criterion (e) showed the highest AUC.

678812,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,2020-03-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in multiple domains and widened gender-based inequalities across the world. It also stimulated extraordinary scientific achievement, bringing vaccines to the public in under a year. In this article, we discuss the implications of current vaccination guidance for pregnant and lactating women, whether their exclusion from the first wave of vaccine trials was justified, and if a change in the current vaccine development pathway is necessary. Pregnant and lactating women were not included in initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, the first vaccine regulatory approvals have been accompanied by inconsistent advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities around the world. Denying vaccination to women who though pregnant or breastfeeding are fully capable of autonomous decision-making is a throwback to a paternalistic era. Conversely, lack of evidence upon which to make an informed decision generated in a timely manner, shifts responsibility from research sponsors and regulators, and places the burden of decision-making upon a woman and her healthcare advisor. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PRGLAC), and others have highlighted the long-standing disadvantage experienced by women in relation to the development of vaccines and medicines. It is uncertain whether there was sufficient justification for excluding pregnant and lactating women from initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials. In future, we recommend regulators mandate plans that describe the development pathway for new vaccines and medicines that address the needs of women who are pregnant or lactating. These should incorporate at the outset, careful consideration of the balance of risks of exclusion or inclusion from initial studies, patient and public perspectives, details of “Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity” studies, and approaches to collect data systematically from participants who are unknowingly pregnant at the time of exposure. This requires careful consideration of any prior knowledge of the mode of action of the vaccine and the likelihood of toxicity or teratogenicity. We also support the view that the default position should be a “presumption of inclusion”, with exclusion of women who are pregnant or lactating only if justified on specific, not generic, grounds. Finally, we recommend closer coordination across countries with the aim of issuing consistent public health advice.","MODI, Neena; AYRES-DE-CAMPOS, Diogo; BANCALARI, Eduardo; BENDERS, Manon; BRIANA, Despina; DI RENZO, Gian Carlo; FONSECA, Eduardo Borges; HOD, Moshe; POON, Liona; SANZ CORTES, Magda; SIMEONI, Umberto; TSCHERNING, Charlotte; VENTO, Maximo; VISSER, Gerard H.A.; VOTO, Liliana",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937821000296; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.01.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821000296?v=s5,502

Participation in UFM programs, including through CEP, could reduce meal costs due to economies of scale and a lower administrative burden. We analyzed the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) data from 508 UFM-eligible schools (103 UFMs) to evaluate whether meal costs varied by UFM status. We used school-level data to address the non-random selection to UFMs with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). We estimated a generalized linear model with a log link and gamma distribution to predict meal costs by UFM status and school size. Full costs among medium and large schools were marginally lower in UFM schools for lunch (−$0.673; 95% CI: −1.395, 0.0499; p = 0.068) and significantly lower for breakfast (−$0.575; 95% CI: −1.077, −0.074; p = 0.025). UFM was not associated with meal costs among smaller schools. Healthy Eating Index scores did not vary significantly by UFMs, suggesting that lower costs could be achieved without an adverse effect on nutritional quality. This analysis is limited by the lack of identified student percentage (ISP) data needed to definitively identify CEP eligibility, although results were robust to sensitivity analyses addressing the lack of ISP data. The potential policy impact of these findings emphasizes the need for future studies that assess ISP and cost with more recent data and longitudinal designs.","Long, Michael W.; Marple, Keith; Andreyeva, Tatiana",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669614/,502

Due to the dynamics of COVID-19 where many infected people are not showing symptoms or showing mild symptoms, and where different countries are employing different testing strategies, it is quite difficult to calculate the R, while the pandemic is still widespread. This paper presents a probabilistic methodology to evaluate the effective reproduction number by considering only the daily death statistics of a given country. The methodology utilizes a linearly constrained Quadratic Programming scheme to estimate the daily new infection cases from the daily death statistics, based on the probability distribution of delays associated with symptom onset and to reporting a death. The proposed methodology is validated in-silico by simulating an infectious disease through a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. The results suggest that with a reasonable estimate of distribution of delay to death from the onset of symptoms, the model can provide accurate estimates of R. The proposed method is then used to estimate the R values for two countries.","Na, Jiaming; Tibebu, Haileleol; De Silva, Varuna; Kondoz, Ahmet; Caine, Michael",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920305774?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834657/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920305774,502

Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is an algorithm derived from machine learning that uses the arterial waveform to predict IOH. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic ability of HPI working with non-invasive ClearSight system in predicting impending hypotension in patients undergoing major gynaecologic oncologic surgery (GOS). In this retrospective analysis hemodynamic data were downloaded from an Edwards Lifesciences HemoSphere platform and analysed. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the performance of HPI working on the ClearSight pressure waveform in predicting hypotensive events, defined as mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg for > 1 min. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were computed at a cutpoint (the value which minimizes the difference between sensitivity and specificity). Thirty-one patients undergoing GOS were included in the analysis, 28 of which had complete data set. The HPI predicted hypotensive events with a sensitivity of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.94] and specificity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.74–0.95) 15 min before the event [area under the curve (AUC) 0.95 (95% CI 0.89–0.99)]; with a sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71–0.92) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71–0.93) 10 min before the event [AUC 0.9 (95% CI 0.83–0.97)]; and with a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.78–0.93) and specificity 0.86 (95% CI 0.77–0.94) 5 min before the event [AUC 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.97)].

OBJECTIVE: To assess autonomic function and relate the findings to the severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the 21st COVID-19 Department of the east campus of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 6 to March 7, 2020. Clinical data were collected. Heart rate variability (HRV), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, and lymphocytes and subsets counts were analysed at two time points: nucleic-acid test positive and negative. Psychological symptoms were assessed after discharge. RESULTS: All patients were divided into a mild group (13) and a severe group (21). The latter was further divided into two categories according to the trend of HRV. Severe patients had a significantly lower standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDNN) (P < 0.001), standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals (SDANN) (P < 0.001), and a higher ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF) (P = 0.016). Linear correlations were shown among SDNN, SDANN, LF/HF, and laboratory indices (P < 0.05). Immune function, D-dimer, and NT-proBNP showed a consistent trend with HRV in severe patients (P < 0.05), and severe patients without improved HRV parameters needed a longer time to clear the virus and recover (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HRV was associated with the severity of COVID-19. The changing trend of HRV was related to the prognosis, indicating that HRV measurements can be used as a non-invasive predictor for clinical outcome.","Pan, Yuchen; Yu, Zhiyao; Yuan, Yuan; Han, Jiapeng; Wang, Zhuo; Chen, Hui; Wang, Songyun; Wang, Zhen; Hu, Huihui; Zhou, Liping; Lai, Yanqiu; Zhou, Zhen; Wang, Yuhong; Meng, Guannan; Yu, Lilei; Jiang, Hong",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.630038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093217/,502

Due to the COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]) pandemic, these therapies are switching to telehealth and telemedicine practices, but access and utilization may be limited due to state policies and social vulnerability. Objective: The objective of this cross-sectional analysis was to evaluate the policy changes to telehealth provisions during the pandemic and the degree to which structural barriers could stymie the intended impact of these policies (e.g., PT/OT accessibility). Materials and Methods: Our analysis examined each states' telehealth policies in relation to PT/OT, ranked their telehealth readiness, identified relationships between existing policies and opioid prescription rates, and discussed how social determinants of health may be associated with telehealth availability and accessibility. Results: Approximately two of five states have both telehealth and telemedicine policies, whereas the majority of states had either a PT- or OT-specific policy in place. In addition, almost all states and the District of Columbia (90%) had general telehealth/medicine policy changes as a result of the pandemic. Discussion: Although such policy changes could reduce COVID-19-related barriers, the degree to which these policies can have a large and long-lasting impact may be contingent on structural barriers. Many states that lack broadband access and have high social vulnerability need more improvements to ensure the utilization of telehealth care, including PT and OT. Conclusion: Despite the policies expanding PT/OT telehealth capabilities, structural barriers may further exacerbate inequities in care accessibility.","Scott-Richardson, Maya; Johnson, Guinevere; Burnett, Sianna; Giordano, Nicholas A; Highland, Krista B",Telemed. j. e. health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34520258/; https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0167,502

Samples were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h. Patients were in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in a COVID-19 ward unit (CWU) at a Spanish referral hospital. None of the samples placed in the ICU unit were positive for COVID-19. However, two surfaces, placed in a CWU room with a patient that required the use of respiratory assistance were positive for coronavirus at 72 h. Surfaces could not be touched by patients or health workers, so viral spreading was unequivocally produced by air transmission. Thus, fomites should be considered as a possible mode of transmission of coronavirus and frequent disinfection of surfaces should be taken into account. Our results, although preliminary, point the importance of SARS-CoV-2 virus air transmission indoors and may shed some light in this debate.","Orenes-Piñero, Esteban; Baño, Francisco; Navas-Carrillo, Diana; Moreno-Docón, Antonio; Marín, Juana María; Misiego, Rocío; Ramírez, Pablo",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720358460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33182011/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142317; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720358460,502

Four results emerge. First, all indicators show huge uncertainty jumps in reaction to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Indeed, most indicators reach their highest values on record. Second, peak amplitudes differ greatly – from a 35% rise for the model-based measure of US economic uncertainty (relative to January 2020) to a 20-fold rise in forecaster disagreement about UK growth. Third, time paths also differ: Implied volatility rose rapidly from late February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late March as stock prices began to recover. In contrast, broader measures of uncertainty peaked later and then plateaued, as job losses mounted, highlighting differences between Wall Street and Main Street uncertainty measures.

The goal of this study is to demonstrate the impact of densely populated residential areas on hospitalization and to identify predictors of length of stay and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in one of the hardest hit counties internationally. METHODS: This is a single-center cohort study of 1325 sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in New York between March 2, 2020 to May 11, 2020. Geospatial distribution of study patients’ residence relative to population density in the region were mapped and data analysis included hospital length of stay, need and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Logistic regression models were constructed to predict discharge dispositions in the remaining active study patients. RESULTS: The median age of the study cohort was 62 years (IQR - 49-75), and more than half were male (57%) with history of hypertension (60%), obesity (41%), and diabetes (42%). Geographic residence of the study patients was disproportionately associated with areas of higher population density (r(s)=0.235, p=0.004), with noted “hot spots” in the region. Study patients were predominantly hypertensive (MAP>90mmHg (670, 51%)) on presentation with lymphopenia (590, 55%), hyponatremia (411, 31%), and kidney dysfunction (eGFR&60ml/min/1.73m (2) (381, 29%)). Of the patients with a disposition (1188/1325), 15% (182/1188) required IMV and 21% (250/1188) developed acute kidney injury. In patients on IMV, median hospital length of stay in survivors (22 days; 16.5-29.5) was significantly longer than non-survivors (15 days; 10-23.75), but this was not due to prolonged time on the ventilator. The overall mortality in all hospitalized patients was 15% and in patients receiving IMV was 48%, which is predicted to minimally rise from 48% to 49% based on logistic regression models constructed to project the disposition in the remaining patients on the ventilator. Acute kidney injury during hospitalization (OR(E)=3.23) was the strongest predictor of mortality in patients requiring IMV.

We also find that the countrywide distribution of cases across states/provinces in these nations also displays similar inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums are found to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under consideration, revealing that slums constitute the most at-risk urban locations in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model to study the spread of a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of neighbourhoods—slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical outcomes for a broad set of parameter values—reflecting the potential validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general, especially across cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an epidemic. Large slums in the developing world, therefore, contain the most vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth of metropolises in Asia and Africa presents significant challenges for future respiratory outbreaks from perspectives of public health and socioeconomic equity.","Sahasranaman, Anand; Jensen, Henrik Jeldtoft",J R Soc Interface,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33468021/,502

SARS-CoV-2 causes mild to severe respiratory tract inflammation, often developing into lung fibrosis with thrombosis in pulmonary small vessels and causing even death. COronaVIrus Disease (COVID-19) patients manifest exacerbated inflammatory and immune responses, cytokine storm, prevalence of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and increased levels of resident and circulating immune cells. Men show higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than women, likely due to estrogens production. The protective role of estrogens, as well as an immune-suppressive activity that limits the excessive inflammation, can be mediated by cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2). The role of this receptor in modulating inflammation and immune response is well documented in fact in several settings. The stimulation of CB2 receptors is known to limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, shift the macrophage phenotype towards the anti-inflammatory M2 type and enhance the immune-modulating properties of mesenchymal stromal cells. For these reasons, we hypothesize that CB2 receptor can be a therapeutic target in COVID-19 pandemic emergency.","Rossi, Francesca; Tortora, Chiara; Argenziano, Maura; Di Paola, Alessandra; Punzo, Francesca",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21113809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471272/,502

Results The estimated vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection >7 days after second dose was 86% (95% CI 72-94%) but only 42% (95% CI 14-63%) >14 days after a single dose. No difference in vaccine effectiveness was observed between females and males. Having a prior positive test was associated with 91% (95% CI 85 to 94%) effectiveness against new infection among the unvaccinated. Conclusion A satisfactory effectiveness of BNT162b2 after the second dose was suggested, but with possibly substantially lower effect before the second dose.","Bjork, J.; Inghammar, M.; Moghaddassi, M.; Rasmussen, M.; Malmqvist, U.; Kahn, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.20.21254636v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.21254636,502

The endemic equilibrium state and the effective reproductive number (R(0)) was obtained and used to find the best recipe for curbing the rate of transmission of the disease. Using the Nigerian demographic data, numerical simulation results showed that 20% coronavirus vaccination when applied in coverage of active individuals is better than 75% preventive individual's usage on limiting the spread of COVID-19. In addition, the results also showed that vaccinating 30% of active individuals are better ways of curbing the disease than vaccinating 75% of individuals that are not infected with the virus as shown by the calculated ratio and the simulation results, respectively.","Gudu, Emmanuel Bala; Wisdom, Daniel Dauda; Joseph, Grace Gudu; Ahmad, Mohammad Aminu; Isaac, Samson; Akinyemi, Ebenezer Ajayi",Data Science for COVID-19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128245361000137; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128245361000137,502

Currently, manhood is dealing with a new epidemic, the infection of the latest coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which causes a deadly disease named COVID-19. This article aims to examine COVID-19’s effect on agriculture, education, and the economy. There are existing estimates to conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant influence on agriculture and the food supply chain, mostly influencing food demand and, as a result, food security, with a disproportionate impact on the most disadvantaged. To overcome spread of COVID-19, a non-contact food delivery system has been used by utilizing drown for this purpose. This epidemic crisis also introduced a digital education system that is challenging for students and teachers who are not educated in it. Weak infrastructure, such as electricity, poor access to the Internet connection, and a lack of technology literacy, has hampered the online education system. Coronavirus has an undesirable influence on the global economy by affecting tourism, the financial market, commerce, shipping, manufacturing, and the service sector. The exchange market was also down during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, we should strictly follow SOP’s to improve our agriculture, education, economy, and other ways of normal life. We should also be vaccinated to fulfill our all losses in different fields.","Mumtaz, Mehvish; Hussain, Nazim; Baqar, Zulqarnain; Anwar, Saima; Bilal, Muhammad",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34333745/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15728-y,502

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and regions implemented travel restrictions and quarantines to reduce human mobility and thus reduce virus transmission. But since human mobility decreased heterogeneously, we lack empirical evidence of the extent to which the reductions in mobility alter the way people from different regions of cities are connected, and what containment policies could complement mobility reductions to conquer the pandemic. Here, we examined individual movements in 21 of the most affected counties in the United States, showing that mobility reduction leads to a segregated place network and alters its relationship with pandemic spread. Our findings suggest localized area-specific policies, such as geo-fencing, as viable alternatives to city-wide lockdown for conquering the pandemic after mobility was reduced.","Fan, Chao; Lee, Ronald; Yang, Yang; Mostafavi, Ali",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413337/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95894-8,502

Platelet dysfunction may be a contributing factor. The aim of this prospective observational study was to characterize platelet dysfunction and its relation to outcome in ECMO patients. Blood was sampled from thirty ECMO patients at three timepoints. Expression of CD62P, CD63, activated GPIIb/IIIa, GPVI, GPIbα and formation platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLA) were analyzed at rest and in response to stimulation. Delta granule storage-pool deficiency and secretion defects were also investigated. Fifteen healthy volunteers and ten patients with coronary artery disease served as controls. Results were also compared between survivors and non-survivors. Compared to controls, expression of platelet surface markers, delta granule secretion and formation of PLA was reduced, particularly in response to stimulation. Baseline CD63 expression was higher and activated GPIIb/IIIa expression in response to stimulation was lower in non-survivors on day 1 of ECMO. Logistic regression analysis revealed that these markers were associated with mortality. In conclusion, platelets from ECMO patients are severely dysfunctional predisposing patients to bleeding complications and poor outcome. Platelet dysfunction on day 1 of ECMO detected by the platelet surface markers CD63 and activated GPIIb/IIIa is associated with mortality. CD63 and activated GPIIb/IIIa may therefore serve as novel prognostic biomarkers, but future studies are required to determine their true potential.

686882,Social media and COVID-19 misinformation: how ignorant Facebook users are?,2021-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Mental health care systems have been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). RESULTS: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). CONCLUSIONS: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.","Almeda, Nerea; García-Alonso, Carlos; Salvador-Carulla, Luis",BMC Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03015-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451305/,502

Analysis of regional data, while hospital capacities for acute stroke care remained fully available, offers an opportunity to assess this. We report regional Stroke Team acute activations and reperfusion treatments during COVID-19 mitigation activities. METHODS: Using case log data prospectively collected by a Stroke Team exclusively serving ≈2 million inhabitants and 30 healthcare facilities, we retrospectively reviewed volumes of consultations and reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke. We compared volumes before and after announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the prior calendar year. RESULTS: Compared with the 10 weeks prior, stroke consultations declined by 39% (95% CI, 32%–46%) in the 5 weeks after announcement of statewide school and restaurant closures in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Results compared with the prior year and time trend analyses were consistent. Reperfusion treatments also appeared to decline by 31% (95% CI, 3%–51%), and specifically thrombolysis by 33% (95% CI, 4%–55%), but this finding had less precision. CONCLUSIONS: Upon the announcement of measures to mitigate COVID-19, regional acute stroke consultations declined significantly. Reperfusion treatment rates, particularly thrombolysis, also appeared to decline qualitatively, and this finding requires further study.

687250,Enhancing the Admissions Process Through Virtual Interviews,2021,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The induction of an effective immune response against tumor cells is of a great benefit in the battle against cancers. We recently characterized a novel, safe, and cost-effective strategy to induce an efficient CD8(+) T cell immune response against potentially whatever antigen. This technique is based on in vivo engineering of exosomes/extracellular vesicles (EVs), i.e., nanovesicles constitutively released by all healthy cells. Immunogenic EVs are generated by intramuscular injection of a DNA vector expressing an EV-anchoring protein fused with the antigen of interest. In this paper, we applied our vaccine platform to counteract the growth of tumors expressing antigens of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). We demonstrated that this method is instrumental in curing mice already developing HPV-related tumors. In addition, cured mice were shown to resist a second tumor cell implantation. These results could be of relevance for a possible translation into the clinic of our technology. ABSTRACT: We developed an innovative method to induce antigen-specific CD8(+) T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). This approach employs a DNA vector expressing a mutated HIV-1 Nef protein (Nef(mut)) deprived of the anti-cellular effects typical of the wild-type isoform, meanwhile showing an unusual efficiency of incorporation into EVs. This function persists even when foreign antigens are fused to its C-terminus. In this way, Nef(mut) traffics large amounts of antigens fused to it into EVs spontaneously released by the recipient cells. We previously provided evidence that mice injected with a DNA vector expressing the Nef(mut)/HPV16-E7 fusion protein developed an E7-specific CTL immune response as detected 2 weeks after the second immunization. Here, we extended and optimized the anti-HPV16 CD8(+) T cell immune response induced by the endogenously engineered EVs, and evaluated the therapeutic antitumor efficacy over time. We found that the co-injection of DNA vectors expressing Nef(mut) fused with E6 and E7 generated a stronger anti-HPV16 immune response compared to that observed in mice injected with the single vectors. When HPV16-E6 and -E7 co-expressing tumor cells were implanted before immunization, all mice survived at day 44, whereas no mice injected with either void or Nef(mut)-expressing vectors survived until day 32 after tumor implantation. A substantial part of immunized mice (7 out of 12) cleared the tumor. When the cured mice were re-challenged with a second tumor cell implantation, none of them developed tumors. Both E6- and E7-specific CD8(+) T immunities were still detectable at the end of the observation time. We concluded that the immunity elicited by engineered EVs, besides counteracting and curing already developed tumors, was strong enough to guarantee the resistance to additional tumor attacks. These results can be of relevance for the therapy of both metastatic and relapsing tumors.","Ferrantelli, Flavia; Manfredi, Francesco; Chiozzini, Chiara; Leone, Patrizia; Giovannelli, Andrea; Olivetta, Eleonora; Federico, Maurizio",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13092263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066801/,502

Infants and children are the ones to develop both short-term and long-term devastating complications from anemia. Although anemia is a very big public health concern, newborns, especially in developing countries, are usually overlooked and undiagnosed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among term newborns in Nekemte Specialized Hospital, Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study involving 278 newborns was conducted from October to November, 2020 with an interview-based questionnaire that included maternal socio-demographic and obstetrics characteristics, newborn’s weight and sex. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 20. The prevalence of newborn anemia was shown in percentage and as a pie-chart. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify the predictors of anemia in the term newborn. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of newborn anemia in the hospital was 29.1%. Maternal anemia (AOR: 3.95, 95% C.I.: 1.97–7.92), delivery by cesarean section (AOR: 4.17, 95% C.I.: 1.89–9.20), vaginal bleeding during pregnancy (AOR: 5.43, 95% C.I.: 1.60–18.39), and maternal failure to take iron-folate supplements during pregnancy (AOR: 2.17, 95% C.I.:1.07–4.41) were factors associated with newborn anemia. CONCLUSION: Anemia among newborns in the hospital was a moderate public health problem. Policy makers should consider maternal health education and appropriate health interventions to reduce the problem. In addition, further longitudinal studies are needed to identify specific causes of newborn anemia in order to prevent the possible complications.","Dereje, Ifa; Etefa, Tesema; Gebremariam, Teka; Getaye, Asfaw; Tunta, Abayneh; Gerbi, Asfaw",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556995/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s326962,502

The cellular mechanisms underlying these so-called ‘cytokine storms’ are regulated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway and by ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species). Both light (Photobiomodulation) and magnetic fields (e.g., Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field) stimulation are noninvasive therapies known to confer anti-inflammatory effects and regulate ROS signaling pathways. Here we show that daily exposure to two 10-minute intervals of moderate intensity infra-red light significantly lowered the inflammatory response induced via the TLR4 receptor signaling pathway in human cell cultures. Anti-inflammatory effects were likewise achieved by electromagnetic field exposure of cells to daily 10-minute intervals of either Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF), or to Low-Level static magnetic fields. Because current illumination and electromagnetic field therapies have no known side effects, and are already approved for some medical uses, we have here developed protocols for verification in clinical trials of COVID-19 infection. These treatments are affordable, simple to implement, and may help to resolve the acute respiratory distress of COVID-19 patients both in the home and in the hospital.","Pooam, Marootpong; Aguida, Blanche; Drahy, Soria; Jourdan, Nathalie; Ahmad, Margaret",Communicative & integrative biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995820/; https://doi.org/10.1080/19420889.2021.1911413,502

Restaurants are an increasingly important yet understudied source of food and may present opportunities to positively influence urban food environments. We sought to explore food environments further, by examining the association between neighborhood characteristics and restaurant consumer nutrition environments within New York City’s Hispanic Caribbean (HC) restaurant environments. We applied an adapted version of the Nutrition Environment Measurements Survey for Restaurants (NEMS-R) to evaluate a random sample of HC restaurants (n=89). NEMS-HCR scores (continuous and categorized as low, medium, and high based on data distribution) were examined against area sociodemographic characteristics using bivariate and logistic regression analysis. HC restaurants located in Hispanic geographic enclaves had a higher proportion of fried menu items (p<0.01) but presented fewer environmental barriers to healthy eating, compared with those in areas with lower Hispanic concentrations. No significant differences in NEMS-R scores were found by other neighborhood characteristics. Size was the only significant factor predicting high NEMS-HCR scores, where small restaurants were less likely to have scores in the high category (NEMS-HCR score>6), compared with their medium (aOR: 6.6, 95% CI: 1.8–24.6) and large counterparts (aOR: 5.6, 95% CI: 1.5–21.4).
