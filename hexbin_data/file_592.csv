Recently, we have witnessed an explosion of interest in studying social influence and spread dynamics in social networks. To date, relatively little material has been provided on a comprehensive review in this field. This brief survey addresses this issue. We present the current significant empirical studies on real social systems, including network construction methods, measures of network, and newly empirical results. We then provide a concise description of some related social models from both macro- and micro-level perspectives. Due to the difficulties in combining real data and simulation data for verifying and validating real social systems, we further emphasize the current research results of computational experiments. We hope this paper can provide researchers significant insights into better understanding the characteristics of personal influence and spread patterns in large-scale social systems.","Zheng, Xiaolong; Zhong, Yongguang; Zeng, Daniel; Wang, Fei-Yue",Front Comput Sci,592,16

Paper lateral flow biosensors (LFBs) have been established as attractive tools for such analytical applications. In the present study a prototype LFB was designed for whole particles (virions) detection of nodavirus or fish nervous necrosis virus. Nodavirus is an important threat in the aquaculture industry, causing severe economic losses and environmental problems. The LFB was based on polyclonal antibodies conjugated on gold nanoparticles for signal visualization. Brain and retinas from fish samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was directly applied on the LFB. Formation of a red test line was indicative of nodavirus virions presence. Nodavirus visual detection was completed in short time (30 min). Key factors of the LFB development influencing the assays’ detection limit were characterized and the optimum parameters were determined, enabling increased efficiency, excluding non-specific interactions. Therefore, the proposed LFB assay consists a robust, simple, low cost and accurate method for detection of nodavirus virions in fish samples. The proposed biosensor is ideal for development of a commercial kit to be used on aquaculture facilities by fish farmers. It is anticipated that disease monitoring and environmental safety will benefit from the simplification of time consuming and costly procedures.","Toubanaki, Dimitra K.; Margaroni, Maritsa; Prapas, Athanasios; Karagouni, Evdokia",Sci Rep,592,16

Also, doping with metallic or non-metallic elements has an impact on the antibacterial and photocatalytic activity of these coatings. Although there are many studies in this field, the effect of co-doping with Cu and N and their concentrations on the antibacterial properties of TiO(2) coatings against the E. coli and S. aureus bacteria has not been studied. In the present investigation, the sol–gel method was employed to deposit both undoped and Cu-N co-doped TiO(2) photocatalytic coatings on glass surface, which are expected to degrade bacterial and chemical contaminants in water while exposed to visible sunlight wavelengths. Before the coating process, an appropriate heat treatment was applied on the samples and the quality of coatings, band gap energy, and also photocatalytic and antibacterial properties were evaluated. Results showed that, in the presence of dopants, the band gap become narrower and the absorption spectrum is transferred from the ultraviolet to the visible light range. Also, it was demonstrated that, under the visible light radiation, all of the co-doped samples show higher photocatalytic activity than the undoped ones. Meanwhile, the antibacterial characteristics of TiO(2) coatings was enhanced by increasing the dopant concentration when exposing to sunlight.

In the present work the effectiveness of ePCR in improving the power of the DGGE technique for microbial population studies was tested. Our results indicated that ePCR results in uniform amplification of several DNA molecules, overcoming the major limitations of conventional PCR, such as preferential amplification and DNA concentration dependence. Moreover, ePCR-DGGE resulted in higher sensitivity when compared to conventional PCR-DGGE methods used for studying microbial populations in a complex matrix. In fact, compared to conventional PCR, the DGGE profiles of ePCR products permitted the detection of a higher number of the species that were present in the tested sample.","Iacumin, Lucilla; Cecchini, Francesca; Vendrame, Marco; Comi, Giuseppe",Microorganisms,592,5

Efficient and accurate methods are required to analyze large metabolic networks. Flux sampling can be used to explore the feasible flux solutions in metabolic networks by generating probability distributions of steady-state reaction fluxes. Unlike other methods, flux sampling can be used without assuming a particular cellular objective. We have undertaken a rigorous comparison of several sampling algorithms and concluded that the coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) algorithm is the most efficient based on both run-time and multiple convergence diagnostics. We demonstrate the power of CHRR by using it to study the metabolic changes that underlie photosynthetic acclimation to cold of Arabidopsis thaliana plant leaves. In combination with experimental measurements, we show how the regulated interplay between diurnal starch and organic acid accumulation defines the plant acclimation process. We confirm fumarate accumulation as a requirement for cold acclimation and further predict γ–aminobutyric acid to have a key role in metabolic signaling under cold conditions. These results demonstrate how flux sampling can be used to analyze the feasible flux solutions across changing environmental conditions, whereas eliminating the need to make assumptions which introduce observer bias.","Herrmann, Helena A.; Dyson, Beth C.; Vass, Lucy; Johnson, Giles N.; Schwartz, Jean-Marc",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,592,24

However, the suitability of AHLT versus adult whole liver transplantation (AWLT) for recipients with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores remains controversial. METHODS: We divided patients undergoing AHLT and AWLT into subgroups according to their MELD scores (≥ 30: AHLT, n = 35; AWLT, n = 88; and < 30: AHLT, n = 323; AWLT, n = 323). Patients were matched by demographic data and perioperative conditions according to propensity scores. A cut-off value of 30 for MELD scores was determined by comparing the overall survival data of 735 cases of nontumor liver transplantation. RESULTS: Among patients with an MELD score ≥ 30 and < 30, AHLT was found to be associated with increased warm ischemia time, operative time, hospitalization time, and intraoperative blood loss compared with AWLT (P < 0.05). In the MELD ≥ 30 group, although the 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for AWLT than for AHLT (P = 0.037), there was no significant difference between AWLT and AHLT in the MELD < 30 group (P = 0.832); however, we did not observe a significant increase in specific complications following AHLT among patients with a high MELD score (≥ 30). Among these patients, the incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or above was significantly higher in patients undergoing AHLT than in those undergoing AWLT (25.7% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.047). For the MELD < 30 group, there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or above for patients undergoing AHLT or AWLT. CONCLUSION: In patients with an MELD score < 30, AHLT can achieve rates of mortality and overall survival comparable to AWLT. In those with an MELD score ≥ 30, the prognosis and incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo III or above are significantly worse for AHLT than for AWLT; therefore, we may need to be more cautious regarding the conclusion that patients with a high MELD score can safely undergo AHLT.","Kong, LingXiang; Lv, Tao; Jiang, Li; Yang, Jian; Yang, Jiayin",BMC Surg,592,1

Researchers have recognized the potential of YouTube as a clinical and patient education resource that may improve access to appropriate care. However, the heterogeneity of evaluation approaches and variable quality of health information have generally limited the potential of YouTube as a self-management intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase the understanding of ALBP content available on YouTube in 2020 and to establish the plausibility of using a simple checklist to facilitate the discovery of YouTube content consistent with current guidelines. We examined the following 4 research questions: how was the data set defined, what are the metadata characteristics of the videos in the data set, what is the information quality of ALBP YouTube videos, and what are the characteristics of the YouTube data set based on an ALBP self-management checklist? METHODS: This was an exploratory, qualitative infodemiology study. We identified videos in our data set through YouTube search based on popular ALBP-relevant search terms identified through Google Trends for YouTube. We accessed YouTube metadata using the YouTube data tools developed by the University of Amsterdam. We used a modified Brief DISCERN checklist to examine the information quality. We developed a checklist based on the 2018 Lancet Low Back Pain guidelines to examine self-management content. RESULTS: We analyzed a data set of 202 YouTube videos authored by chiropractors, physicians, physiotherapists, and instructors of yoga and other disciplines. We identified clear differences in the ALBP videos in our data set based on the authors’ disciplines. We found that the videos authored by each discipline strongly featured a specific intervention domain, that is, education, treatment, or exercise. We also found that videos authored by physicians were consistently coded with the highest ALBP self-management content scores than all other disciplines. CONCLUSIONS: The results returned by YouTube in response to a search for back pain–related content were highly variable. We suggest that a simple checklist may facilitate the discovery of guideline-concordant ALBP self-management content on YouTube. Further research may identify the clinical contexts in which the use of an ALBP checklist with YouTube is feasible.","Zheluk, Andrey; Maddock, Jess",JMIR Form Res,592,1

A distinctive form of sharing in adult Homo sapiens involves active giving of high-valued possessions to others, without an immediate reciprocal benefit. In two Experiments with 19-month-old human infants (N = 96), we found that despite measurable possessive behavior toward their own personal objects (favorite toy, bottle), infants spontaneously gave these items to a begging stranger. Moreover, human infants exhibited this behavior across different types of objects that are relevant to theory (personal objects, sweet food, and common objects)—showing flexible generalizability not evidenced in non-human primates. We combined these data with a previous dataset, yielding a large sample of infants (N = 192), and identified sociocultural factors that may calibrate young infants’ sharing of objects with others. The current findings show a proclivity that is rare or absent in our closest living relatives—the capacity to override possessive behavior toward personally valued objects by sharing those same desired objects with others.","Barragan, Rodolfo Cortes; Meltzoff, Andrew N.",Sci Rep,592,22

OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of a telehealth program on the level of nutritional knowledge and body mass index (BMI) of university teachers. METHODS: A pre-experimental study was carried out from August to December 2020. A pretest and a posttest were applied. The number of teachers in the initial test was 88 and those included in the final evaluation, 83; and they were selected by nonprobability sampling for convenience. The telehealth-based program lasted 18 weeks and included basic information on nutrition and motivational messages. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data were collected through a predesigned questionnaire before and after the educational program. RESULTS: Posttest knowledge scores increased significantly from 6.40 ± 1.70 to 10.59 ± 1.18 (P < .001). In relation to time, significant variations are observed in weight measurements (P < .001), BMI (P < .001), and basic nutritional knowledge (P < .001) before and after the intervention program.

Despite the genetic heterogenicity, photoreceptor cell damage remains the hallmark of RP pathology. As a result, RP patients usually suffer from reduced night vision, loss of peripheral vision, decreased visual acuity, and impaired color perception. Although photoreceptor cell death is the primary outcome of RP, the underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death, with characteristic iron overload and lipid peroxidation. Recent studies, using in vitro and in vivo RP models, discovered the involvement of ferroptosis-associated cell death, suggesting a possible new mechanism for RP pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the association between ferroptosis and photoreceptor cell damage, and its implication in the pathogenesis of RP. We propose that ferroptotic cell death not only opens up a new research area in RP, but may also serve as a novel therapeutic target for RP.","Yang, Ming; So, Kwok-Fai; Lam, Wai-Ching; Lo, Amy Cheuk Yin",Cells,592,1

While existing scholarly assessments highlight central institutional features of the Paris shift, they tend to overlook its symbolic and discursive dimensions. Our analysis shows that the Paris architecture combines two core elements: an iterative pledge and review process to stimulate global climate action, and a ‘performative’ narrative aimed at aligning actors’ expectations on the prospect of a low-carbon future. We therefore suggest calling it an incantatory system of governance. We then examine the origins of the new approach and find that the rise of ‘soft law’ approaches and communicative techniques in global climate governance are both indicative of a broader process: the entry of management culture in international organisations. Against this backdrop, we examine the prospects, limitations and caveats of the new approach and discuss its wider implications for global politics.","Aykut, Stefan C.; Morena, Edouard; Foyer, Jean",Int Polit,592,16

We argue that the process under the Paris Agreement, its ‘rulebook’ and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) will have to be accompanied by focused and tailored governance mechanisms in the energy realm. The energy sector itself is key to limiting global warming to two degrees centigrade compared to the preindustrial level, because it is responsible for over two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, neither the energy transition nor energy governance start from scratch. Energy governance is already happening on many levels: the local, the national, the regional and the global. These multi-level governance structures are necessary to enable, facilitate, and accelerate the energy transition(s) on the ground. They have to be adapted, however, to the changing and transforming energy world as we argue in the conclusions. In a first step, we conceptualize the notion of ‘energy transition’ and relate it to the concept of ‘energy transformation’. We argue that it is necessary to firstly move beyond the normative and target-driven idea(s) behind ‘transition’ and to secondly bring in the systemic aspects of energy transformation. Moreover, energy security, economic efficiency, sustainability and climate neutrality have emerged over time as the guiding paradigms, forming a strategic quadrangle, as opposed to a strategic triangle, traditionally used to define energy security. In a second step, we present an overview of the current international energy governance system where multilayered governance structures have developed over time. We argue that the existing architecture is stemming from the past and is neither fit for governing the energy transition, nor even reflecting the proccesses underway in todays’ world. In a third step, we highlight that the energy transformation has and will have tremendous techno-economic, socio-technical and political (Cherp et al. 2018) effects that have both internal and external dimensions. Moreover, the transformation comes with (geo)political effects as it changes the political economy of energy on all levels: the global, the regional, the national and the local. In the final step, we look at ways forward. We argue that it is necessary to preserve existing multilateral institutions and to strengthen them. Moreover, we assume that governance approaches towards and inside regions will have to be re-shaped or even created from scratch. We conclude that the crumbling of the global liberal order and the crises of multilateralism are complicating the approach to a better governance of the energy transition on the global level. Moreover, we witness the emergence of illiberal tendencies in the Western democracies as well. Climate and energy are playing into the polarization of societies as the two topics emerged as a major cleavage and a conflict line. We emphasize that a just and inclusive energy transition, both on national and international levels, is necessary to keep countries and the world on a sustainable energy transformation path.

One of the main solutions proposed for this information overload problem are recommender systems, which provide personalized results. Most existing social recommendation approaches consider relation information to improve recommendation performance in the static context. However, relations are likely to evolve over time in the dynamic network. Therefore, temporal information is an essential ingredient to making social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation model based on evolving relation network, named SoERec. The learned evolving relation network is a heterogeneous information network, where the strength of relation between users is a sum of the influence of all historical events. We incorporate temporally evolving relations into the recommendation algorithm. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on two widely-used datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.","Jiang, Bo; Lu, Zhigang; Liu, Yuling; Li, Ning; Cui, Zelin",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,592,16

We model the degradation path of individual assets, to predict overall failure rates. Instead of a separate distribution for each hidden state, we use hierarchical mixtures of distributions in the exponential family. In our approach the observation distribution of the states is a finite mixture distribution of a small set of (simpler) distributions shared across all states. Using tied-mixture observation distributions offers several advantages. The mixtures act as a regularization for typically very sparse problems, and they reduce the computational effort for the learning algorithm since there are fewer distributions to be found. Using shared mixtures enables sharing of statistical strength between the Markov states and thus transfer learning. We determine for individual assets the trade-off between the risk of failure and extended operating hours by combining a MMMM with a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to dynamically optimize the policy for when and how to maintain the asset.","Hofmann, Paul; Tashman, Zaid",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,592,16

We propose a new technique for transforming CHCs with ADTs into CHCs where predicates are defined over basic types, such as integers and booleans, only. Thus, our technique avoids the explicit use of inductive proof rules during satisfiability proofs. The main extension over previous techniques for ADT removal is a new transformation rule, called differential replacement, which allows us to introduce auxiliary predicates corresponding to the lemmas used when making inductive proofs. We present an algorithm that applies the new rule, together with the traditional folding/unfolding rules, for the automatic removal of ADTs. We prove that if the set of the transformed clauses is satisfiable, then so is the set of the original clauses. By an experimental evaluation, we show that the use of the new rule significantly improves the effectiveness of ADT removal, and that our approach is competitive with respect to a state-of-the-art tool that extends the CVC4 solver with induction.","De Angelis, Emanuele; Fioravanti, Fabio; Pettorossi, Alberto; Proietti, Maurizio",Automated Reasoning,592,21

CMC constitute a small proportion of children, but have very high need for health services, are hospitalized frequently, and account for significant proportion of pediatric healthcare expenditures. High-quality home health nursing services are important for CMC, but models of care of home healthcare, after discharge of CMC from the hospital, have not been tested. Our project aims are to develop, implement, and test a model of care, called ICollab, to improve home healthcare delivery for CMC. The ICollab model consists of collaboration between HHN, primary-care physicians and clinicians of the complex care program of a tertiary-care children's hospital in the care of CMC. In this randomized clinical trial, we will recruit 110 CMC discharged home on home health nursing services. The intervention group (n = 55) will receive the ICollab intervention for 6 months post-discharge from the hospital, in addition to usual care. Children in the control group (n = 55) will receive only usual care. Outcome measures will include healthcare utilization metrics (hospitalization rates, emergency room visit rates, and days to readmission), caregiver burden and caregiver satisfaction with home healthcare, HHN retention, and HHN collaboration with other healthcare providers. We hypothesize that ICollab will reduce healthcare utilization and caregiver burden, and improve caregiver satisfaction with home healthcare, increase HHN retention, and increase HHN collaboration with other healthcare providers. Results of this study have the potential to provide a critically needed evidence-base for interventions to improve the quality of healthcare delivery for CMC.

The current coronavirus crisis will have a strong and negative impact on the German economy, according to the current business cycle expectations of German firms. To the extent that the training decisions of firms depend on these perceptions, we expect a downward shift in firm demand for apprentices and consequently also a decrease in the equilibrium number of apprenticeship contracts. To assess the impact of changes in business cycle expectations, we analyze German data on the apprenticeship market at the state-level and at the occupation-level within states from 2007 to 2019. We apply first-differences regressions to account for unobserved heterogeneity across states and occupations, allowing us to identify the association between changes in two popular measures of business cycle expectations (the ifo Business Climate Index and the ifo Employment Barometer) and subsequent changes in the demand for apprentices, the number of new apprenticeship contracts, unfilled vacancies and unsuccessful applicants. We find that the German apprenticeship market prior to the current crisis can be characterized by excess demand for apprentices (although there are matching problems in some states, with both a high share of unfilled vacancies and a high share of unsuccessful applicants). Taking into account the most recent data on business cycle expectations up to June 2020, we estimate that the coronavirus-related decrease in firms’ expectations about the business cycle can be associated with a predicted 8% decrease in firm demand for apprentices and a 6% decrease in the number of new apprenticeship positions in Germany compared to 2019 (− 30,000 apprenticeship contracts; 95% confidence interval: ± 8000).","Muehlemann, Samuel; Pfeifer, Harald; Wittek, Bernhard H.",Empirical Res Voc Ed Train,592,16

Francisella tularensis, which is a Gram-negative coccobacillus-shaped bacterium, is the causative agent of tularemia. Recently, an increase in the number of human tularemia cases has been noticed in several countries around the world. It has been reported mostly from North America, several Scandinavian countries, and certain Asian countries. The disease spreads through vectors such as mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flies, and ticks. Humans can acquire the disease through direct contact of sick animals, consumption of infected animals, drinking or direct contact of contaminated water, and inhalation of bacteria-loaded aerosols. Low infectious dose, aerosol route of infection, and its ability to induce fatal disease make it a potential agent of biological warfare. Tularemia leads to several clinical forms, such as glandular, ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. The disease is diagnosed through the use of culture, serology, or molecular methods. Quinolones, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides are frequently used in the treatment of tularemia. No licensed vaccine is available in the prophylaxis of tularemia and this is need of the time and high-priority research area.

In contrast, once trained, artificial neural networks such as deep encoder-decoder convolutional networks allow to predict aeroacoustics at lower cost and, depending on the quality of the employed network, also at high accuracy. The architecture for such a neural network is developed to predict the sound pressure level in a 2D square domain. It is trained by numerical results from up to 20,000 GPU-based lattice-Boltzmann simulations that include randomly distributed rectangular and circular objects, and monopole sources. Types of boundary conditions, the monopole locations, and cell distances for objects and monopoles serve as input to the network. Parameters are studied to tune the predictions and to increase their accuracy. The complexity of the setup is successively increased along three cases and the impact of the number of feature maps, the type of loss function, and the number of training data on the prediction accuracy is investigated. An optimal choice of the parameters leads to network-predicted results that are in good agreement with the simulated findings. This is corroborated by negligible differences of the sound pressure level between the simulated and the network-predicted results along characteristic lines and by small mean errors.","Rüttgers, Mario; Koh, Seong-Ryong; Jitsev, Jenia; Schröder, Wolfgang; Lintermann, Andreas",High Performance Computing,592,1

Local actors assume special responsibilities in these partnerships: They provide health care services to particularly vulnerable groups and can convey information on context-specific problems of rights-holders to the national government and international organizations.

All patients were completely asymptomatic. They included 72 males and 48 females (60%:40%). Their age ranged from 10 to 58 years (mean 35.95 ± 12.25 SD). HRCT was analyzed by three expert consultant radiologists in consensus. Among asymptomatic initially screened COVID-19 patients, additional to GGOs, bilateral consolidative changes were unexpectedly found together with secondary fibrosis (23.3% and 10%). HRCT results significantly impacted the clinical decision (P < 0.0001); PCR had to be repeated with home isolation (43.3%). Infected health care providers had to stop their duty immediately (20%). Isolated hospitalization replaced routine ward admission (25%). Cautious surgical interference was performed using full personal protective equipment (PPE) (8.3%). Among asymptomatic recovered COVID-19 patients, unexpected large lesions (> 3 cm) were found (70%). Near 50% of lung volume was persistently affected (10%). Secondary fibrosis was striking (33%). Encysted hydro-pneumothorax persisted for a whole month (1.7%). “No-isolation” decision remained unchanged because of clinical and laboratory stability; however, steroids were prescribed to speed lung recovery. CONCLUSION: HRCT findings among asymptomatic and recovered COVID-19 patients can be unexpected and can definitely impact the clinical decision.","Samir, Ahmed; Abdelgawad, Mohamed Saied; Baess, Ayman Ibrahim; Hassan, Hebatallah Hassan Mamdouh",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,592,1

Cancellation of non-essential activities and social distancing policies are implemented during this crisis to avoid spread of the infection. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective reviews were performed from a Level-II trauma-center from November 2019 (one month before the outbreak started in China) to April 2020. General demographics, mechanism of trauma, diagnosis, and treatment were recorded. We dichotomized the data between pre-COVID-19 (before March 1st) and COVID-19 period, and compared differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients composed our cohort, with a mean age of 66.2 years (SD+/−: 18.9), and 66% male. An average of 25 neuro-traumas/month was observed, with the highest average cases per day in March (1 case/day), and the lowest in April (0.6 cases/day). We noticed a progressive decrease of neuro-traumas since the beginning of March (from 11 cases to 2 cases a week), with the lowest point in the first week of April. This tendency was evident after March 16th, simultaneously with the cancellation of all non-essential activities in NYC during COVID-19 era, the most common mechanism of trauma was mechanical fall, but it was less frequent compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (61.4% vs 40.8; P = .04). Subdural hematomas were the most common pathology in both periods. Non-operative management was selected for most patients (79.2 vs 87.8%, P = .201) in both periods, but the tendency to convert code status to Do-Not-Intubate/Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNI/DNR) increased during the COVID-19 crisis (5.9% to 12.2%, P = .041). CONCLUSION: A temporary decrease of neuro-traumas was observed during the initial phase and peak of the crisis. This tendency was observed simultaneously with the implementation of social-distancing policies as the number of total infected patients was rising in NYC. Mechanical falls were the most frequent cause of neuro-trauma in both periods. More neuro-trauma patients were converted to DNI/DNR code during the crisis and this was not necessarily related to patient's COVID-19 status.","Lara-Reyna, Jacques J; Yaeger, Kurt; Rossitto, Christina P; Camara, Divaldo; Wedderburn, Raymond; Ghatan, Saadi; Bederson, Joshua B; Margetis, Konstantinos",Neurosurgery,592,1

Thus, virus indexing has become imperative to determine the status of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) in Ebonyi State, to implement appropriate preventive and control strategies. Seventy-eight cassava accessions obtained from different locations of Ebonyi State were phenotypically scored, using scales 1–5 depending on CMD symptomatic expressions, followed by multiplex-PCR and sequencing for validation. 11% of cassava accessions cultivated in Afikpo were resistant (RE) to ACMV compared to 8% of moderately-resistant (MR) accessions in Izzi and 55% of tolerant (TO) ACMV accessions in Ebonyi. 100% of cassava accessions in Onicha and 66% in Afikpo South were susceptible (SU) and highly susceptible (HS) to ACMV, respectively. With multiplex-PCR, 97.4% (ACMV) and 2.6% (EACMV) were positive. Dunn’s multiple comparison tests of CMD mean incidence demonstrated differences (P < 0.05), except between RE and MR, and TO and MR. More transitions (A/G, C/T) compared to transversions (A/T, G/T), were detected, with nonsynonymous mutations (Leucine/Isoleucine; Valine/Isoleucine; Arginine/Lysine; Methionine/Isoleucine), and good bit-scores (91.13–99.07% identites; e-values of 7.00e(−148)–0.00e(+00)). Phylogeny resolved the sequences into five major groups. DNA sequencing validated the detected ACMV and EACMV species. This study revealed variants of ACMV and low adoption of RE and MR cassava accessions in the farmers’ fields. The findings will guide in getting disease-free and resistant varieties as planting materials to significantly mitigate the CMD spread in Ebonyi State, Nigeria.

We consider whether National Early Warning Scores (NEWS/NEWS2) could contribute to COVID-19 surveillance in care homes. We analysed NEWS measurements from care homes in England (December 2019 to May 2020). We estimated pre-COVID (baseline) levels for NEWS and NEWS components using 80th and 20th centile scores for measurements before March 2020. We used time-series to compare the proportion of above-baseline NEWS to area-matched reports of registered deaths in care home residents from the Office for National Statistics We analysed 29,656 anonymised NEWS from 6,464 people in 480 care home units across 46 local authority areas. From March 23rd to May 20th, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19, 4,221 other causes) in corresponding geographical areas. A rise in the proportion of above-baseline NEWS was observed from March 16th 2020. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in deaths. We conclude that NEWS could contribute to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents’ health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.","Stow, Daniel; Barker, Robert; Matthews, Fiona; Hanratty, Barbara",Innov Aging,592,28

We studied the potential to counteract these negative effects, examining the before and after measurements of participants in two obesity intervention studies that were converted from in-person to remote delivery, due to COVID-19. The Veterans Achieving Weight Loss and Optimizing Resilience-Using Protein study (VALOR-UP; n=9) and the Egg-Supplemented Pre-Diabetes Intervention Trial (EGGSPDITE; n=6) enrolled obese (BMI = 34.2±3.8 kg/m2) older adults (age = 71.5±4.5 yrs; 80% male; 47% black) with prediabetes (fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL and/or HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%). Participants followed a hypocaloric diet, attended weekly support groups, and weighed themselves weekly; VALOR-UP participants also attended a weekly exercise class delivered remotely. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-COVID) and the end of a 4-month period coinciding with stay-at-home orders. Between baseline and 4 months, calorie intakes (3-day diet record) decreased by 402.1±529.3 kcal/day (p<0.05) and body weight by 6% (6.1±3.4 kg; p<0.0001). Physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery) improved by 1.1±1.4 units (p<0.01) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical and mental composite quality of life remained stable (p=0.63 and p=0.48, respectively). Thus, despite COVID-19 circumstances, most participants were able to benefit from an intervention to improve function and reduce obesity. The somewhat surprising findings for this small cohort offer promise not only for future lifestyle interventions during COVID-19 isolation but also for other isolated populations, including home-bound older adults.","Starr, Kathryn Porter; Borack, Michael; Miller, Marshall; Fruik, Angela; Rincker, Jamie; Wallis, Jessica; Hakim, Amir; Bales, Connie",Innov Aging,592,16

METHODS: We obtained RNAseq profiles of 62 prospectively enrolled COVID-19 patients and 24 healthy controls (HC). We collected 23 independent studies profiling 1,855 blood samples from patients covering six viruses (influenza, RSV, HRV, Ebola, Dengue and SARS-CoV-1). We studied host whole-blood transcriptomic responses in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 viral infections to understand similarities and differences in host response. Gene signature threshold was absolute effect size ≥1, FDR ≤ 0.05%. RESULTS: Differential gene expression of COVID-19 vs HC are highly correlated with non-COVID-19 vs HC (r=0.74, p< 0.001). We discovered two gene signatures: COVID-19 vs HC (2002 genes) (COVIDsig) and non-COVID-19 vs HC (635 genes) (nonCOVIDsig). Pathway analysis of over-expressed signature genes in COVIDsig or nonCOVIDsig identified similar pathways including neutrophil activation, innate immune response, immune response to viral infection and cytokine production. Conversely, for under-expressed genes, pathways indicated repression of lymphocyte differentiation and activation (Fig1). Intersecting the two gene signatures found two genes significantly oppositely regulated (ACO1, ATL3). We derived a third gene signature using COCONUT to compare COVID-19 to non-COVID-19 viral infections (416 genes) (Fig2). Pathway analysis did not result in significant enrichment, suggesting identification of novel biology (Fig1). Statistical deconvolution of bulk transcriptomic data found M1 macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T cells and total B cells changed in the same direction across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infections. Cell types that increased in COVID-19 relative to non-COVID-19 were CD56(bright) NK cells, M2 macrophages and total NK cells. Those that decreased in non-COVID-19 relative to COVID-19 were CD56(dim) NK cells & memory B cells and eosinophils (Fig3). Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] Figure 3 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The concordant and discordant responses mapped here provide a window to explore the pathophysiology of COVID-19 vs other viral infections and show clear differences in signaling pathways and cellularity as part of the host response to SARS-CoV-2.

Our research group conducted a large pragmatic cluster randomized influenza vaccine trial in 965 nursing homes (NCT03965195). Due to the pandemic and its impact after the influenza season, we prospectively collected reports of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and performed a prospective study on the association between contract staffing and reported outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized those using more contract nursing care would have higher risk of an outbreak. METHODS: From February through April, we collected monthly facility-level, self-reported data on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Facility characteristics were taken from public data from Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services. Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were identified using a LASSO variable selection procedure, with a generalized linear, Poisson family model. Facility characteristics evaluated include demographics (e.g. number of residents), influenza vaccination rates, quality measures (e.g. % with UTI), and functional status (e.g. % with tube feedings). Facilities with contract staffing hours in the upper 25% quantile of direct care (RN, LPN, CNA) were considered ‘heavy use’. RESULTS: Of 965 randomized NHs, 663/965 (69%) reported data on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. On average, 13% of facilities had at least one outbreak, with 5/842 (0.5%) outbreaks in February, 91/835 (10.8%) in March and 217/686 (30%) in April. SARS-CoV-2 (+) facilities were larger (average total beds, 151 vs. 117), but were mostly similar by functional and cognitive status. Occupancy rate, total residents, Influenza vaccination rate, % with UTI, receiving respiratory treatments, tube feedings, and Medicaid payers were adjusted for in the analysis. The ‘heavy use’ of contract staffing included those with >223 hours per quarter. A multivariable regression found the relative risk SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was 1.56 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.22, 1.99) with heavy use of contract staffing. CONCLUSION: The participating nursing homes in our vaccine trial with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were larger. Our study highlights that heavy use of contract staffing was associated with 56% increased risk of an outbreak.

The models are validated in a period characterized by unprecedented turmoil and tested in a period of bear markets, allowing the assessment of whether the predictions are good even when the market direction changes between the validation and test periods. The classification and regression methods use attributes from trading and network activity for the period from August 15, 2015 to March 03, 2019, with the test sample beginning on April 13, 2018. For the test period, five out of 18 individual models have success rates of less than 50%. The trading strategies are built on model assembling. The ensemble assuming that five models produce identical signals (Ensemble 5) achieves the best performance for ethereum and litecoin, with annualized Sharpe ratios of 80.17% and 91.35% and annualized returns (after proportional round-trip trading costs of 0.5%) of 9.62% and 5.73%, respectively.

However, the effects of liraglutide on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the promoting effects of liraglutide were investigated in MC3T3-E1 cells. The results indicated that cell viability was affected following the treatment of the cells with different concentrations of liraglutide (0, 10, 100, and 1000 nM) at different time periods of culture (24, 48, and 72 h). Moreover, the activity levels of alkaline phosphatase and the number of mineralized nodules in MC3T3-E1 cells were significantly increased following treatment with 100 nM liraglutide. The mRNA and protein levels of Col-1, OPG, and OCN in MC3T3-E1 cells were also markedly increased following 100 nM liraglutide treatment compared with those of the control group. The expression levels of the ERK5 signaling pathway key proteins (MEK5, p-ERK5, ERK5, and NUR77) were increased following liraglutide treatment in MC3T3-E1 cells, and the gene expression levels of the ERK5 signaling pathway were also elevated. Moreover, the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92 significantly decreased the expression levels of p-ERK5 and NUR77 as well as the proliferation of osteoblasts. However, these changes could be rescued by liraglutide to some extent. Therefore, these results revealed that liraglutide may promote osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation in MC3T3-E1 cells via the activation of the ERK5 signaling pathway.","Sun, Yue; Liang, Yuzhen; Li, Zhengming; Xia, Ning",Int J Endocrinol,592,1

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study performed in children younger than 12 years admitted to PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Data were collected on all consecutive CXRs performed between December 2016 and April 2017. The primary outcome was to assess the factors that were associated with higher chest radiograph prescriptions in PICU. Secondary outcomes were to study the indications, association with mechanical ventilation, image quality and avoidable radiation exposure. RESULTS: Of 303 children admitted during the study period, 159 underwent a total of 524 CXRs in PICU. Median (IQR) age of the study cohort was 2 (0.6–5) years. More than two thirds [n = 115, 72.3%] were mechanically ventilated. Most CXRs (n = 449, 85.7%) were performed on mechanically ventilated patients, amounting to a median (IQR) of 3 (2–5) radiographs per ventilated patient. With increasing duration of ventilation, the number of CXRs proportionately increased in the first two weeks of mechanical ventilation. In non-ventilated children, about two thirds (68%) underwent only one CXR. Majority of the prescriptions were on demand (n = 461, 88%). Most common indications were peri-procedure prescriptions (37%) followed by evaluation for respiratory disease status (24%). About 40% CXRs resulted in interventions; adjustment in ventilator settings (13.5%) was the most frequent intervention. In 26% (n = 138) of radiographs, image quality required improvement. One or more additional body part exposure other than chest and upper abdomen were noted 336 (64%) images. Children with > 3 CXR had higher PRISM III score, more often mechanically ventilated, had higher number of indwelling devices [mean (SD) 2.6 (1.2) vs. 1.7 (1.0)] and stayed longer in PICU [median (IQR) 11(7.5–18.5) vs. 6 (3–9)]. CONCLUSION: On demand prescription was the prevalent practice in our PICU. Most non-ventilated children underwent only one CXR while duration of PICU stay and the number of devices determined the number of CXRs in mechanically ventilated children. Quality improvement strategies should concentrate on the process of acquisition of images and limiting the radiation exposure to unwanted body parts.","Gupta, Rajeev; Nallasamy, Karthi; Williams, Vijai; Saxena, Akshay Kumar; Jayashree, Muralidharan",BMC Med Imaging,592,1

This retrospective study is aiming to assess the role and benefits of using HFNCO compared to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in management of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of the files of 63 patients with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 37 patients received HFNCO as initial therapy, and 26 patients were primarily treated with NIV. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of baseline characteristics, laboratory tests, arterial blood gases, PaO2/FiO2 values, and vital signs. Re-assessment after 24 h of starting treatment with either HFNCO or NIV showed significant improvement (P<0.01) in the respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygenation parameters. The magnitude of improvement of the vital signs and oxygenation was not significantly different between patients using HFNCO or NIV. Success rate of HFNCO was 86.4%, endotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 10.81% of patients, and mortality rate was 2.7%. Success rate of NIV was 84.6%, endotracheal intubation rate was 11.53%, and mortality rate was 3.8%. No significant difference (P>0.05) between the 2 groups as regards the duration of treatment, rate of endotracheal intubation with invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate. CONCLUSION: High flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNCO) is effective in the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with COVID-19. Its efficacy is similar to NIV, with no difference in the duration of treatment, endotracheal intubation rate, or mortality rate.","Shoukri, Amr Mounir",Egypt J Bronchol,592,1

The outcome of TGCT depends on pathologic type and tumor stage. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influence numerous cancers via post-transcriptional regulation. The prognostic importance of RBPs in TGCT has not been fully investigated. In this study, we set up a prognostic risk model of TGCT using six significantly differentially expressed RBPs, namely, TRMT61A, POLR2J, DIS3L2, IFIH1, IGHMBP2, and NPM2. The expression profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression datasets. We observed by performing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analyses that in the training cohort, the expression of six RBPs was correlated with disease-free survival in patients with TGCT. We assessed the specificity and sensitivity of 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival status prediction using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and successfully validated using the test cohorts, the entire TCGA cohort, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analyses were carried out to seek the possible signaling pathways related with risk score. We also examined the association between the model based on six RBPs and different clinical characteristics. A nomogram was established for TGCT recurrence prediction. Consensus clustering analysis was carried out to identify the clusters of TGCT with different clinical outcomes. Ultimately, external validations of the six-gene risk score were performed by using the GSE3218 and GSE10783 datasets downloaded from the GEO database. In general, our study constructed a prognostic model based on six RBPs, which could serve as independent risk factor in TGCT, especially in seminoma, and might have brilliant clinical application value.","Yao, Liangyu; Cong, Rong; Ji, Chengjian; Zhou, Xiang; Luan, Jiaochen; Meng, Xianghu; Song, Ninghong",Front Genet,592,1

Female sex, genetic predisposition, sun exposure, smoking and some medications serve as risk factors for LE. The most important CLE forms are the acute-cutaneous LE (e.g., butterfly rash, generalized macular–papular rash, enoral), the subacute-cutaneous LE (e.g., annular) and the chronic-cutaneous LE (e.g., scaring discoid lesions, panniculitis, chilblain-LE). Diagnosis is primarily based upon the clinical picture and its histopathology. Results of autoimmune serology and direct immunofluorescence can be helpful. For mild forms of CLE local therapy is often sufficient. If not, hydroxychloroquine is the first choice of systemic therapy in addition to transient systemic steroids. For recalcitrant cases additional therapy with methotrexate, retinoids, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, thalidomide, belimumab and rituximab may be used. All CLE therapies are off-label. An update of conventional vaccinations is advisable, if possible, to be performed before starting immunosuppressive therapies. To objectively verify the therapeutic response, the periodic scoring using the RCLASI (Revised CLE Disease Area and Severity Index) is recommended. Preventive sun protection (cream, clothing, travel destinations) is of pivotal importance, since intense UV-exposure can provoke disease flares. LE is no contraindication against a pregnancy. However, pregnancy should not start during a disease flare since it increases the risk for adverse outcomes for the fetus and mother. Steroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone and azathioprine serve as suitable therapies during pregnancy.","Heil, P. M.",hautnah,592,5

The study was conducted at two different universities—in Europe and the Middle East. Cell phone usage is analyzed from the perspective of mobile learning. The data in this study were collected from 103 students from the University of Latvia and 106 students from a Middle Eastern private American University. This study shows that there is no significant difference on how the two groups perceive the use of cell phone and their opinion of its impact on their academic performance. The obtained results are in line with the theoretical model. They show the influence of perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness on students’ attitudes towards using cell phones. Data shows that there is a positive relationship between cell phone usage and students’ perception of its effect on their academic performance. This study reveals several interesting findings, and it is believed that this research offers the educators and administrators further insight in analysing the current effect of cell phones on students’ academic performance and the possibility of adopting mobile learning as one of the technological tools which supports technology enhanced learning.

Yet, they encounter stressors that can negatively impact their well-being, relationships with children, and, ultimately, job retention. To inform efforts to support early childhood teachers’ work-related well-being, the current study examines positive factors that predict work engagement. Participants were 50 early childhood teachers from Head Start (34%), center-based programs (32%), and licensed home-based programs (34%). Consistent with a resilience framework and the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined both a personal resource (self-efficacy) and a workplace resource (professional support) in relation to work engagement, or the positive, fulfilling connection to one’s work. Teachers’ self-efficacy and professional support predicted greater work engagement, accounting for job demands (teachers’ compassion fatigue/work distress and children’s challenging behaviors) and teachers’ education and professional development. Although not causal, findings are suggestive that supporting early childhood teachers with what they need to do their job effectively and feel that they can make meaningful differences in children’s lives may help them to engage in their work with passion, dedication, and positive energy. Ultimately, supporting teachers’ work engagement may in turn have developmental benefits for children as well.","Lipscomb, Shannon T.; Chandler, Kelly D.; Abshire, Caitlyn; Jaramillo, Jamie; Kothari, Brianne",Early Child Educ J,592,26

Some studies have demonstrated an association with bleeding risk, whereas others have not. We studied the population of our level II emergency department (ED) trauma center to determine the risk of bleeding in patients receiving APT and whether bleeding results not from antiplatelet agents but rather from age. We assessed the bleeding risk, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) that necessitated hospitalization for observation, the need for cranial neurosurgery, the severity of the patient’s condition at discharge, and the frequency of ED revisits for head trauma in patients receiving APT. Materials and Methods: This retrospective single-center study included 483 patients receiving APT who were in the ED for MHT in 2019. The control group consisted of 1443 patients in the ED with MHT over the same period who were not receiving APT or anticoagulant therapy. Our ED diagnostic therapeutic protocol mandates both triage and the medical examination to identify patients with MHT who are taking any anticoagulant or APT. Results: APT was not significantly associated with bleeding risk (p > 0.05); as a risk factor, age was significantly associated with the risk of bleeding, even after adjustment for therapy. Patients receiving APT had a greater need of surgery (1.2% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.0001) and a higher rate of hospitalization (52.9% vs. 37.4%; p < 0.0001), and their clinical condition was more severe (evaluated according to the exit code value on a one-dimensional quantitative five-point numerical scale) at the time of discharge (p = 0.013). The frequency of ED revisits due to head trauma did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: The risk of bleeding in patients receiving APT who had MHT was no higher than that in the control group. However, the clinical condition of patients receiving APT, including hospital admission for ICH monitoring and cranial neurosurgical interventions, was more severe.","Savioli, Gabriele; Ceresa, Iride Francesca; Luzzi, Sabino; Giotta Lucifero, Alice; Pioli Di Marco, Maria Serena; Manzoni, Federica; Preda, Lorenzo; Ricevuti, Giovanni; Bressan, Maria Antonietta",Medicina (Kaunas),592,1

Large datasets of natural and synthetic compounds are computationally searched for molecules that fit into these alternative sites, and any compounds that fit will be targeted for experimental testing for their ability to inhibit the functions of these viral enzymes.

In particular, it allows for heterogeneity in provincial export capacity, which significantly reduces pro-export effects, and select the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood as the most suitable estimator according to diagnostic tests. When both immigration and emigration are instrumented, the pro-export effect of immigrants found by previous studies vanishes and that of emigrants, instead, appears appreciable. The results obtained suggest that over the period that encompasses the double-deep crisis, immigrants did not show significant information and enforcement effects in the considered context, while the effects of emigrant demand for home-country goods may have been important. The prevalence of emigrant over immigrant effects appears attributable to a change in the composition of the migration stocks over the considered period of crisis.","D’Ambrosio, Anna; Montresor, Sandro",Rev World Econ,592,24

Spirituality is hypothesized to impact pain experience in various ways. Nevertheless, the role that spirituality plays in multimodal pain therapy remains controversial and, to date, quantitative data on whether and for which patients spiritual aspects should be considered in the treatment of chronic pain is lacking. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the proportion and characteristics of patients with chronic pain who wish spiritual aspects to be integrated in their treatment. Methods: Two hundred nine patients with chronic pain were recruited from five inpatient departments and outpatient clinics in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Patients filled out validated questionnaires, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Resilience Scale (RS-11), the Spiritual and Religious Attitudes in Dealing with Illness (SpREUK), and the 12-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp-12). Results: More than 60% (CI(95%): 55.5–67.9%) of the patients wanted to address spiritual aspects in their treatment. These patients were significantly younger, had higher levels of education, and suffered from more frequent and more severe pain than patients who did not wish to address spiritual aspects. Furthermore, there were high correlations with existing spiritual resources and higher scores of spirituality. Conclusions: These results confirm that the majority of chronic pain patients wish spiritual aspects to be considered in their treatment. Additionally, the finding that these patients had more spiritual resources underlines the importance of integrating spiritual aspects in a resource-oriented, patient-centered care approach for this condition.","Hasenfratz, Karin; Moergeli, Hanspeter; Sprott, Haiko; Ljutow, André; Hefti, René; Rittmayer, Isabelle; Peng-Keller, Simon; Rufer, Michael",Front Psychiatry,592,16

However, the correlations of PER1 with prognosis and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in ovarian cancer (OV) remain unclear. Methods: The Oncomine and TIMER databases were used to examine the expression of PER1 in OV. Kaplan–Meier Plotter and PrognoScan were used to evaluate the relationship between PER1 and prognosis. Kaplan–Meier Plotter was used to analyze the relationships between PER1 and clinicopathological features of OV patients. The relationship between PER1 expression and immune infiltration in OV was investigated using the TIMER database and CIBERSORT algorithm. The STRING database was used to analyze PER1-related protein functional groups, the GeneMANIA online tool was used to analyze gene groups with similar functions to those of PER1, and Network Analyst was used to identify transcription factors that regulate PER1. The correlation between PER1 and immunoinvasion of OV was analyzed using TIMER. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect PER1 expression. Results: PER1 was differentially expressed in different cancer tissues, and its expression in various OV subtypes was lower than that in normal ovarian tissue. OV patients with low PER1 expression had a reduced overall survival rate. Decreased PER1 expression in stage 1 and stage 1+2 OV patients was related to poor prognosis, while increased PER1 expression in stage 3+4 patients and TP53 mutation were related to poor overall survival and progression-free survival. We identified eight genes whose expression was strongly correlated with that of PER1, as well as four transcription factors that regulate PER1. In OV, PER1 expression levels were positively correlated with infiltration levels of cells including neutrophils, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages, and closely related to a variety of immune markers. Reduced expression of PER1 was significantly associated with poor overall survival. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PER1 could be used as a prognostic biomarker to determine prognosis and immune infiltration in OV patients.","Chen, Mali; Zhang, Lili; Liu, Xiaolong; Ma, Zhen; Lv, Ling",Front Genet,592,16

After dissociation, fluorescent signals from mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus are extracted with a bespoke app and used to generate rates of nuclear entry and exit. Using this method, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of YAP1 on canonical sites enhances its rate of nuclear export. Moreover, we provide evidence that, despite high intercellular variability, YAP1 import and export rates correlated within the same cell. By simultaneously releasing YAP1 and TAZ from sequestration, we show that their rates of entry and exit are correlated. Furthermore, combining the optogenetic release of YAP1 with lattice light-sheet microscopy revealed high heterogeneity of YAP1 dynamics within different cytoplasmic regions, demonstrating the utility and versatility of our tool to study protein dynamics.","Dowbaj, Anna M; Jenkins, Robert P; Williamson, Daniel; Heddleston, John M; Ciccarelli, Alessandro; Fallesen, Todd; Hahn, Klaus M; O'Dea, Reuben D; King, John R; Montagner, Marco; Sahai, Erik",Journal of cell science,592,1

The median patient age was 76.0 years (range, 70-88); the ECOG-PS was 0 in 24 patients and 1 in 15 patients. The median PFS was 9.4 months as a primary endpoint, and the median OS was 22.4 months. The ORR was 40.5% and the disease control rate was 86.5%. Grade 3-4 AEs included neutropenia (71.8%), leukopenia (51.3%), anorexia (15.4%), febrile neutropenia (10.3%), and fatigue (10.3%). CONCLUSIONS FTD/TPI plus Bev is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. Capecitabine/bevacizumab can be selected as a subsequent maintenance therapy without irinotecan and oxaliplatin because FTD/TPI has no cross-resistance with 5-fluorouracil.

METHODS A total of 150 consecutive patients (74 adolescents and 81 adults) were admitted to a 20-week intensive CBT-E program (13 weeks of inpatient followed by 7 weeks of day-hospital treatment). All patients had responded poorly to previous outpatient treatments and were assessed at admission, end of treatment (EOT), and 20- and 60-week follow-ups. RESULTS About 70% of eligible patients began the program, and more than 85% completed it. Body mass index (BMI) in adults and BMI-for-age percentile in adolescents improved significantly from baseline to EOT, remained stable until 20-week follow-up, and slightly decreased from 20-week follow-up to 60-week follow-up, while remaining in the lower normal range. Eating disorder psychopathology, general psychopathology, and clinical impairment scores decreased significantly at EOT and showed only a slight increase from EOT to follow-ups. No difference was found between adolescent and adult patients in treatment acceptance, dropout, or any outcome measure. DISCUSSION These findings indicate that intensive CBT-E seems to be an effective treatment for severely ill adolescent and adult patients with anorexia nervosa.","Dalle Grave, Riccardo; Conti, Maddalena; Calugi, Simona",The International journal of eating disorders,592,31

METHODS The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent stroke in Intracranial Stenosis trial is an ongoing, randomized, multicenter, 2-arm trial that will determine whether intracranial angioplasty and stenting adds benefit to aggressive medical management alone for preventing the primary endpoint (any stroke or death within 30 days after enrollment or after any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up, or stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days) during a mean follow-up of 2 years in patients with recent TIA or stroke caused by 70% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery. Aggressive medical management in both arms consists of aspirin 325 mg per day, clopidogrel 75 mg per day for 90 days after enrollment, intensive risk factor management primarily targeting systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg (<130 mm Hg in diabetics) and low density cholesterol <70 mg/dL, and a lifestyle modification program. The sample size required to detect a 35% reduction in the rate of the primary endpoint from angioplasty and stenting based on the log-rank test with an alpha of 0.05, 80% power, and adjusting for a 2% loss to follow-up and 5% crossover from the medical to the stenting arm is 382 patients per group. RESULTS Enrollment began in November 2008 and 451 patients have been enrolled as of March 31, 2011. CONCLUSIONS This is the first randomized stroke prevention trial to compare angioplasty and stenting with medical therapy in patients with intracranial arterial stenosis and to incorporate intensive management of multiple risk factors and a lifestyle modification program in the study design. Hopefully, the results of the trial will lead to more effective therapy for this high-risk disease.","Chimowitz, Marc I; Lynn, Michael J; Turan, Tanya N; Fiorella, David; Lane, Bethany F; Janis, Scott; Derdeyn, Colin P",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,592,14

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, controlled experimental study, paired design. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 5) METHODS: Full-thickness skin wounds (4 cm × 1.5 cm) were created bilaterally on the antebrachia of 5 dogs (n = 10). Excised skin was grafted to the contralateral limb. Grafts were randomized to NPWT or bolster dressings (control; CON). NPWT was applied continuously for 7 days. Grafts were evaluated on Days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 17, biopsied on days 0, 4, 7, and 14, and had microbial culture on Day 7. Outcome variables were: time to first appearance of granulation tissue, percent graft necrosis, and percent open mesh. Significance was set at P < .05. Histologic findings, culture results, and graft appearance were reported. RESULTS Granulation tissue appeared earlier in the NPWT grafts compared with CON grafts. Percent graft necrosis and remaining open mesh area were both greater in CON grafts compared with NPWT grafts at most time points. Histologic results showed no significant difference in all variables measured, and all cultures were negative. CONCLUSIONS Variables of graft acceptance were superior when NPWT was used in the first week post-grafting. Fibroplasia was enhanced, open meshes closed more rapidly and less graft necrosis occurred with NPWT application. More preclinical studies are required to evaluate histologic differences.","Stanley, Bryden J; Pitt, Kathryn A; Weder, Christian D; Fritz, Michele C; Hauptman, Joe G; Steficek, Barbara A",Veterinary surgery : VS,592,12

A recent study introduced Blumgart anastomosis (BA), which minimizes severe complications after PD. This study compares BA with conventional anastomosis (CA) for pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) after PD at a single institution. Methods A total of 87 patients who underwent PD at our hospital between January 2003 and October 2015 were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the anastomosis type. Of them, 44 patients underwent anastomosis using CA (group A, conventional duct-to-mucosa anastomosis) and 43 underwent anastomosis using BA (group B, Blumgart anastomosis). Results There was a significant difference in duration of the operation between groups A and B (473.1±102.0 versus 386.4±58.5 min, p<0.001) and intraoperative transfusion (2.2±2.7 versus 0.7±1.5 units, p<0.001). There was no significant difference between groups A and B in incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (43.2% versus 27.9%, p=0.137) ,postoperative hemorrhage (PPH) (13.7% versus 7.0%, p=0.209), delayed gastric emptying (DGE) (29.5% versus 9.3%, p=0.063), surgical and non-surgical complications (60.5% versus 59.1%, p=0.896), length of ICU stay (9.0±6.3 versus 7.4±7.2 days, p=0.099), or length of postoperative hospital stay (37.7±16.7 versus 41.6±15.1 days, p=0.118).

Non-compatibility of material in the vascular system could obstruct the way of the biological fluids. The concept of development of polymeric composite material for vascular implants is to provide enough support to the vessel and to restore the vessel in the natural state after degradation. In this research, the polycaprolactone composite materials (carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone) were developed by reinforcement of the 0%-2% of carbonyl iron powder using the solvent cast three-dimensional printing technique. The physicochemical properties of developed composites were characterized in conjunction with mechanical and biological properties. The mechanical characterizations were assessed by uniaxial tensile testing as well as flexibility testing. The results of mechanical testing assured that carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone composites have shown desirable properties for vascular implants. Besides the mechanical characterization, in vitro biological investigations of carbonyl iron powder/polycaprolactone were done for analyzing blood compatibility and cytocompatibility. The results revealed that the materials developed were biocompatible, less hemolytic, and having non-thrombogenic properties indicating the promising applications in the field of cardiovascular applications.","Singh, Jasvinder; Kaur, Tejinder; Singh, Neetu; Pandey, Pulak Mohan","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The Gambia introduced PCV7 in August, 2009, and PCV13 in May, 2011. We aimed to measure the impact of the introduction of these vaccines on pneumonia incidence. METHODS We did population-based surveillance and case-control studies. The primary endpoint was WHO-defined radiological pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation. Population-based surveillance was for suspected pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months (minimum age 3 months in the case-control study) between May 12, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015. Surveillance for the impact study was limited to the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS), whereas surveillance for the case-control study included both the BHDSS and Fuladu West Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Nurses screened all outpatients and inpatients at all health facilities in the surveillance area using standardised criteria for referral to clinicians in Basse and Bansang. These clinicians recorded clinical findings and applied standardised criteria to identify patients with suspected pneumonia. We compared the incidence of pneumonia during the baseline period (May 12, 2008, to May 11, 2010) and the PCV13 period (Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2015). We also investigated the effectiveness of PCV13 using case-control methods between Sept 12, 2011, and Sept 31, 2014. Controls were aged 90 days or older, and were eligible to have received at least one dose of PCV13; cases had the same eligibility criteria with the addition of having WHO-defined radiological pneumonia. FINDINGS We investigated 18 833 children with clinical pneumonia and identified 2156 cases of radiological pneumonia. Among children aged 2-11 months, the incidence of radiological pneumonia fell from 21·0 cases per 1000 person-years in the baseline period to 16·2 cases per 1000 person-years (23% decline, 95% CI 7-36) in 2014-15. In the 12-23 month age group, radiological pneumonia decreased from 15·3 to 10·9 cases per 1000 person-years (29% decline, 12-42). In children aged 2-4 years, incidence fell from 5·2 to 4·1 cases per 1000 person-years (22% decline, 1-39). Incidence of all clinical pneumonia increased by 4% (-1 to 8), but hospitalised cases declined by 8% (3-13). Pneumococcal pneumonia declined from 2·9 to 1·2 cases per 1000 person-years (58% decline, 22-77) in children aged 2-11 months and from 2·6 to 0·7 cases per 1000 person-years (75% decline, 47-88) in children aged 12-23 months. Hypoxic pneumonia fell from 13·1 to 5·7 cases per 1000 person-years (57% decline, 42-67) in children aged 2-11 months and from 6·8 to 1·9 cases per 1000 person-years (72% decline, 58-82) in children aged 12-23 months. In the case-control study, the best estimate of the effectiveness of three doses of PCV13 against radiological pneumonia was an adjusted odds ratio of 0·57 (0·30-1·08) in children aged 3-11 months and vaccine effectiveness increased with greater numbers of doses (p=0·026). The analysis in children aged 12 months and older was underpowered because there were few unvaccinated cases and controls. INTERPRETATION The introduction of PCV in The Gambia was associated with a moderate impact on the incidence of radiological pneumonia, a small reduction in cases of hospitalised pneumonia, and substantial reductions of pneumococcal and hypoxic pneumonia in young children. Low-income countries that introduce PCV13 with reasonable coverage can expect modest reductions in hospitalised cases of pneumonia and a marked impact on the incidence of severe childhood pneumonia.

METHODS Genotyping 2066 CL cases and 2046 controls using Illumina HumanCoreExomeBeadChips provided data for 4,498,586 imputed single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Genome-wide association testing using linear mixed models took account of genetic diversity/ethnicity/admixture. Post-GWAS positional, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), and chromatin interaction mapping was performed in FUMA. Transcriptional data were compared between lesions and normal skin, and cytokines measured using flow cytometry and Bioplex assay. RESULTS Positional mapping identified 32 genomic loci associated with CL, none achieving genome-wide significance (P&5x10 -8). Lead SNVs at 23 loci occurred at protein coding or non-coding RNA genes, 15 with eQTLs for functionally relevant cells/tissues and/or showed differential expression in lesions. Of these, the 6 most plausible genetic risk loci were: SERPINB10 (Pimputed_1000G=2.67x10 -6), CRLF3 (Pimputed_1000G=5.12x10 -6), STX7 (Pimputed_1000G=6.06x10 -6), KRT80 (Pimputed_1000G=6.58x10 -6), LAMP3 (Pimputed_1000G=6.54x10 -6) and IFNG-AS1 (Pimputed_1000G=1.32x10 -5). LAMP3 (Padjusted=9.25x10 -12; +6-fold), STX7 (Padjusted=7.62x10 -3; +1.3-fold) and CRLF3 (Padjusted=9.19x10 -9; +1.97-fold) were expressed more highly in CL biopsies compared to normal skin; KRT80 (Padjusted=3.07x10 -8; -3-fold) was lower. Multiple cis-eQTLs across SERPINB10 mapped to chromatin interaction regions of transcriptional/enhancer activity in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells and haematopoietic stem cells. Those at IFNG-AS1 mapped to transcriptional/enhancer regions in T, natural killer, and B cells. The percent peripheral blood CD3 + T cells making antigen-specific interferon-γ differed significantly by IFNG-AS1 genotype.

RESULTS Seven patients had a history of basic lung diseases. All patients used different methods of oxygen therapy before the occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax according to the severity of the COVID-19, including 18 patients with ventilator-assisted breathing, 2 patients with bilevel positive airway pressure assisted breathing, and 1 patient with mask oxygen inhalation. All patients were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by chest CT (computed tomography) and virus nucleic acid detection and were found to have spontaneous pneumothorax through physical examination, bedside X-ray, and/or bedside ultrasound. 13 of 21 patients combined with pleural effusion at the same time. All the patients underwent closed thoracic drainage for spontaneous pneumothorax and the pleural effusion, if any. Nine patients died, and 12 patients recovered smoothly.

Although it has been suggested that these patients be transported to cardiac resuscitation centers, few jurisdictions have acted on this recommendation. To better evaluate the evidence on this subject, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available literature evaluating the association between the destination hospital's capability (cardiac resuscitation center or not) and resuscitation outcomes for adult patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was performed. Methods and Results PubMed, EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library databases were first searched using a specifically designed search strategy. Both original randomized controlled trials and observational studies were considered for inclusion. Cardiac resuscitation centers were defined as having on-site percutaneous coronary intervention and targeted temperature management capability at all times. The primary outcome measure was survival. Twelve nonrandomized observational studies were retained in this review. A total of 61 240 patients were included in the 10 studies that could be included in the meta-analysis regarding the survival outcome. Being transported to a cardiac resuscitation center was associated with an increase in survival (odds ratio=1.95 [95% confidence interval 1.47-2.59], P<0.001). Conclusions Adult patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest transported to cardiac resuscitation centers have better outcomes than their counterparts. When possible, it is reasonable to transport these patients directly to cardiac resuscitation centers (class II a, level of evidence B, nonrandomized).

Executive functions (EF) are cognitive processes that organise and guide behaviour towards one's goals. Both emotional awareness and EF play a role in processes such as emotion regulation and are risk factors for the development and maintenance of depression. Although previous research suggests that aspects of emotional awareness are related to EF, methodological and measurement limitations within the available literature make it difficult to clearly understand how they are associated. In this registered report, we examined the extent to which task-based measures of a specific EF process, shifting, are differentially related to unique facets of emotional awareness (i.e. emotional clarity of type, emotional clarity of source, voluntary attention to emotions, and involuntary attention to emotions), and to what extent EF and emotional awareness are related to depression. Using structural equation modelling, we found evidence that emotional clarity of type was associated with greater shifting cost. Shifting was not associated with any other facet of emotional awareness. Depression was linked to lower emotional clarity of type, higher involuntary attention to emotions, but not poorer EF performance. We discuss how emotional awareness and EF may be uniquely related to depression.","Eckland, Nathaniel S; Letkiewicz, Allison M; Berenbaum, Howard",Cognition & emotion,592,29

Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries were 26% and 27%, respectively, more likely to have obesity than those who had commercial insurance (Odds Ratio:1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.20-1.32; Odds Ratio:1.27, 95%CI:1.22-1.32). Moreover, Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries with obesity had a higher prevalence of diabetes compared with privately insured with obesity (10.58% and 10.44% vs 4.45%). Medicare beneficiaries with obesity had a statistically higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (4.34%, 95%CI: 3.77-4.91) than privately insured (3.21%, 95%CI: 2.94-3.47).Based on statewide data among 18 to 65 years old adults, Medicare and Medicaid provide health coverage to 40% of individuals with obesity and 46% of those with the obesity-related comorbidities and complications.

Here, we report three patients with compound heterozygous mutations in VPS41 (VPS41S285P and VPS41R662 * ; VPS41c.1423-2A>G and VPS41R662 * ) displaying neurodegeneration with ataxia and dystonia. Cellular consequences were investigated in patient fibroblasts and VPS41-depleted HeLa cells. All mutants prevented formation of a functional HOPS complex, causing delayed lysosomal delivery of endocytic and autophagic cargo. By contrast, VPS41S285P enabled regulated secretion. Strikingly, loss of VPS41 function caused a cytosolic redistribution of mTORC1, continuous nuclear localization of Transcription Factor E3 (TFE3), enhanced levels of LC3II, and a reduced autophagic response to nutrient starvation. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1 was not affected. In a C. elegans model of Parkinson's disease, co-expression of VPS41S285P /VPS41R662 * abolished the neuroprotective function of VPS41 against α-synuclein aggregates. We conclude that the VPS41 variants specifically abrogate HOPS function, which interferes with the TFEB/TFE3 axis of mTORC1 signaling, and cause a neurodegenerative disease.","van der Welle, Reini E N; Jobling, Rebekah; Burns, Christian; Sanza, Paolo; van der Beek, Jan A; Fasano, Alfonso; Chen, Lan; Zwartkruis, Fried J; Zwakenberg, Susan; Griffin, Edward F; Ten Brink, Corlinda; Veenendaal, Tineke; Liv, Nalan; van Ravenswaaij-Arts, Conny M A; Lemmink, Henny H; Pfundt, Rolph; Blaser, Susan; Sepulveda, Carolina; Lozano, Andres M; Yoon, Grace; Santiago-Sim, Teresa; Asensio, Cedric S; Caldwell, Guy A; Caldwell, Kim A; Chitayat, David; Klumperman, Judith",EMBO molecular medicine,592,16

DESIGN Florida's 2020 COVID-19 cases are summarized into age-specific county rates and supplemented with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and 2020 presidential voting results to assess the association of population age structure and political choices with age-specific COVID-19 infection, emergency, hospitalization, and mortality rates. RESULTS Younger counties experienced higher under-25 infection rates, as well as higher over-64 infection, emergency, and hospitalization rates. Older counties experienced reduced infection rates for all ages and decreased over-64 emergency and hospitalization rates. Trump's vote share was associated with higher infection rates for all and higher over-64 emergency, hospitalization, and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS Younger counties experience higher COVID-19 infection rates for all residents, with elevated morbidity risks among seniors.

METHODS The VAR technique aligns the stomach, duodenum, and jejunal loop vertically along the body's longitudinal axis. It was performed in 120 consecutive patients (between June 2008 and October 2015) who underwent PPPD. We evaluated the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE). RESULTS The incidence of DGE was 1.7% (n = 2). The proposed clinical grading classified these 2 cases of DGE as grade B. There was no DGE related to pancreatic fistula. The median duration to starting a solid diet was 3 days (range 3-5 days). The median operative time was 450 min (range 391-550 min). CONCLUSION The VAR technique allows the upper digestive tract to be aligned linearly and can minimize the risk of DGE after PPPD.","Kobayashi, Shinjiro; Koizumi, Satoshi; Hatori, Takashi; Segami, Kouhei; Hoshino, Hiroyuki; Otsubo, Takehito",Digestive surgery,592,1

Arteries affected by this complication are the celiac trunk (CTr) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and their evaluation is usually based on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is also a useful technique for diagnosing AAD and is essential in monitoring surgical or endovascular treatment when CTA is not available. However, the usefulness of TEE for evaluating CTr and SMA involvement and mesenteric ischemia mechanisms in AAD is not well established. Real-time information on mesenteric malperfusion is needed at the bedside, in primary care facilities and the operating room to achieve prompt diagnosis and better therapeutic management.

This hybrid docking-QSAR approach can provide valuable information about the most important chemical and structural features of the ligands that affect their inhibitory activities. Docking studies were used to find the actual conformations of chemicals in active site of HIV-1 protease. Then the molecular descriptors were calculated from these conformations. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) were used as QSAR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that statistical parameters of the LS-SVM model are better than the MLR model, which indicate that there are some non-linear relations between selected molecular descriptors and anti-HIV activities of interested chemicals. The correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and average absolute error (AAE) for LS-SVM are: R=0.988, RMSE=0.207 and AAE=0.145 for the training set, and R=0.965, RMSE=0.403 and AAE=0.338 for the test set.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether flat-panel detector multiphase computed tomography angiography protocol is associated with reduced treatment times and a similar safety profile as the standard imaging protocol. METHODS Single-center prospective study of consecutive patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes transferred to our facility for consideration of endovascular therapy from May 2016 to December 2017. Those with basilar strokes and/or presenting to the emergency department were excluded. Patients were categorized into two groups: (1) flat-panel detector CT assessment in stroke to reduce times to intra-arterial treatment group, with patients transferred directly to the suite for multiphase computed tomography angiography; and (2) patients undergoing standard protocol including computed tomography ± computed tomography angiography/CT perfusion. The groups were matched for age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and pretreatment glucose. Baseline characteristics, time metrics, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS Out of 419 patients who underwent endovascular therapy over the study period, 210 patients fit inclusion criteria, with 54 (25.7%) in the flat-panel detector CT assessment in stroke to reduce times to intra-arterial treatment group. After matching, 49 flat-panel detector CT assessment in stroke to reduce times to intra-arterial treatment/control pairs were generated and analyzed. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. Flat-panel detector CT assessment in stroke to reduce times to intra-arterial treatment patients had significantly shorter median door-to-puncture (33 [26.5-47] vs. 55 [44.5-66] min, p < 0.001), door-to-reperfusion (85 [57.5-115.5] vs. 110 [80-153], p = 0.005) and picture-to-puncture (18 [13.5-22.5] vs. 42 [32-47.5] min, p < 0.001) times. There were no differences in rates of successful reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3, 95.9% vs. 100%, p = 0.5), parenchymal hematomas type-2 (4.1% vs. 2%, p = 1.00), good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale 0-2, 44.9% vs. 40.8%, p = 0.68), and 90-day mortality (14.3% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.30).

CBT-I is the guideline-recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but availability of CBT-I therapists is limited. Somryst addresses this need by providing asynchronous access to CBT-I treatment. As a contactless therapeutic medium, Somryst is also an ideal option when face-to-face therapy is not available or recommended for safety reasons (e.g., because of possible exposure to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus). Areas covered: PDTs are the first class of software-based medical devices FDA-cleared and available via mobile applications. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and technical features of Somryst, and describes safety and effectiveness data from the randomized trials on which FDA clearance was based. Expert opinion: Somryst demonstrates robust clinical efficacy with a favorable benefit-to-risk profile for treating adults with chronic insomnia. FDA clearance was based on data from 2 clinical trials of the first-generation web-based CBT-I platform Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi).

We compared image quality of routine breathhold with intermittent apnea during controlled mechanical ventilation of patients under general anesthesia as the ideal situation without respiratory motion in the detection and characterization of regional lymph nodes in esophageal cancer. METHODS In this prospective study, 10 patients treated for esophageal cancer underwent ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) enhanced MRI scans. Before neoadjuvant therapy, MRI scans were acquired with a routine breathhold technique. After neoadjuvant therapy, patients were scanned under general anesthesia immediately prior to surgery with controlled mechanical ventilation. The image quality was compared using a Likert scale questionnaire based on visibility of anatomical structures and image artifacts. RESULTS MRI with controlled mechanical ventilation and prolonged controlled apnea of 4 min was safe and feasible. All cardio-respiratory monitoring parameters remained stable during the apnea phases. Mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes down to 2 mm in size could be visualized with all sequences. All image quality criteria, including visibility of thoracic structures and regional lymph nodes were scored higher using the controlled ventilation sequences compared to the routine breathhold phase. CONCLUSION USPIO-enhanced MRI with controlled mechanical ventilation is superior to routine breathhold MRI in visualizing lymph nodes, which warrants new motion reduction techniques to use MRI for the detection of lymph node metastases in patients with esophageal cancer.","de Gouw, D J J M; Maas, M C; Slagt, C; Mühling, J; Nakamoto, A; Klarenbeek, B R; Rosman, C; Hermans, J J; Scheenen, T W J",Magnetic resonance imaging,592,33

This resulted in a rapid and profound change of people's daily lives. Objective We assessed the psychological impact of the 40-day quarantine in a large cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and caregivers. Moreover, we analyzed whether prelockdown clinical features may be associated with subjective response of patients with PD to this traumatic event. Methods A total of 94 patients with PD were enrolled in the study. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and the 12-item Zarit Burden Inventory were obtained from patients and caregivers by email. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine whether prelockdown clinical motor and nonmotor features were associated with the psychological impact of lockdown. Results Regression analyses showed that prelockdown levels of anxiety, treatment-related motor complications, patients' quality of life, and lockdown hours per day were significantly associated with psychological impact measures of the 40-day quarantine. In addition, we showed that caregiver burden was correlated with overall patient autonomy and attention/memory impairment. Conclusions We identified specific PD motor and nonmotor features potentially predisposing to higher psychological impact of stressful situations, such as quarantine. This may help guide postpandemic interventions and preventive strategies to avoid further impairment of psychological well-being in patients with PD.","De Micco, Rosa; Siciliano, Mattia; Sant'Elia, Valeria; Giordano, Alfonso; Russo, Antonio; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Tessitore, Alessandro",Movement disorders clinical practice,592,24

To characterize the duck immune response to influenza, we sought to identify innate immune genes expressed early in an infection. We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) to construct 3 libraries enriched in differentially expressed genes from lung RNA of a duck infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), or lung and intestine RNA of a duck infected with low pathogenic avian influenza A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) compared to a mock-infected duck. Sequencing of 1687 clones identified a transcription profile enriched in genes involved in antiviral defense and other cellular processes. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), interferon induced protein with tricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5), and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like gene (OASL) were increased more than 1000-fold in relative transcript abundance in duck lung at 1dpi with highly pathogenic VN1203. These genes were induced much less in lung or intestine following infection with low pathogenic BC500. The expression of these genes following infection suggests that ducks initiate an immediate and robust response to a potentially lethal influenza strain, and a minimal response to a low pathogenic strain.","Vanderven, Hillary A; Petkau, Kristina; Ryan-Jean, Kieran E E; Aldridge, Jerry R; Webster, Robert G; Magor, Katharine E",Molecular immunology,592,1

This multicentre, randomised, controlled study included patients 18-44 years of age with low-risk term, singleton pregnancies. The randomisation was done weekly. Scheduled caesarean deliveries without labour were included. For comparison, the Additional treatment, Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, Separation of deep tissues, Isolation of bacteria, Stay in hospital > 14 days (ASEPSIS) score for wound healing assessment was modified. The absolute scores were obtained based on a one-day reading rather than the five-day reading used in ASEPSIS. Zero (""0"") was assigned as a complete healing. Higher scores were associated with more severe disruption of healing. The patients were enrolled between March 2015 and February 2017. The demographics were not statistically different. The wound scoring was similar in the groups at discharge and first-week evaluation. At the six weeks post-surgery, the wound scoring was significantly less in the 48-hour (3.9%) versus the 24-hour group (9%; p = .002). Dressing removal at 48 hours had a lower scoring in the low-risk population with scheduled caesarean deliveries.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Surgical dressings are used to provide suitable conditions to heal caesarean incisions. There has been a limited number of studies on the evaluation of ideal timing on wound dressing removal after a caesarean delivery. These studies concluded there are no increased wound complications with removal at six hours versus 24 hours or within or beyond 48 hours after surgery.What do the results of this study add? The postoperative removal of the wound dressing at 48 hours had a lower wound score at six weeks than the removal at 24 hours for women with uncomplicated scheduled caesarean deliveries.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Early discharge after caesarean delivery is becoming more common. Dressing removal at 24 hours versus 48 hours becomes more crucial and needs to be clarified.

The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. METHODS We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. RESULTS In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF). Injury to these areas (TPO: OR: 23.04; CI: 4.11 - 129.06; temporal stem: OR: 21.96; CI: 2.93 - 164.41) was associated with a higher-risk of persisting aphasia. CONCLUSIONS Tractography of language pathways can help to determine the individual aphasia risk profile pre-surgically. The TPO and temporal stem/peri-insular white matter were confirmed as functional nodes particularly sensitive to surgical injuries.","Tuncer, Mehmet Salih; Salvati, Luca Francesco; Grittner, Ulrike; Hardt, Juliane; Schilling, Ralph; Bährend, Ina; Silva, Luca Leandro; Fekonja, Lucius S; Faust, Katharina; Vajkoczy, Peter; Rosenstock, Tizian; Picht, Thomas",NeuroImage.

Methods: Data of clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary pathological results were retrospectively reviewed in a case of COVID-19 with rapid exacerbation from mild to critical condition. Results: This patient hospitalized at day 9 post 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection, experienced progressive deterioration from mild to severe at day 11, severe to critical at day 18 and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT) as well as heart lung transplantation during day 28-45 day post infection, and died on the second day post heart and lung transplantation. The patient had suffered from hypertension for 8 years. At the early stage of the disease, his symptoms were mild and the inflammatory indices increased and the lymphocyte count decreased continuously. The patient's condition exacerbated rapidly with multi-organ infections, and eventually developed pulmonary hemorrhage and consolidation, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, liver dysfunction, etc. His clinical manifestations could not be improved despite viral RNAs test results became negative. The patient underwent lung and heart transplantation and finally died of multi organ failure at the second day post lung and heart transplantation. Pathological examination indicated massive mucus, dark red secretions and blood clots in bronchus. The pathological changes were mainly diffused pulmonary hemorrhagic injuries and necrosis, fibrosis, small vessel disease with cardiac edema and lymphocyte infiltration. Conclusions: The clinical course of COVID-19 can exacerbate rapidly from mild to critical with lung, liver and heart injuries. Steadily increased inflammation indices are suggestive of irreversible disease progression and worse outcome. In the early stages of the disease, the progress of the disease should be closely observed and evaluated, and the factors related to the progress of the disease should be identified and managed.","Jiang, S W; Gao, H; Wu, L; Wang, G W; Cen, F L; Li, J X; Feng, C; Wen, J M; Chen, Y; He, R L; Qiao, K; Wang, Y; Liu, Y X; Wang, Z Q",Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,592,19

Using a within-subject study we aimed to investigate the effect of background distraction on cognitive performance. In the presence of silence, white noise, and sirens, fifty-five fluent English speakers completed three equivalent variations of a reading comprehension task. As predicted, there was a significant main effect of background sound, with poorer performance in the presence of distraction (particularly sirens), but no interaction was found between distraction and extraversion. Thus, the findings partially replicated previous research in terms of distraction but were inconsistent with regard to the Eysenckian theory of arousal differences between introverts and extraverts. Implications of the effect of sirens on those they are not designed to alert are considered. Limitations of this study are also considered. Practitioners Summary: This study was concerned with whether white noise and the sound of sirens effects reading comprehension. We found that compared to doing a highly involving and demanding cognitive task in silence, siren noise has a most significant negative effect on performance. Compared to working silence, white noise also reduced the efficiency on text comprehension. There were no introvert-extravert effects.","Gheewalla, F; McClelland, A; Furnham, A",Ergonomics,592,17

Viroporins vary greatly in terms of their atomic structure and can perform multiple functions during the virus life cycle, including those distinct from their role as oligomeric membrane channels. Recent progress has seen an explosion in both the identification and understanding of many such proteins encoded by highly significant pathogens, yet the prototypic M2 proton channel of influenza A virus remains the only example of a viroporin with provenance as an antiviral drug target. This review attempts to summarize our current understanding of the channel-forming functions for key members of this growing family, including recent progress in structural studies and drug discovery research, as well as novel insights into the life cycles of many viruses revealed by a requirement for viroporin activity. Ultimately, given the successes of drugs targeting ion channels in other areas of medicine, unlocking the therapeutic potential of viroporins represents a valuable goal for many of the most significant viral challenges to human and animal health.","Scott, Claire; Griffin, Stephen",The Journal of general virology,592,1

Between December 2017 and August 2020, 410 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (a single lesion that was ≤5 cm or ≤3 lesions that were ≤3 cm) underwent ablation at our institution. Propensity score matching identified 150 matched pairs of patients with well-balanced characteristics. The microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation groups had similar overall survival rates at 1 year (99.3% vs. 98.2%) and at 2 years (88.4% vs. 87.5%) (p = 0.728), as well as similar recurrence-free survival rates at 1 year (81.1% vs. 76.2%) and at 2 years (60.5% vs. 62.1%) (p = 0.492). However, the microwave ablation group had a significantly lower mean number of total insertions (1.22 ± 0.49 vs. 1.59 ± 0.94; p < 0.0001). This retrospective study revealed no significant differences in the overall survival and recurrence-free survival outcomes after microwave ablation or radiofrequency ablation. However, we recommend microwave ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma tumors with a diameter of >2 cm based on the lower number of insertions.","Kuroda, Hidekatsu; Nagasawa, Tomoaki; Fujiwara, Yudai; Sato, Hiroki; Abe, Tamami; Kooka, Yohei; Endo, Kei; Oikawa, Takayoshi; Sawara, Kei; Takikawa, Yasuhiro",Cancers,592,1

OBJECTIVE To find the clinical and hormonal effects of virtual reality training (VRT) and isokinetic training (IKT) in chronic LBP patients. METHODS Through the simple random sampling method, 60 university football players with chronic LBP were allocated into three groups: NVRT= 20, NIKT= 20 and NCONTROL= 20. The three groups underwent different exercises for 4 weeks. Clinical (pain intensity and kinesiophobia) and hormonal (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, growth hormone, prolactin, ACTH and cortisol) values were measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and 6 months. RESULTS Four weeks following training, the VRT and IKT groups showed significant changes in pain intensity and kinesiophobia in comparison to the control group (p< 0.05). Hormonal measures also showed significant improvement in the VRT group in comparison to the other two groups (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION Training through virtual reality and isokinetic exercise is an effective approach in terms of pain and kinesiophobia. In terms of hormonal analysis, virtual reality shows slightly more improvements than isokinetic training in subjects with chronic LBP.","Nambi, Gopal; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Alrawaili, Saud M; Abodonya, Ahmed M; Saleh, Ayman K",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,592,16

In this context, the present work aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of an ethanolic concentrated extract from Physalis angulata. The cytotoxicity of samples was determined using peritoneal macrophages though the Alamar Blue assay. The immunomodulatory activity of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata on activated macrophages was determined by measurement of nitrite and cytokine production. The immunosuppressive effects of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was evaluated on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. The effects of the extract on cell cycle progression and cell death on lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Lastly, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was tested in vivo in toxicological tests and in models of peritonitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The ethanolic extract from P. angulata decreased nitrite, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and TNF-α production by activated macrophages without affecting the cell viability. In addition, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata inhibited lymphoproliferation and the secretion of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and IFN-γ, and increased interleukin-4 secretion by activated splenocytes. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with the ethanolic extract from P. angulata induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, mice treated with the extract from P. angulata at 100 or 200 mg/kg did not show signs of toxicity or alterations in serum components. Finally, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata significantly reduced neutrophil migration and reduced paw edema in bovine serum albumin-induced the delayed-type hypersensitivity response model. Our results demonstrate the potential of the ethanolic extract of P. angulata as an alternative for the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases.","Daltro, Sérgio Ricardo Teixeira; Santos, Ivanilson Pimenta; Barros, Paula Ladeia; Moreira, Diogo Rodrigo Magalhães; Tomassini, Therezinha Coelho Barbosa; Ribeiro, Ivone Maria; Ribeiro Dos Santos, Ricardo; Meira, Cássio Santana; Soares, Milena Botelho Pereira",Planta medica,592,17

Here we describe the genetic polymorphism of Plasmodium vivax PMV (PvPMV) Thailand isolates, followed by cloning, expression, purification and characterization of PvPMV-Thai, presenting the pro- and mature-form of PvPMV-Thai. With our refolding and purification method, approximately 1mg of PvPMV-Thai was obtained from 1g of washed inclusion bodies. Unlike PvPMV-Ind and PvPMV-Sal-1, PvPMV-Thai contains a four-amino acid insertion (SVSE) at residues 246-249. We have confirmed that this insertion did not interfere with the catalytic activity as it is located in the long loop (R241-E272) pointing away from the substrate-binding pocket. PvPMV-Thai exhibited similar activity to PfPMV counterparts in which PfEMP2 could be hydrolyzed more efficiently than HRPII. Substrate specificity studies at P1' showed that replacing Ser by Val or Glu of the PfEMP2 peptide markedly reduced the enzyme activity of PvPMV similar to that of PfPMV whereas replacing His by Val or Ser of the HRPII peptide increased the cleavage activity. However, the substitution of amino acids at the P2 position with Glu dramatically reduced the cleavage efficiency by 80% in PvPMV in contrast to 30% in PfPMV, indicating subtle differences around the S2 binding pocket of both PfPMV and PvPMV. Four inhibitors were also evaluated for PvPMV-Thai activity including PMSF, pepstatin A, nelfinavir, and menisporopsin A-a macrocyclic polylactone. We are the first to show that menisporopsin A partially inhibits the PvPMV-Thai activity at high concentration. Taken together, these findings provide insights into recombinant production, substrate specificity and inhibition of PvPMV-Thai.","Sappakhaw, Khomkrit; Takasila, Ratchaneekorn; Sittikul, Pichamon; Wattana-Amorn, Pakorn; Assavalapsakul, Wanchai; Boonyalai, Nonlawat",Molecular and biochemical parasitology,592,16

A multimodal approach incorporating chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by extended surgery may improve resectability and outcomes for patients with advanced TETs. Surgical debulking is also reportedly acceptable for invasive thymoma because of its potential for achieving favorable outcomes. Re-resection is an acceptable option for patients with recurrent thymoma after initial resection, and repeat resection for recurrent pleural dissemination seems effective.

One of the exposure methods pf this disease is through occupational exposures and, thereby, a large number of people are prone to catching this disease due to their occupations. Nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic are at the forefront of healthcare. There is no information about the level of resilience and the demographic and job factors predicting resilience in the critical conditions of this occupational group. OBJECTIVE The present study aims to determine the resilience score and its predictive demographic factors among the nurses working at the hospitals involved with COVID-19 in Ahvaz, Iran. METHODS 387 nurses from Ahvaz hospitals participated in this study. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) was used to assess resilience. Demographic information was also collected using a designed questionnaire. Since the present study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the questionnaires were sent online. Data were entered into software SPSS (version 23) and T-test, ANOVA and regression methods were used for data analysis. RESULTS The mean score of 61.18 (±14.8) was obtained for CD-RISC. The results of this study showed that age (r = 0.610, P = 0.003), work experience (r = 0.572, P = 0.030), and level of education (r = 0.514, P = 0.044) had a significant positive correlation with nurses' resilience score during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple regression analysis indicated that work experience and level of education were the predictors of nurses' resilience (R2 = 0.15). CONCLUSION The score of nurses' resilience was low. Based on the results, education and work experience were determined as the contributing factors for resilience.

DESIGN Diagnostic test evaluation. SAMPLE 60 mL of pooled urine from 4 dogs, divided into six 10-mL aliquots. PROCEDURES Urine aliquots were spiked with bacteria from 1 of 6 independent Escherichia coli cultures to achieve a target bacterial concentration of 10(5) CFUs/mL. One milliliter from each aliquot was transferred into 5 silicone-coated clot tubes (SCTs) and 5 urine transport tubes (UTTs). Samples were stored at 4°C (39°F) and 25°C (77°F) for 0, 8, and 24 hours, and then standard QBCs were performed. RESULTS Median bacterial concentration for urine samples stored in a UTT for 24 hours at 4°C was lower than that for samples stored in an SCT under the same conditions. Conversely, a substantial decrease in median bacterial concentration was identified for samples stored for 24 hours in an SCT at 25°C, compared with the median concentration for samples stored in a UTT under the same conditions. Median bacterial concentration in samples stored in an SCT at 25°C for 24 hours (275 CFUs/mL) was less than the cutoff typically used to define clinically important bacteriuria by use of urine samples obtained via cystocentesis (ie, > 1,000 CFUs/mL).

Therefore, understanding dog ownership on a fine scale is critical. The main objectives of this study were to explore dog management in rural localities from central Chile focusing on modeling owner-related variables associated with dog confinement and characterize confined and FRDs populations. Interviews (170) were carried out in Paine municipality, reporting a human:dog ratio of 1.5:1, and dogs in most households (85.9%, 146/170). Thirty-seven percent (54/146) of those households did not confine their dog(s) to some degree, and 41% (196/472) of surveyed dogs were FRD. Based on multivariable logistic regression models, non-confinement was decreased by (i) negative opinion of owners toward roaming behavior of their dogs, (ii) negative opinion toward FRDs, among others. Dog confinement increased along with owners' concerns about the impacts of their dogs on others. Owned-FRDs tended to have poorer general care than confined dogs. Our findings represent a contribution to the understanding of the human dimensions behind FRDs and provide critical quantitative elements to consider when planning effective control strategies.","Astorga, Francisca; Poo-Muñoz, Daniela Alejandra; Organ, John; Medina-Vogel, Gonzalo",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,592,16

Research progress of oncology drug trials and approved cancer drugs in China in 2020 were systematically summarized and compared with 2019. Methods: Information Disclosure Platform for Drug Clinical Studies and China Food and Drug Administration Query System for Domestic and Imported Drug were searched for registered clinical trials and approved oncology drugs, respectively. The trial scope, stage, drug type, effect and mechanism of domestic and global pharmaceutical enterprises were compared between 2019 and 2020. Results: A total of 722 cancer drug trials registered in China in 2020, with an annual growth rate of 52.3%, accounting for 28.3% of all registered trials. Among them, 603 (83.5%) trials were initiated by domestic pharmaceutical enterprises, and 105 (14.5%) were international multicenter trials, phase I trials accounted for 44.5%. For all those trials, there were 458 cancer drug varieties, with an annual growth rate of 36.7%, and 361 (85.8%) were developed by domestic enterprises. Most of the investigational products were therapeutic innovative drugs (77.1%), major in tumor treatment (92.8%). In terms of mechanism, targeted drugs were the most popular, accounting for 76.6%, and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) were the most common targets. In addition, there were 19 anticancer drugs from 17 companies approved in China in 2019, with 10 drugs from domestic companies. Lung cancer and breast cancer are the most common indications for both registered trials and marketed drugs. No statistically significant differences were found between 2020 and 2019 in terms of the distribution of trial sponsor, scope and stage, as well as the distribution of drug type, effect and mechanism (P>0.05).

However, most studies of interventions have focused on veterans, representing a missed opportunity for intervention with active military personnel. Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, the aim of this systematic review was to analyse and synthesise the evidence related to workplace-based interventions for reducing alcohol use in active-duty military personnel. METHODS Four electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from database inception until 20 January 2020. This review focused on experimental and quasi-experimental studies of active-duty military personnel. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were independently performed by two reviewers using a standardised checklist. A third reviewer was used to arbitrate the disputed studies for final selection. RESULTS The search yielded seven studies from an initial 1582 records identified. A range of interventions were used in these studies (four randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised trials and one before and after cohort study), including web-based approaches, telephone-delivered interventions and individual and group-based face-to-face interventions. Seven studies found decreased drinking, measured using a range of outcomes, following the intervention. However, this was not sustained in the longer term in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS The low methodological rigour of most studies limited the capacity to demonstrate the efficacy of the interventions studied. Given the importance of reducing harmful or RSOD use of alcohol in the military, future studies would benefit from improved methodological rigour including ensuring adequate study power, randomisation, selection of validated outcome measures, including measures other than consumption (eg, attitudinal measures), and longer-term follow-up. There is also a need to develop methods that ensure participant loss to follow-up is minimised.","Watterson, Jason R; Gabbe, B; Rosenfeld, J V; Ball, H; Romero, L; Dietze, P",BMJ military health,592,1

In Malmö, Sweden, patients are followed up by general practitioners (GP), but in Linköping by gastroenterologists (GE). The aim of this study was to investigate if there were any differences in well-being and dietary adherence depending on type of follow-up. METHODS All adult patients with newly diagnosed biopsy-verified coeliac disease in the cities between 2010 and 2014 were offered to participate. Data was retrieved comprising demography, laboratory analyses, questionnaires (Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale, Short Health Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, Psychological General Well-being Index and Short Form 36) and follow-up. RESULTS In the GP cohort 39/73 patients and in the GE cohort 58/121 agreed to participate (mean age 43 and 44 years, 69 and 60% women, respectively). A follow-up to a dietician was carried out in 31% and 93% of patients, respectively (p < .001). In the GP group 28% had eaten gluten-containing food during the last 4 weeks compared to 9% in the GE group (p = .01). Despite this, no differences could be seen in vitamin or mineral levels. The questionnaires did not indicate any major discrepancies in subjective health. CONCLUSION Irrespective of the design of the follow-up physical and mental well-being were comparable. Dietary adherence was not quite as good in the GP group but follow-up in a primary care setting can still be a suitable and equivalent alternative. However, it is crucial that the dietary counselling is structured in a way that ensures dietary adherence.","Lexner, Jesper; Hjortswang, Henrik; Ekesbo, Rickard; Sjöberg, Klas",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,592,6

We are carrying out osseous fixation with securement of the suture anchor by a nonresorbable collagen patch. The objective of this study is to examine the follow-up data of 30 patients and to assess whether the clinical outcomes depended on the extent of the fatty degeneration of the gluteus medius. METHODS Thirty patients (28 female and 2 male) with a mean age of 76.8 ± 4.3 years (68-83 years) were followed for a mean of 46.8 ± 23.1 months (24-101 months). RESULTS Pain improved significantly from a preoperative visual analog scale score of 7.0 ± 1.52 (6-10) to 0.83 ± 0.77 (0-3) 24-month postoperative. The gluteus medius muscle force increased from 2.09 ± 0.81 to 3.3 ± 0.78 using the British Medical Research Council Scale. All patients exhibited a severe limp before the operation. Postoperatively, only 5 patients had a severe limp, while 14 exhibited a mild limp and 11 no limp at all. The modified Harris Hip Score increased from a preoperative value of 44.5 ± 4.2 (26-66) to a value of 81.1 ± 7.79 (60-100) 24-month postoperative.

Carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, the survey recruited participants by a chain sampling procedure. Its outcome was the worsening of self-rated health during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was based on a hierarchical model of determination. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle indicators and intensity of social restraint measures, and biological and psychological issues during the pandemic. From the total sample of 45,161 participants, 29.4% reported worsening of health state during this period. After adjusting for hierarchical distal factors, the health problems mostly associated with worsening health state were: bad self-rated health (adjusted OR = 4.35, p < 0.001), health care seeking for mental health problem (adjusted OR = 3.95, p < 0.001), and for COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 3.60, p < 0.001).

However, the global distribution, endemicity, and latitudinal gradients of species richness in mangrove crabs remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether species richness of mangrove crabs decreases towards the higher latitudes and tested the importance of environmental factors such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in creating the latitudinal gradients in species richness of mangrove crabs. A total of 8262 distribution records of 481 species belonging to six families of mangrove crabs including Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae were extracted from open-access databases or collected by the authors, quality controlled, cleaned, and analyzed. Species richness was plotted against 5° latitudinal bands in relation to environmental factors. The R software and ArcGIS 10.6.1 were used to analyze the species latitudinal range and richness as well as to map the distribution of mangrove forest, endemic species, species geographical distribution records, and biogeographic regions. The Indo-West Pacific showed the highest species richness of mangrove crabs where more than 65% of species were found in the Indian Ocean and along the western Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that there are 11 significantly different biogeographic regions of mangrove crabs. The highest endemicity rate was observed in the NW Pacific Ocean (29%). Latitudinal patterns of species richness in Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, and Sesarmidae showed an increasing trend from the poles toward the intermediate latitudes including one dip near the equator. However, latitudinal gradients in Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, and Oziidae were unimodal increasing from the higher latitudes towards the equator. Species richness per 5° latitudinal bands significantly increased following mean SST mean (°C), calcite, euphotic depth (m), and mangrove area (km2) across all latitudes, and tide average within each hemisphere. Species richness significantly decreased with dissolved O2 (ml l-1) and nitrate (μmol l-1) over all latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. The climax of global latitudinal species richness for some mangrove was observed along latitudes 20° N and 15°-25° S, not at the equator. This can suggest that temperature is probably the key driver of latitudinal gradients of mangrove crabs' species richness. Species richness and mangrove area were also highly correlated.","Sharifian, Sana; Kamrani, Ehsan; Saeedi, Hanieh",Journal of thermal biology,592,1

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are inherently somewhat hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of less than 86°. When they are arranged in a textured manner on substrates having different surface topographies, different wettabilities are exhibited. These range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and even superhydrophobic, and with isotropic to anisotropic contact angle (CA) hysteresis. If chemical modification is involved, the wettability can be adjusted from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic on a certain structured ACNTs. Here, we first examine the structural influence of isotropic roughness on this effect (including nano-structures and hierarchical structures), where isotropic wetting (including wetting and anti-wetting) is observed. Water can wet the nano-structured CNT alignment, resulting in self-assembly; on the other hand, superhydrophobicity is durable on hierarchical and chemically-modified nano-structured alignments. Secondly, the effects of anisotropic roughness on wetting behavior are discussed. Finally, we suggest the remaining challenges in the field, and several practical applications of ACNT possessing special wettability.","Liu, Huan; Zhai, Jin; Jiang, Lei",Soft matter,592,8

The correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model has proven useful in constructing explanatory models of psychopathology. The bifactor S - 1 model is also useful for examining the latent structure of psychopathology, especially in contexts with clear theoretical predictions. Joint use of correlated first-order syndrome-specific model and bifactor S - 1 model provides leverage for explaining psychopathology, and both models can also guide individual clinical assessment. In this reply, we further clarify reasons why the symmetrical bifactor model should not be used to study the latent structure of psychopathology and also discuss a restricted bifactor S - 1 model that is equivalent to the first-order syndrome-specific factors model.","Burns, G Leonard; Geiser, Christian; Servera, Mateu; Becker, Stephen P; Beauchaine, Theodore P",Journal of abnormal child psychology,592,1

METHODS Participants were 670 young adult cohort members (ages 21-29) of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010-2018 who participated in the C-EAT study (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time). RESULTS Among the sample, 84% (n = 561) reported pandemic-related changes to their mood or stress and 33% (n = 221) reported changes to their substance use. Linear regression analyses identified several meaningful risk factors for higher psychological distress during the pandemic, including female gender, White race, higher pre-pandemic depressive symptoms and perceived stress, and lower pre-pandemic stress management ability. A thematic analysis further identified five major themes related to changes in stress and mood following the COVID-19 outbreak describing specific emotional reactions, stress related to the direct impact of the pandemic as well as interpersonal connectedness and economic factors, and strategies for managing stress. In addition, two major themes were identified related to substance use during the pandemic detailing specific changes in and motivations for substance use.

Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Amro, M; Mohamed, A; Alawna, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,592,13

Here, we investigated if canagliflozin can reverse isoprenaline (ISO)-induced renal oxidative damage in rats, a model that mimics SNS overstimulation-induced organ injuries in humans. We found that ISO administration elevates renal oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced protein oxidation product (APOP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO), while depleting levels of endogenous antioxidants such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Strikingly, canagliflozin treatment of ISO-treated rats not only prevents elevation of oxidative stress markers but also rescues levels of depleted antioxidants. Our results also show that canagliflozin stimulates antioxidant/anti-inflammatory signaling pathways involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt and eNOS, and inhibits iNOS and NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (NOX4), all of which are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, canagliflozin prevents ISO-induced apoptosis of kidney cells by inhibiting Bax protein upregulation and caspase-3 activation. Histological examination of kidney sections reveal that canagliflozin attenuates ISO-mediated increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and fibrosis. Finally, consistent with these findings, canagliflozin treatment improves kidney function in ISO-treated rats, suggesting that the antioxidant effects may be clinically translatable.","Hasan, Raquibul; Lasker, Shoumen; Hasan, Ahasanul; Zerin, Farzana; Zamila, Mushfera; Parvez, Faisal; Rahman, Md Mizanur; Khan, Ferdous; Subhan, Nusrat; Alam, Md Ashraful",Scientific reports,592,27

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare sedative use between patients with COVID-19 ARDS and non-COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 ARDS compared with historical controls of non-COVID-19 ARDS who were admitted to 2 hospitals from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, and April 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019, respectively. The primary outcome was median cumulative dose of propofol (µg/kg) at 24 hours after intubation. RESULTS There were 92 patients with COVID-19 ARDS and 37 patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS included. Within the first 24 hours of intubation, patients with COVID-19 ARDS required higher total median doses of propofol: 51 045 µg/kg (interquartile range, 26 150-62 365 µg/kg) versus 33 350 µg/kg (9632-51 455 µg/kg; P = 0.004).

Unfortunately, considering the intensification of multiple electron-vibration interactions as temperature increases, luminescence thermal quenching of lanthanide-doped materials is generally considered to be inevitable. Recently, the emergence of thermally enhanced upconversion luminescence in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles seemed to challenge this stereotype, and the research on this topic rapidly aroused wide attention. While considerable efforts have been made to explore the origin of this phenomenon, the key mechanism of luminescence enhancement is still under debate. Here, to sort out the context of this intriguing finding, the reported results on this exciting topic are reviewed, and the corresponding enhancement mechanisms as proposed by different researchers are summarized. Detailed analyses are provided to evaluate the contribution of the most believed ""surface-attached moisture desorption"" process on the overall luminescence enhancement of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles at elevated temperatures. The impacts of other surface-related processes and shell passivation on the luminescence behaviour of the lanthanide-doped materials are also elaborated. Lack of standardization in the reported data and the absence of important experimental information, which greatly hinders the cross-checking and reanalysis of the results, is emphasized as well. On the foundation of these discussions, it is realized that the thermal-induced luminescence enhancement is a form of recovery process against the strong luminescence quenching in the system, and the enhancement degree is closely associated with the extent of luminescence loss induced by various quenching effects beforehand.","Shi, Rui; Martinez, Eduardo D; Brites, Carlos D S; Carlos, Luís D",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,592,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study examined 75 patients admitted, from March to April 2020, at the Poliambulanza Foundation with CoViD-19. In 53 out of 75 patients, chest X-rays were positive for infiltration and/or pleural effusion. Two weeks after discharge, two rhinopharyngeal swabs were performed with negative results for CoViD-19. Enlisted patients responded to a questionnaire, upon informed consent, called the Questionnaire for Olfactory Dysfunction (QOD) which evaluates the severity of the disorder and social impact. In the second phase of the study we carefully researched the recovery times of olfactory dysfunction and dysgeusia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The analysis of the scores of the Olfactory Dysfunction Questionnaire CoViD-19 (QOD) recorded the total recovery in all patients of olfactory and gustatory function with an average time of 17.4 days. This study reveals that Coronavirus does not cause a permanent olfactory and gustatory loss.

Sequence analysis of the spike protein (S) genes showed that each specimen had unique characteristics, and that the PEDV1/S/4 strain could be differentiated from the others via a unique mutation of the S gene. The phylogeny of S glycoprotein showed that all strains were clustered into two major groups. The four Gansu PEDV field strains were characterized into different groups; this finding was consistent with the results of the protein characterization prediction. This analysis additionally revealed the unique characteristics of each specimen. The results of this study could be used to elucidate the prevalence of PEDV and contribute to the prevention of PEDV in Gansu.","Huang, M Z; Wang, H; Wang, S Y; Cui, D A; Tuo, X; Liu, Y M",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,592,1

In two cases the autonomy for oral/enteric feeding was obtained within 3 and 7 months after surgery with sustained growth, persisting at 5 years of follow-up after STEP. One child remained dependent of parenteral nutrition and was submitted to intestinal transplantation 30 months after STEP. However, since STEP until transplantation, it was possible to increase enteric volume and decrease intestinal dilation and the frequency of occlusive episodes. STEP is an effective and safe technique for intestinal lengthening that may allow increased tolerance to oral/enteric feeding or at least alleviate some complications of short bowel syndrome.","Lourenço, Lara; Campos, Miguel; Monteiro, Joaquim; Trindade, Eunice; Dias, Jorge Amil; Guerra, António; Guerra, Paula; Correia-Pinto, Jorge; Estevão-Costa, José",European journal of pediatrics,592,14

The transfer of these patients is associated with risks and has been experienced as highly challenging, which needs to be further explored. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To describe critical care nurses' experiences of caring for critically ill patients with artificial airways during interhospital transfers. DESIGN A cross-sectional study using a qualitative approach was conducted during spring 2020. Participants were critical care nurses (n = 7) from different hospitals (n = 2). METHODS The data were collected through semi-structured interviews based on an interview guide. A qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach was performed. RESULTS The analysis resulted in one main theme, ""Preserving the safety in an unknown environment,"" and three sub-themes, ""Being adequately prepared is essential to feel secure,"" ""Feeling abandoned and overwhelmingly responsible,"" and ""Being challenged in an unfamiliar and risky environment."" CONCLUSIONS Critical care nurses experienced interhospital transfers of critically ill patients with artificial airways as complex and risky. It is essential to have an overall plan in order to prevent any unpredictable and acute events. Adequate communication and good teamwork are key to the safe transfer of a critically ill patient in that potential complications and dangers to the patient can be prevented. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Standardized checklists need to be created to guide the transfers of critically ill patients with different conditions. This would prevent failures based on human or system factors, such as lack of experience and lack of good teamwork.","Dabija, Marius; Aine, Matilda; Forsberg, Angelica",Nursing in critical care,592,12

We therefore used a MR-visible three-dimensional intra-peritoneal stoma (IPST) mesh in a porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic terminal sigmoid colostomy has been done with implantation of a prophylactic MRI-visible IPST mesh in two animals. MRI investigations were done after 1 week, 6 months and in case of clinical impairment. These findings were compared to endoscopy and makroscopical and histological investigation of the preparation. RESULTS The first animal has to be killed because of an ileus 4 weeks after operation. The second animal has to be killed after 7 weeks because of recurrent obstipation. In all cases MRI investigation could identify the IPST mesh and could clearly separate between mesh and intestine. MRI revealed a big bowl ileus due to a funnel dislocation in the first animal. In the second animal, MR diagnostic explored a functional stenosis because of a too small diameter of the central funnel in combination with sticky feces and distension of the terminal sigmoid before discharging into the funnel. Endoscopy, makroscopical and histological investigation of the preparation supported MRI findings. CONCLUSION Although complicate clinical course was a diagnostic challenge exploring 3D implants such as IPST, visualization of this new MRI-visible IPST mesh could be proved and turned out as an effective diagnostic possibility. Further studies are necessary to analyze long-time effects such as shrinkage, mesh migration and tissue integration using MRI scanning.","Otto, J; Busch, D; Klink, C; Ciritsis, A; Woitok, A; Kuhl, C; Klinge, U; Neumann, U P; Kraemer, N A; Conze, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,592,16

Preventing recurrence of aneurysms requires dense coiling, which may aggravate the mass effect. However, the flow diverter (FD) is a new device that avoids the need for dense coiling. This study was performed to investigate whether use of FDs with adjunctive coil embolization can relieve the aneurysmal mass effect and to explore the factors that affect the variation of compressional symptoms. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patients with compressional symptoms caused by unruptured aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment with an FD with adjunctive coil embolization at our center from January 2015 to December 2017. Imaging follow-up included digital subtraction angiography (DSA) ranging from 11 to 14 months and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ranging from 24 to 30 months; the former was used to evaluate the intracavitary volume, and the latter was used to measure the variation of the mass effect. Follow-up physical examinations were performed to observe variations of symptoms. Results: In total, 22 patients with 22 aneurysms were treated by an FD combined with coil embolization. All 22 patients underwent the last clinical follow-up. Regarding compressional symptoms, 12 (54.54%) patients showed improvement, 6 (27.27%) were fully recovered, and 6 (27.27%) showed improvement but with incomplete cranial palsy. However, five (22.72%) patients showed no change, four (18.18%) showed worsening symptoms compared with their preoperative state, and one (4.55%) died of delayed rupture. Seventeen of the 22 patients underwent MRI. Of these 17 patients, the aneurysm shrank in 13 (76.47%) and no significant change occurred in 4 (23.53%). In the multivariate analysis, a short duration from symptom occurrence to treatment (p = 0.03) and younger patient age (p = 0.038) were statistically significant factors benefiting symptom improvement, and shrinkage of the aneurysm was associated with favorable clinical outcomes (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Use of the FD with adjunctive loose coil embolization might help to alleviate the compressional symptoms caused by intracranial aneurysms. Shrinkage of the aneurysm, a short duration of symptoms, and younger patient age might contribute to favorable outcomes of mass effect-related symptoms.","Wang, Zhongxiao; Tian, Zhongbin; Li, Wenqiang; Wang, Jiejun; Zhu, Wei; Zhang, Mingqi; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Jian; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Yisen; Yang, Xinjian",Frontiers in neurology,592,17

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galluzzi, Francesca; Rossi, Veronica; Bosetti, Cristina; Garavello, Werner",Neuroepidemiology,592,20

Activation of mTORC1 by amino acids and growth factors involves recruitment of the complex to the lysosomal membrane and is further supported by lysosome distribution to the cell periphery. Here, we show that translocation of lysosomes toward the cell periphery brings mTORC1 into proximity with focal adhesions (FAs). We demonstrate that FAs constitute discrete plasma membrane hubs mediating growth factor signaling and amino acid input into the cell. FAs, as well as the translocation of lysosome-bound mTORC1 to their vicinity, contribute to both peripheral and intracellular mTORC1 activity. Conversely, lysosomal distribution to the cell periphery is dispensable for the activation of mTORC1 constitutively targeted to FAs. This study advances our understanding of spatial mTORC1 regulation by demonstrating that the localization of mTORC1 to FAs is both necessary and sufficient for its activation by growth-promoting stimuli.","Rabanal-Ruiz, Yoana; Byron, Adam; Wirth, Alexander; Madsen, Ralitsa; Sedlackova, Lucia; Hewitt, Graeme; Nelson, Glyn; Stingele, Julian; Wills, Jimi C; Zhang, Tong; Zeug, André; Fässler, Reinhard; Vanhaesebroeck, Bart; Maddocks, Oliver D K; Ponimaskin, Evgeni; Carroll, Bernadette; Korolchuk, Viktor I",The Journal of cell biology,592,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty patients who underwent unilateral TKA were randomly assigned into two groups: MRJB and NCD groups. Pre- and post-operative hematocrit levels, amount of drained blood and transfused blood were measured and calculated into IBL. Pain score, amount of morphine usage, range of motion (ROM) at discharge, blood transfusion rate, and complications were also recorded and compared between both groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the mean IBL between MRJB (221.2 ± 233.3 ml) and NCD groups (158.5 ± 186.7 ml) (p = 0.219). Post-operative pain score at rest and during ambulation, amount of morphine usage, ROM at discharge, blood transfusion rate, and complications were also similar between two groups. CONCLUSIONS This study cannot determine the benefit of MRJB over NCD.

We summarized the latest advances in bioinformatics analysis of sequencing data from T and B cell repertoires and also presented contemporary ideas about the mechanisms of clonal diversity formation at different stages of organism development. At the same time, we focused on the importance of the allelic variants of the HLA genes and spectra of presented antigens for the formation of T-cell receptors (TCR) landscapes. The main idea of this review is that immune equilibrium and proper functioning of immunity are highly dependent on the interaction between the recognition and the presentation landscapes of antigens. Certain changes in these landscapes can occur during life, which can affect the protective function of adaptive immunity. We described some mechanisms associated with these changes, for example, the conversion of effector cells into regulatory cells and vice versa due to the trans-differentiation or bystander effect, changes in the clonal organization of the general TCR repertoire due to homeostatic proliferation or aging, and the background for the altered presentation of some antigens due to SNP mutations of MHC, or the alteration of the presenting antigens due to post-translational modifications. The authors suggest that such alterations can lead to an increase in the risk of the development of oncological and autoimmune diseases and influence the sensitivity of the organism to different infectious agents.","Shevyrev, Daniil; Tereshchenko, Valeriy; Kozlov, Vladimir",Frontiers in immunology,592,13

The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. METHODS In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H-dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P = 0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

METHODS A total of 100 small target vessels of the lower limbs with a maximum diameter of 3 mm were prospectively randomized to catheterize with either the preshaped torqueable Direxion™ (J tip shape; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) or a similarly steam-shaped Renegade™ microcatheter (Boston Scientific) in a porcine model. Catheterization was first performed in combination with a microguidewire and afterwards without. RESULTS No significant differences were found for the mean vessel diameter in the Direxion (1.53 ± 0.44 mm; n = 50) or Renegade (1.62 ± 0.43 mm; n = 50; p = 0.35) group. Guidewire-assisted catheterization was successful in all target vessels, whereas access was achieved in most cases with the guidewire alone. However, when it became necessary to steer the Direxion actively, this was regarded as key to obtain vessel access in three of four target vessels (75 %). Vessel catheterization without guidewire was significantly more successful with the Direxion (88 %; n = 44) compared with the Renegade (32 %; n = 16; p < 0.0001). In addition, this catheterization technique was also significantly faster with the Direxion compared with guidewire-assisted vessel catheterization with the Renegade (16.1 ± 14.4 sec compared with 27.1 ± 24.7 sec; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS The Direxion microcatheter demonstrated unique steerability characteristics, which makes it a promising new tool especially for complex coaxial endovascular procedures.","Dudeck, Oliver",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,592,16

The formulation stimulates various leukocytes, including T, B, and NK cells and macrophages. Although Juzen-taiho-to is known to contain numerous compounds with various pharmacological activities, it is not clear which compounds are responsible for the stimulation of individual cell types. Here, we conducted what we call ""biomarker-guided screening"" to purify compounds responsible for the macrophages stimulatory activity. To this end, gene expression was analyzed by a DNA array for macrophages treated with Juzen-taiho-to and DMSO (vehicle control), which identified intercellular adhesion molecule 1 as a biomarker of macrophage stimulation by Juzen-taiho-to. A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was then used to guide the purification of active compounds. The screening resulted in the purification of a glycolipid mixture, containing β-glucosylceramides. The glycolipid mixture potently stimulated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression in primary dendritic cells as well as in primary CD14+ (macrophages) cells. The identification of this glycolipid mixture opens up an opportunity for further studies to understand how plant-derived glycolipids stimulate macrophages and dendritic cells in a safe and effective manner as demonstrated by Juzen-taiho-to.","Takaoka, Anna; Iacovidou, Maria; Hasson, Tal H; Montenegro, Diego; Li, Xiangming; Tsuji, Moriya; Kawamura, Akira",Planta medica,592,16

Areas covered: Using papers published in PubMed, a case is presented to consider beneficial microbes as a means to improve management of infectious diseases. Clinical evidence is mounting that certain probiotic microbes can contribute to this armamentarium. These could have an immediate effect against necrotizing enterocolitis, pre- and post-surgical procedures, antibiotic-associated infections, urogenital infections in women and for reducing the severity and duration of respiratory infections. While further studies will always be warranted irrespective of the intervention, and quality assurance and patient safety must remain a priority, the main barrier to implementation may well be unwarranted hesitation amongst physicians, healthcare administrators and regulators. Meanwhile, patients are already taking things into their own hands at a time when their knowledge of product selection is poor and clinical guidance is invariably missing.

Although such stabilizers facilitate the anastomosis procedure by immobilizing the heart and holding the surgery site steady, they can cause damage to the heart tissue and rupture of the capillary vessels, due to applying relatively large pressures on the epicardium. In this paper, we propose an advanced robotic approach to perform TECAB on a beating heart with minimal invasiveness. The idea comes from the fact that the main pulsations of the heart occur as excursions in normal direction, i.e., perpendicular to the heart surface. We devise a 1-DOF flexible heart stabilizer which eliminates the lateral movements of the heart, and a 1-DOF compensator mechanism which follows the heart trajectory in the normal direction, thus canceling the relative motion between the surgical tool and the heart surface. In fact, we bring a compromise between two radical approaches of operating on a completely immobilized beating heart with no heart motion compensation, and operating on a freely beating heart with full compensation of heart motion, considering the invasiveness of the first and the technical challenges of the second approach. We propose operating on a partially stabilized beating heart with unidirectional compensation of the heart motion; the flexible stabilizer would exert much less holding force to the heart tissue and the robotic system with unidirectional compensator would be technically feasible. In the proposed approach, a motion sensor mounted on the stabilizer measures the heart excursion data and sends it into a control unit. A predictive controller uses this data to generate an automated trajectory. The slave robots follow this trajectory, which is superimposed on the surgeon's tele-operation commands received from a master console. Finally, the tool-activation units in the slave robots actuate the articulated laparoscopic tools to perform the anastomosis procedure. The evaluation of the hypothesis showed that our solution for the robotic TECAB on beating heart is both practical and cost effective. We showed in an in-vivo study that the flexible stabilizer can effectively restrict the heart lateral movements, while allowing for its normal excursion. We found readily available linear motors which could afford the high forces, speeds and accelerations required for following the heart trajectory. Finally, we showed that the tool-activation unit is capable of providing the maneuverability and workspace required for the most challenging task of CABG procedure, i.e., anastomosis suturing.","Alamdar, Alireza; Hanife, Shahrzad; Farahmand, Farzam; Behzadipour, Saeed; Mirbagheri, Alireza",Medical hypotheses,592,28

They can occur sporadically or as part of familial syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Isolated colonic neurofibroma without systemic manifestations is a rarely reported clinical entity. Here we present a case of a 51 years old male with an isolated colonic neurofibroma seen on a screening colonoscopy. CASE SUMMARY Fifty-one years old male who was otherwise healthy without a significant family history of cancer underwent a screening colonoscopy and was found have a 2.3 cm × 1.4 cm lesion in the colon. Tissue biopsy revealed a spindle cell tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis was negative for adenopathy. He underwent an endoscopic ultrasound that showed an ill-defined avascular lesion of mixed echogenicity measuring 2.8 cm × 15.2 cm in the submucosa with no communication with muscularis mucosa or propria. Immunohistochemistry staining of the tumor was strongly positive for S100, with rare penetrating axons deep within the tumor. Tumor cells were negative for c-kit and desmin and had low Ki-67 index. These findings were consistent with a solitary colonic submucosal neurofibroma. A detailed history and physical examination did not reveal any evidence of extraintestinal neurofibromatosis. He underwent transanal surgical resection of the tumor. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications. CONCLUSION While neurofibromas have been well described in literature, an isolated colonic neurofibroma is a rare pathological entity. Malignant transformation of neurofibromas has been reported in patients with neurofibromatosis syndromes. We report a case of isolated colonic neurofibroma and highlight the importance of resection due to the increased risk of tumorigenesis.","Ghoneim, Sara; Sandhu, Sonia; Sandhu, Dalbir",World journal of clinical cases,592,31

We describe a major reorganisation of service at a regional referral centre (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust) to manage the crisis. Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) was implemented for triage to make optimum use of limited diagnostic resources. Consultations were switched from face-to-face to telephone. We aimed to evaluate the impact FIT had on resource allocation and patient diagnoses in the first three months of use. METHOD All colorectal two-week wait patient referrals were posted a pack requesting FIT and notification of telephone consultation. A pre-paid envelope was included for return of samples. At consultation, FIT was incorporated with the presenting symptoms to guide investigation choice and triage urgency. FIT ≥10 μg/g was interpreted as positive. Outcome data was collected prospectively and compared with retrospective audit data from pre-pandemic levels across three months. RESULTS From 26th March 2020 to 2nd July there were 381 referrals who were invited to provide FIT samples and underwent telephone consultations. 358 FIT samples were returned (94%). Onward referral for colonoscopy reduced from 62% to 34% (p<0.001). There were fourteen colorectal cancers (3.7%) diagnosed, which was not statistically different to the pre-pandemic level of 3.9% (p=0.995).

The present study aimed to analyze the long-term results of prophylactic mesh used for preventing incisional hernia after emergency midline laparotomies. METHODS This study was a registered (NCT04578561) retrospective analysis of patients who underwent an emergency midline laparotomy between January 2009 and July 2010 with a follow-up period of longer than 2 years. Long-term outcomes and risk factors for the development of incisional hernias between patients who received a prophylactic reinforcement mesh (Group M) and suture (Group S) were compared. RESULTS From an initial 266 emergency midline laparotomies, 187 patients were included. The median follow-up time was 64.4 months (SD 35). Both groups had similar characteristics, except for a higher rate of previous operations (62 vs. 43.2%; P = 0.01) and operation due to a revision laparotomy (32.5 vs.13%; P = 0.02) in the M group. During follow-up, 29.9% of patients developed an incisional hernia (Group S 36.6% vs. Group M 14.3%; P = 0.002). Chronic mesh infections were diagnosed in 2 patients, but no mesh explants were needed, and no patient in the M group developed chronic pain. Long-term risk factors for incisional hernia were as follows: smoking (HR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.318-4.624; P = 0.05), contaminated surgery (HR = 2.98; 95% CI 1.142-7.8; P = 0.02), surgical site infection (SSI; HR = 3.83; 95% CI 1.86-7.86; P = 0.001), and no use of prophylactic mesh (HR = 5.09; 95% CI 2.1-12.2; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION Incidence of incisional hernias after emergency midline laparotomies is high and increases with time. High-risk patients, contaminated surgery, and surgical site infection (SSI) benefit from mesh reinforcement.

Engaging patients through tools that collect and summarize such data may improve communication and patient activation. However, differential tool adoption by race might widen health care disparities. OBJECTIVE Determine if a digital tool designed to collect and present PCD improves communication and patient activation; secondarily, evaluate if use impacts outcomes by race. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pragmatic, two-armed, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted during 2019 in a primary care setting. INTERVENTION The PCD tool (PatientWisdom) invited patients to identify preferences, values, goals, and barriers to care. Patients were randomized to a standard pre-visit email or facilitated enrollment with dedicated outreach to encourage use of the tool. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes of interest were post-visit patient communication and patient activation measured by the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM), respectively. Outcomes were evaluated using treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) principles. KEY RESULTS A total of 301 patients were enrolled. Facilitated enrollment resulted in a five-fold increase in uptake of the PCD tool. TOT analysis indicated that the PCD tool was associated with notable increases in specific CAT items rated as excellent: ""treated me with respect"" (+ 13 percentage points; p = 0.04), ""showed interest in my ideas"" (+ 14 percentage points; p = 0.03), ""showed care and concern"" (+ 16 percentage points; p = 0.02), and ""spent about the right amount of time with me"" (+ 11 percentage points; p = 0.05). There were no significant pre/post-visit differences in PAM scores between arms (- 4.41 percentage points; p = 0.58). ITT results were similar. We saw no evidence of the treatment effect varying by race in ITT or TOT analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The inclusion of PCD enhanced essential aspects of patient-provider communication but did not affect patient activation. Outcomes did not differ by race.

A variety of surgical factors contribute to Virchow's triad of venous stasis, vascular injury, and hypercoagulability, including intraoperative venous distension and microvascular endothelial damage. Patients also may have individual risk factors such as a history of thromboembolism, cancer, advanced age, or a genetic trait linked to hypercoagulation. This article discusses recent trends in the development and validation of venous thromboembolism risk scores, including the results of a large validation study. DATA SOURCES A Medline literature search was performed to identify original studies. CONCLUSIONS Venous thromboembolism risk scores have been developed for groups of patients based on a few broad risk categories, but a more accurate, individualized risk score can be obtained using a recently validated risk scoring system, which can be used to determine the type and length of prophylaxis to administer. Further studies are under way to refine this system.","Caprini, Joseph A",American journal of surgery,592,1

We performed computer-aided design flow analysis of pediatric rigid bronchoscopes to gain insight into flow dynamics. STUDY DESIGN We made accurate three-dimensional computer models of pediatric rigid bronchoscopes and endotracheal tubes. SOLIDWORKS (Dassault Systemes, Vélizy-Villacoublay, France) flow analysis software was used to analyze fluid dynamics during pressure-controlled and volume-controlled ventilation. METHODS Flow analysis was performed on rigid bronchoscopes and similar outer diameter endotracheal tubes comparing resistance, flow, and turbulence during two ventilation modalities and in common surgical scenarios. RESULTS Increased turbulent flow was observed in bronchoscopes compared to more laminar flow in endotracheal tubes of similar outer diameter. Flow analysis displayed higher resistances in all pediatric bronchoscope sizes except one (3.0 bronchoscope) compared to similar-sized endotracheal tubes. Loss of adequate ventilation was observed if the bronchoscope was not assembled correctly or if increased peak inspiratory pressures were needed. Anesthesia flow to the patient was reduced by 63% during telescope insertion. CONCLUSIONS Flow analysis illustrates increased turbulent flow and increased airflow resistance in all but one size of pediatric bronchoscopes compared to endotracheal tubes. This increased turbulence and resistance, along with the unanticipated gas distal exit pattern, may contribute to the documented hypercarbia and hypoxemia during procedures. These findings may explain why hypoxemia and hypercarbia are commonly observed during rigid bronchoscopy, especially when positive pressure ventilation is needed.

We aimed to directly compare clinical outcomes and cost utility among the three ERCP modalities. METHODS Patients with RYGB anatomy who had DAE, LA-ERCP, or GATE from 2009 to 2019 at 2 tertiary centers were included in our review. We measured outcomes in three areas: success rate, post-procedural adverse events (AEs) and hospitalization, and cost utility per Medicare/Medicaid insurance payments. RESULTS Cohort Total 130 patients (70 underwent DAE, 42 LA-ERCP, and 18 GATE). Success rate DAE was successful in 59% of patients, compared to success rates of 98 and 100% for LA-ERCP and GATE, respectively (p < 0.001). For DAE, 62% of unsuccessful cases required rescue therapy. Adverse events and hospitalization Patients who underwent GATE had the lowest rate of hospitalization post procedure (44% vs. 77% and 100% for DAE and LA-ERCP, respectively, p < 0.01) and spent the least amount of time hospitalized (median time 0 days vs 2 and 3 days for DAE and LA-ERCP, respectively, p < 0.0001). GATE had lower AE rates than LA-ERCP (6 vs 31%, p = 0.046), and both had similar rates to DAE. Cost utility LA-ERCP carried the highest total procedural and hospitalization cost per Medicare/ Medicaid insurance payments (median payment difference of $9.7 K vs GATE and $7.9 K vs DAE, p < 0.01 for both). Procedural and hospitalization costs were similar between GATE and DAE (p = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS GATE is a safe modality for ERCP with high success rates in RYGB patients and exhibits the lowest hospitalization time and rate of adverse events when compared to DAE and LA-ERCP. GATE is similar to DAE from a cost utility approach, and both are less costly than LA-ERCP.","Wang, Thomas J; Cortes, Pedro; Jirapinyo, Pichamol; Thompson, Christopher C; Ryou, Marvin",Surgical endoscopy,592,10

RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies expand understanding of the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy globally and highlight associated individual and contextual factors. Common concerns underlying hesitancy include uncertainty about the need for vaccination and questions about vaccine safety and efficacy. Sociodemographic factors associated with parental vaccine hesitancy vary across locations and contexts. Studies about psychology of hesitancy and how parents respond to interventions highlight the role of cognitive biases, personal values, and vaccination as a social contract or norm. Evidence-based strategies to address vaccine hesitancy include presumptive or announcement approaches to vaccine recommendations, motivational interviewing, and use of immunization delivery strategies like standing orders and reminder/recall programs. A smaller number of studies support use of social media and digital applications to improve vaccination intent. Strengthening school vaccine mandates can improve vaccination rates, but policy decisions must consider local context. SUMMARY Vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge for child health. Future work must include more interventional studies to address hesitancy and regular global surveillance of parental vaccine hesitancy and vaccine content on social media.","Cataldi, Jessica R; O'Leary, Sean T",Current opinion in infectious diseases,592,1

Under CVI, during periods where the medical system is under capacity, volunteers from low-risk groups would be intentionally infected after giving informed consent, and then quarantined until they have developed immunity. Proponents claim that this could have benefits for society, such as building herd immunity and ensuring that critical workers won't be incapacitated during the peak of the infection. They also claim that this could have benefits for individuals, such as being safely exempted from lockdown measures and (for individuals who are likely to be infected anyway) ensuring that the infection happens under relatively less dangerous conditions. Some respond that CVI would unethical. Here, I argue that, while CVI may or may not be ill-advised for empirical reasons, there are no in-principle ethical objections to it (i.e., if CVI would work as well as its proponents think, it would be ethical to implement it). I present three arguments for this conclusion. The first is an argument from informed consent: informed consent to relevantly similar medical procedures renders performing these procedures permissible, so informed consent to CVI would render it permissible. The second is an argument from reasonable beneficence: it draws on recent work by Caspar Hare on relevantly similar choices to argue that CVI is permissible. The third is an argument from precedent: smallpox variolation was permissible, and CVI is relevantly similar to that, so CVI is permissible.","Crummett, Dustin",Bioethics,592,31

To date, there is no pharmaceutical intervention to delay or treat cognitive decline or dementia. As an estimated one-third of dementia cases might be attributable to modifiable lifestyle factors (such as cognitive and physical activity), multidomain lifestyle interventions are a promising way to maintain or improve brain health. Offering programs online would enable large-scale implementation. An overview of multidomain Web-based lifestyle programs for brain health would facilitate comparison and improvement of such programs to develop effective and sustainable interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of Web-based multidomain lifestyle programs aimed at optimizing brain health in healthy adult populations and (2) describe the programs and targeted lifestyle factors, availability, and evaluation of adherence and user experience. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. METHODS Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched for Web-based lifestyle programs that were included when the program (1) aimed to optimize brain health, (2) focused on multiple lifestyle factors, (3) was completely Web-based (website, Web application or mobile app), (4) consisted of multiple sessions, and (5) focused on a healthy adult population. Program characteristics (target population, duration, frequency, tailoring, platform, and availability) and results of program evaluations (effectiveness, user evaluations, and adherence) were extracted and compared. Studies using a controlled design were included in a random-effects meta-analysis on the effectiveness on brain health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale. RESULTS The electronic searches yielded 44 documents describing 14 Web-based lifestyle programs; physical and cognitive activities were targeted in all programs. Four programs (4/14, 29%) were publicly available and free of charge, whereas others were restricted to research settings (5/14, 36%), available after payment (1/14, 7%), or not available at all (2/14, 14%). User evaluations were reported for 8 (57%) of the 14 programs. Reported dropout of the intervention groups ranged from 2% to 52%. Overall, 3 studies evaluated the effectiveness of a program using a controlled design and were included in the meta-analysis (moderate-to-high quality). Pooled results showed a significant small-to-medium effect of the Web-based multidomain lifestyle interventions on outcome measures for brain health (global cognition score, subjective cognitive score, and lifestyle risk score; standard mean difference=0.45; 95% CI 0.12-0.78), with a high degree heterogeneity across studies (I2=75%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS In total, 14 Web-based multidomain lifestyle programs aimed at optimizing brain health were found. The programs showed heterogeneity in both characteristics and effectiveness evaluation. Despite this heterogeneity, this meta-analysis suggests that Web-based lifestyle programs can positively influence brain health outcomes and have the potential to contribute to the prevention of dementia.","Wesselman, Linda Mp; Hooghiemstra, Astrid M; Schoonmade, Linda J; de Wit, Marjolein Cj; van der Flier, Wiesje M; Sikkes, Sietske Am",JMIR mental health,592,1

In this study, the clinical and dosimetric benefits of ART were compared with the conventional IMRT. Materials and Methods Sixty patients with locally advanced HNC were randomized into two arms to receive IMRT up to a curative dose of 70 Gy with concurrent weekly chemotherapy and were prospectively analyzed between March 2018 and March 2019. Repeat CT scan was acquired after the 3rd week of radiation. Patients in the study arm underwent replanning, whereas those in the control arm continued with the first IMRT plan. Assessment was done weekly till the end of treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months post IMRT for disease response and toxicities. Tumor volume reduction rate (TVRR) and dose reduction to organs at risk were also recorded. Results Complete response was observed in 90% and 96.7% patients in the control and study arms, respectively, at the end of 6 months. Insignificant differences were found between the two arms in terms of toxicities. Xerostomia was statistically significantly higher in the control arm at 6 months (P = 0.01). TVRR was found to be 31.85%. Dose to spinal cord, ipsilateral, and contralateral parotid reduced by 4.3%, 6%, and 2.2%, respectively, with ART. Conclusion Mid-treatment adaptive replanning can help in better target coverage and minimize toxicities in HNC patients.","Maheshwari, Guncha; Dhanawat, Aditya; Kumar, Harvindra S; Sharma, Neeti; Jakhar, Shankar Lal",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,592,8

For diagnosis and prevention of recurrence, perianal fistula imaging (PFI) is crucial. The aim of this study was to investigate if a Flex-M superficial coil images would provide more information than images obtained with a phased-array body coil in PFI. Material and methods Thirty-one fistulas of 29 patients were prospectively evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. A phased-array body coil was used in all patients as in routine practice, and sequences with Flex-M coil were also obtained. Afterwards, images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists who were blinded to the patients, coil and also to each other. The site of internal and external openings, and presence or absence of abscess and secondary tracts were recorded. Results The conspicuity of images was better with the Flex-M coil. Both radiologists saw more internal openings with the Flex-M coil. Cohen's κ value was 0.100 (p = 0.201) for Reader 1 and 0.110 (p = 0.361) for Reader 2 between these two coils. Additionally, numerically more internal/external openings and secondary tracts were seen by both readers. Interobserver variability was not statistically significant, and Cohen's κ values signifyied good concordance between readers. Conclusions In our study we showed that multichannel superficial phased-array coils improved imaging quality in PFI. We think that Flex-M coil can easily be used in routine clinical practice to gather better images of perianal fistulas.","Akyel, Nazlı Gülsüm; Akın, Kayıhan; Kösehan, Dilek; Köktener, Aslı",Polish journal of radiology,592,16

Control programs aim to suppress parasitism without promoting anthelminthic resistance, but few evidence-based guidelines define acceptable parasite loads in camelids. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES In clinically healthy nonanemic camelids, compare erythrocyte variables to Mhl real-time PCR status and to fecal egg count (FEC). Determine the FEC threshold above which erythrocyte variables are consistently below reference interval medians. ANIMALS One hundred fourteen client-owned adult alpacas and llamas. METHODS In a cross-sectional study, whole blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was assessed for packed cell volume (PCV) by centrifugation, erythrocyte count (RBC), and hemoglobin concentration (HGB) using an ADVIA120 analyzer, and Mhl using real-time PCR. Trichostrongyle eggs per gram (epg) were counted by modified McMaster test on freshly collected feces. Significant differences in erythrocyte variables based on Mhl status and FEC thresholds were assessed by independent t test and one-way ANOVA, respectively. RESULTS Packed cell volume, RBC, and HGB were not significantly different between Mhl-positive and Mhl-negative animals, but were significantly lower in animals with FEC >1000 epg compared to those with <500 epg. All animals with FEC >600 epg had RBC and HGB below the reference interval median. All animals with FEC >750 epg had PCV below the reference interval median. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE In healthy nonanemic camelids, positive Mhl PCR is not associated with lower erythrocyte variables and such animals may not warrant treatment. Fecal egg count >600-750 epg has a negative effect on erythrocyte variables, and may be a guide for deworming protocols.","Viesselmann, Lisa C; Videla, Ricardo; Schaefer, John; Chapman, Aly; Wyrosdick, Heidi; Schaefer, Deanna M W",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,592,31

Biologic meshes have been advocated in parastomal hernia repair due to purported resistance to infection in contaminated fields. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of additionally cross-linked acellular porcine dermal collagen mesh (Permacol) for onlay parastomal hernia repair. METHODS A retrospective review of case notes, and abdominal CT scans when available, was performed for consecutive patients who had a parastomal hernia repaired between January 2007 and May 2010. All hernias were repaired with onlay placement of the biologic mesh. Hernias were classified according to the Moreno-Matias classification where CT scans were available. RESULTS Over a 34-month period, 30 consecutive patients, median age 74 years, 17 female, underwent parastomal hernia repair using onlay biologic mesh. There were 23 paracolostomy and seven paraileostomy hernias. The hernia was primary in 26 patients. Pre-operative CT scans were available in 18 patients (Moreno-Matias Type 1 = 1, Type 2 = 4, Type 3 = 13). There was one perioperative death, and 29 patients were available for follow-up, and median duration of follow-up (either CT or clinical) was 36 months (range 3-79). Twenty-six patients developed recurrence of the parastomal hernia (89.6%), and median time to recurrence was 10 months (range 3-72),with Moreno-Matias Type 1 = 0, Type 2 = 4, Type 3 = 14, unknown = 8. Fifteen out of 26 patients have had repairs of the recurrence using a variety of techniques. Of these, 10 patients have had further recurrence. CONCLUSION Onlay repair of parastomal hernia with cross-linked porcine dermal collagen biologic mesh reinforcement has poor long-term outcomes with unacceptably high recurrence rates and should not be performed.","Warwick, A M; Velineni, R; Smart, N J; Daniels, I R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,592,0

In 1994, one-third of Serengeti lions died from canine distemper virus (CDV). Based on the limited epidemiological data available from this period, it has been unclear whether the 1994 outbreak was propagated by lion-to-lion transmission alone or involved multiple introductions from other sympatric carnivore species. More broadly, we do not know whether contacts between lions allow any pathogen with a relatively short infectious period to percolate through the population (i.e. reach epidemic proportions). We built one of the most realistic contact network models for a wildlife population to date, based on detailed behavioural and movement data from a long-term lion study population. The model allowed us to identify previously unrecognized biases in the sparse data from the 1994 outbreak and develop methods for judiciously inferring disease dynamics from typical wildlife samples. Our analysis of the model in light of the 1994 outbreak data strongly suggest that, although lions are sufficiently well connected to sustain epidemics of CDV-like diseases, the 1994 epidemic was fuelled by multiple spillovers from other carnivore species, such as jackals and hyenas.","Craft, Meggan E; Volz, Erik; Packer, Craig; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",Proceedings.

We hypothesized that if V(T) was adjusted to target permissive hypercarbia, VV would result in more efficient gas exchange without increasing inflammatory and injurious responses in the lung. METHODS Preterm lambs at 129 d gestation were anesthetized, tracheotomized, and randomized to either CV (n = 8) or VV (n = 8) using the same initial average V(T) and RR. Lung mechanics and gas exchange were measured intermittently, and average V(T) was adjusted to target partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40-50 mm Hg for 3 h. Lung injury and inflammation were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, lung tissue, and peripheral blood. RESULTS VV achieved permissive hypercarbia using a lower average V(T), peak inspiratory pressure, and elastance (increased compliance) as compared with CV. Oxygenation and markers of lung tissue inflammation or injury were not different apart from a lower wet:dry tissue ratio in the VV lungs.

It is unclear if home monitoring of young people with CF is feasible or acceptable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made home monitoring more of a necessity. We report the results of CLIMB-CF, exploring home monitoring's feasibility and potential obstacles. METHODS We designed a mobile app and enrolled participants with CF aged 2-17 years and their parents for six months. They were asked to complete a variety of measures either daily or twice a week. During the study, participants and their parents completed questionnaires exploring depression, anxiety and quality of life. At the end of the study parents and participants completed acceptability questionnaires. RESULTS 148 participants were recruited, 4 withdrew prior to starting the study. 82 participants were female with median (IQR) age 7.9 (5.2-12 years). Median data completeness was 40.1% (13.6-69.9%) for the whole cohort; when assessed by age participants aged ≥ 12 years contributed significantly less (15.6% [9.8-30%]). Data completeness decreased over time. There was no significant difference between parental depression and anxiety scores at the start and the end of the study nor in CFQ-R respiratory domain scores for participants ≥ 14 years. The majority of participants did not feel the introduction of home monitoring impacted their daily lives. CONCLUSIONS Most participants felt home monitoring did not negatively impact their lives and it did not increase depression, anxiety or decrease quality of life. However, uptake was variable, and not well sustained. The teenage years pose a particular challenge and further work is required.","Edmondson, C; Westrupp, N; Seddon, P; Olden, C; Wallis, C; Dawson, C; Brodlie, M; Baxter, F; McCormick, J; MacFarlane, S; Rice, D; Macleod, A; Brooker, R; Connon, M; Ghayyda, S; Blaikie, L; Thursfield, R; Brown, L; Price, A; Fleischer, E; Itterman, J; Hughes, D; Barrett, P; Surette, M; Donnelly, C; Mateos-Corral, D; Padley, G; Wallenburg, J; Brownlee, K; Alton, E W F W; Bush, A; Davies, J C",Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society,592,26

This study aimed to summarize a personal experience of CUT anatomic lung resection with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy (CUT-ALR-SML) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CUT-ALR-SML in our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 326 patients with NSCLC were chosen to undergo CUT-ALR-SML in our institute from August 2013 to July 2018. Data such as clinicopathologic characteristics and perioperative outcomes were reviewed in this article. RESULTS For the 326 cases of ALR, the specific procedures and the corresponding number of cases were as follows: segmentectomy, 90; lobectomy, 218; sleeve lobectomy, 9; ipsilateral lobe combined with segment resected synchronously (i-L+S), 6; and pneumonectomy, 3. A total of 31 cases required conversion to open surgery, and 4 cases were converted to multiportal thoracoscopic surgery. All patients underwent SML. The average mediastinal lymph node stations and mediastinal lymph nodes dissected under CUT-ALR-SML were 3.3±1.4 and 9.6±8.4, respectively. Approximately 99.7% of the patients acquired free resection margins. A total of 42 (12.9%) patients suffered from postoperative complications, and 1 patient died of pneumonia during the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS Complete uniportal ALR, particularly for segmentectomy and lobectomy is safe and feasible with low complication rates and excellent free resection margin rates. SML during complete uniportal thoracoscopic surgery adequately assesses the N2 lymph node. However, further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the role of CUT-ALR-SML in the treatment of NSCLC.","Deng, Youjun; Wang, Jiaqing; Mu, Juwei; Wang, Zheng; Wang, Guangsuo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",592,1

Both deployment approaches were subsequently used nationwide, with each state selecting one of the two contact methods. Experimental results showed that requests from the familiar sender achieved higher survey response (54.3%) compared to requests from the unfamiliar sender (36.9%; OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.23, 3.33).

In patients with PE, the expression of the majority of integrin mRNAs located on leukocytes and platelets was significantly upregulated. The expression of mRNAs related to L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand was significantly upregulated, while the expression of mRNA related to E-selectin was significantly downregulated. The expression of mRNAs related to classic cadherins and protocadherins was downregulated, and the expression of mRNAs related to vascular endothelial cadherin was significantly downregulated; the expression of mRNAs related to the immunoglobulin superfamily had no obvious difference between the 2 groups. In conclusion, we demonstrated that, in symptomatic PE patients, the adhesion of leukocytes and platelets was enhanced; the activation of endothelial cells was obviously weakened; the adherens junctions among endothelial cells were weakened, with the endothelium becoming more permeable.","Xie, Yuan; Duan, Qianglin; Wang, Leming; Gong, Zhu; Wang, Qiang; Song, Haoming; Wang, Hao",Molecular medicine reports,592,26

The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamics and inflammatory response of a novel transumbilical technique with that of a conventional transthoracic technique in thoracic exploration and lung resection in a canine model. METHODS Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to undergo transumbilical thoracoscopy (n = 8) or standard thoracoscopy (n = 8). Animals in the umbilical group received lung resection via a 3-cm transumbilical incision in combination with a 2.5-cm transdiaphragmatic incision. Animals in the standard thoracoscopy group underwent lung resection via a 3-cm thoracic incision. Hemodynamic parameters (e.g., mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and global end-diastolic volume index) and inflammatory parameters (e.g., neutrophil count, neutrophil 2',7' -dichlorohydrofluorescein [DCFH] expression, monocyte count, monocyte inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, total lymphocyte count, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts, the CD4+/CD8+ratio, plasma Creactive protein level, interleukin-6 level) were evaluated before surgery, during the operation, and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. RESULTS Lung resections were successfully performed in all 16 animals. There were 2 surgery-related mortality complications (1 animal in each group). In the transumbilical group, 1 death was caused by early extubation before the animal fully recovered from the anesthesia. In the thoracoscopic group, 1 death was caused by respiratory distress and the complication of sepsis at 5 days after surgery. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regard to the hemodynamic and immunologic impact of the surgeries. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the hemodynamic and inflammatory changes with endoscopic lung resection performed by the transumbilical approach are comparable to those after using the conventional transthoracic approach. This information is novel and relevant for surgeons interested in developing new surgical techniques in minimally invasive surgery.","Lu, Hung-Yi; Chu, Yen; Wu, Yi-Cheng; Liu, Chien-Ying; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Chao, Yin-Kai; Wu, Ching-Yang; Yuan, Hsu-Chia; Ko, Po-Jen; Liu, Yun-Hen; Liu, Hui-Ping",International journal of surgery,592,16

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) conditioning has been hypothesized as a non-pharmacological strategy aiming to improve adaptive responses during high altitude ascent. In the recent years, IH training (IHT) has become increasingly popular among recreational and professional athletes owing to its ability to mitigate high altitude related problems. This study aimed at exploring the role of IHT in altitude acclimatization. METHODS Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to IHT for 4 h consecutively for 5 days at 12% FiO2 under normobaric conditions. To assess the effect of IHT in hypoxic acclimatization, animals were further exposed to extreme hypoxia (EH) at 8% FiO2. Oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate and heart rate were recorded during the exposure. Oxidative stress (ROS, MDA, and 4-HNE) and histopathological examinations were studied in the lung tissue sections. Hypoxia biomarkers, HIF-1α, EPO, VEGF, and BPGM were evaluated through western blotting in the lung tissue. RESULTS Assessment of the IHT showed that SpO2 levels were found to be higher in the IH trained rats with a statistical difference of p < 0.01 in the first hour of hypoxia exposure as compared to the untrained rats. There was a significantly higher (p < 0.001) generation of ROS and MDA in the untrained rats as compared to the trained rats. Lipid peroxidation markers and systemic inflammatory marker were found to be expressed at much higher level in the untrained rats. There was a higher expression of HIF-1α (1.24-fold ↑), VEGF (1.14-fold ↑) and decrease in EPO (1.43-fold ↓) in the untrained rats as compared to trained rats. CONCLUSIONS Preconditioning with IHT resulted in the reduction in hypoxia induced oxidative stress during extreme hypoxia exposure and thus, maintaining redox balance as well as adjustment in the physiological changes in rats.","Nimje, Megha A; Patir, Himadri; Tirpude, Rajesh Kumar; Reddy, Prasanna K; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Experimental lung research,592,5

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of women undergoing staging for uterine and ovarian cancer between January 2011 and July 2013 at a major metropolitan teaching hospital was reviewed. Patients undergoing HARS were matched with patients undergoing staging laparotomy [exploratory laparotomy (XLAP)] for the same indications and with patients undergoing traditional robotic surgery (RS) for staging of endometrioid endometrial cancer. In HARS, a longer incision is used to allow palpation of the peritoneal surfaces, to exteriorize the small bowel, to examine the mesentery, and to perform omentectomy. RESULTS One hundred five patients were analyzed (15 HARS, 45 RS, 45 XLAP). Compared with XLAP, HARS was associated with decreased blood loss (200 vs 400 mL, P = 0.011) and shorter hospital stay (1 vs 4 days, P < 0.001). Patients who had undergone HARS had fewer major complications, but those results did not reach statistical significance (0% vs 27%, P = 0.063). Hand-assisted robotic surgery was associated with higher blood loss and length of stay as compared to robotic staging of endometrioid endometrial cancer (RS). Minor wound complications were also more common (27% vs 2%, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS Hand-assisted robotic surgery allows for thorough visual and tactile assessment of peritoneal surfaces. It represents a safe alternative to laparotomy for staging of ovarian and uterine cancers with high risk of peritoneal spread. Long-term follow-up study is needed to determine oncologic adequacy of HARS.","Fornalik, Hubert; Brooks, Hannah; Moore, Elizabeth S; Flanders, Nicole L; Callahan, Michael J; Sutton, Gregory P",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,592,0

Although intergenerational support has been found to be associated with wellbeing of older people in previous study, most analysis were from the perspective of children's characteristics and exchange patterns. This study aims to investigate the impact of different types of intergenerational support on subjective wellbeing among Chinese oldest-old and the variation across groups of different economic status, based on their five-tier of needs (physiological needs, safety needs, love/belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs). METHODS We included older adults aged ≥ 80 years from the 2018 Chinese longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We assessed older people's subjective wellbeing by their life satisfaction and psychological health. We evaluated four types of intergenerational support: parents provide financial support, receive financial, instrumental and emotional support. We applied binary logistic regression analysis to analyze the association between different intergenerational support and older people's subjective wellbeing and the moderating effect of self-rated economic status on this relationship. RESULTS A total of 8.794 participants were included, with a mean age of 91,46 years (standard deviation:7.60). Older adults who provide financial support (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.85) and receive emotional support (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.83) report better subjective wellbeing. However, receiving instrumental support depressed psychological health (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.79) while improved life satisfaction (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.55). Receiving emotional support promoted parents' psychological health among all combinations of support, and receiving all the three types together raised their subjective wellbeing most. CONCLUSIONS Our study recognizes that higher level of subjective wellbeing for oldest-old is related to providing financial support, receiving emotional and certain instrumental support. In addition, higher economic status can moderate these associations.","Huang, Fanghong; Fu, Peipei",BMC geriatrics,592,1

Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is upregulated in mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and may contribute to delirium, it is not known whether inhibition of systemic IL-6 mitigates delirium-relevant neuropathology. To histologically define neuropathological effects of IL-6 inhibition in an experimental VILI model. VILI was simulated in anesthetized adult mice using a 35cc/kg tidal volume mechanical ventilation model. There were two controls groups: 1) spontaneously breathing, or 2) anesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 10cc/kg tidal volume to distinguish effects of anesthesia from VILI. Two hours prior to inducing VILI, mice were treated with either anti-IL-6 antibody, anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, or saline. Neuronal injury, stress, and inflammation were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), a neuronal apoptosis marker, was significantly increased in the frontal (p<0.001) and hippocampal (p<0.0001) brain regions and accompanied by significant increases in c-Fos and heat shock protein-90 in the frontal cortices of VILI mice compared to controls (p<0.001). These findings were not related to cerebral hypoxia and there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal death. Frontal and hippocampal neuronal CC3 were significantly reduced with anti-IL-6 antibody (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively), anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (p<0.05 and p<0.0001, respectively) compared to saline VILI mice. VILI induces potentially reversible neuronal injury and inflammation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which is mitigated with IL-6 inhibition. These data suggest a potentially novel neuroprotective role of systemic IL-6 inhibition that justifies further investigation.","Sparrow, Nicklaus A; Anwar, Faizan; Covarrubias, Ambart E; Rajput, Padmesh S; Rashid, Mohammad Harun; Nisson, Peyton L; Gezalian, Michael M; Toossi, Shahed; Ayodele, Maranatha O; Karumanchi, S Ananth; Ely, E Wesley; Lahiri, Shouri",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,592,1

We report our preliminary experience of stent-assisted coiling embolization of these aneurysms. METHODS A total of 50 patients with 52 tiny, wide-necked aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling from January 2007 to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULT All aneurysms were successfully treated with the stent-assisted coiling technique, and at the end of the procedure, aneurysm occlusion was complete for 45 (86.5 %), near complete for 3 (5.8 %) and incomplete for 4 (7.7 %). Procedural complications (1 intraprocedural rupture, 2 coil migrations and 1 aneurysm re-rupture) occurred in 4 (8 %) of 50 patients, resulting in permanent morbidity in 1 (2 %) patient and death in 1 (2 %) patient. Follow-up imaging was available in 43 (84.3 %) aneurysms for 6-31 months (mean, 13 months). Complete occlusion was achieved in 40 (93 %) of 43 aneurysms on long-term follow-up. One aneurysm with complete occlusion and one with incomplete occlusion after the initial embolization developed a significant recurrence (4.7 %). Clinical follow-up was available for 43 (86 %) of 50 patients at a mean of 36.7 months (range 15-66 months). Of these 43 patients, 42 (97 %) made an excellent recovery achieving a GOS of 5. None of the patients died or experienced re-bleeding or ischemic cerebral vascular events during follow-up. CONCLUSION Stent-assisted coiling embolization is feasible and relatively safe for tiny, wide-necked intracranial aneurysms of carotid arteries. Furthermore, long-term follow-up angiography indicated stent-assisted coiling seems to be effective in preventing early recanalization.","Zheng, Yongtao; Song, Yanbing; Liu, Dajun; Liu, Yingjun; Xu, Qiang; Tian, Yanlong; Leng, Bing",Acta neurochirurgica,592,23

Given the growing prevalence of anxiety in the United States and beyond, there is an urgent clinical need to develop nonpharmacologic treatments that effectively treat and reduce its core symptoms (eg, worry). A leading theory posits that although worrying may be unpleasant, the immediate emotions that are avoided by concentrating on worry are often perceived as more aversive (eg, fear, anger, grief). From a mechanistic perspective, worry is thought to be learned and reinforced in a similar manner to other types of positively and negatively reinforced behaviors: habits. Mindfulness training, a practice that brings awareness to cognitive, affective, and physiological experiences, when delivered in-person via programs such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing anxiety, but is difficult to scale in this manner. In this review, we explore novel approaches to using mindfulness training to specifically target the theoretical mechanisms underlying the perpetuation of anxiety (eg, worry as a habit), and the emergence of mobile health platforms (eg, digital therapeutics) as potential vehicles for remote delivery of treatment.","Brewer, Judson A; Roy, Alexandra",American journal of lifestyle medicine,592,1

An interim analysis of cases occurring in or transferred to these hubs was performed on March 20, 2020 and recommendations were released on March 24, 2020. The vision of this strict organization was to centralize patients in high-risk maternity centers in order to concentrate human resources and personal protective equipment (PPE), dedicate protected areas of these major hospitals, and centralize clinical multidisciplinary experience with this disease. All maternity hospitals were informed to provide a protected labor and delivery room for nontransferable patients in advanced labor. A pre-triage based on temperature and 14 other items was developed in order to screen suspected patients in all hospitals to be tested with nasopharyngeal swabs. Obstetric outpatient facilities were instructed to maintain scheduled pregnancy screening as per Italian guidelines, and to provide pre-triage screening and surgical masks for personnel and patients for pre-triage-negative patients. Forty-two cases were recorded in the first 20 days of hub and spoke organization. The clinical presentation was interstitial pneumonia in 20 women.

Current chemotherapy for arenavirus infection is limited to the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, which is characterized by considerable toxicity and treatment failure. Using Pichinde virus as a model arenavirus, we attempted to design glycoprotein-derived fusion inhibitors similar to the FDA-approved anti-HIV peptide enfuvirtide. We have identified a GP2-derived peptide, AVP-p, with antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. The 50% inhibitory dose (IC50) for the peptide is 7 μM, with complete inhibition of viral plaque formation at approximately 20 μM, and its antiviral activity is largely sequence dependent. AVP-p demonstrates activity against viruses with the Old and New World arenavirus viral glycoprotein complex but not against enveloped viruses of other families. Unexpectedly, fusion assays reveal that the peptide induces virus-liposome fusion at neutral pH and that the process is strictly glycoprotein mediated. As observed in cryo-electron micrographs, AVP-p treatment causes morphological changes consistent with fusion protein activation in virions, including the disappearance of prefusion glycoprotein spikes and increased particle diameters, and fluorescence microscopy shows reduced binding by peptide-treated virus. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements suggest that glycoproteins are destabilized by peptide-induced alterations in viral membrane order. We conclude that untimely deployment of fusion machinery by the peptide could render virions less able to engage in on-pathway receptor binding or endosomal fusion. AVP-p may represent a potent, highly specific, novel therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Because the only drug available to combat infection by Lassa virus, a highly pathogenic arenavirus, is toxic and prone to treatment failure, we identified a peptide, AVP-p, derived from the fusion glycoprotein of a nonpathogenic model arenavirus, which demonstrates antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. AVP-p is unique among self-derived inhibitory peptides in that it shows broad, specific activity against pseudoviruses bearing Old and New World arenavirus glycoproteins but not against viruses from other families. Further, the peptide's mechanism of action is highly novel. Biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy indicate that AVP-p induces premature activation of viral fusion proteins through membrane perturbance. Peptide treatment, however, does not increase the infectivity of cell-bound virus. We hypothesize that prematurely activated virions are less fit for receptor binding and membrane fusion and that AVP-p may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection.","Spence, Jennifer S; Melnik, Lilia I; Badani, Hussain; Wimley, William C; Garry, Robert F",Journal of virology,592,16

METHODS Systematic review of the literature. Pooled prevalence estimates by care setting and clinical or radiological diagnostic criteria were calculated and plotted [PROSPERO ID: CRD42018109640]. RESULTS In total, 41 papers reporting on 55 study samples were included. The overall risk of bias was considered high in two-thirds of the papers. The mean prevalence, based on a clinical diagnosis of LSS in the general population, was 11% (95% CI 4-18%), 25% (95% CI 19-32%) in patients from primary care, 29% (95% CI 22-36%) in patients from secondary care and 39% (95% CI 39-39%) in patients from mixed primary and secondary care. Evaluating the presence of LSS based on radiological diagnosis, the pooled prevalence was 11% (95% CI 5-18%) in the asymptomatic population, 38% (95% CI - 10 to 85%) in the general population, 15% (95% CI 13-18%) in patients from primary care, 32% (95% CI 22-41%) in patients from secondary care and 21% (95% CI 16-26%) in a mixed population from primary and secondary care. CONCLUSIONS The mean prevalence estimates based on clinical diagnoses vary between 11 and 39%, and the estimates based on radiological diagnoses similarly vary between 11 and 38%. The results are based on studies with high risk of bias, and the pooled prevalence estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. With an growing elderly population, there is a need for future low risk-of-bias research clarifying clinical and radiological diagnostic criteria of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Gaining a stronger understanding of factors associated with an increased likelihood of RSDBs among traumatised individuals offers potential new avenues for research and treatment. Mounting evidence indicates relations between traumatic experiences and deficits/disturbances in characteristics of positive memories; however, relations between RSDBs and positive memory characteristics has been understudied. Using hierarchical multiple regression, we examined relations between positive memory characteristics (Memory Experiences Questionnaire-Short Form; MEQ-SF) and RSDBs, controlling for PTSD and depression severity, among a sample of treatment-seeking trauma-exposed individuals (N = 77; Mage = 33.96; 57.10% female). Results indicated that MEQ-SF subscales of Accessibility, Coherence, Emotional Intensity, and Sensory Details were significantly associated with engagement in RSDBs, above and beyond PTSD and depressive severity. Those who easily accessed emotionally evocative positive memories tended to engage in elevated RSDBs; those with less coherence and fewer sensory details in their positive memories were also more likely to engage in RSDBs. Theories related to emotion dysregulation and cognitive deficits may explain these obtained relations.","Banducci, Anne N; Contractor, Ateka A; Weiss, Nicole H; Dranger, Paula",Memory,592,24

DESCRIPTION The subjects were the 40 patients in whom ND2 lymph node dissection was performed among those with a preoperative diagnosis of stage IA (T1 N0 M0) lung cancer who underwent thoracoscopic operations in our hospital during the 2-year period from January 2001 to December 2002. With the patient in the lateral position, a Thoraco Holder (Fuji Systems Corp, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted between the fourth and fifth intercostal space on the anterior axillary line. The surgeon used it as a port for performing the surgical maneuvers. An access needle was placed in the auscultatory triangle in the fifth intercostal space, and a 3-mm thoracoscope was used. Pulmonary lobectomy and mediastinal dissection were performed in the same manner as the standard thoracoscopic two-windows method. EVALUATION The one-window technique was successful in 38 patients, and conversion to the two-windows method occurred in the other 2. Mean operation time was 2 hours 18 minutes. A mean number of 16.5 lymph nodes were removed, and mean blood loss was 22 mL. All 40 patients are alive and free of recurrence at 5 or more years since the operation. CONCLUSIONS As a result of mastering the operation and developing improved instruments, pulmonary lobectomies can now be performed by the one-window method.

METHODS Community-recruited adults aged 50 years and older were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups: 8-week training in mindfulness meditation, matched 8-week training in moderate-intensity sustained exercise, or observational control. The primary outcome was area-under-the-curve global illness severity during a single cold and influenza season, using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) to assess severity. Health care visits and days of missed work were counted. Nasal wash collected during ARI illness was assayed for neutrophils, interleukin-8, and viral nucleic acid. RESULTS Of 154 adults randomized into the study, 149 completed the trial (82% female, 94% white, mean age 59.3 ± 6.6 years). There were 27 ARI episodes and 257 days of ARI illness in the meditation group (n = 51), 26 episodes and 241 illness days in the exercise group (n = 47), and 40 episodes and 453 days in the control group (n = 51). Mean global severity was 144 for meditation, 248 for exercise, and 358 for control. Compared with control, global severity was significantly lower for meditation (P = .004). Both global severity and total days of illness (duration) trended toward being lower for the exercise group (P=.16 and P=.032, respectively), as did illness duration for the meditation group (P=.034). Adjusting for covariates using zero-inflated multivariate regression models gave similar results. There were 67 ARI-related days of-work missed in the control group, 32 in the exercise group (P = .041), and 16 in the meditation group (P <.001). Health care visits did not differ significantly. Viruses were identified in 54% of samples from meditation, 42% from exercise, and 54% from control groups. Neutrophil count and interleukin-8 levels were similar among intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS Training in meditation or exercise may be effective in reducing ARI illness burden.","Barrett, Bruce; Hayney, Mary S; Muller, Daniel; Rakel, David; Ward, Ann; Obasi, Chidi N; Brown, Roger; Zhang, Zhengjun; Zgierska, Aleksandra; Gern, James; West, Rebecca; Ewers, Tola; Barlow, Shari; Gassman, Michele; Coe, Christopher L",Annals of family medicine,592,1

OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the evidence for the relationship between training load and musculoskeletal injury risk in athlete, military, and first responder (i.e. law enforcement, firefighting, rescue service) populations. METHODS The CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SportDISCUS, and SCOPUS databases were searched using a comprehensive strategy. Studies published prior to July 2017 were included if they prospectively examined the relationship between training load and injury risk. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. A narrative synthesis of findings was conducted. RESULTS A total of 2047 articles were examined for potential inclusion. Forty-six met the inclusion criteria and 11 known to the authors but not found in the search were added, for a total of 57 articles. Overall, 47 studies had at least partially statistically significant results, demonstrating a relationship between training load and injury risk. Included articles were rated as poor (n = 15), fair (n = 6), and good (n = 36) based on NOS score. Articles assessed as 'good' were considered level 2b evidence on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Model, and articles assessed as 'fair' or 'poor' were considered level 4 evidence. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the existence of a relationship between training load and injury continues to be well supported in the literature and is strongest for subjective internal training load. The directionality of this relationship appears to depend on the type and timeframe of load measured.","Eckard, Timothy G; Padua, Darin A; Hearn, Darren W; Pexa, Brett S; Frank, Barnett S",Sports medicine,592,1

METHODS We performed a systematic search resulting in 10 studies reporting stroke frequency among COVID-19 patients, which were pooled with one unpublished series from Canada. We applied random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the proportion of stroke among COVID-19. We performed an additional systematic search for cases series of stroke in COVID-19 patients (n=125) and we pooled these data with 35 unpublished cases from Canada, USA, and Iran. We analyzed clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality stratified into age groups (<50, 50-70, >70 years). We applied cluster analyses to identify specific clinical phenotypes and their relationship with death. RESULTS The proportion of COVID-19 patients with stroke (1.8%, 95%CI 0.9-3.7%) and in-hospital mortality (34.4%, 95%CI 27.2-42.4%) were exceedingly high. Mortality was 67% lower in patients <50 years-old relative to those >70 years-old (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.94, P=0.039). Large vessel occlusion was twice as frequent (46.9%) as previously reported and was high across all age groups, even in the absence of risk factors or comorbidities. A clinical phenotype characterized by older age, a higher burden of comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality (58.6%) and a 3x higher risk of death than the rest of the cohort (OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.53-8.09, P=0.003).

Neuronal plasticity and remodeling are crucial for recovery of neural functions after brain injury. Buyang Huanwu decoction, which is a classic formula in traditional Chinese medicine, can positively alter synaptic plasticity. This study assessed the effects of Buyang Huanwu decoction in combination with physical exercise on neuronal plasticity in cerebral ischemic rats. METHODS Cerebral ischemic rats were administered Buyang Huanwu decoction and participated in physical exercise after the induction of a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neurobehavioral functions and infarct volumes were evaluated. The presynaptic (SYN), postsynaptic (GAP-43) and cytoskeletal (MAP-2) proteins in the coronal brain samples were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The ultrastructure of the neuronal synaptic junctions in the same region were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS Combination treatment of Buyang Huanwu decoction and physical exercise ameliorated the neurobehavioral deficits (p < 0.05), significantly enhanced the expression levels of SYN, GAP-43 and MAP-2 (p < 0.05), and maintained the synaptic ultrastructure.

Thrombosis and infections are the main causes of catheter-related comorbidity. Fibrin sheath, intimately related with the biofilm, is the precipitating factor of this environment, determining catheter patency and patient morbidity. Its association with bacterial overgrowth and thrombosis has led to the search of multiple preventive measures. Among them is the development of catheter coatings to prevent thrombosis and infections. There are two kinds of treatments to cover the catheter surface: antithrombotic and antimicrobial coatings. In nondialysis-related settings, mainly in intensive care units, both have been shown to be efficient in the prevention of catheter-related infection. This includes heparin, silver, chlorhexidine, rifampicine and minocycline. In hemodialysis population, however, few studies on surface-treated catheters have been made and they do not provide evidence that shows complication reduction. The higher effectiveness of coatings in nontunneled catheters may depend on the short average life of these devices. Hemodialysis catheters need to be used over long periods of time and require clinical trials to show effectiveness of coatings over long periods.

However, Paw comprises the endotracheal tube (ETT)-related pressure drop (∆PETT ) and thus does not reflect the pressure in the patients' lungs. Therefore, monitoring of mechanical ventilation should be based on the tracheal pressure (Ptrach ). We systematically investigated potential factors influencing ∆PETT in pediatric ETTs. METHODS In this study, the flow-dependent pressure drop across pediatric ETTs from four manufacturers [2.0-4.5 mm inner diameter (ID)] was estimated in a physical model of the upper airways. Additionally, ∆PETT was examined with the ETTs shortened to 75% of their original length and at different curvatures. In nine healthy mechanically ventilated children (aged between 9 days and 29 months), Ptrach was compared to Paw . RESULTS ∆PETT was nonlinearly flow dependent. Low IDs corresponded to high ∆PETT . Differences between ETTs from different manufacturers were identified. Shortening of the ETTs' length by 25% reduced ∆PETT on average by 14% of the value at original length. Ventilation frequency and tube curvature did not influence ∆PETT to a relevant extent. In the pediatric patients, the root mean square deviation between Paw and Ptrach was 2.3 cm H2O. CONCLUSION Paw and Ptrach differ considerably (by ∆PETT ) during mechanical ventilation of pediatric patients. The ETTs' ID, tube length, and manufacturer type are significant factors for ∆PETT and should be taken into account when Paw is valuated. For this purpose, Ptrach can be continuously calculated with good precision by means of the Rohrer approximation.","Spaeth, Johannes; Steinmann, Daniel; Kaltofen, Heike; Guttmann, Josef; Schumann, Stefan",Paediatric anaesthesia,592,24

Many care activities physically performed before C19 have been moving to virtual systems during the C19. The transitions from the physical to the virtual settings can interfere with collaboration structures in the ICU, which may impact clinical outcomes. Understanding the differences can help HCOs identify challenges when transitioning physical collaboration to the virtual in the post-C19 era. OBJECTIVE This study aims to leverage network analysis to determine the changes in neonatal ICU (NICU) collaboration structures from pre- to intra-C19. METHODS In this retrospective study, we applied network analysis to the utilization of electronic health records (EHRs) of 712 critically ill neonates (386 pre-C19 and 326 intra-C19, excluding those with C19 infection) admitted to the NICU of Vanderbilt University Medical Center (a major academic medical center at Nashville, Tennessee, USA) between September 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020 to learn collaboration between clinicians. We characterized pre-C19 as September through December of 2019 and intra-C19 as March through June of 2020. These two groups were compared using patients' clinical characteristics, including their age, sex, race, length of stay (LOS), and discharge dispositions. We leveraged the actions committed to the EHRs of patients by clinicians to measure clinician-clinician connections. We characterized a collabora-tion relationship (tie) between two clinicians as they performed actions to EHRs of the same patient within the same day. Upon the definition of collaboration relationship, we built pre- and intra-C19 networks. We used three sociometric measurements, including eigenvector centrali-ty, eccentricity, and betweenness, to quantify a clinician's leadership, collaboration difficulty, and broad skillsets in a network, respectively. We assessed the extent to which the eigenvector centrality, eccentricity, and betweenness of clinicians, in pre- and intra-C19 networks, are sta-tistically different using Mann-Whitney U tests at the 95% confidence level. RESULTS Our analysis results showed that the collaboration difficulty increased from pre- to intra-C19 (median eccentricity: 3 vs. 4, p <.001). In addition, nurses had reduced leadership (median ei-genvector centrality: 0.183 vs. 0.087, p <.001), and neonatologists who have broader skillsets cared for a wider spectrum of patients in the NICU structure during the C19 pandemic (median betweenness centrality: 0.0001 vs. 0.005, p <.001). The pre- and intra-C19 patient groups shared similar distributions in sex (~0 difference), race (4% difference in White, and 3% dif-ference in African American), LOS (interquartile range difference in 1.5 days), and discharge dispositions (~0 difference in home, 2% difference in expired, and 2% difference in others). There were no significant differences in the patient demographics and outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Management of NICU patients typically requires multidisciplinary care teams. Understanding collaboration structures can provide fine-grained evidence to potentially refine or optimize ex-isting teamwork in the NICU.

The purpose of this paper is to apply and expand a previously introduced model to sustaining new interdisciplinary research collaborations: Forging Alliances in Interdisciplinary Rehabilitation Research (FAIRR). FAIRR is a logic model that can be used as a guide to create interdisciplinary rehabilitation research teams. In this paper, we propose to expand FAIRR by including strategies for sustaining interdisciplinary rehabilitation research collaborations: modifying inputs (resources needed to assemble a team and to conduct research activities), shifting activities (steps taken to move the interdisciplinary collaboration forward), and examining what impacts the fit between inputs and activities. Two examples are used to highlight the application of the FAIRR model to interdisciplinary collaborations during COVID-19.","Gill, Simone V; Shin, Danny; Ayoub, Maria; Keegan, Laura; Desrochers, Phillip C; Helfrich, Christine A",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,592,1

However, one of the rare causes is periampullary or juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common in the general population, the overwhelming majority are asymptomatic. Duodenal diverticula can cause combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction through multiple mechanisms such as stasis-induced primary choledocholithiasis, stasis-induced intradiverticular enterolith, or longstanding diverticulitis, causing stenosing fibrosing papillitis or a combination of more than one of these mechanisms. Herein, I report a case of Lemmel syndrome due to a combination of multiple mechanisms and review the available literature on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and management of juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. PATIENT CONCERNS Multiple episodes of abdominal pain, jaundice, anorexia, fever, and significant unintentional weight loss. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS Primary choledocholithiasis, recurrent ascending cholangitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic atrophy due to giant juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum, with unsuccessful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that was completely resolved after open transduodenal sphincteroplasty and septoplasty, transampullary and transcystic common bile duct exploration and stone extraction, and duodenal diverticular inversion. OUTCOME Complete resolution of combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction without recurrence for 2 years after surgery.

To reduce the risk of relapse, additional therapy has been added post-ASCT. In a nontransplant relapse setting, the combination of intravenous bortezomib and oral vorinostat (BV) was studied and showed efficacy. Therefore, it was reasonable to study this combination therapy post-ASCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS We report on BV given post-ASCT. All 30 patients underwent conditioning for ASCT with high-dose melphalan. After recovery from the acute transplant-related toxicity, BV therapy was started and given for a total of 12 (28-day) cycles. RESULTS The most common toxicities were hematological, gastrointestinal (diarrhea and nausea), fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The median follow-up for BV patients is 7.8 (range: 6.12-9.03) years. After BV therapy, 18 patients (60%) are alive, and 9 (30%) are alive without disease progression. CONCLUSIONS BV can be given post-ASCT with an acceptable toxicity profile and produces reasonable disease-free and overall survival rates.

A high background signal due to target interference was observed in our anti-REGN-Y antibody assay, and two different strategies were evaluated to mitigate this false-positive signal. Results: Multiple anti-target antibodies were tested and found to be ineffective at reducing target interference, so soluble target receptor and co-factor proteins were used in combination to inhibit the target-mediated signal. These competitive blockers synergistically inhibited target interference and increased target tolerance levels, especially when the assay was performed under mild acidic conditions. A separate approach, target immunodepletion using magnetic beads conjugated with an anti-target antibody, was also effective at mitigating the target-mediated signal, also in combination with mild acidic assay pH. Both methods allowed detection of a true ADA signal in monkey and human post-dose serum samples.

However, very little is known about the role that subsurface microorganisms may play in the biogeochemical cycling of Cu. In this study, we investigate the bioreduction of Cu(II) by the subsurface metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens Rapid removal of Cu from solution was observed in cell suspensions of G. sulfurreducens when supplied with Cu(II), while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses showed the formation of electron dense nanoparticles associated with the cell surface. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) point analysis and EDX spectrum image maps revealed the nanoparticles are rich in both Cu and S. This was confirmed by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses which identified the nanoparticles as Cu2S. Biomineralization of CuxS nanoparticles in soils has been reported to enhance the colloidal transport of a number of contaminants including Pb, Cd, and Hg. However, formation of these CuxS nanoparticles has only been observed under sulfate-reducing conditions and could not be repeated using isolates of implicated organisms. As G. sulfurreducens is unable to respire sulfate, and no reducible sulfur was supplied to the cells, these data suggest a novel mechanism for the biomineralization of Cu2S under anoxic conditions. The implications of these findings for the biogeochemical cycling of Cu and other metals as well as the green production of Cu catalysts are discussed.ImportanceDissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria are ubiquitous in soils and aquifers and are known to utilize a wide range of metals as terminal electron acceptors. These transformations play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metals in pristine and contaminated environments and can be harnessed for bioremediation and metal bioprocessing purposes. However, relatively little is known about their interactions with Cu. As a trace element that becomes toxic in excess, Cu can adversely affect soil biota and fertility. In addition, biomineralization of Cu nanoparticles has been reported to enhance mobilization of other toxic metals. Here, we demonstrate that when supplied with acetate under anoxic conditions, the model metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens, can transform soluble Cu(II) to Cu2S nanoparticles. This study provides new insights into Cu biomineralization by microorganisms and suggests that contaminant mobilization enhanced by Cu biomineralization could be facilitated by Geobacter species and related organisms.","Kimber, Richard L; Bagshaw, Heath; Smith, Kurt; Buchanan, Dawn M; Coker, Victoria S; Cavet, Jennifer S; Lloyd, Jonathan R",Applied and environmental microbiology,592,8

The failure of the host to efficiently produce type I IFNs in response to infection by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is linked with an increased probability for the disease to become lethal. JEV is a neurotropic virus of the Flaviviridae family that causes encephalitis in humans. JEV infection is regulated by several host factors, including microRNAs, which are conserved noncoding RNAs that participate in various physiological and pathological processes. We showed that the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a led to inhibition of the production of type I IFN by reducing the abundances of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and the signaling protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 5 (SOCS5). Mechanistically, induction of miR-301a expression during JEV infection required the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. In mouse neurons, neutralization of miR-301a restored the host innate immune response by enabling IFN-β production, thereby restricting viral propagation. Inhibition of miR-301a in mouse brain rescued the production of IRF1 and SOCS5, increased the generation of IFN-β, and reduced the extent of JEV replication, thus improving mouse survival. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a assists viral pathogenesis by suppressing IFN production, which might be targeted by antiviral therapies.","Hazra, Bibhabasu; Kumawat, Kanhaiya Lal; Basu, Anirban",Science signaling,592,27

This study aimed to understand individual decisions to practice different social distancing measures in the immediate emergence of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN Utilizing social media advertising and snowball sampling, a web-based survey was administered in 16 Latin American countries. METHODS We estimated seemingly unrelated Probit models to identify factors associated with the decision to implement social distancing practices. RESULTS From 5,480 respondents, estimated marginal effects indicate that risk perceptions are positively related to distancing from friends or relatives and avoiding public places but do not seem to influence the decision to stay home. Results also indicate that risk perceptions are related to household income, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the country, and perceived preparedness of the health care system. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the notion that people will follow social distancing measures if there is a clear understanding of risk. Providing the public ways to access accurate numbers of confirmed cases can inform perception of disease severity. Since household income was a determinant of practicing social distancing, without financial assistance, some will be forced to break regulations in order to procure food or resources for their survival.","Alicea-Planas, Jessica; Trudeau, Jennifer M; Vásquez Mazariegos, William F",Hispanic health care international : the official journal of the National Association of Hispanic Nurses,592,1

We know that the route of transmission of the disease is through saliva droplets produced by speaking, coughing and sneezing. The virus is highly infectious, and each infected individual infects 2.5 people on average. The average incubation period is about 5 days, with an estimated range from 2 to 14 days; the incubation period in children is similar, however some have exhibited a longer incubation. The virus binds to the cellular receptor ACE2, which in children has a structural and functional immaturity thus offering lower affinity to the pathogen; this could explain the lower incidence of infection from SARS-CoV-2 in this segment of the population.The common clinical observation is that COVID-19 is less severe in children, and in this group the disease is often asymptomatic. Pending further clinical studies able to clarify the infection and transmission dynamics, it is therefore important to apply also in children all preventive and hygiene measures recommended by the health authorities during dental treatment. We should avoid procedures that generate aerosols as much as possible, minimising the use of the air syringe. When possible, it is recommended to employ minimally invasive procedures and ART (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment). The latter is a technique that can also be employed in very young and uncooperative patients with widespread carious lesions, in order to avoid more invasive and complex procedures. Ozone therapy could be of great help in the control of the progression of the asymptomatic carious lesions, especially during the Phase 2 of reopening, when we should to minimise the use of rotating instruments producing aerosols. The above introduces a new concept of ""no aerosol"" that will possibly guide our therapeutic choices not only in the immediate future but also in the long term, opening scenarios of prevention and cure that are more efficient, safe, and sustainable. During procedures that generate aerosols, the use of proper PPE is crucial to minimise the risk of transmission. It is also strongly recommended to work with an assistant, and to use double suction and a rubber dam. We will have to rethink and review the schedule of daily activities, in terms of timing and mode of delivery of care, on the basis of an agenda which can be divided into ""no aerosol"" and ""aerosol"" procedures, and ""virtual visits"" (including management of true emergencies), creating a virtuous optimisation of care for the safety of operators and office staff, as discussed in an article published on this very EJPD issue.

The patients in the control group (C group) were given 0.9% sodium chloride in a double-blind fashion. Spinal anaesthesia was performed with 10 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine. The changes of Sao2, BIS and hemodynamic variables during caesarean section, Apgar score of neonate and the incidence of adverse effects were recorded. Results BIS values were lower in the L group compared to C group (P ≤ 0.001). Comparison of mean arterial pressure (MAP) changes during spinal anaesthesia and surgery reveal statistically significant difference between two groups through repeated measure analysis (P ≤ 0.001), but comparision of heart rate (HR) changes during spinal anaesthesia and surgery failed to reveal any statistically significant difference between two groups. (P = 0.261). The Apgar scores did not reveal a significant difference between the two groups at first and five minutes after delivery (P = 0.99). Conclusion Intravenous lignocaine infusion given with spinal anaesthesia in women undergoing elective caesarean delivery providing lower BIS values without respiratory depression, in the absence of foetal compromise.","Khezri, Marzieh Beigom; Rajabi, Maryam; Yaghoobi, Siamak; Barikani, Ameneh",Indian journal of anaesthesia,592,23

Maternal PM2.5 exposure has been confirmed to damage the growth of somatic cells and enhance the incidence of chronic respiratory diseases in children. Here we aim to investigate the impact of in utero PM2.5 exposure on early birth weight and postnatal lung development. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered PM2.5 (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every 3 days until birth. Maternal and birth outcomes and somatic growth were monitored. Lungs were collected on PND1 (where PND = postnatal day) and PND28; the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D) was analyzed, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured. Expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-κB were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. There were no significant intergroup differences for maternal outcomes; however, offspring exposed in utero to 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 were significantly smaller in litter weight than the controls. In utero exposure to 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 led to lower body weight after birth and disrupted lung development during infancy. ROS levels were significantly increased in the 7.5 mg/kg PM2.5 group. PM2.5-treated rats showed upregulated pulmonary expression of TLR4 and NF-κB. Maternal PM2.5 exposure enhances the risk of low birth weight and affects lung alveolar development. The underlying molecular mechanisms may involve TLR4/NF-κB signaling.","Tang, Wenting; Li, Zhongjun; Huang, Yaoguang; Du, Lili; Wen, Chuangyu; Sun, Wen; Yu, Zhiqiang; Huang, Suran; Chen, Dunjin",Chemical research in toxicology,592,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to evaluate the OAGB at our University Hospital between 2006 and 2013. PATIENTS One thousand patients have undergone an OAGB. Data were collected on all consecutive patients. The mean follow-up period was 31 months (SD, 26.3; range, 12-82.9), and complete follow-up was available in 126 of 175 patients (72 %) at 5 years after surgery. RESULTS Mortality rate was 0.2 %. Overall morbidity was 5.5 %; 34 required reoperations: i.e., 6 leaks, 5 obstructions, 5 incisional hernias, 7 biliary refluxes, 2 perforated ulcers, 2 bleeds, 2 abscesses, and 1 anastomotic stricture. Four patients were reoperated for weight regain. Overall rate of marginal ulcers was 2 % (n = 20), all in heavy smokers. Conversion from an OAGB to a RYGB was required in nine cases (0.9 %): seven for intractable biliary reflux, two for a marginal ulcer. At 5 years, percent excess body mass index loss was 71.6 ± 27 %. One hundred patients with type-2 diabetes, with a mean preoperative HbA1C of 7.7 ± 1.9 %, were followed for >2 years; the total resolution rate was 85.7 %. CONCLUSION This study confirms that the OAGB is an effective procedure for morbid obesity with comparable outcomes to RYGB; in addition, it seems to be safer with lower morbidity. Its technical simplicity represents a real advantage and makes it an option that should be considered by all bariatric surgeons.","Chevallier, Jean Marc; Arman, Gustavo A; Guenzi, Martino; Rau, Cedric; Bruzzi, Mathieu; Beaupel, Nathan; Zinzindohoué, Frank; Berger, Anne",Obesity surgery,592,11

Therefore, we compared the ITA indications for RRA with the recommendations by the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA). METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 380 consecutive DTC patients treated with surgery and RRA, followed at the Section of Endocrinology, University of Siena, Italy from January 2006 to December 2019. RESULTS Using ITA a significant increase of DTC patients classified as low or high risk and a significant decrease of patients defined at intermediate risk were observed (p < 0.0001). Consequently, the percentage of patients without routinary indication for RRA (47.4%, versus 38.2%, p < 0.0001) and those with a definite indication for RRA (8.2 versus 1.8%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher compared to ATA. Moreover, using ITA the percentage of patients with a selective use of RRA was lower in comparison to ATA (44.7% versus 60%, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the prevalence of distant metastases, at post-ablative whole body scan, in patients without indication for RRA, was not different using either ATA or ITA (2.1% and 1.1% respectively, p = 0.37). CONCLUSION The use of ITA Consensus, in clinical practice, increases significantly the number of patients for whom RRA is not routinely indicated in comparison to ATA guidelines but without differences in delaying the diagnosis of distant metastatic disease.","Forleo, R; Fralassi, N; Maino, F; Capezzone, M; Brilli, L; Pilli, T; Cantara, S; Castagna, M G",Journal of endocrinological investigation,592,1

We extended our experience with LRN to T2 renal tumors (greater than 7 cm) and compared the efficacy and long-term oncologic outcomes with those of open radical nephrectomy (ORN) for T2 clear renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the same period. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data from 33 patients who underwent LRN and 35 patients who underwent ORN in our institution from January 2003 to June 2006 for T2N0M0 RCC. We compared long-term oncologic outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS The median follow-up periods were 60.0 months (range, 48.0-77.0 months) and 65.6 months (range, 56.0-77.0 months) in the LRN and ORN groups, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the patients' demographic data. There were no significant differences in the 5-year overall survival rate, the cancer-specific survival rate, or the recurrence-free survival rate. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that LRN for the management of T2 RCC is feasible and efficacious and that the long-term oncologic outcomes of LRN are comparable to those of ORN.","Kwon, Se Yun; Jung, Jae Wook; Kim, Bum Soo; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Yoo, Eun Sang; Kwon, Tae Gyun",Korean journal of urology,592,28

Therapeutic strategies place much focus on dopamine replacement and the inhibition of dopamine metabolism. The present study was based on the known abilities of chalcones to act as molecular scaffolds that selectively inhibit MAO-B with the added advantage of binding reversibly. Recently, we synthesized a series of 26 chalcone compounds, amongst which (2E)-1-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O10) and (2E)-1-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O23) most inhibited MAO-B. Hence, the present study was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective effect of O10 and O23 at varying doses such as 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg each in a haloperidol-induced murine model of PD. Both compounds were effective (though O23 was the more effective) at ameliorating extrapyramidal and non-motor symptoms in the model and improved locomotory and exploratory behaviors, reduced oxidative stress markers, and enhanced antioxidant marker and neurotransmitter levels. Furthermore, histopathological studies showed O10 and O23 both reduced neurofibrillary tangles and plaques to almost normal control levels.","Parambi, Della Grace Thomas; Saleem, Uzma; Shah, Muhammad Ajmal; Anwar, Fareeha; Ahmad, Bashir; Manzar, Amna; Itzaz, Aqsa; Harilal, Seetha; Uddin, Md Sahab; Kim, Hoon; Mathew, Bijo",Neurochemical research,592,16

We evaluated a new energy source, the ForceTriad (Covidien, West Windsor, NJ) LigaSure, which delivers both mono- and bipolar energy in a 5-mm format and allows for tissue fusion and vessel sealing and division. This report documents our experience with this device. METHODS A database review was performed, looking for all cases that were performed in children using the ForceTriad LigaSure as the main source of hemostasis and tissue fusion. Two different handpieces were used a fine Maryland dissector-type instrument with no cutting blade, and a sealer/cutter, both in a 5-mm format. RESULTS A total of 60 cases were performed in children from September 2006 to September 2007, using the ForceTriad. The two most common cases were Nissen fundoplication (40 cases; weight: 8.5-95 kg [average,40.7]; operating room [OR] time: 15-70 min [average, 32]; average days to full feeds: 2) and lung lobectomy (11)cases (weight: 4.6-63 kg [average, 27.3]; OR time: 60-180 min [average, 123]; average hospital days: 3.1). Other procedures included, excision of choledochal cyst (3), aortopexy, closure of bronchopleural fistula, nephrectomy(1), thymectomy (1), parathyroid adenoma excision (1), total colectomy (2), and intestinal duplication resection(2). There were no failures of vessel or tissue fusion and no operative complications. A delayed hydropneumothorax developed in 1 lung resection and spontaneously resolved. CONCLUSION The ForceTriad provides a safe, effective energy source in a 5-mm format. As compared to previous versions of the LigaSure, there was less sticking, a quicker seal, and no tissue-fusion failures.","Ponsky, Todd A; Khosla, Arjun; Rothenberg, Steven S",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Despite over a 96.2 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of January 22nd, 2021, reports of patients co-infected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are scarce. It remains unknown whether HIV patients are at a greater risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, despite the immunocompromised status. We present a systematic review of the literature reporting cases of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection and examine trends of clinical outcomes among co-infected patients. Methods We systematically compiled 63 reports of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, published as of January 22nd, 2021. These studies were retrieved through targeted search terms applied to PubMed/Medline and manual search. Results Despite scattered evidence, reports indicate a favorable prognosis for HIV patients with strict adherence to cART. However, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a poorer prognosis in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 patients, despite cART and viral suppression. Studies were limited by geographic coverage, small sample size, lack of patient details, and short follow-up durations. Conclusions Although some anti-HIV drugs have shown promising in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, there is no conclusive evidence of the clinical efficacy of any anti-HIV drug in the treatment of COVID-19. Further research is needed to explain the underrepresentation of severe COVID-19 cases among the HIV patient population and to explore the possible protective mechanisms of cART in this vulnerable population.","Patel, Raj H; Acharya, Arpan; Chand, Hitendra S; Mohan, Mahesh; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",AIDS research and human retroviruses,592,27

This study aims to compare short-term outcomes of LLR and open liver resections (OLR) in the PS segments. METHODS This multicenter study consisted of all patients who underwent LLR in the PS segments and all patients who underwent OLR in the PS segments between October 2011 and July 2016. Laparoscopic cases were case-matched with those who had an identical open procedure during the same period based on tumor location (same segment) and the Brisbane classification of the resection. Demographics, comorbid factors, perioperative outcomes, short-term outcomes, necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the interval between surgery and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy were compared between the two groups. Data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained electronic database. RESULTS Both groups were comparable for age, sex, ASA score, maximum tumor diameter, and number of patients with additional liver resections outside the posterior segments. Operative time was similar in both groups (median 140 min; p = 0.92). Blood loss was less in the LLR-group (median: 150 vs. 300 ml in OLR-group). Median hospital stay was 6 days in both groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications (OLR-group: 31.4% vs. LLR-group: 25.7%; p = 0.60). There was no significant difference in R0 resections (LLR: 97.2 vs. 100% in OLR; p = 1.00). Tumor-free margins were less in the LLR group (LLR: 5 vs. 9.5 mm in OLR; p = 0.012). Patients undergoing LLR were treated with chemotherapy sooner compared to those undergoing OLR (41 vs. 56 days, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION This study suggests that laparoscopic parenchymal preserving liver resections in the PS segments can be performed with comparable short-term outcomes as similar OLR. The shorter interval to chemotherapy might provide long-term oncologic benefits in patients who underwent LLR.","D'Hondt, Mathieu; Tamby, Esther; Boscart, Isabelle; Turcotte, Simon; Parmentier, Isabelle; Pottel, Hans; Lapointe, Réal; Ovaere, Sander; Vansteenkiste, Franky; Vandenbroucke-Menu, Franck",Surgical endoscopy,592,1

Clinical use of PGHD has emerged as an essential issue. This study explored the evidence to determine the extent of and describe the characteristics of PGHD integration into electronic health records (EHRs). Methods In August 2019, we conducted a systematic scoping review. We included studies with complete, partial, or in-progress PGHD and EHR integration within a clinical setting. The retrieved articles were screened for eligibility by 2 researchers, and data from eligible articles were abstracted, coded, and analyzed. Results A total of 19 studies met inclusion criteria after screening 9463 abstracts. Most of the study designs were pilots and all were published between 2013 and 2019. Types of PGHD were biometric and patient activity (57.9%), questionnaires and surveys (36.8%), and health history (5.3%). Diabetes was the most common patient condition (42.1%) for PGHD collection. Active integration (57.9%) was slightly more common than passive integration (31.6%). We categorized emergent themes into the 3 steps of PGHD flow. Themes emerged concerning resource requirements, data delivery to the EHR, and preferences for review. Discussion PGHD integration into EHRs appears to be at an early stage. PGHD have the potential to close health care gaps and support personalized medicine. Efforts are needed to understand how to optimize PGHD integration into EHRs considering resources, standards for EHR delivery, and clinical workflows.","Tiase, Victoria L; Hull, William; McFarland, Mary M; Sward, Katherine A; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Staes, Catherine; Weir, Charlene; Cummins, Mollie R",JAMIA open,592,16

Transplant recipients are vulnerable due to comorbidities and immunosuppressants that render them susceptible to infections. The information on COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients remains limited to small case series. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted, and 12 case series totalling 204 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 were identified. Data were extracted, pooled and analysed. RESULTS Most patients (74%) were men. The most frequent symptoms were fever (76%), cough (64%) and dyspnoea (43%). At admission, over 70% of the patients had abnormal radiological findings. Leukocyte counts were in the lower normal range. C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer were consistently increased. Treatments included lowering immunosuppression, hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulins. Thirty-one percent of the patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and 16% required intubation. The overall mortality was 21.2%. Patients who died were significantly older than those who survived (61 ± 12 vs. 51 ± 15, p < .01).

This study was aimed to investigate whether modification of BMSCs with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) could enhance the survival of the implanted BMSCs. BMSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and were infected with Hif-1α-GFP lentiviral vector or Hif-1α siRNA. The modified BMSCs were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition, cellular viability and apoptosis were then assessed. An inhibitor of AMPK (compound C) was used to detect whether AMPK and mTOR were implicated in the functions of Hif-1α on BMSCs survival. Besides, ultrastructure of BMSCs was observed and the expression of autophagy markers was measured. The modified BMSCs were transplanted into middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, and the cerebral infarction volume and neurological function was assessed. The results indicated that Hif-1α overexpression protected OGD induced injury by promoting cellular viability and inhibiting apoptosis. AMPK was activated while mTOR was inactivated by Hif-1α overexpression, and that might be through which Hif-1α functioned BMSCs survival. Hif-1α overexpression promoted autophagy; more important, compound C abolished the induction of Hif-1α on autophagy. Transplantation of the overexpressed Hif-1α of BMSCs into the MCAO rats reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcome; besides, it inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines generation while promoted neurotrophin secretion. In conclusion, Hif-1α might be contributed in the survival of BMSCs by regulating the activation of AMPK and mTOR, as well as by promoting autophagy.","Lv, Bingke; Li, Feng; Han, Jianbang; Fang, Jie; Xu, Limin; Sun, Chengmei; Hua, Tian; Zhang, Zhongfei; Feng, Zhiming; Jiang, Xiaodan",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,592,31

METHODS During the period 2010-2011, a total of 1,605 stool samples, including 115 from Tunisian patients with pneumonia, were cultured on amoebae. We used a recently developed high-throughput isolation system to detect amoebae plaque lysis on agar plates; this method allows for the testing of 100 samples per plate per week. The giant virus was identified by sequencing of genes conserved in Megavirales. RESULTS A single giant virus, called Shan, was isolated from the stool of a Tunisian patient with pneumonia who responded poorly to antibiotics. This virus has an icosahedral shape typical of members of the family Mimiviridae and a size of 640 ± 10 nm. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Shan virus was classified as a member of Mimivirus lineage C that infects amoebae. CONCLUSION Only one isolate was obtained in this study, suggesting that giant viruses of amoebae are rare in human stool. The isolation of Shan virus from a patient with pneumonia brings into question the etiological role of this virus and its subsequent release in stool.","Saadi, Hanene; Reteno, Dorine-Gaelle Ikanga; Colson, Philippe; Aherfi, Sarah; Minodier, Philippe; Pagnier, Isabelle; Raoult, Didier; La Scola, Bernard",Intervirology,592,16

DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study via web-based survey. SETTING PICUs at North American academic institutions. SUBJECTS Pediatric intensivists, pediatric critical care fellows, and pediatric residents. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 1,323 responses were received representing a center response rate of 74% (147 of 200). Ninety percent of respondents stated that in-hospital coverage is good for patient care, and 85% stated that in-hospital coverage provides safer care. Sixty-three percent of intensivists stated that working in in-hospital models limits academic productivity, and 65% stated that in-hospital models interfere with nonclinical responsibilities. When compared with intensivists in home coverage models, intensivists working in in-hospital models generally had more favorable perceptions of the effects of in-hospital on patient care (p < 0.0001) and faculty quality of life. Physician burnout was measured with the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory. Although 57% of intensivists responded that working in in-hospital models increases burnout risk, burnout scores were not different between coverage models. Seventy-nine percent of intensivists currently working at institutions with in-hospital coverage stated that they would prefer to work in an in-hospital coverage model, compared with 31% of those working in a home coverage model (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Although concerns exist regarding the effect of 24/7 in-hospital coverage on faculty, the majority of pediatric intensivists and critical care trainees responded that in-hospital coverage by intensivists is good for patient care.

However, patients with such findings frequently do not receive appropriate follow-up, partially due to the lack of tools for the management of such findings and the time required to maintain up-to-date lists. Natural language processing (NLP) is capable of extracting information from free-text clinical documents and could provide the basis for software solutions that do not require changes to clinical workflows. OBJECTIVES In this manuscript we present (1) a machine learning algorithm we trained to identify radiology reports documenting the presence of a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma, and (2) the web application and results database we developed to manage these clinical findings. METHODS We manually annotated a training corpus of 4,090 radiology reports from across our institution with a binary label indicating whether or not a report contains a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma. We trained a convolutional neural network to perform this text classification task. Over the NLP backbone we built a web application that allows users to coordinate clinical management of adrenal incidentalomas in real time. RESULTS The annotated dataset included 404 positive (9.9%) and 3,686 (90.1%) negative reports. Our model achieved a sensitivity of 92.9% (95% confidence interval: 80.9-97.5%), a positive predictive value of 83.0% (69.9-91.1)%, a specificity of 97.8% (95.8-98.9)%, and an F1 score of 87.6%. We developed a front-end web application based on the model's output. CONCLUSION Developing an NLP-enabled custom web application for tracking and management of high-risk adrenal incidentalomas is feasible in a resource constrained, safety net hospital. Such applications can be used by an institution's quality department or its primary care providers and can easily be generalized to other types of clinical findings.","Bala, Wasif; Steinkamp, Jackson; Feeney, Timothy; Gupta, Avneesh; Sharma, Abhinav; Kantrowitz, Jake; Cordella, Nicholas; Moses, James; Drake, Frederick Thurston",Applied clinical informatics,592,31

A multi-institutional research consortium was created to evaluate the utility of robotics for gynecologic surgery (benign and malignant). IRB approval was obtained at each institution. A multi-institutional HIPPA compliant database was then created and analyzed for all patients that underwent robotic-assisted surgery with staging for endometrial cancer between the April 2003 and January 2009. In total, 395 patients were identified. A subset of patients between the ages of 80 and 95 years were then identified and analyzed for demographic data and perioperative outcomes. Twenty-seven patients in this age group were identified who underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomy and staging. The median age was 84, and median body mass index was 28. Comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension were identified in 22 and 74% of patients, respectively. Over one-half (56%) of the patients reported a prior abdominal surgery. Final pathological analysis demonstrated that 88% of all patients had either Stage I or II disease. The median operative time was 192 min. The median estimated blood loss was 50 cc, and the median lymph node count was 16. The median hospital stay was 1.0 day. The overall intraoperative and postoperative complication rate was 7.4 and 33%, respectively. No patient received a blood transfusion. There was one conversion to laparotomy (3.7%). A comparison of the outcomes of the elderly cohort to those of all patients in the database (control group) revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, nodal yield, or conversion rate. Intraoperative complications were statistically similar between the groups; however, postoperative complications were significantly higher in the elderly cohort. We conclude that robotic surgery is safe, feasible, and expands surgical options for octogenarians and nonagenarians diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Age should not be considered a contraindication for robotic surgical management of patients with endometrial cancer.","Lowe, M Patrick; Kumar, Saurabh; Johnson, Peter R; Kamelle, Scott A; Chamberlain, Donald H; Tillmanns, Todd D",Journal of robotic surgery,592,1

As this technique is more widely used, it is important to maintain well-established practices of the critical view of safety (CVS) dissection and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC). We present our initial experience with SILC using CVS dissection and routine IOC. STUDY DESIGN Fifty-four patients with biliary colic were offered SILC, which was performed through the umbilicus. CVS with photo documentation was attained before clipping and transecting the cystic structures. IOC was done using various needle puncture techniques. Assessment of CVS was carried out by independent surgeon review of operative still photos or videos using a 3-point grading scale: visualization of only 2 ductal structures entering the gallbladder; a clear triangle of Calot; and separation of the base of the gallbladder from the cystic plate. RESULTS SILC was performed in 54 patients (15 male and 39 female). Six patients required 1 supplementary 3- or 5-mm port. Complete IOC was successful in 50 of 54 patients (92.6%). CVS was achieved at the time of operation in all 54 patients. Photo documentation review confirmed 3 of 3 CVS criteria in 32 (64%) patients, 2 of 3 in 12 patients (24%), 1 of 3 in 3 patients (6%), and 0 in 3 patients (6%). CONCLUSIONS As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes less invasive, proven safe dissection techniques should be maintained. Dissection to obtain the CVS should be the goal of every patient and IOC can be accomplished in a high percentage of patients. This approach places patient safety considerations foremost in the evolution of minimally invasive cholecystectomy.","Rawlings, Arthur; Hodgett, Steven E; Matthews, Brent D; Strasberg, Steven M; Quasebarth, Mary; Brunt, L Michael",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,592,1

Owing to the fact that many tasks do not necessarily require the knowledge and skills of a doctor, interest in using nurses to expand the capacity of the primary care workforce is increasing. Substitution of nurses for doctors is one strategy used to improve access, efficiency, and quality of care. This is the first update of the Cochrane review published in 2005. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to investigate the impact of nurses working as substitutes for primary care doctors on:• patient outcomes;• processes of care; and• utilisation, including volume and cost. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of the Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com), as well as MEDLINE, Ovid, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and EbscoHost (searched 20.01.2015). We searched for grey literature in the Grey Literature Report and OpenGrey (21.02.2017), and we searched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries (21.02.2017). We did a cited reference search for relevant studies (searched 27.01 2015) and checked reference lists of all included studies. We reran slightly revised strategies, limited to publication years between 2015 and 2017, for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL, in March 2017, and we have added one trial to 'Studies awaiting classification'. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials evaluating the outcomes of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. The review is limited to primary healthcare services that provide first contact and ongoing care for patients with all types of health problems, excluding mental health problems. Studies which evaluated nurses supplementing the work of primary care doctors were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessment of risk of bias of included studies. When feasible, we combined study results and determined an overall estimate of the effect. We evaluated other outcomes by completing a structured synthesis. MAIN RESULTS For this review, we identified 18 randomised trials evaluating the impact of nurses working as substitutes for doctors. One study was conducted in a middle-income country, and all other studies in high-income countries. The nursing level was often unclear or varied between and even within studies. The studies looked at nurses involved in first contact care (including urgent care), ongoing care for physical complaints, and follow-up of patients with a particular chronic conditions such as diabetes. In many of the studies, nurses could get additional support or advice from a doctor. Nurse-doctor substitution for preventive services and health education in primary care has been less well studied.Study findings suggest that care delivered by nurses, compared to care delivered by doctors, probably generates similar or better health outcomes for a broad range of patient conditions (low- or moderate-certainty evidence):• Nurse-led primary care may lead to slightly fewer deaths among certain groups of patients, compared to doctor-led care. However, the results vary and it is possible that nurse-led primary care makes little or no difference to the number of deaths (low-certainty evidence).• Blood pressure outcomes are probably slightly improved in nurse-led primary care. Other clinical or health status outcomes are probably similar (moderate-certainty evidence).• Patient satisfaction is probably slightly higher in nurse-led primary care (moderate-certainty evidence). Quality of life may be slightly higher (low-certainty evidence).We are uncertain of the effects of nurse-led care on process of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low.The effect of nurse-led care on utilisation of care is mixed and depends on the type of outcome. Consultations are probably longer in nurse-led primary care (moderate-certainty evidence), and numbers of attended return visits are slightly higher for nurses than for doctors (high-certainty evidence). We found little or no difference between nurses and doctors in the number of prescriptions and attendance at accident and emergency units (high-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in the number of tests and investigations, hospital referrals and hospital admissions between nurses and doctors (low-certainty evidence).We are uncertain of the effects of nurse-led care on the costs of care because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review shows that for some ongoing and urgent physical complaints and for chronic conditions, trained nurses, such as nurse practitioners, practice nurses, and registered nurses, probably provide equal or possibly even better quality of care compared to primary care doctors, and probably achieve equal or better health outcomes for patients. Nurses probably achieve higher levels of patient satisfaction, compared to primary care doctors. Furthermore, consultation length is probably longer when nurses deliver care and the frequency of attended return visits is probably slightly higher for nurses, compared to doctors. Other utilisation outcomes are probably the same. The effects of nurse-led care on process of care and the costs of care are uncertain, and we also cannot ascertain what level of nursing education leads to the best outcomes when nurses are substituted for doctors.","Laurant, Miranda; van der Biezen, Mieke; Wijers, Nancy; Watananirun, Kanokwaroon; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; van Vught, Anneke Jah",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,592,1

This study investigated (1) patterns of volunteering among older adults in Hong Kong during COVID-19; (2) associations between volunteering and mental health of older adults during COVID-19; and (3) associations between key psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem) and volunteering among older adults during COVID-19. This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19. Our study suggested that encouraging older adults to volunteer during the pandemic is a key pathway to maintain mental health. Social workers are encouraged to engage older adults in volunteerism regularly to offset the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms in times of crisis.","Chan, Wai; Chui, Cheryl Hiu Kwan; Cheung, Johnson Chun Sing; Lum, Terry Yat Sang; Lu, Shiyu",Journal of gerontological social work,592,9

While computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are mainstays in preoperative evaluation of bony invasion and soft tissue extension of the lesion, their imaging characteristics by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is less well characterized. OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical presentation and management of a PET positive sinonasal lesion. To conduct a literature review of FDG uptake in benign sinonasal papillomas. METHODS Case report (n = 1) and literature review of similar cases (n = 32). RESULTS We report the case of a 69-year-old man presenting with an isolated left maxillary sinus mass with avid FDG uptake, discovered on PET/CT imaging. An endoscopic left maxillary mega-antrostomy provided successful definitive treatment for final pathologic diagnosis of oncocytic papilloma. Literature review of cases of sinonasal papillomas with avid FDG uptake found that oncocytic papillomas, on average, exhibit greater uptake than inverted papillomas and both may be mistaken as malignancies on PET. CONCLUSION While PET imaging demonstrating avid FDG uptake is associated with an increased risk of malignancy, it does not rule out the possibility of a benign sinonasal papilloma nor other benign inflammatory lesions. Particularly, oncocytic papillomas may have very high FDG uptake and mimic malignant lesions.","Shafqat, Iram; Ho, Allen S; Manzoor, Daniel; Balzer, Bonnie; Wu, Arthur W","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",592,1

Herein, by using a high-pressure nitrogen-extraction (HPNE) strategy to assist crystallization, a wide processing window in the well-controlled printing process for preparing high-quality perovskites is achieved. The yellow-phase perovskite generated by the HPNE acts as a crucial intermediate phase to produce large-area high-quality perovskite film. Furthermore, an ionic liquid is developed to passivate the perovskite surface to reduce surface defect density and to suppress carrier recombination, resulting in significantly increased efficiency to 22.7%, the highest for large-area fabrication.

It is somewhat controversial whether wearing SM during exercise affects performance and health status and/or may influence the results. In order to give an answer we planned a prospective, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effects of wearing a SM or no-SM in 33 (17 male) physically active helthy subjects during a graded exercise cycle ergometry test. METHODS The two tests were performed in random order in the same subjects. The participants were all tested the same day, after a recovery time of at least of one hour, in order to avoid interferences on physical performances. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate and arterial blood pressure were assessed throughout the exercise tests every step of two minutes, at the end of exercise, performed at the same time with and without mask. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Wearing SM had no effect on performance, since the duration of cycle ergometry test with SM and without SM median, respectively, was 14.2, [lower-upper quartile 13.9-14.8] versus 14.3 [13.9-15.5] minutes, p=0.094, and median peak power was 150 W [150-180] versus 150 W [120-180] p=0.754. When expressed relative to peak exercise performance, no differences were found between wearing or not wearing SM regarding arterial oxygen saturation, or heart rate at any time during the exercise tests. Wearing SM during vigorous exercise had no detrimental effect on cardiovascular parameters, as well as on exercise metrics in all participants. No ventricular repolarization abnormalities and no arrhythmias were reported on the electrocardiograms.","Pasqualetto, M Cristina; Tuttolomondo, Domenico; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Baratella, M Cristina; Casolino, Pietro; Stefani, Maria; Reato, Stefania; Tattan, Elisa; Sorbo, Maria D; Bigon, Lucio; Giada, Franco; Nizzetto, Manuele; Ferrara, Chiara; Galiotto, Alessandra; Scevola, Moreno; Rigo, Fausto",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,592,31

A scenario is ripe for craniofacial injuries. Annually, over 1 million Americans, with many more abroad participate in organized hockey. This number continues to grow at youth, amateur and professional levels. Following the characterization of groups with the highest incidence of hockey-related craniofacial injuries, our goal is to propose guidelines for the acute management of hockey-related craniofacial injuries in amateur settings. METHODS This study follows a 10-year retrospective cohort design, examining hockey-related craniofacial injury data derived from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database. Within the NEISS data, patients were stratified by age, gender, and ethnicity to allow for analysis and comparison between groups. RESULTS Sample data consisted of 2,544 hockey-related craniofacial injuries treated in US emergency departments between 2010 and 2019. Majority of the injuries included in this analysis involved patients within the 12-18-year-old age group (53.8%). Of the diagnoses, concussion was the most frequent hockey-related craniofacial injury (39.9%). Dental injuries represented the least (1%). In the 12 to 18 age group, the diagnoses concussion, fracture, and laceration differed significantly from the null hypothesis of equality of proportions across all injury types (P < 0.05). Similarly, within the 19 to 34 age group, the diagnoses of concussion, fracture, laceration, and internal injury differed significantly from the null hypothesis of assumed equality of proportion (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS High incidence of hockey-related craniofacial injury among patients 12 to 18 years of age signals a need for continued interventions targeted towards this age group. Increased sideline personnel training and education, as well as promoting a stricter adherence to established guidelines are integral parts of a greater strategy towards reducing injury incidence. Working towards reducing injuries and making participation in hockey safer, should be a goal as the sport continues to experience a historic rise in interest and participation.","Pierrot, Randall G; Weber, Lee E; Wolfe, Erin M; Slavin, Benjamin R; Eidelson, Sarah A; Plotsker, Ethan; Mathew, Prakash J; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,592,9

METHODS Patients diagnosed with MDD according to DSM-IV-TR criteria who had inadequate response to antidepressant treatment continued treatment with their current antidepressant for 2 weeks. Patients still having inadequate response, and with irritability, received 6 weeks of open-label treatment with their current antidepressant at the same dose and adjunctive brexpiprazole (target dose: 3 mg/d). Brexpiprazole was discontinued at week 6, and the patients continued with their antidepressant until week 10. Changes from baseline to week 6 and week 6 to week 10 were analyzed. RESULTS This study was conducted between October 7, 2013, and July 30, 2014. Fifty-four patients were treated with adjunctive brexpiprazole. At week 6, clinically relevant improvements were observed in Sheehan Irritability Scale total (-21.1) and item 1 (irritable mood) (-3.5) scores, Kellner Symptom Questionnaire total (-24.4) and anger-hostility subscale (-7.7) scores, and 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, clinician version (IDS-C₃₀), item 6 (irritable mood) score (-1.2). More (15 patients) stopped than developed (5 patients) anger attacks during treatment, as measured by the Anger Attacks Questionnaire. The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness score improved (-1.4), as did the depressive symptoms (IDS-C₃₀ total score, -17.8; Kellner Symptom Questionnaire depression subscale score, -7.7; and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score, -14.2). Irritability symptoms worsened after brexpiprazole discontinuation, assessed at week 10. Adjunctive brexpiprazole was well tolerated.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends integration across levels and building-blocks of health systems as a prerequisite of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). While health systems of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often fragmented and led by siloed service delivery structure, several LMICs-including India-have attempted health system integration. Several systematic reviews of evidence on healthcare integration from developed countries exist, but no synthesis from LMICs was reported to date. This review will overview the existing evidence of primary-secondary care integration (PSI) in the context of LMICs, aiming to support policy decisions for the effective integration of health delivery systems in India. METHODS The review will be conducted following the six steps recommend by Arksey and O'Malley. Scientific and grey literature will be systematically selected from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, and electronic repositories (such as WHO, World Bank, Health Policy Plus, and OpenGrey).

To date, little is known about the characteristics of pulmonary auscultation in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to explore the features and clinical significance of pulmonary auscultation in COVID-19 pneumonia using an electronic stethoscope in isolation wards. METHODS This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Red-Cross Hospital during the period from January 27, 2020, to February 12, 2020. Standard auscultation with an electronic stethoscope was performed and electronic recordings of breath sounds were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients with average age of 60.6 years were enrolled. The most common symptoms were cough (73.7%) during auscultation. Most cases had bilateral lesions (96.4%) such as multiple ground-glass opacities (69.1%) and fibrous stripes (21.8%). High-quality auscultation recordings (98.8%) were obtained, and coarse breath sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, fine crackles, and Velcro crackles were identified. Most cases had normal breath sounds in upper lungs, but the proportions of abnormal breath sounds increased in the basal fields where Velcro crackles were more commonly identified at the posterior chest. The presence of fine and coarse crackles detected 33/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 12.5%) and 8/9 patients with consolidation (sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 15.2%), while the presence of Velcro crackles identified 16/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 41% and specificity 81.3%). CONCLUSIONS The abnormal breath sounds in COVID-19 pneumonia had some consistent distributive characteristics and to some extent correlated with the radiologic features. Such evidence suggests that electronic auscultation is useful to aid diagnosis and timely management of the disease. Further studies are indicated to validate the accuracy and potential clinical benefit of auscultation in detecting pulmonary abnormalities in COVID-19 infection.","Wang, Bo; Liu, Yanbin; Wang, Ye; Yin, Wanhong; Liu, Tao; Liu, Dan; Li, Diandian; Feng, Mei; Zhang, Yanlin; Liang, Zong'an; Fu, Ziqiao; Fu, Siyun; Li, Weimin; Xiong, Nian; Wang, Gang; Luo, Fengming",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,592,23

Following implementing improvement measures including strategies targeting the accompanying person, mitigation workflow failure rates decreased from 42 to 13 items, the pass rate for the maximum body temperature cutoff increased from 53.1% to 90.8%, and the compliance rate of hand washing increased from 89.5% to 100%. CONCLUSION The HFMEA model can effectively implement preventive risk assessment and workflow management of high-risk medical procedures. The model can adjudicate the health of hospital visitors during the epidemic/pandemic, provide epidemic/pandemic education training and preventive measure health education guidance for hospital visits, and improve their epidemic prevention cognition. When combined, these strategies can prevent nosocomial infection to achieve the best anti-epidemic effect.","Tiao, Chi-Hui; Tsai, Ling-Chin; Chen, Li-Chin; Liao, Yu-Mei; Sun, Li-Chen",Quality management in health care,592,20

Therefore, the study of human-virus PPIs can help us understand the principles of human-virus relationships and can thus guide the development of highly effective drugs to break the transmission of viral infectious diseases. Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of experimentally identified human-virus PPI data, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for bioinformatics studies revolving around human-virus PPIs. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of computational studies on human-virus PPIs, especially focusing on the method development for human-virus PPI predictions. We briefly introduce the experimental detection methods and existing database resources of human-virus PPIs, and then discuss the research progress in the development of computational prediction methods. In particular, we elaborate the machine learning-based prediction methods and highlight the need to embrace state-of-the-art deep-learning algorithms and new feature engineering techniques (e.g. the protein embedding technique derived from natural language processing). To further advance the understanding in this research topic, we also outline the practical applications of the human-virus interactome in fundamental biological discovery and new antiviral therapy development.","Lian, Xianyi; Yang, Xiaodi; Yang, Shiping; Zhang, Ziding",Briefings in bioinformatics,592,20

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of IRIS in HIV-infected Koreans initiating ART, and whether integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) treatment increases the risk of IRIS. METHODS This retrospective analysis included adults living with HIV, seen at four university-affiliated hospitals in South Korea, who were naïve to ART and had a CD4 T-cell count < 200 cells/μL between January 2004 and May 2019. IRIS was determined through a medical record review within 6 months of ART initiation. Propensity score-matched case-control study between the non-INSTI and INSTI groups was performed. RESULTS The study included 501 patients; 192 were assigned to the INSTI group, who started ART based on INSTIs as the initial treatment. There were opportunistic infections (OIs) in 253 (50.5%) cases before ART initiation. The three most common OIs were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, candidiasis and tuberculosis (TB). We identified 47 cases of IRIS; TB-IRIS was the most common type. The incidence of IRIS within 6 months of ART initiation was 9.4%, and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and incidence of IRIS between the matched groups. The risk factors for IRIS were pre-ART CD4 T-cell count (< 30 cells/μL), higher pre-ART viral load (≥ 75 000 copies/mL), and TB-OI. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of IRIS was 9.4% in Korean HIV patients. The INSTI regimen was not related to IRIS occurrence.","Kim, J; Nam, H-J; Kang, S-J; Jung, S-I; Hwang, C H; Kim, Y-S; Chang, H-H; Kim, S-W; Park, K-Hwa",HIV medicine,592,7

Much of the debate in previous studies concentrated on whether information outside attentional focus could be consciously experienced and reportable. This study sought to address the debate from a new perspective, through testing whether fully attended supraliminal information is necessarily reportable with a variation of attribute amnesia. Participants were asked to judge the parity of a single number or whether a Chinese character referred to furniture. After several trials, they were unexpectedly asked to report the stimulus identity. The results consistently showed that participants could not correctly report the identity, indicating that fully attended information that was consciously perceived could sometimes overflow report. In addition to providing novel overflow evidence, these findings also have crucial implications in understanding the relationship between consciousness and working memory.","Wang, Rui; Fu, Yingtao; Chen, Luo; Chen, Yutong; Zhou, Jifan; Chen, Hui",Consciousness and cognition,592,33

Viral pneumonias appear similar in presentation and severity of illness to bacterial causes of pulmonary infection. Clinical criteria do not reliably allow the differentiation of viral from bacterial causes in pneumonia.

METHODS We recruited 37 patients with primary progressive MS and 21 healthy controls for an observational cohort study. Structural connectomes were reconstructed based on diffusion-weighted imaging data using probabilistic tractography and analyzed with graph theory. RESULTS We observed the same topological organization of brain networks in patients and controls. Consistent with the originally defined rich-club regions, we identified superior frontal, precuneus, superior parietal, and insular cortex in both hemispheres as rich-club nodes. Connectivity within the rich club was significantly reduced in patients with MS (p = 0.039). The extent of reduced rich-club connectivity correlated with clinical measurements of mobility (Kendall rank correlation coefficient τ = -0.20, p = 0.047), hand function (τ = -0.26, p = 0.014), and information processing speed (τ = -0.20, p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS In patients with primary progressive MS, the fundamental organization of the structural connectome in rich-club and peripheral nodes was preserved and did not differ from healthy controls. The proportion of rich-club connections was altered and correlated with disability measures. Thus, the rich-club organization of the brain may be a promising network phenotype for understanding the patterns and mechanisms of neurodegeneration in MS.","Stellmann, Jan-Patrick; Hodecker, Sibylle; Cheng, Bastian; Wanke, Nadine; Young, Kim Lea; Hilgetag, Claus; Gerloff, Christian; Heesen, Christoph; Thomalla, Götz; Siemonsen, Susanne",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,592,8

The advantages of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies' quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients' characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. METHODS A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. RESULTS 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent VR (28%), AR (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. CONCLUSION The heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it. Future studies need to develop specific and objective methods to evaluate the clinical quality of new technologies and definitively demonstrate advantages of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation compared to face-to face orthopedic rehabilitation.","Berton, Alessandra; Longo, Umile Giuseppe; Candela, Vincenzo; Fioravanti, Sara; Giannone, Lucia; Arcangeli, Valeria; Alciati, Viviana; Berton, Claudia; Facchinetti, Gabriella; Marchetti, Anna; Schena, Emiliano; De Marinis, Maria Grazia; Denaro, Vincenzo",Journal of clinical medicine,592,20

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is summarization of the current evidence for accuracy of ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter in detecting intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients. DATA SOURCES Medical subject heading terms were used to search MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for relevant citations. Publications from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2019, were included in the search strategy. STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they involved patients less than 18 years, where ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter was compared to conventional, nonophthalmic tests for intracranial hypertension. Studies were excluded if there was insufficient data to compute a sensitivity/specificity table. Case reports, case series, and manuscripts not published in English were also excluded. DATA EXTRACTION The initial search returned 573 citations. Of these, 57 were selected for review. DATA SYNTHESIS Eleven citations were included in the final meta-analysis. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was performed, which revealed a pooled sensitivity for ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter of 93% (95% CI, 74-99%), a specificity of 74% (95% CI, 52-88%), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 39.00 (95% CI, 4.16-365.32). The area under the curve of the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Subgroup analyses of the test's performance evaluating new-onset intracranial hypertension and in comparison to invasively measured intracranial pressure were performed. The test performance in these instances was similar to findings in the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS We are unable to identify a threshold value in ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter for the determination of intracranial hypertension in children. Even though the ultrasound measured optic nerve sheath diameter measurement is highly sensitive to the presence of increased intracranial pressure, the test has only moderate specificity. Therefore, other confirmatory methods and further investigation is necessary in the clinical care of children. The technique is likely not sufficiently precise for clinical use in the absence of other confirmatory methods, and further investigation is necessary to determine clinical protocols for its use in children.","Bhargava, Vidit; Tawfik, Daniel; Tan, Yuan Jin; Dunbar, Trevor; Haileselassie, Bereketeab; Su, Erik",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,592,10

Once in contact with the skin, the pen is a potential source of bacterial transmission and subsequent infections after ACLR. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this study was to assess whether the skin marking pen is a fomite for contamination during arthroscopic ACLR. We hypothesized that there would be a difference in the rate of culture-positive pens between control pens and the study pens used to delineate the proposed skin incision. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Twenty surgical marking pens were collected prospectively from patients undergoing ACLR over a 12-month period. All patients underwent standard preoperative sterile preparation and draping procedures. Proposed incisions were marked with a new sterile pen, and the pen tip was immediately sent for a 5-day inoculation in broth and agar. Negative controls (unopened new pen) and positive controls (used to mark the skin incisions preoperatively) were also cultured. Additionally, blank culture dishes were observed during the growth process. All pens were removed from the surgical field before incision, and new marking pens were used when needed during the procedure. Results Three of the 20 study pens (15%) demonstrated positive growth. All 3 pens grew species of Staphylococcus. None of the negative controls demonstrated growth, 6 of the 12 positive controls showed growth, and none of the blank dishes exhibited growth. Conclusion This study found a 15% rate of surgical marking pen contamination by Staphylococcus during ACLR. It is recommended that the skin marking pen not be used for any further steps of the surgical case and be discarded once used. Clinical Relevance Infections after ACLR are rare but may result in significant morbidity, and all measures to reduce them should be pursued. Surgeons performing ACLR should dispose of the surgical marking pen after skin marking and before intraoperative use such as graft markup.","Ridley, Taylor J; Rud, Christopher T; Krych, Aaron J; Macalena, Jeffrey A",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,592,31

The researches about the shielding properties of activated carbon atoms for gamma-rays are very rare and required to be improved. Since the use of radioactive sources in different fields (nuclear industry, shielding material, radiation biophysics and space research application, etc.) has been increasing expeditiously, the photon interactions with matter has gained more importance in the world of material science technology. In this article, we review the basics of the impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2), as well as the link between the structural behaviors and the gamma shielding properties in terms of both quality and efficiency. Both XCom software and EGSnrc simulation code were used to obtain the theoretical calculations that are significantly important to be able to understand the shielding properties of impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2) for gamma-rays. At the end, the mass attenuation coefficients (μm), the total atomic and the electronic cross-sections (σt,a and σt,e), the effective atomic number and the effective electron density (Zeff and Neff), the half value layer (HVL), the tenth value layer (TVL), and the mean free path (MFP) values of such materials were calculated and then compared with those of some other known shielding materials like lead, borosilicate, concrete and vermiculite.

We evaluated the effects of new strategies and aimed to share our results and experience with other NICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using prospectively collected hospital databases, we retrospectively compared the demographic and clinical data of neonates, rates of breastfeeding at discharge, nosocomial infection and parental satisfaction one month before (open group) and after (closed group) the implementation of alternative FCC management strategies when family visit was suspended during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized a multidisciplinary task force and adopted strategies of triage and screening, management of suspected infants, and breastfeeding promotion with effective communication. The nosocomial infection rate and parental satisfaction for open and closed groups (144 and 108 term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, respectively) were not different (1% vs. 0%, p = 1.00; 98.6 vs. 98.8, p = .80; respectively). Breastfeeding rate at discharge decreased but the difference was not significant (74% vs. 80%, p = .29). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, in term and near-term neonates with brief hospitalization, the alternative FCC strategies maintained high parental satisfaction without increased nosocomial infection rate, but strong support for breastfeeding was needed.

No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Usual palliative treatment includes maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough. The clinical severity and extent of transmission need to be determined, and therapeutic options need to be developed and optimized. METHODS The present review discusses the recent repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS Several compounds, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon-β, ribavirin, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and ivermectin, have emerged as promising alternatives. They block the virus from entering host cells, prevent viral replication, and attenuate exacerbation of the host's immune response. CONCLUSION Although some evidence indicates the positive actions of different classes of compounds for the treatment of COVID-19, few clinical assays have been established to definitively demonstrate their therapeutic value in humans. Multicenter clinical studies are urgently needed to validate and standardize therapeutic regimens that involve these agents.

This small subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) results from the incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. Production of the sfRNA is important for the pathogenicity of the virus. This study not only presents a detailed description of the yellow fever virus (YFV) sfRNA but, more importantly, describes for the first time the molecular characteristics of the stalling site for XRN1 in the flavivirus genome. Similar to the case for West Nile virus, the YFV sfRNA was produced by XRN1. However, in contrast to the case for other arthropod-borne flaviviruses, not one but two sfRNAs were detected in YFV-infected mammalian cells. The smaller of these two sfRNAs was not observed in infected mosquito cells. The larger sfRNA could also be produced in vitro by incubation with purified XRN1. These two YFV sfRNAs formed a 5'-nested set. The 5' ends of the YFV sfRNAs were found to be just upstream of the previously predicted RNA pseudoknot PSK3. RNA structure probing and mutagenesis studies provided strong evidence that this pseudoknot structure was formed and served as the molecular signal to stall XRN1. The sequence involved in PSK3 formation was cloned into the Sinrep5 expression vector and shown to direct the production of an sfRNA-like RNA.

The 8F high-resolution manometry (HRM) catheter (ManoScan™ ESO, Covidien) has advantages of fast response times and the ability to measure urethral pressures along the urethral length without withdrawal. Our objective was to determine static and dynamic maximum urethral closure pressures (MUCPs) and resting functional urethral length (FUL) in women using HRM before and after transurethral bulking and compare results to other women who underwent midurethral sling (MUS). METHODS We recorded rest, cough, and strain MUCPs and FUL in 24 women before and after transurethral bulking with polydimethylsiloxane (Macroplastique®) using the HRM catheter and compared these changes to HRM values from 26 women who had the same measures before and after MUS. RESULTS At rest, MUCPs increased minimally after both urethral bulking and MUS (3 vs 0.4 cm H2 O respectively, P = 0.4). Under dynamic conditions there were statistically insignificant small increases in MUCP and these increases were markedly less than after MUS (cough: 1.5 vs 63.8 cm H2 O, P < 0.001 and strain: 11.5 vs 57.7 cm H2 O, P < 0.001). FUL increased by 0.5 cm after transurethral bulking (P = 0.003), and decreased by 0.25 cm after MUS placement (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS The mechanism of continence after urethral bulking differs from MUS. While MUS increases dynamic MUCP, bulking may rely on increasing the length of the continence zone.","Wasenda, Erika J; Kirby, Anna C; Lukacz, Emily S; Nager, Charles W",Neurourology and urodynamics,592,19

In contrast, the impact on research has been variable. To classify the pandemic-related effect on research, the development of the number of scientific publications of the German ORL university hospitals before and during the pandemic was analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS The publication performance between 2015 and 2020 of the 39 current chairmen was surveyed using a literature search (Pubmed). All entries relating to the chairmen of the university hospital as first, last or co-author were included. The absolute and relative development of each author's publication performance was determined and evaluated using nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS A total of 2420 publications could be documented. From 2015 to 2019, an average of 368 publications were published per year. In 2020, this number increased by 57.9 % to 581 publications. While the number of monthly publications remained constant between 2015 and 2019, a significant increase was seen from May 2020 up to a maximum of 74 publications in September 2020. In 2020, 34 articles (5.9 %) had a thematic relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with 7 of these papers (20.6 %) resulting from cross-site publications. CONCLUSION In 2020, the number of scientific publications was raised to more than 1.5 times the usual annual publications. This increase was clearly related in time to the reduction of elective patient care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic starting in mid-March 2020. Probably, free time capacities enabled this increased publication output. Our results confirm the great scientific potential of the ORL university hospitals, which has been successfully implemented despite the pandemic.","Guderian, D; Leinung, M; Weiss, R; Diensthuber, M; Stöver, T; Loth, A",Laryngo- rhino- otologie,592,27

Our goal was to determine the frequency of hypopneic hypoventilation and its association with hypoxia in children undergoing sedation with ketamine. METHODS Children who received intravenous ketamine with or without midazolam for sedation in a pediatric emergency department were prospectively enrolled. Heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET(CO2)) levels were recorded every 30 seconds. RESULTS Fifty-eight subjects were included in this study. Fifty percent of subjects had recorded ET(CO2) values less than 30 mm Hg without a rise in respiratory rate. Twenty-eight percent of subjects experienced a decrease in pulse oximetry less than 95%. Patients who experienced a persistent decrease in ET(CO2) at least 30 seconds in length were much more likely to have a persistent decrease in pulse oximetry than those with normal or transient decreases in ET(CO2) (relative risk, 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-30.5). Decreases in ET(CO2) occurred on an average of 3.7 minutes before decreases in pulse oximetry. CONCLUSIONS Hypopneic hypoventilation as detected by capnography is common in children undergoing sedation with ketamine with or without midazolam. Hypoxia is frequently preceded by low ET(CO2) levels. Further studies are needed to determine if the addition of routine monitoring with capnography can reduce the frequency of hypoxia in children undergoing sedation.","Langhan, Melissa L; Chen, Lei; Marshall, Clement; Santucci, Karen A",Pediatric emergency care,592,1

DESIGN Study 1 was a population-based, longitudinal study using nationally representative data from 29 provinces in mainland China. The baseline sample (N = 3233) was obtained from February 1 to 9, 2020. Follow-up (N = 1380) took place during March 17 to 24, 2020. Study 2 was a machine learning-based sentiment analysis in which data were captured from Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website, among the most popular official, unofficial, and health-related media accounts. The screened blogs from November to December 2019 and February to March 2020 were scored by Google APIs for positivity and magnitude. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Physician-patient trust. RESULTS Study 1 showed fear and anxiety affected changes in physician-patient trust through media usage, the indirect effect of which was 0.14 (0.03) and the 95% CI was [0.08, 0.19]. Study 2 indicated a more positive image of physicians after the outbreak compared to before [F (2, 3537) = 3.646, p = 0.026, partial η2=0.002]. CONCLUSION The negative impact of anxiety and fear on physician-patient trust was mediated by media use, which can be explained by the more positive media image during the pandemic.","Chen, Yidi; Wu, Jianhui; Ma, Jinjin; Zhu, Huanya; Li, Wenju; Gan, Yiqun",Psychology & health,592,1

We elucidated the association between pet sensitization and pet ownership by age. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 2883 patients who visited our allergy clinic for nasal symptoms from January 2003 to December 2014; 1957 patients with data on skin-prick tests and questionnaire responses were included, and divided into adult (age>19) and children (≤19) groups; the association between pet sensitization and pet ownership was evaluated in both groups. Results Among the children, dog and cat sensitization showed no association with dog and cat ownership, respectively. Dog sensitization was significantly associated with dog ownership [odds ratio (OR)=3.283, p<0.001], and cat sensitization with cat ownership (OR=13.732, p<0.001) in the adult group. After adjustment for age, sex, familial history of allergy, sinusitis, diabetes mellitus, other pet ownership, and non-pet sensitization, the association was significant in dog sensitization with dog ownership [adjusted OR (aOR)=3.881, p<0.001], and cat sensitization with cat ownership (aOR=10.804, p<0.001) among adults. Dog ownership did not show any association with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis, whereas atopic dermatitis had a significant association with cat ownership in adults (aOR = 4.840, p<0.001). Conclusion Pet ownership in adulthood increases risk of pet sensitization. However, pet ownership was not associated with prevalence of atopic disorders, regardless of age, except for atopic dermatitis and cat ownership in adults.","Won, Jun Yeon; Kwon, Jea-Woo; Hong, Seung-No; Lee, Woo Hyun",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,592,20

This systematic review critically appraised, compared and summarised the measurement properties of lymphoedema-specific self-reported questionnaires (SRQs) measuring various patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (QOL), function, morbidity, and symptoms. METHODS Seven databases were searched to identify studies of the measurement properties of SRQs. Two review teams independently evaluated the quality of the individual studies using the risk of bias tool from the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN). Measurement properties of the SRQs presented in the studies were then rated. Study level ratings were summarised for an SRQ if they were reported in multiple studies, and their overall quality of the evidence were then graded. RESULTS Forty articles, reporting on 19 SRQs were identified from 8615 records. The focus of the 19 SRQs included eight on QOL, four on symptoms, two on function, and two on impairment. The other three SRQs were on illness perception, self-efficacy, and patient-relevant treatment benefit, respectively. Eight and three SRQs were upper limb and lower limb-specific, respectively, whereas seven questionnaires were for both upper and lower limb lymphoedema. One SRQ was developed for head and neck lymphoedema. According to the COSMIN framework, none of the SRQs reviewed had sufficient evidence to support all nine measurement properties. In lower limb questionnaires, the LYMQOL-leg has sufficient content, structural, and construct validity as well as internal consistency and reliability. For upper limb lymphoedema questionnaires, the Lymph-ICF-UL had sufficient content and construct validity as well as reliability. CONCLUSION LYMQOL-leg SRQ is recommended with confidence for evaluation of QOL of people with lower limb lymphoedema while the Lymph-ICF-UL is recommended for evaluation of the QOL of the breast cancer-related lymphoedema with some confidence. In view of the high level of the indeterminate ratings of the measurement properties of the existing SRQs, further research is desirable.","Paramanandam, Vincent Singh; Lee, Mi-Joung; Kilbreath, Sharon L; Dylke, Elizabeth S",Acta oncologica,592,17

To achieve that, microfabricated Cu electrodes on a printed circuit board modified with the conducting polymer poly(3-octylthiophene) (POT) have been employed as a substrate. This polymer was introduced to enhance the stability of the potential drift (0.9 mV/h) and improve the limit of detection (0.126 nmol mL-1). Nernstian potentiometric response was achieved for DZP over the concentration range 1.0 × 10-2 to 5.0 × 10-7 mol L-1 with a slope of 55.0 ± 0.4 mV/decade and E0 ~ 478.9 ± 0.9. Intrinsic merits of the proposed sensor include rapid response time (11 ± 2 s) and long life time (3 months). In order to enhance the selectivity of the potentiometric sensor towards the target drug and minimize any false positive results, calix[4]arene (CX4) was impregnated as an ionophore within the PVC plastic ion-sensing membrane. The performance of the POC sensors was assessed using electrochemical methods of analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as a surface characterization tool. The studied sensors were applied to the potentiometric determination of DZP in different biological fluids (plasma, urine, saliva, and human milk) in the presence of its metabolite with an average recovery of 100.9 ± 1.3%, 99.4 ± 1.0%, 101.8 ± 1.2%, and 99.0 ± 2.0%, respectively.

Traditionally, the various models and methods in this area use a continuous formulation, resting upon the solid foundation of functional analysis. In this work, we examine a discrete formulation of dense flow visualization. From probability theory, we derive a similarity matrix that measures the similarity between different points in the flow domain, leading to the discovery of a whole new class of visualization models. Using this matrix, we propose a novel visualization approach consisting of the computation of spectral embeddings, i.e., characteristic domain maps, defined by particle mixture probabilities. These embeddings are scalar fields that give insight into the mixing processes of the flow on different scales. The approach of spectral embeddings is already well studied in image segmentation, and we see that spectral embeddings are connected to Fourier expansions and frequencies. We showcase the utility of our method using different 2D and 3D flows.","Preuss, Daniel; Weinkauf, Tino; Kruger, Jens Harald",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,592,16

In response, many organizations have spoken out and called to cancel all elective surgical procedures. OBJECTIVE Our study aimed to provide clear recommendations for plastic surgeons to follow by addressing the following issues: 1) What defines elective surgery, and where does one draw the line between essential versus nonessential services? 2) How does this differ in the hospital versus private practice setting? 3) If called upon to operate on a patient with COVID-19, how do plastic surgeons protect themselves, while still providing excellent medical care? METHODS A PRISMA systematic review of the literature on plastic surgery in the setting of a pandemic was performed on March 19, 2020. An ethical analysis was conducted using the four principles of medical ethics. RESULTS The initial search yielded 118 articles. Eighteen articles were relevant and included for analysis. Only one editorial article was published in a plastic surgery journal. Accordingly, no peer-reviewed published COVID-19 guidelines exist for plastic surgery. Given that this pandemic may place healthcare systems under undue stress with an unpredictable trajectory, it is the responsibility of the plastic surgeon to assess and postpone cases whenever possible to properly contribute to adequate resource allocation and patient safety measures. CONCLUSION This article fills an important gap in the literature by addressing COVID19 and providing guidelines for upholding ethics and responsible resource allocation. By upholding these standards, plastic surgeons can do their part to help minimize the spread of this virus.","Dorfman, Robert; Saadat, Sean; Gupta, Nisha; Roostaeian, Jason; Da Lio, Andrew",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,592,7

In this study, determination and discrimination of hand sanitisers was carried out by employing attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. Fifty commercially available hand sanitisers were obtained from the market and analysed. ATR-FTIR profiles of each sanitiser were compared and decomposed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Physical observation enabled the discrimination of seven samples based on their respective colours, the presence of beads and their colours, and the physical forms of formulations. Subsequently, eight distinct patterns were observed through visual comparison of ATR-FTIR profiles of the remaining 43 samples. An initial unsupervised exploratory PCA model indicated the separation of two main groups with ATR-FTIR profiles similar to those of ethanol and isopropanol, respectively. The PCA score-LDA model provided good predictions, with a 100% correct classification into eight different groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a quick determination and discrimination of hand sanitiser samples, allowing screening for any restricted components and sample-to-sample comparison.","Teoh, Way Koon; Md Muslim, Noor Zuhartini; Ismail, Md Lukmi; Chang, Kah Haw; Abdullah, Ahmad Fahmi Lim",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,592,28

Here, an artificial Saccharomyces cerevisiae × Saccharomyces eubayanus tetraploid interspecies hybrid was created by rare mating, and its ability to sporulate and produce viable gametes was exploited to generate phenotypic diversity. Four spore clones obtained from a single ascus were isolated, and their brewing-relevant phenotypes were assessed. These F1 spore clones were found to differ with respect to fermentation performance under lager brewing conditions (15 °C, 15 °Plato), production of volatile aroma compounds, flocculation potential and temperature tolerance. One spore clone, selected for its rapid fermentation and acetate ester production was sporulated to produce an F2 generation, again comprised of four spore clones from a single ascus. Again, phenotypic diversity was introduced. In two of these F2 clones, the fermentation performance was maintained and acetate ester production was improved relative to the F1 parent and the original hybrid strain. Strains also performed well in comparison to a commercial lager yeast strain. Spore clones varied in ploidy and chromosome copy numbers, and faster wort fermentation was observed in strains with a higher ploidy. An F2 spore clone was also subjected to 10 consecutive wort fermentations, and single cells were isolated from the resulting yeast slurry. These isolates also exhibited variable fermentation performance and chromosome copy numbers, highlighting the instability of polyploid interspecific hybrids. These results demonstrate the value of this natural approach to increase the phenotypic diversity of lager brewing yeast strains. Contribution to the field Lager beer fermentations have traditionally been carried out with natural S. cerevisiae × S. eubayanus hybrids. These strains possess both the ability to tolerate low temperatures and the ability to utilize efficiently wort sugars. However, being closely related, strains within the group exhibit limited phenotypic variability. Since the recent discovery of wild strains of S. eubayanus, it has been possible to generate lager yeast hybrids artificially, thereby increasing the genetic and phenotypic diversity of lager brewing strains. Here, to demonstrate the potential for further increased diversity, a constructed tetraploid hybrid was sporulated and spore clones derived from a single ascus were evaluated with respect to fermentation performance (sugar utilization, stress tolerance and volatile aroma synthesis). Meiosis introduced variability in a number of key parameters. One fertile spore clone from this F1 generation was sporulated to introduce further diversity and to demonstrate the potential of clone selection in steering phenotypes in a desirable direction. Genome instability of hybrids was observed, but this can be exploited to further increase diversity. This was demonstrated by assessing performance of variants isolated after ten consecutive rounds of fermentation. The approach allows for the introduction of phenotypic diversity without the need for targeted genetic modification.","Krogerus, Kristoffer; Magalhães, Frederico; Castillo, Sandra; Peddinti, Gopal; Vidgren, Virve; De Chiara, Matteo; Yue, Jia-Xing; Liti, Gianni; Gibson, Brian",bioRxiv,592,1

In this regard, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils representing the cellular component, and cytokines, interferons, complement or Toll-Like Receptors, representing the mediators of unspecific response act together for both activation of the adaptive immune response and viral clearance. Of great importance is the proper functioning of the innate immune response from the very beginning. For instance, in the early stages of viral infection, the defective interferon response leads to uncontrolled viral replication and pathogen evasion, while hypersecretion during the later stages of infection generates hyperinflammation. This cascade activation of systemic inflammation culminates with cytokine storm syndrome and hypercoagulability state, due to a close interconnection between them. Thus an unbalanced reaction, either under- or over-stimulation of the innate immune system will lead to an uncoordinated response and unfavorable disease outcomes. Since both cellular and humoral factors are involved in the time-course of the innate immune response, in this review we aimed to address their gradual involvement in the antiviral response with emphasis on key steps in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hutanu, A.; Georgescu, A.

However, many educational service providers were reluctant to utilise it fully till Covid-19 hit the world. As a result, almost most of these educational institutions have been pushed to adopt this method of teaching as an alternative mode to the conventional approach. They adapted to this new norm very quickly. However, with this new norm there arise inevitable challenges, one of which is the students’ engagement in the learning process, where in normal times it has its challenge. Therefore, the current study was planned to uncover the effects of an organisational factor (e.g. internal crises communication), technological factors (e.g. knowledge quality, interactivity, complexity), and personal factor (e.g. social responsibility) on students’ online learning engagement. Data have been obtained from a convenience sample of 365 business students from a private university in Selangor state in Malaysia. The results of the partial least square structural equation modelling have revealed that the students online learning engagement is positively and directly predicted by internal crises communication, interactivity and social responsibility as well as negatively predicted by complexity. Findings also show that knowledge quality, internal crises communication, and complexity have influenced online learning engagement indirectly through interactivity.

The aim. Conduct a systematic review of publications on the research of the use of B vitamins to support immunity and rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19. Methods. Intelligent analysis of so-called Big Data and special computational methods for analyzing Big Data of biomedical publications, based on the topological theory of sentiment analysis of medical texts from PubMed/MEDLINE. Results. Low levels of B vitamins contribute to chronic comorbidities and aggravate the clinical course of COVID-19 significantly. Increasing the supply of B vitamins in COVID-19 patients is essential for the maintenance of energy and oxygen metabolism;the direct antiviral effects of vitamins (reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication);compensation of chronic comorbidities (thromboembolism, impaired liver and kidney functions, diabetes mellitus, polyneuropathy), which aggravate the course of COVID-19;reducing hyperhomocysteinemia and chronic aseptic inflammation;inhibiting carbonic anhydrases to improve oxygen metabolism in the lungs, and increasing the clearance of lactate from the blood and preventing sepsis. Conclusion. By improving myelination of the olfactory sensory neurons, vitamin B12 can help overcome anosmia, which occurs in 80% of COVID-19 patients. Short courses (up to 2 – 3 weeks) of high-dose parenteral therapy with thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin can be used as a part of a complex of therapeutic measures to improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, especially in elderly patients with polyhypovitaminosis, diabetes mellitus, hyperhomocysteinemia, thrombophilia, and high risk of sepsis.

In our approach, when a transaction is broadcast by a peer, it is published immediately in a temporary block after being approved using a consensus mechanism. When a predefined number of temporary blocks have been published, the system will combine them into a permanent one and publish it upon approval using the same consensus mechanism. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is feasible and effective for timely publication of transaction records in a private blockchain.","Ming, R.; Xu, H. P.; Ieee Comp, S. O.

Virion structure is of interest, not only in the context of virus assembly, but also because pleomorphic variations may correlate with infectivity and pathogenicity. Detailed images of virus morphology often rely on electron microscopy, which is generally low throughput and limited in molecular identification. We have used fluorescence super-resolution microscopy combined with a rapid automated analysis pipeline to image many thousands of individual influenza virions, gaining information on their size, morphology and the distribution of membrane-embedded and internal proteins. This large-scale analysis revealed that influenza particles can be reliably characterised by length, that no spatial frequency patterning of the surface glycoproteins occurs, and that RNPs are preferentially located towards filament ends within Archetti bodies. Our analysis pipeline is versatile and can be adapted for use on multiple other pathogens, as demonstrated by its application for the size analysis of SARS-CoV-2. The ability to gain nanoscale structural information from many thousands of viruses in just a single experiment is valuable for the study of virus assembly mechanisms, host cell interactions and viral immunology, and should be able to contribute to the development of viral vaccines, anti-viral strategies and diagnostics.","McMahon, Andrew; Andrews, Rebecca; Ghani, Sohail V.; Cordes, Thorben; Kapanidis, Achillefs N.; Robb, Nicole C.",bioRxiv,592,1

There are many publicly available databases and tools that offer appealing features to help with such a task. However, many applications lack exposure or are constrained with unfriendly or outdated user interfaces. Thus, it follows that there are many resources that are relevant to investigation of medical disorders that are underutilized. Results We developed an R Shiny web application, called Kaleidoscope, to address this challenge. The application offers access to several omics databases and tools to let users explore research questions in silico. The application is designed to be user- friendly with a unified user interface, while also scalable by offering the option of uploading user-defined datasets. We demonstrate the application features with a starting query of a single gene (Disrupted in schizophrenia 1, DISC1) to assess its protein-protein interactions network.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a record-breaking year with 43,551 deaths attributed to gun violence in the U.S., with almost 20,000 classified as murder/unintentional death and more than 24,000 classified as suicide (Gun Violence Archive, 2021). Black men are 10 times more likely to die from gun violence than are white men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020c). Yet, in proportion to these sobering statistics, researchers' knowledge of the range of causes and possible remedies remains negligible. The purpose of this Special Issue of the Psychology of Violence devoted to Gun Violence was to highlight and spur additional, psychologically oriented research regarding firearm violence. Method: This Special Issue consists of seven original U.S.-based studies that address various aspects of gun violence, including individual, geographical, psychological, and sociological factors associated with attitudes toward guns, gun policies, and gun violence. Results: Individually and collectively, these studies provide novel insights regarding different types of gun perceptions and beliefs. These works consider a wide range of factors including media exposure, beliefs about the link between mental illness and gun violence, cumulative trauma, masculinity norms, regional norms, and trust in law enforcement. Discussion: This Special Issue is intended to spark greater interest in working to mitigate firearm violence and encourage researchers across scientific disciplines to collaboratively apply their theoretical perspectives and methodologies to reduce the devastating, but understudied, U.S. gun violence epidemic.

The model is based on an encoder and two stages of learning to make reliable decisions. The encoder extracts important words using text normalization, resulting in two vectors: symptom vectors and doctor utterance vectors. The symptom vectors are represented as a weighted bag-of-words feature. The first stage is used to cluster the patients’ utterances by applying Hopfield network while considering the semantic similarity, whereas the second stage extracts an implicit label as a template of advice using clustering. Additionally, the external evaluation model used the applied feedforward neural network classification algorithm using labels obtained in the second stage. The CovidDialog-English dataset is used to evaluate the model. The experimental results indicate the high performance of the feedforward neural network with an F1-score of 0.972 and presents a comparison of three clusters using the k-nearest neighbours and naïve Bayes-based models. © 2021.

We developed a novel folate-ligand guided zinc-peptide complex 010DS-Zn for selective induction of parthanatos in folate receptor overexpressing targets that include many solid and blood cancer types, in addition to M2-like macrophages. Consistent with known parthanatos mechanism, its in vitro mode-of-action (MOA) tested against 4T1 murine breast cancer cell was characterized by specific and rapid PARP-dependent AI F translocation into nucleus that executed massive DNA fragmentation. This in vitro/ex vivo cytotoxicity was found highly consistent against the 90 blood and solid patient-derived cancer types tested. Further in vivo MOA studies against aPD-1 responder and non-responder syngenic cancer models showed 010DS-Zn to be effective against both, albeit at increased dosage in the MDSC enriched tumors. In the aPD-1 responder cancer model CT26, 010DS-Zn demonstrated robust T-cell immune response initiation, which was enhanced upon co-treatment with aPD-1 mAb. Regardless of the tumor-response in vivo, 010DS-Zn treatment produced robust TAM-reduction activity in dose-dependent manners. Collectively, 010DS-Zn presents new cancer immunotherapeutic potentials for enabling previously inaccessible 2-combination therapies for targeting 3 layers of immune-evasion: Tregs, TAM, and MDSC. Furthermore, its ability to directly clear M2-like macrophages presents opportunities-worth-investigation for treating the M2-like macrophage-driven severe SARS-CoV-2 autoimmune syndromes or its post-recovery heart-damages.","Chung, J.

It was hypothesized that these patients were at higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to their inherent immune dysfunction and immunosuppressive therapy. Several rheumatology societies issued recommendations urging patients not to stop their anti-rheumatic treatments. Objectives: To assess treatment compliance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Methods: The web-based survey COVIDRA (COVID in RA) was developed to assess the impact of the first wave mandatory confinement in patients with RA focusing on 5 domains: RA symptoms, attitudes towards medication, employment status, physical exercise and mental health. The questionnaire was sent to RA patients through e-mail and social media of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology and two patient associations;and it was filled locally at two rheumatology centers in Lisbon. Recruitment took place during June and July 2020. Descriptive statistics were generated by the survey software and were afterwards transported and evaluated using appropriate biostatistics software. Results: We obtained 441 valid questionnaires. Most respondents were female (88.4%), caucasian (93.6%), with a mean age of 58 (+/-13) years. The majority (57.6%) had longstanding disease (≥10 years) and were treated with csDMARDs (63.2%) and/or bDMARDs/tsDMARDS (23,7%). Only 14% (N=61) discontinued or reduced the dosage or frequency of their RA treatment. Most of these changes were previously planned by the attending physician (27.9%). Only 11 patients (18%) discontinued their immunosuppressive medication out of fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 (corresponding to 2.5% of total responders). Another 11 patients did so because they had no prescription, couldn't go to the community/ hospital pharmacy or couldn't afford the medication. Although these numbers preclude any statistical analysis, when compared to patients who persisted on their treatment, those discontinuing due to fear of contagion were younger (56.4 vs 58.5 years), all female (100 vs 86.8%), with long-lasting disease (≥ 11 years) (90.9% vs 57.5%), more frequently treated with bDMARDs (36.4 vs 23.1%) and presenting more symptoms of depression (54.5 vs 49.7%). Conclusion: Most RA patients complied with their treatment during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Portugal. Only a minority changed their immunosuppressive treatment due to fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Very similar rates of immunosuppressive discontinuation due to fear of contagion were reported.","Araujo, F.; Goņalves, N.; Mourão, A. F.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,592,10

This was contrary to previous years where interviews were in-person and on-site. Prior to the pandemic, studies evaluated the potential advantage of incorporating virtual interviews as the on-site interview has been shown to be expensive, time consuming, and disruptive to a resident’s education. Objective: This study sought to evaluate the virtual interview experience from the applicant’s and interviewer’s perspective, and to characterize the advantages and disadvantages of virtual interviewing in the 2020 OB/GYN fellowship application cycle. Materials and Methods: This was a survey-based study with participants including recent OB/GYN fellowship applicants, current fellows, and current subspecialty faculty who participated in interviews. Demographics, residency training, application cycle metrics, cost of interviewing, perception of the virtual interview experience, and preference for the future were analyzed using t-test and Fisher’s exact tests. Results: There were 130 responses with 24 applicants, 59 fellows. and 47 faculty. Amongst in-person and virtual applicants, there was no significant difference in demographics. There was no significant difference in the number of programs applied to, however there were significantly more interviews granted, attended, and ranked in the virtual interview cohort. Virtual interviewees spent significantly less money ($624.2 vs $5226.2, p &lt;0.01) and time (43.4 vs 113.1 hours, p &lt;0.01) on interviews than their in-person counterparts and took significantly fewer days off of work (8.5 vs 14.9 days, p &lt;0.01). There was no difference between the percentage of applicants that matched within their top three ranked programs (80% vs 65.1%, p=0.38). When asked to rate their recommendation for incorporation of virtual interviews in the future using a scale of 1-10 (with 10 indicating “strongly recommend”), applicants responded significantly more favorably (8.15 vs 5.2 (fellows), vs 5.4 (faculty), p &lt;0.01). Faculty and fellow interviewers agreed that in-person interviews were more effective than virtual. Conclusion: This study found that virtual interviewing was associated with less time and financial burden without affecting the likelihood that the applicant matches at one of their top-ranked programs. Additionally, most applicants strongly recommend incorporating virtual interviews in the future. While there are significant advantages, fellow and faculty interviewers agree that in-person interviews are more effective. A potential solution moving forward is hybrid interviewing, where both virtual and in-person interviews are utilized. Financial Support: none References:: 1.

Design: Prospective, population-based epidemiological and Mendelian randomisation studies. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 377,143 self-identified British descent (54% women; median age 58 years) participants in the UK Biobank. Main outcome measures: First incident pneumonia over an average of 8 follow-up years. Results: 107,310 (30%) participants had hypertension at UK Biobank enrolment, and 9,969 (3%) developed a pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension at baseline was significantly associated with increased risk for incident respiratory disease including pneumonia (hazard ratio 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.43), P<0.001), acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure (1.43 (1.29 to 1.59), P<0.001), and chronic lower respiratory disease (1.30 (1.25 to 1.36), P<0.001), independent of age, age2, sex, smoking status, BMI, prevalent diabetes mellitus, prevalent coronary artery disease, and principal components of ancestry. Mendelian randomisation analyses indicated that genetic predisposition to a 5 mmHg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk of incident pneumonia for SBP (1.08, (1.04 to 1.13), P<0.001) and DBP (1.11 (1.03 to 1.20), P=0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increase in blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in the first second, forced vital capacity, and the ratio of the two (P<0.001 for all). Conclusions: These results strongly suggest that elevated blood pressure independently increases risk for pneumonia and reduces pulmonary function. Maintaining adequate blood pressure control, in addition to other measures, may reduce risk for pneumonia. Whether the present findings are generalizable to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require further study.","Zekavat, S. M.; Honigberg, M.; Pirruccello, J.; Kohli, P.; Karlson, E.

Although there are published consensuses on donor screening guidelines, there are few reports about the implementation of those guidelines in functioning stool banks. Methods: To help inform consensus standards with data gathered from real-world settings and, in turn, to improve patient care, here we describe the general methodology used in 2018 by OpenBiome, a large stool bank, and its outputs in that year. Results: In 2018, the stool bank received 7,536 stool donations from 210 donors, a daily average of 20.6 donations, and processed 4,271 of those donations into FMT preparations. The median time a screened and enrolled stool donor actively donated stool was 5.8 months. The median time between the manufacture of an FMT preparation and its shipment to a hospital or physician was 8.9 months. Half of the stool bank's partner hospitals and physicians ordered an average of 0.75 or fewer FMT preparations per month.

This approach models infection-age-dependent infectivity and extends the classical SIR and SEIR models. We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time) and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this FLLN, the joint evolution of the mean infectivity and of the proportion of susceptible individuals is determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then obtain expressions for the evolution of the proportions of exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non-Markovian) branching process and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of nonextinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use these equations to derive the expression for the basic reproduction number R0 during the early stage of an epidemic, in terms of the average individual infectivity function and the exponential rate of growth of the epidemic, and apply our results to the Covid-19 epidemic. © 2021 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","Forien, R.; Pang, G.; Pardoux, É",SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics,592,24

From a common database prepared for COVID-19, we retrieved the relevant data and compared the clinical findings and outcomes of PCR-positive patients with those of PCR-negative cases who had been diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were included in the analysis, of which 126 (36.1%) were PCR-negative. PCR-negative patients were younger (54.6 ± 20.8 vs. 60.8 ± 18.9 years, P = .009) but were similar to PCR-positive patients in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms. They had higher lymphocyte counts (1519 ± 868 vs. 1331 ± 737/mm3, P = .02) and less frequently presented with bilateral radiographic findings (68.3% vs. 79.4%, P = .046) than PCR-positive patients.

Hence, we build a constrained peptide database, containing most probable sequences to interpret mass spectrometry data (MS). In parallel, we perform MS de novo sequencing with genomic-based algorithms that foresee point mutations. We calibrated SLIDER with Gallus gallus lysozyme, for which sequence is unequivocally established and numerous natural isoforms are reported. We used SLIDER to characterise a metalloproteinase and a phospholipase A2-like protein from the venom of Bothrops moojeni and a crotoxin from Crotalus durissus collilineatus. This integrated approach offers a more realistic structural descriptor to characterize macromolecules isolated from natural source. Key points The method SEQUENCE SLIDER integrates biophysical, genetic and structural data to assign sequence. It joins crystallography, mass spectrometry and phylogenetic data to characterize isoforms. Sequence heterogeneity of four proteins purified directly from snake venom was established.","Borges, Rafael J.; Salvador, Guilherme H.

The Pythagorean fuzzy soft set (PFSS) is a proper extension of the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) which discusses the parametrization of the attributes of alternatives. It is also a generalization of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS). The PFSS is used to precisely evaluate the deficiencies, anxiety, and hesitation in decision-making (DM). The most essential determination of the current study is to advance some operational laws along with aggregation operators (AOs) within the Pythagorean fuzzy soft environs such as Pythagorean fuzzy soft interaction weighted average (PFSIWA) and Pythagorean fuzzy soft interaction weighted geometric (PFSIWG) operators with their desirable features. Furthermore, a DM technique has been established based on the developed operators to solve multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Moreover, an application of the projected method is presented for the selection of an effective hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparative analysis with the merits, effectivity, tractability, along with some available research deduces the effectiveness of this approach.","Zulqarnain, R. M.; Xin, X.

However, the technical noise and bias of the technology still have negative impacts on the downstream analysis. Here, we present a self-supervised Contrastive LEArning framework for scRNA-seq (CLEAR) profile representation and the downstream analysis. CLEAR overcomes the heterogeneity of the experimental data with a specifically designed representation learning task and thus can handle batch effects and dropout events. In the task, the deep learning model learns to pull together the representations of similar cells while pushing apart distinct cells, without manual labeling. It achieves superior performance on a broad range of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, dropout correction, batch effect removal, and pseudo-time inference. The proposed method successfully identifies and illustrates inflammatory-related mechanisms in a COVID-19 disease study with 43,695 single cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further experiments to process a million-scale single-cell dataset demonstrate the scalability of CLEAR. This scalable method generates effective scRNA-seq data representation while eliminating technical noise, and it will serve as a general computational framework for single-cell data analysis.","Han, Wenkai; Cheng, Yuqi; Chen, Jiayang; Zhong, Huawen; Hu, Zhihang; Chen, Siyuan; Zong, Licheng; King, Irwin; Gao, Xin; Li, Yu",bioRxiv,592,1

This mixed-method study involved surveys and interviews with women in their third trimester of pregnancy to understand prevalence and correlates of prenatal depression during a pandemic event. Survey participants included 378 pregnant women in the United States with due dates between April and December 2020 who self-reported depressive symptoms using the 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Participants were predominately white, married, and highly educated. A subset of 21 women participated in qualitative interviews. In total, 56.3% of women reported depressive symptoms consistent with clinical levels of prenatal depression. Correlates of depressive symptoms included younger age, unmarried status, lack of access to paid parental leave, feeling unsafe in current romantic relationship, fear and worry about upcoming childbirth, and change in birth plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In-depth interviews with participants revealed key themes around pregnant women’s experiences with fear and anxiety, mixed emotions, and grief and loss. These findings underscore the pervasive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women during the perinatal period, with specific implications for the care of women with prenatal depression and their families. The heightened potential for prenatal depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is concerning given the potential adverse effects of maternal depression. Practitioners must work together to engage in additional assessment of risks of prenatal depression to ensure support for expecting families is readily accessible.

It is not possible to compare the theory with viral or bacterial mutation rates, as these are not measured on a time base. There is positive evidence from population level avian studies where the coefficient of additive evolvability (Cav) and its square (IA) change with environmental favourability in agreement with this model.

Here we discovered that both thiolated and non-thiolated DNA/RNA can be efficiently attached to AuNPs to achieve high-stable spherical nucleic acid (SNA) within minutes under a domestic microwave (MW)-assisted heating-dry circumstance. Further studies showed that for non-thiolated DNA/RNA the conjugation is poly (T/U) tag dependent.

However, the interstitial fluid in the interspace between tissue and capillary has a high Prandtl number around 103 and hence its convective mass transport is more efficient than its diffusive transport. The interstitial flow drained by the initial lymphatics contributes to the convective transport of O2 through tissue, which can be modeled as aligned blood capillaries in parallel and the initial lymphatics. It is found that both the O2 concentration distribution and the total O2 flux are sensitive to the flow rate of interstitial fluid. The convection contribution has been evaluated based on the Peclet number, feature flow rate, and convection-diffusion boundary. At the same interstitial flow rate, convection delivers more O2 to type I muscle fibers with a higher concentration of myoglobin than to type IIX muscle fibers. Even with a small external force, tissue with a higher specific hydraulic conductance (permeability) has a larger interstitial flow rate and a higher O2 transport rate than those in healthy tissue. Hence, the overall O2 transport from capillary to tissue includes two components, i.e., active convection transport by interstitial flow due to pressure gradient and passive diffusion transport due to concentration gradient. The active convective O2 transport is crucial for the recovery of damaged tissue where the contribution from passive diffusion transport is constrained by regulation of capillary opening. The convection facilitated O2 transport can be the basis for cell differentiation, morphogenesis, and therapeutic effects of massage and acupuncture. Key points Interstitial flow plays a key role in active O2 transport in tissue due to its high Prandtl number v/D~103; O2 transport in tissue is balanced by both active convection and passive diffusion transport. Interstitial flow in form of active convective transport can pump more than hundred times of O2 into tissue than those by passive diffusion transport due to the concentration gradient. Active convection transport can be triggered by external pressure, which is crucial for damage tissue recovery.","Liu, Zhu; Wen, Chenyu; Zhang, Shi-Li",bioRxiv,592,1

Since the start of the pandemic, real time RT-PCR diagnostic testing from upper respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, has been the standard. Moreover, respiratory samples in viral transport media are the ideal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS). In early 2021, many clinicians transitioned to antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tests, which use anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection. Despite this shift in testing methods, the need for whole-genome sequence surveillance remains. Thus, we developed a workflow for whole-genome sequencing with antigen test-derived swabs as an input rather than nasopharyngeal swabs. In this study, we use excess clinical specimens processed using the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card. We demonstrate that whole-genome sequencing from antigen tests is feasible and yields similar results from RT-PCR-based assays utilizing a swab in viral transport media.","Nazario-Toole, A.

Design/methodology/approach This paper distinguishes a firm's intrinsic value and book value, where a firm can lose its intrinsic value when it encounters cash-flow crunch. Wang transform is applied to (1) calculating the appropriate level of interest rate subsidy payable to incentivize banks to issue more loans to SMEs and to extend the loan maturity of current debt to the SMEs, (2) describing the frailty distribution for SMEs and (3) defining banks' underwriting capability and overlap index in risk selection. Findings Government support for SMEs can be in the form of an appropriate level of interest rate subsidy payable to incentivize banks to issue more loans to SMEs and to extend the loan maturity of current debt to the SMEs. Research limitations/implications More available data on bank loans would have helped strengthen the empirical studies. Practical implications This paper makes policy recommendations of establishing policy-oriented banks or investment funds dedicated to supporting SMEs, developing risk indices for SMEs to facilitate refined risk underwriting, providing SMEs with long-term tax relief and early-stage equity-type investments. Social implications The model highlights the importance of providing bridge loans to SMEs during the COVID-19 disruption to prevent massive business closures.

Methods: Students completed repeated online surveys at three time points (October 2020 (baseline), February 2021, March 2021) to explore relationships between demographic and psychological factors (loneliness and positive mood) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress). Results: A total of 893 students participated. Depression and anxiety levels were higher at all timepoints than pre-pandemic normative data (p<.001). Scores on all mental health measures were highest in February, with depression and anxiety remaining significantly higher in March than baseline. Female students and those with previous mental health disorders were at greatest risk of poor mental health outcomes. Lower positive mood and greater loneliness at baseline were associated with greater depression and anxiety at follow-ups. Baseline positive mood predicted improvement of depression and anxiety at follow-ups.

The use of Digital PCR yielded very precise measurements. The observations thus generated exhibit a rough stabilization on plateaus of the epidemic and other remarkable features. Such plateaus are widely reported in the setting of the Covid-19 pandemics. In this paper we raise the question of why such plateaus and other features of epidemics dynamics arise. Indeed, the classical SIR model and its extensions hardly provide an explanation for such behavior. To address this question we introduce here a new model, which takes into account heterogeneity and natural variability of behaviors in populations. Owing to this model, we show that features such as plateaus, rebounds, and shoulders are part of the intrinsic dynamics of an epidemic. In particular, in the context of the Thau lagoon, we argue that they are not generated by public health policy measures or psychological reactions of the population. We then show that this model fits very well the measures obtained around the Thau lagoon.","Berestycki, H.; Desjardins, B.; Heintz, B.; Oury, J.-M.",,592,1

Using YPLL before age 75 to anchor comparisons between males and females and a novel Monte Carlo simulation procedure to perform estimation and uncertainty quantification, our results reveal a near-universal pattern across states of higher COVID-19-attributable YPLL among males compared to females. Furthermore, the disproportionately high COVID-19 mortality burden among males is generally more pronounced when measuring mortality burden in terms of YPLL compared to death counts, reflecting dual phenomena of males dying from COVID-19 at higher rates and at systematically younger ages relative to females. The U.S. COVID-19 epidemic also offers lessons underscoring the importance of cultivating a public health environment that recognizes sex-specific needs as well as different patterns in risk factors, health behaviors, and responses to interventions between men and women.

Nowadays molecular techniques allow us to detect and quantify minute amounts of DNA traces released in the environment (eDNA) by any organism. We present three qPCR-assays targeting the monk seal mitogenome. The assays were soundly tested on an extensive and diversified sample set (n=73), including positive controls from Madeira breeding population collected during the peak of abundance, and two opportunistic Mediterranean eDNA-sample collections (offshore/coastal) from on-going projects.

What are the special ethical obligations assumed by architects? Because their work creates the basic material conditions that make all other human activity possible, architects and their associates in building enjoy vast influence on how we all live, work, play, worship, and think. With this influence comes tremendous, and not always examined, responsibility. This book addresses the range of ethical issues that architects face, with a broad understanding of ethics. Beyond strictly professional duties-transparency, technical competence, fair trading-lie more profound issues that move into aesthetic, political, and existential realms. Does an architect have a duty to create art, if not always beautiful art? Should an architect feel obliged to serve a community and not simply the client? Is social justice a possible orientation for architectural practice? Is there such a thing as feeling compelled to “shelter being” in architectural work? By taking these usually abstract questions into the region of physical creation, the book attempts a concrete reformulation of “architectural ethics” as a matter of deep reflection on the architect’s role as both citizen and caretaker.

General disruption has also affected the traditional program of a postgraduate training, which has been so far fixed with temporary solutions, but not given a proper evaluation in the times of big expectations and pressures from both patients and healthcare workers.ObjectivesOutbreak of the COVID-19 put psychiatry trainees and Early Career Psychiatrists in an unprecedented position of responsibility for treatment of a variety of comorbidities they had no prior experience with due to closure of specialized hospital departments and limited access to regular diagnostic tools. In addition to changes in clinical practice and deployment to unfamiliar ground, rescheduling of different components of regular training, transferring most of the educational activities to distance learning, limiting professional growth by canceling most courses and conferences only strengthened the feeling of uncertainty caused by constant adjustments of the final examinations’ conditions.MethodsThe Speciality Training Section of the Polish Psychiatric Association decided to review changes forced by the COVID-19 outbreak in a traditional postgraduate training program in psychiatry.ResultsIdentified shortcomings pose questions about the necessity of a solid revision of the training in order to cope with more demanding working conditions.ConclusionsPresented recommendations may be the starting point for a discussion on the programs’ evaluation across the entire region.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Szczegielniak, A.; Gondek, T.; Rewekant, A.",European Psychiatry,592,24

Healthcare professionals now have to make clinical assessments based on remote patient examinations. The number of tender and swollen joints a patient has drives decision-making in RA, making it particularly important that people with RA and HCPs have a shared understanding of these examinations. Even before remote consultations became widespread, long gaps between clinic visits create challenges in enabling HCPs to form an accurate picture of disease activity over time. The REMORA (REmote MOnitoring of Rheumatoid Arthritis) app aims to address this issue by asking people with RA to track disease activity, including counting the number of tender or swollen joints, weekly(1). Data are integrated into the electronic patient record for clinicians to access with patients during clinical consultations. As part of the supporting materials for the REMORA app, we planned to develop a video to train people with RA how to examine their own joints. This video may now help meet the need created by the recent expansion in remote consultations. Objectives: To describe the co-production, implementation and evaluation of a video to train patients how to examine their own joints. Methods: The need for the video to fill a current gap in patient education was identified by the REMORA patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group. A core working group comprising the PPIE lead, a nurse consultant, rheumatology clinicians, project and communications managers was formed. A storyboard was drafted and feedback gained from the PPIE group and wider REMORA team. Images were sourced from licenced suppliers, or co-developed with the PPIE group where necessary. No ethical approval was required as the PPIE group lead was acting as an equal member of the research term. Written informed consent was gained from video participants. Filming took place between two national lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a challenge to ensure social distancing and requiring the use of masks. Results: A 15 minute video to train people with RA to self-examine for tender and swollen joints was developed. An introduction outlining the rationale behind self-examination is followed by a nurse consultant coaching an RA patient in individual joint self-examination. Shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints and knees are included, all of which are counted in disease activity scores. Early feedback from stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. The video will be publicly available on YouTube from February 2021. A survey of patients and HCPs aims to obtain more formal feedback on the video, with a view to a further iteration, if required. Leading national organisations in rheumatology will promote the video, as it supports national programmes including the British Society for Rheumatology national early inflammatory arthritis audit and ePROMS (electronic patient report outcome measure) platform, both of which include entry of patient reported tender and swollen joint counts. Conclusion: This video was co-designed by people with RA, aiming to support self-examination of tender and swollen joint counts. Hits on YouTube and survey responses will help assess its impact. Evaluation to assess whether the video affects patients' ability to self-examine for tender and swollen joints before and after watching is planned. We hope the video will support remote consultations and help people with arthritis to better understand and self-manage their arthritis, and to have shared decision making conversations with their clinicians.","Sharp, C.; Staniland, K.; Cornell, T.; Dixon, W.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,592,26

In this study, several generally available respirators and mask designs were fit tested, and their materials were evaluated for filtration efficiency using 250 nm polystyrene latex particles. Efficiency testing was performed for 2 and 0.5 h at low (2.6 L min(-1)) and high (7.4 L min(-1)) airflows, respectively, using similar to 17.4 cm(2) material area. As expected, all N95 and KN95 respirators passed the fit test, and their materials showed efficiencies &gt; 95% for the entire experiment at both airflows. Of the three air filters used in the 3D-printed Montana masks, only the HEPA filter had a filtration efficiency &gt; 95% at both airflows. Regardless of the insert material, the Montana mask failed all fit tests. Homemade duckbill masks made of Halyard H600 sterilization wrap and WypAll X80 reusable wipe also failed the fit test, and both filter materials had an average filtration efficiency &lt; 95% at high airflows. To explain the filtration efficiency results, the structure and composition of all filter materials were determined using FE-SEM, and IR and Raman spectroscopy. In conclusion, when highly efficient materials are used in masks that do not fit the users properly, the potential of these materials to protect the users from aerosols is compromised. Therefore, the mask design is as important as the filtration efficiency of the mask material.","Ardon-Dryer, K.; Warzywoda, J.; Tekin, R.; Biros, J.; Almodovar, S.; Weeks, B. L.; Hope-Weeks, L.

Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food security is important to provide support, and identify long-term impacts and needs. Objective. Our team- the National Food Access and COVID research Team (NFACT) was formed to assess food security over different U.S. study sites throughout the pandemic, using common instruments and measurements. Here we present results from 18 study sites across 15 states and nationally over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. A validated survey instrument was developed and implemented in whole or part across the sites throughout the first year of the pandemic, representing 22 separate surveys. Sampling methods for each study site were convenience, representative, or high-risk targeted. Food security was measured using the USDA six-item module. Food security prevalence was analyzed using analysis of variance by sampling method to statistically significant differences. Results. In total, more than 27,000 people responded to the surveys. We find higher prevalence of food insecurity (low or very low food security) since the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to before the pandemic. In nearly all study sites, we find higher prevalence of food insecurity among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), households with children, and those with job disruptions. We also demonstrate lingering food insecurity, with high or increased prevalence over time in sites with repeat surveys. We find no statistically significant differences between convenience and representative surveys, but statistically higher prevalence of food insecurity among high-risk compared to convenience surveys. Conclusions. This comprehensive multi-study site effort demonstrates higher prevalence of food insecurity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in multiple survey sites continues throughout the first year of the pandemic. These impacts were prevalent for certain demographic groups, and most pronounced for surveys targeting high-risk populations.","Niles, M. T.; Beavers, A. W.; Clay, L. A.; Dougan, M. M.; Pignotti, G.

In this paper, we analyze an infectious disease model in which the contact rate switches between two levels when the moving average of active cases crosses one of two thresholds. The switching mechanism naturally forces the existence of periodic orbits. In order to make unbiased comparisons between periodic orbits in this model and a traditional one where the contact rate switches based on more simplistic pointwise evaluations of active cases, we use a rigorous homotopy continuation method. We develop computer-assisted proofs that can validate the continuation and prove that the branch of periodic orbits has no folds and is isolated in the space of periodic solutions. This allows a direct, rigorous comparison between the geometric and quantitative properties of the cycles with a moving average threshold and a pointwise threshold. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a sample problem modeled off of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Montreal.","Church, K. E. M.",Siam Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems,592,12

Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5’ and 3’ ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses. And we proved the feasibility of using the sRNA-seq based method for the detection of viruses in a sample containing miniscule RNA.","Xu, Xiaofeng; Bei, Jinlong; Xuan, Yibo; Chen, Jianyuan; Chen, Defu; Barker, Stephen C.; Kelava, Samuel; He, Bingjun; Gao, Shan; Chen, Ze",bioRxiv,592,26

Experiencing nature during childhood shapes aspects of a personal relationship with nature, crucial for sustainable decision-making processes in adulthood. Scholars often stress the need to ‘reconnect’ urban dwellers with nature;however, few elaborate on how this can be achieved. Here, we argue that nature reconnection requires urban ecosystems, with a capacity to enable environmental learning in the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains, i.e., learning that occurs in the head, heart and hands of individuals. Drawing on environmental psychology, urban ecology, institutional analysis and urban planning, we present a theoretical framework for Human–Nature Connection (HNC), discuss the importance of nurturing HNC for children, elaborate on the role of property-rights and the importance of creating collective action arenas in cities for the promotion of urban resilience building. As values and environmental preconceptions underly environmental behavior, there are limits to achieving HNC in cities, as presumptive sentiments toward nature not always are positive. We end by discussing the role of new digital technologies in relation to HNC, and conclude by summarizing the major points brought forward herein, offering policy recommendations for HNC as a resilience strategy that can be adopted in cities throughout the world.","Colding, Johan Giusti Matteo Haga Andreas Wallhagen Marita Barthel Stephan",Sustainability,592,1

To design a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to understand which SARS-CoV-2 specific epitopes can elicit a T cell response and provide protection across a broad population. In this study, PLpro and RdRp, two immunogenic non-structural proteins from an immunodominant gene region ORF1ab, as well as ORF3a and ORF9b are identified as potential vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2. To select top epitopes for vaccine design, we used various clinical properties, such as antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and IFN-y secretion. The analysis of CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes revealed multiple potential vaccine constructs that cover a high percentage of the world population. We identified 8 immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD8 proteins for nsp3, 4 for nsp12, 11 for ORF3a and 3 for ORF9b that are common across four lineages of variants of concern – B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, which protect 98.12%, 87.08%, 96.07% and 63.8% of the world population, respectively. We also identified variant specific T cell epitopes that could be useful in targeting each variant strain separately. Including the prediction of mouse MHC affinity towards our top CD8 epitopes, our study revealed a total of 3 immunogenic, antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD8 epitopes overlapping with 6 antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, stable and IFN-y inducing CD4 epitopes across all four variants of concern which can effectively be utilized in pre-clinical studies.

However this has not been systematically examined at a national level in the UK. Here we examined changes in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by cause for 0-24 year olds by age-group. Methods We used data on DALYS by cause, sex and age-group for the UK from 1998 to 2017 from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. We modified the GBD cause-hierarchy to be more relevant to paediatrics. We assessed current causes of burden in 2017 and change at cause-level for 1998-2007 and 2008-2017 by age. We then used Holt-Winters doubly exponentiated time-series models to forecast change in DALYs by age to 2040. Results In 2017, neonatal and congenital disorders were the main causes of DALYS across 0-24 year olds, with other the other large causes being anxiety and depression, endocrine and immune disorders, and lower respiratory tract infections. Total DALYS were highest amongst neonates and lowest amongst 1-9 year olds, rising with age amongst 10-24 year olds. Between 1998-2017, total DALYs fell in each age-group, with the largest falls in infants. The greatest changes in DALYS from 2008 to 2017 were falls in neonatal and congenital causes amongst infants, falls in infectious diseases and injuries in older age-groups, and rises in neonatal causes, mental health, acne and somatic symptoms in all age-groups other than infants. These patterns were forecast to continue to 2040. Conclusions We forecast falls in causes that have historically dominated disease in CYP, particularly congenital disorders, infectious diseases, cancers and injuries, representing falls in the prevalence of many infectious diseases and improvements in road safety and also improvements in survival from cancer and many congenital conditions. Forecast increases in DALYS from mental health problems, other adolescent health issues and the consequences of neonatal survival, such as neuro-disability and epilepsy, have potential implications for the training of paediatricians and workforce needs over the next two decades. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and changes in child poverty require further research.","Ward, J. L.; Hargreaves, D.; Turner, S.; Viner, R.

Since 2018, foreigners from the so-called third countries have become dominant within the immigrant population. The migration crisis due to the Pandemic seems not affected the patterns of migration to Slovakia. We would argue that the need in Slovakia's domestic labour market affected immigration flows more than anything else. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic, due to emigration flows, there was a shortage of labour in the country. However, as a result of the restrictive measures taken by the government in response to the Pandemic, changes are taking place, which also has an impact on the employment of foreigners. During the Pandemic, several laws regulating the legal status of foreigners in the Slovak Republic have been amended. This article focuses on the legislative developments in shaping the Slovak migration policy in the near future.","Privara, A.; Rievajova, E.",Migration Letters,592,11

They provide the basis for robust experimental designs and reproducibility of results. In many countries, the determination of welfare is a mandatory legal requirement and implies the assessment of the degree of the severity that an animal experiences during an experiment. However, for an effective severity assessment, an objective and exact approach/system/strategy is needed. In light of these demands, we have developed the Relative Severity Assessment (RELSA) score. This comprehensive composite score was established on the basis of physiological and behavioral data from a surgical mouse study. Body weight, the Mouse Grimace Scale score, burrowing behavior, and the telemetry-derived parameters heart rate, heart rate variability, temperature, and general activity were used to investigate the quality of indicating severity during postoperative recovery. The RELSA scores not only revealed individual severity levels but also allowed a comparison of severity in distinct mouse models addressing colitis, sepsis, and restraint stress using a k-means clustering approach with the maximum achieved RELSA scores. We discriminated and classified data from sepsis nonsurvivors into the highest relative severity level. Data from mice after intraperitoneal transmitter implantation and sepsis survivor al were located in the next lower cluster, while data from mice subjected to colitis and restraint stress were placed in the lowest severity cluster. Analysis of individual variables and their combinations revealed model- and time-dependent contributions to severity levels. In conclusion, we propose the RELSA score as a validated tool for objective real-time applicability in severity assessment and as a first step towards a unified and accessible risk assessment tool in biomedical research. As an effective severity assessment system, it will fundamentally improve animal welfare, as well as data quality and reproducibility.","Talbot, Steven R.; Struve, Birgitta; Wassermann, Laura; Heider, Miriam; Weegh, Nora; Knape, Tilo; Hofmann, Martine C.

This project, co-funded by Erasmus[superscript +], focuses on capacity development for curriculum transformation through internationalisation and development of Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) virtual exchange. Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-to-face training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore. Writing from an insider perspective as project partners, in this paper we draw from appreciative inquiry, using a metaphor of a mosaic as our identity, to first provide the background on the iKudu project before sharing the impact of the pandemic on the project's adapted approach. We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached.","Jacobs, L.; Wimpenny, K.; Mitchell, L.; Hagenmeier, C.; Beelen, J.; Hodges, M.; George, V.; DeWinter, A.; Slambee, C.; Obadire, S.; Viviani, A.; Samuels, L.; Jackson, L.

About 25% of patients who were diagnosed with hypochondria now fall into the category illness anxiety disorder. This disorder constitutes a new diagnostic category in DSM5 and is included within the somatic symptom and related disorders.ObjectivesWe propose to carry out a bibliographic review off the new diagnostic category of illness anxiety disorder.MethodsWe present the clinical case of a 27-year-old man in the context of the Covid19 pandemic.ResultsThe illness anxiety disorder is characterized by being concerned about having or acquiring a serious illness. Somatic symptoms are not present, but if they are, they are of mild intensity. The level of concern is excessive or disproportionate if there is any disease or if there is a high risk of developing it. There is a high level of health anxiety and the individual is easily alarmed by personal health status. It is a disorder that tends to be chronic and recurrent. The exact comorbidity is still unknown. However, it is important to keep in mind that hypochondria concurs with anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Treatment is based on the cognitive restructuring of bodily symptoms. In addition, exposure therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy are also effective. Regarding pharmacological treatment, SSRIs are useful in relation with comorbidity.ConclusionsIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by significant attention to somatic concerns in medical places, making it very useful for primary care professionals.","Higueras, P.

This represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment of potentially significant disease. Our aim was to quantify and characterise non-TB abnormalities identified by TB-focused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB prevalence survey. Methods: We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult ([≥]15 years) CXRs classified as ""abnormal, suggestive of TB"" or ""abnormal other"" during field interpretation from the TB Prevalence Survey. Each image was read (blinded to field classification and study radiologist read) by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological diagnosis. A third reader resolved discrepancies. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated. Findings: Cardiomegaly was the most common non-TB abnormality at 259/1123 (23*1%, 95% CI 20*6%-25*6%), while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17/1123 (1*5 %, 95% CI 0.9%-2*4%). We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 3*2% (95% CI 2*3%- 4*4%) and non-specific patterns in 4*6% (95% CI 3*5%- 6*0%). Prevalence of active-TB and severe post-TB lung changes was 3*6% (95% CI 2*6%- 4*8%) and 1*4% (95% CI 0*8%- 2*3%) respectively. Interpretation: Based on radiological diagnosis, we identified a wide variety of non-TB diagnoses during population-based TB screening.

SARS-CoV-2 infects humans as a result of the interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and the receptor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (rACE2), located predominantly in the alveolar cells. Objective: This study aims to identify inhibitory peptides of the protein-protein interaction between the receptor-binding-domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor through computational tools. Methods: Through the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics protein database, crystals were selected and interaction models were carried out between the viral protein and the ACE2;thereafter, the study designed inhibitory peptides of the interaction through the Rosetta web server, validated their interaction through ClusPro and, finally, determined the theoretical physicochemical and cytotoxic properties. Results: A protein complex was generated and modeled through ClusPro;the balanced model was selected with the lowest binding energy. From the protein interactions of each of the crystals and from the model, eight peptides of 20 residues were obtained. The theoretical evaluation showed non-toxic peptides, six soluble in water, and two insoluble. Conclusion: We found eight peptides that interacted with the receptor-binding-domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which could avoid contact with the cell receptor and generate interference in the infection process.","Rodríguez-Salazar, C.

In Italy, the hardest hit region was Lombardy, with the first reported case on 20 February 2020. San Raffaele Scientific Institute — a large tertiary hospital and research centre in Milan, Italy — was immediately involved in the management of the public health emergency. Since the beginning of the outbreak, the elective surgical activity of the hospital was rapidly reduced and large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganised to admit and assist patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, the hospital became the regional referral hub for cardiovascular emergencies in order to keep ensuring a high level of health care to non-COVID-19 patients in northern Italy. In a few days, a COVID-19 emergency department was created, improving the general ward capacity to a total number of 279 beds dedicated to patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds was increased from 28 to 72 (54 of them dedicated to patients with COVID-19, and 18 to cardiology and cardiac surgery hub emergencies), both converting pre-existing areas and creating new high technology spaces. All the involved health care personnel were rapidly trained to use personal protection equipment and to manage this particular category of patients both in general wards and ICUs. Furthermore, besides clinical activities, continuously important research projects were carried out in order to find new strategies and more effective therapies to better face an unprecedented health emergency in Italy.","Zangrillo, Alberto; Beretta, Luigi; Silvani, Paolo; Colombo, Sergio; Scandroglio, Anna Mara; Dell’Acqua, Antonio; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Landoni, Giovanni; Monti, Giacomo; Azzolini, Maria Luisa; Monaco, Fabrizio; Oriani, Alessandro; Belleti, Alessandro; Sartorelli, Marianna; Pallanch, Ottavia; Saleh, Omar; Sartini, Chiara; Nardelli, Pasquale; Lombardi, Gaetano; Morselli, Federica; Scquizzato, Tommaso; Frontera, Antonio; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Scotti, Raffaella; Assanelli, Andrea; Dagna, Lorenzo; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Castagna, Antonella; Scarpellini, Paolo; Di Napoli, Davide; Ambrosio, Alberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Tresoldi, Moreno",Critical care and resuscitation : journal of the Australasian Academy of Critical Care Medicine,592,19

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of several sampling conditions and environmental factors on fecal VOC profiles, analyzed by an electronic nose (eNose). Effects of fecal sample mass, water content, duration of storage at room temperature, fecal sample temperature, number of freeze-thaw cycles and effect of sampling method (rectal swabs vs. fecal samples) on VOC profiles were assessed by analysis of totally 725 fecal samples by means of an eNose (Cyranose320®). Furthermore, fecal VOC profiles of totally 1285 fecal samples from 71 infants born at three different hospitals were compared to assess the influence of center of origin on VOC outcome. We observed that all analyzed variables significantly influenced fecal VOC composition. It was feasible to capture a VOC profile using rectal swabs, although this differed significantly from fecal VOC profiles of similar subjects. In addition, 1285 fecal VOC-profiles could significantly be discriminated based on center of birth. In conclusion, standardization of methodology is necessary before fecal VOC analysis can live up to its potential as diagnostic tool in clinical practice.","Berkhout, Daniel J C; Benninga, Marc A; van Stein, Ruby M; Brinkman, Paul; Niemarkt, Hendrik J; de Boer, Nanne K H; de Meij, Tim G J",Sensors,592,9

Such systems focus on detecting clusters of syndromes in excess of baseline levels, which may indicate an outbreak. We model the detection limits of a potential system based on primary care consults for the detection of an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from an averaged-sized medical centre were extracted from the Patient Care Enhancement System (PACES) [the electronic medical records system serving the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)]. Thresholds were set to 3 or more cases presenting with particular syndromes and a temperature reading of >or=38oC (T >or=38). Monte Carlo simulation was used to insert simulated SARS outbreaks of various sizes onto the background incidence of febrile cases, accounting for distribution of SARS incubation period, delay from onset to first consult, and likelihood of presenting with T >or=38 to the SAF medical centre. RESULTS Valid temperature data was available for 2,012 out of 2,305 eligible syndromic consults (87.2%). T >or=38 was observed in 166 consults (8.3%). Simulated outbreaks would peak 7 days after exposure, but, on average, signals at their peak would consist of 10.9% of entire outbreak size. Under baseline assumptions, the system has a higher than 90% chance of detecting an outbreak only with 20 or more cases. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance based on clusters of cases with T >or=38 helps reduce background noise in primary care data, but the major limitation of such systems is that they are still only able to confidently detect large outbreaks.","Chen, Mark I C; Tan, Iain B H; Ng, Yih-Yng","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",592,26

METHODOLOGY We developed a novel ""marionette method""technique for performing SILC. Two 5 mm trocars were placed through a 1.5 cm transumbilical incision. In addition, a nylon suture with a laparoscopic sliding knot was used to tighten the fundus of the gallbladder and was thereafter suspended with this nylon suture. The neck of the gallbladder was tightened by means of a loop type retractor, to enable adequate visualization of the triangle of Calot. Dissection was performed as a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy using standard straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS All 20 patients successfully underwent a single-incision, two-trocar laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed using the marionette method. The mean operative time was 119 min. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS The marionette method can provide good tension and an appropriate laparoscopic view with a suitable surgical field for safely performing a dissection at the triangle of Calot during SILC.","Kuroki, Tamotsu; Adachi, Tomohiko; Kitasato, Amane; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Tajima, Yoshitsugu; Kanematsu, Takashi",Hepato-gastroenterology,592,9

The transmission and virulence of this new pathogen has raised concern for how best to protect operating room staff while effectively providing care to the infected patient requiring urgent or emergent surgery. Observations Establishment of a clear protocol that adheres to rigorous infection control measures while providing a safe system for interfacility transport and operative care is vital to a successful surgical pandemic response. While emergency protocols must be rapidly developed, they should be collaboratively improved and incorporate new knowledge as and when it becomes available. These measures combined with practice drills to keep operating room personnel ready and able should help construct processes that are useful, easy to follow, and tailored to the unique local environment of each health care setting. Conclusions After the initial apprehensions and struggles during our confrontation with the COVID-19 crisis, it is our hope that the experience we share will be helpful to surgical staff at other institutions grappling with the challenges of operative care in the pandemic environment. While this protocol focuses on the current COVID-19 pandemic, these recommendations serve as a template for surgical preparedness that can be readily adapted to infectious disease crisis that unfortunately might emerge in the future.","Arora, Vivek; Evans, Connie; Langdale, Lorrie; Lee, Alex","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",592,28

DATA SOURCES The 7 manuscripts submitted were reviewed and their major findings were compared with literature on the same or related topics. STUDY SELECTION Manuscripts address the use of molecular techniques in the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bacterial ribosome mutations, which may lead to ribosome-targeted drug resistance; pharmacogenomics as a clinical laboratory service and example of warfarin dosing using CYP2C9 mutation analysis; definition of the potential of cytosine arabinoside incorporation into DNA to disrupt transcription using an in vitro model of oligonucleotides; use of laser capture microdissection to isolate solid tumor cells free of nontumor cells; and molecular methods used to classify lymphomas. DATA SYNTHESIS Two current issues related to the use of molecular tests in the clinical laboratories are (1) decentralization of molecular-based testing to a variety of nonmolecular laboratories and (2) need for wider acceptance of molecular-based testing through its incorporation in clinical practice guidelines. Molecular methods have had a major impact on infectious disease through the rapid identification of new infectious agents, SARS, and the characterization of drug resistance. Pharmacogenomics identifies the genetic basis for heritable and interindividual variation in response to drugs. The incorporation of the nucleoside analog, cytosine arabinoside, into DNA leads to local perturbation of DNA structure and reduces the ability of transcription factors to bind to their specific DNA binding elements as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Laser capture microdissection of tumor cells can provide an adequate number of cells for whole genome amplification. Gene expression microassay profiles of various lymphomas have modified classification systems and predict prognosis and response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS The current -omics era will continue to emphasize the use of microarrays and database software for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic screening to search for a useful clinical assay. The number of molecular pathologic techniques will expand as additional disease-associated mutations are defined.","Kiechle, Frederick L; Zhang, Xinbo; Holland-Staley, Carol A",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,592,33

Various studies published globally have shown variable severity of disease and mortality. The objective of our study was to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in our setup. Methods in this descriptive case series, individuals with signs and symptoms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and asymptomatic patients with history of close contact to confirmed COVID-19 patients were considered for SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Epidemiological and clinical features of only PCR positive cases were recorded. Data regarding hospitalization status, exposure to known COVID-19 patients, clinical feature and clinical outcome of patients was collected and interpreted. Results A total of 266 patients were found to be SARS-CoV 2 PCR positive which were included in the study. Mean age of patients was 39.45±31.9 years and majority of the patients in our study were male, i.e., 238 (89.5%). Most common clinical features among COVID-19 symptomatic patients were fever and dry cough followed by myalgias and sore throat. Eighteen (7%) out of 266 died in our setup. Time duration of viral shedding after initial positive PCR varied between 11 days to up to more than 55 days. Conclusion Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) can present with wide range of clinical spectrum and disease can be life threatening. Severity of disease, requirement of ICU care and mortality were directly related to age of the patient and underlying comorbidities.

The present study aims to investigate the echocardiography findings in COVID-19 patients and possible correlations between the findings and the disease outcome. Methods In this cross-sectional study, baseline characteristics and echocardiographic findings of hospitalized COVID-19 cases, and their correlation with mortality were evaluated. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed to assess possible pulmonary embolism. In-hospital mortality was considered as the main outcome of the present study. Results 680 confirmed COVID-19 cases with the mean age of 55.15 ± 10.92 (range: 28 - 79) years were studied (63.09% male). Analysis showed that history of ischemic heart disease (RR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.08-1.19), history of hypertension (RR=1.04; 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), presence of embolism in main pulmonary artery (RR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.35-1.74), CT involvement more than 70% (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.1.01-1.16), left ventricular ejection fraction < 30 (RR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), pleural effusion (RR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.16), pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure 35 to 50 mmHg (RR=1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), right ventricular dysfunction (RR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.40-1.08), and collapsed inferior vena-cava (RR=1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08) were independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion Our study showed that cardiac involvement is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients. Echocardiography findings have independent prognostic value for prediction of in-hospital mortality. Since echocardiography is an easy and accessible method, echocardiography monitoring of COVID-19 patients can be used as a screening tool for identification of high-risk patients.","Pishgahi, Mehdi; Karimi Toudeshki, Kimia; Safari, Saeed; Yousefifard, Mahmoud",Archives of academic emergency medicine,592,1

To provide lactogenic immunity, eighteen lines of transgenic mice secreting a recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody (rIgG1) and ten lines of transgenic mice secreting recombinant IgA monoclonal antibodies (rIgA) neutralizing transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) into the milk were generated. Genes encoding the light and heavy chains of monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6A.C3 were expressed under the control of regulatory sequences derived from the mouse genomic DNA encoding the whey acidic protein (WAP) and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), which are highly abundant milk proteins. The MAb 6A.C3 binds to a highly conserved epitope present in coronaviruses of several species. This MAb does not allow the selection of neutralization escaping virus mutants. The antibody was expressed in the milk of transgenic mice with titers of one million as determined by RIA, and neutralized TGEV infectivity by one million fold corresponding to immunoglobulin concentrations of 5 to 6 mg per ml. Matrix attachment regions (MAR) sequences were not essential for rIgG1 transgene expression, but co-microinjection of MAR and antibody genes led to a twenty to ten thousand-fold increase in the antibody titer in 50% of the rIgG1 transgenic animals generated. Co-microinjection of the genomic BLG gene with rIgA light and heavy chain genes led to the generation of transgenic mice carrying the three transgenes. The highest antibody titers were produced by transgenic mice that had integrated the antibody and BLG genes, although the number of transgenic animals generated does not allow a definitive conclusion on the enhancing effect of BLG co-integration. Antibody expression levels were transgene copy number independent and integration site dependent. The generation of transgenic animals producing virus neutralizing antibodies in the milk could be a general approach to provide protection against neonatal infections of the enteric tract.","Castilla, J; Sola, I; Pintado, B; Sánchez-Morgado, J M; Enjuanes, L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,592,16

The CFD prediction of numerous jet configurations occurring in aerospace are discussed along with aeroelasticity for aeroengine and external aerodynamics, design optimization, unsteady flow modelling and aeroengine internal and external flows. It is concluded that there is a lack of detailed measurements (for both canonical and complex geometry flows) to provide validation and even, in some cases, basic understanding of flow physics. Not surprisingly, turbulence modelling is still the weak link along with, as ever, a pressing need for improved (in terms of robustness, speed and accuracy) solver technology, grid generation and geometry handling. Hence, CFD, as a truly predictive and creative design tool, seems a long way off.

METHODS Plasma inflammatory cytokine concentrations (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-alpha) were monitored longitudinally on admission, immediately before corticosteroids, and 1 to 2 days and 7 to 10 days after the drug treatment in a cohort of pediatric patients (n = 8) with virologic confirmed SARS-associated coronavirus infection. None of the patients required mechanical ventilation or intensive care treatment. All children except 1 (patient 3) received corticosteroids. RESULTS Plasma IL-1beta levels (excluding patient 3) were substantially elevated immediately before (range: 7-721 ng/L) and 7 to 10 days after (range: 7-664 ng/L) corticosteroid treatment. In contrast, the plasma concentrations of other key proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, were not overtly increased in any of the patients throughout the course of illness. In addition, plasma IL-10 concentration was significantly lower 1 to 2 days and 7 to 10 days after corticosteroid treatment, compared with the immediate pretreatment level. Similarly, plasma IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were significantly decreased 7 to 10 days after the drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS Pediatric SARS patients have markedly elevated circulating IL-1beta levels, which suggests selective activation of the caspase-1-dependent pathway. Other key proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, showed only mildly elevated levels at the initial phase of the illness. The current evidence does not support the use of TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody in this group of children.","Ng, Pak C; Lam, Christopher W K; Li, Albert M; Wong, Chun K; Cheng, Frankie W T; Leung, Ting F; Hon, Ellis K L; Chan, Iris H S; Li, Chi K; Fung, Kitty S C; Fok, Tai F",Pediatrics,592,5

Thus, to induce a maximal protective effect, it is desirable to apply vaccines by the mucosal route where virus infections start. Mucosal vaccines administered either orally or nasally have been shown to be effective in inducing antigen-specific immune responses at both systemic and mucosal compartments. However the mucosal antigen-specific immune response is weak because most protein antigens can evoke only a weak immune response when they are applied mucosally. Therefore, one strategy to overcome the weakness of the immune response is a co-administration of mucosal adjuvant with the vaccine antigen. Unfortunately, the development of safe and effective mucosal adjuvant has proved to be challenging. Cytokines are promising adjuvants because they are human-derived safe material and display potent immune-modulating functions. In this regards, we have created a mutant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), mTNF-K90R, that exhibits high bioactivity and resistance to proteases. In this report, we examined the potential of mTNF-K90R as a mucosal adjuvant and evaluated its effectiveness and safety.","Kayamuro, Hiroyuki; Yoshioka, Yasuo; Abe, Yasuhiro; Kamada, Haruhiko; Tsunoda, Shin-ichi; Tsutsumi, Yasuo",Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,592,16

Recently, it has been observed that individuals also consistently differ in their residual intraindividual variability (rIIV). This variation will probably have broad biological and methodological implications to the study of trait variation in labile traits, such as behaviour and physiology, though we currently need studies to quantify variation in rIIV, using more standardized and powerful methodology. Focusing on activity rates in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), we provide a model example, from sampling design to data analysis, in how to quantify rIIV in labile traits. Building on the doubly hierarchical generalized linear model recently used to quantify individual differences in rIIV, we extend the model to evaluate the covariance between individual mean values and their rIIV. After accounting for time-related change in behaviour, our guppies substantially differed in rIIV, and it was the active individuals that tended to be more consistent (lower rIIV). We provide annotated data analysis code to implement these complex models, and discuss how to further generalize the model to evaluate covariances with other aspects of phenotypic variation.","Mitchell, David J; Fanson, Benjamin G; Beckmann, Christa; Biro, Peter A",Royal Society open science,592,16

Its use in Western countries is still debated owing to concerns about its oncologic equivalence to open gastrectomy (OG). We sought to review and compare their operative outcomes and oncologic specimen quality (number of harvested lymph nodes and surgical margins) for gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). METHODS We reviewed the charts of all patients undergoing LAG (2007-2010) and OG (2000-2010) for GA in a single institution. Several surgeons performed the OGs, whereas 1 fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon performed LAGs. The primary outcome was quality of the surgical specimen, assessed by the number of harvested lymph nodes (LNs) and margin status. Secondary outcomes were perioperative events. Data were analyzed as intention to treat. RESULTS We retrieved 60 cases (47 OGs, 13 LAGs). The conversion rate was 23%. Mean operative time was 115 minutes longer and blood loss was 425 mL less (both p < 0.001) for LAGs. A mean of 14.4 (standard deviation [SD] 9.8) and 11.2 (SD 8.2) LNs were harvested for OGs and LAGs, respectively (p = 0.29). Negative margins were achieved for all patients. Mean length of stay was similar (LAG: 19 d v. OG: 18.9 d; p = 0.91). The groups did not differ on major postoperative complications (12.7% v. 23.1%; p = 0.39) or operative mortality (2.1% v. 7.7%; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic assisted gastrectomy is a challenging but safe and feasible procedure in experienced hands. It offers the same radical resection as OG regarding negative margins and LN retrieval. Long-term follow-up is warranted.","Hallet, Julie; Labidi, Saber; Bouchard-Fortier, Antoine; Clairoux, Ariane; Gagné, Jean-Pierre",Canadian journal of surgery. Journal canadien de chirurgie,592,14

This procedure is usually performed by automated dispersion of disinfectant on individuals when they go through a booth. This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report is a systematic review that synthesizes the evidence on the efficacy and safety of using these booths and provides recommendations to the Ministry of Health to facilitate decision-making regarding the relevance of using this technology. METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using Pubmed, Web of Science, INAHTA and GIN databases, from inception to June 4, 2020. Three independent reviewers selected eligible studies then extracted and synthesized the evidence. The synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary group of experts to provide recommendations. RESULTS Two scientific papers and a Malaysian HTA report were included in data synthesis. In light of the resources consulted, spraying disinfectants on humans in booths is not effective and can be toxic. Disinfectants are intended for use on surfaces, not on living tissue and spraying disinfectants on the outside of the body does not kill the virus inside an infected person's body. Furthermore, this procedure may increase the risk of neglecting other effective measures. CONCLUSION It is recommended to prohibit the use of disinfection booths in all structures.","Jameleddine Chtioui, Mouna; Harzallah, Nabil; Odabachian Jebali, Marie Christine; Grati, Hela; Njeh, Mansour; Dhidah, Lamine; Laadhari, Nizar; Hamouda, Chokri",La Tunisie medicale,592,16

The concept of social distancing is about limiting contacts between people, which breaks virus transmission chains, delays the increase in the number of infected people in the population and prevents overloading of health care systems. Many countries, including Poland, implemented a number of interventions aimed at limiting the number of infections and slowing down the tempo of the pandemic's spread. These are, among others, mass-scale testing, isolation of infected individuals, hand hygiene, breath etiquette and wearing mascs. Apart from these, a number of restrictions were enforced to ensure social distancing, such as closing down schools and universities, forbidding organising large parties and mass gatherings, limiting travels and use of public transport, increasing awareness of the public opinion on the necessity to stay at home, up to even introducing full lockdown with only the right to go out to buy food and medication or use the health care system. These interventions were gradually introduced in particular countries, in different ways, to a greater or lesser extent. Their effectiveness is largely influenced by the socio-economic and cultural factors, the nature of political and healthcare systems as well as the operating procedures used during their implementation. The implemented social distancing strategies prove to be effective, especially when combined with such actions as mass-scale testing, tracking contact chains, isolation and quarantine. The current work aims at making an overview of selected social distancing strategies and assessing their effectiveness in slowing down COVID-19 epidemic.","Lewtak, Katarzyna; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,592,27

Under such circumstances, research becomes critical to inform clinical care and protect future patients. Given that severely ill patients admitted to intensive care units are at high risk of mortality, establishing the cause of death at a histopathological level could prove invaluable in contributing to the understanding of COVID-19. Postmortem examination including autopsies would be optimal. However, in the context of high contagion and limited personal protective equipment, full autopsies are not being conducted in South Africa (SA). A compromise would require tissue biopsies and samples to be taken immediately after death to obtain diagnostic information, which could potentially guide care of future patients, or generate hypotheses for finding needed solutions. In the absence of an advance written directive (including a will or medical record) providing consent for postmortem research, proxy consent is the next best option. However, obtaining consent from distraught family members, under circumstances of legally mandated lockdown when strict infection control measures limit visitors in hospitals, is challenging. Their extreme vulnerability and emotional distress make full understanding of the rationale and consent process difficult either before or upon death of a family member. While it is morally distressing to convey a message of death telephonically, it is inhumane to request consent for urgent research in the same conversation. Careful balancing of the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence and justice becomes an ethical imperative. Under such circumstances, a waiver of consent, preferably followed by deferred proxy consent, granted by a research ethics committee in keeping with national ethics guidance and legislation, would fulfil the basic premise of care and research: first do no harm. This article examines the SA research ethics framework, guidance and legislation to justify support for a waiver of consent followed by deferred proxy consent, when possible, in urgent research after death to inform current and future care to contain the pandemic in the public interest.","Moodley, K; Allwood, B W; Rossouw, T M",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,592,16

The bacterium produces several virulence factors,whose principal ones are lipopolysaccharide and leukotoxin. The latter is cytotoxic only for ruminant leukocytes, a phenomenon that is correlated with its ability to bind and interact with the ruminant beta2-integrin Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen 1. This paper globally reviews all the information available on host-pathogen interactions underlying respiratory mannheimiosis (formerly pasteurellosis), from the stable and the Petri dish to the biochemical cascade of events triggered by the leukotoxin inside ruminant leukocytes. One conclusion can be made: the most widespread cattle respiratory disease with the most important impact on beef production worldwide, is probably due to a tiny ruminant-specific focal variation in the CD18- and/or CD11a-expressing genes.","Zecchinon, Laurent; Fett, Thomas; Desmecht, Daniel",Veterinary research,592,33

From a total of 61 healthy fox feces, 43 were positive for type II and 29 for type I CCV, out of which 25 were simultaneously positive for the two different genotypes. Among 24 raccoon dogs samples, 22 were CCV type II-positive, and from those 16 were additionally type I positive. No CCVs was detected from healthy mink feces. Sequence analysis found that ten type II CCVs fragments of M gene shared a high similarity with reference strain CCV 1-71 (96.5-99.5%), and four type I CCVs shared a high similarity (96.7%-98.1%) with a reported FCV-like CCV strain. The sequence of one particular M gene fragment was found to cluster between the type I and type II CCV branches in phylogenetic analysis, suggesting the existence of a novel strain.

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to have a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of older COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from December 2019 to May 3rd, 2020. Observational studies including older adults (age &#8805; 60 years) with COVID-19 infection and reporting clinical characteristics or outcome were included. Primary outcome was assessing weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of severity and outcomes. Secondary outcomes were clinical features including comorbidities and need of respiratory support. RESULT: Forty-six studies with 13,624 older patients were included. Severe infection was seen in 51% (95% CI- 36-65%, I2-95%) patients while 22% (95% CI- 16-28%, I2-88%) were critically ill. Overall, 11% (95% CI- 5-21%, I2-98%) patients died. The common comorbidities were hypertension (48, 95% CI- 36-60% I2-92%), diabetes mellitus (22, 95% CI- 13-32%, I2-86%) and cardiovascular disease (19, 95% CI - 11-28%, I2-85%). Common symptoms were fever (83, 95% CI- 66-97%, I2-91%), cough (60, 95% CI- 50-70%, I2-71%) and dyspnoea (42, 95% CI- 19-67%, I2-94%). Overall, 84% (95% CI- 60-100%, I2-81%) required oxygen support and 21% (95% CI- 0-49%, I2-91%) required mechanical ventilation. Majority of studies had medium to high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of older patients with COVID-19 have severe infection, one in five are critically ill and one in ten die. More high-quality evidence is needed to study outcomes in this vulnerable patient population and factors affecting these outcomes.","Singhal, Sunny; Kumar, Pramod; Singh, Sumitabh; Saha, Srishti; Dey, Aparajit Ballav",BMC Geriatr,592,16

We report a case of a patient who fully recovered from COVID-19 with intermittent negative RT-PCR testing and a symptom free interval who went on to develop a second infection. The patient's second infection resulted in a more severe clinical course. The patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome resulting in intubation twice and an extensive stay in the intensive care unit. Six weeks post-discharge, the patient was evaluated for continued dyspnea, hypoxia, and continued oxygen dependence. The patient subsequently underwent right heart catherization for further evaluation and was found to have newly developed pulmonary hypertension. Given the possibility of second wave infections this fall and winter, this case highlights the concern that re-infections with COVID-19 could cause substantially worse clinical outcomes and long-term complications. In terms of ongoing vaccine development, the short lived immune response in this case calls into question the ability of a future vaccine to provide long term lasting immunity against COVID-19.","Salcin, S A M E E N A; Fontem, F R A N K L I N",Respir Med Case Rep,592,33

ANOVA with post hoc tests (Tukey HSD) are utilized to reveal the mean difference of mental disorders between various employment status, as well as between reasons of unemployment. Binary logit model is used to investigate the potential effect of different reasons of unemployment on mental disorders. Individuals who were not working during the pandemic due to involuntary reasons had higher probabilities of mental disorders than those who were working and those who voluntarily separated from work. Among respondents who were not working due to COVID-19 related reasons, respondents whose employer went out of business were the most likely to experience mental disorders. Household job uncertainty in the next four weeks positively contributed to mental disorders.

In the semitime case the SIR model does not describe the quantities in the past;instead they only hold for times later than the initial time t = 0 of the newly occurring wave. Simple exact and approximative expressions are derived for the final and maximumvalues of the infected, susceptible and recovered/removedpopulation fractions as well the daily rate and cumulative number of new infections. It is demonstrated that two types of temporal evolution of the daily rate of newinfections j(τ) occur depending on the values of k and the initial value of the infected fraction I(0) = η: In the decay case for k 1 - 2η the daily rate monotonically decreases at all positive times from its initial maximum value j(0) = η(1 - η). Alternatively, in the peak case for k &lt; 1 - 2η the daily rate attains a maximum at a finite positive time. By comparing the approximated analytical solutions for j(τ) and J(τ) with the exact ones obtained by numerical integration, it is shown that the analytical approximations are accurate within at most only 2.5 percent.

To examine these relationships, we designed and preregistered the present study (https://osf.io/qfw9h). We assessed a large, heterogeneous sample including undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff of a large, public, Midwestern university (n = 1055) to ascertain whether personality domains uniquely predicted distress in response to COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. This was a three-panel study in which the same potential participant pools were invited to participate at each survey announcement. Data collection occurred between early March through late May 2020, from within days of local shelter-in-place order onset to within days of reaching 100,000 COVID-related deaths in the USA. Domain and distress scores were determined from self-reported ratings on the Big Five Inventory and the 21-Item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, respectively. Participants also reported personal experiences with six COVID-specific lifestyle impacts: insufficient outdoor or indoor living space, job insecurity, income insecurity, or taking care of or homeschooling school-aged children during working hours. Zero-order correlations revealed that all personality domains except openness had statistically significant correlations with distress, and all correlations were negative except for that of neuroticism. When entered simultaneously, neuroticism was the predominant risk factor of distress that held across all preregistered and exploratory analyses. Our expectation that extraversion would be negatively associated with distress was not supported broadly, while agreeableness was a unique potential risk factor (though this effect was mostly limited to exploratory analyses). The results especially highlight the link between employment and income uncertainty with psychological distress, while also identifying insufficient indoor and outdoor space as potential risk factors. We hope these findings inform future public health action and further emphasize the utility of personality trait models in general.","Balling, C. E.; Napolitano, S. C.; Lane, S. P.; Samuel, D.

Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibiliy, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptiblity with temporary immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.","Ng, Kok Yew; Gui, Meei Mei",,592,23

There is a sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; however, SARS-CoV-2 RBDs (receptor-binding domain) binds 20-fold strongly with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) than SARS-CoV. The study aims to investigate protein-protein interactions (PPI) of hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 RBD between wild and variants to detect the most influential interaction. Variants of hACE2 were retrieved from NCBI and subjected to determine the most pathogenic nsSNPs. Probability of PPIs determines the binding affinity of hACE2 genetic variants with RBD was investigated. Composition variations at the hACE2 and RBD were processed for PatchDock and refined by FireDock for the PPIs. Twelve nsSNPs were identified as the top pathogenic from SNPs (n = 7489) in hACE2 using eight bioinformatics tools. Eight RBD variants were complexed with 12 nSNPS of hACE2, and the global energy scores (Kcal/mol) were calculated and classified as very weak (-3.93 to -18.43), weak (-18.42 to -32.94), moderate (-32.94 to -47.44), strong (-47.44 to -61.95) and very strong (-61.95 to -76.46) zones.

Zonation of the five zones was established based on the scores to differentiate the effect of hACE2 and RBD variants on the binding affinity.

We introduce a single new parameter corresponding to a power-law exponent of the susceptibility distribution that characterizes the population heterogeneity. We show that our generalized model is as simple as the original model which is contained as a limiting case. Because of this simplicity, numerical solutions can be generated easily and key properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly. In particular, we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the epidemic, as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be quantified during an epidemic. We find that in strongly heterogeneous populations the epidemic reaches only a small fraction of the population. This implies that the herd immunity level can be much lower than in commonly used models with homogeneous populations. Using our model to analyze data for the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany shows that the reported time course is consistent with several scenarios characterized by different levels of immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the time course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or seasonality. Our analysis reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity in the population. Our work shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without increasing the complexity of the model. We show that information about population heterogeneity will be key to understand how far an epidemic has progressed and what can be expected for its future course.","Neipel, Jonas; Bauermann, Jonathan; Bo, Stefano; Harmon, Tyler; Julicher, Frank",,592,1

Finally, surgical excisions (SE) (+ 31.7%) increased, but sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (-29%) and lymph node dissections(LND) (-64%) decreased compared to the same period in 2019. Our experience supports the continuation of surgical and diagnostic procedures in patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgical and follow-up procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma should not be postponed considering that the pandemic is lasting for an extended period.","Filoni, Angela; Del Fiore, Paolo; Cappellesso, Rocco; Dall039,; Olmo, Luigi; Salimian, Nick; Spina, Romina; Tropea, Saveria; Rastrelli, Marco; Russano, Francesco; D039,; Amico, Mattia; Collodetto, Alessandra; Rossi, Carlo Riccardo; Buja, Alessandra; Vecchiato, Antonella; Alaibac, Mauro; Mocellin, Simone",Dermatol Ther,592,30

This multicentre prospective study explored the clinical course and outcomes of this hospitalised patient population, as, to date, the best approach has not been specifically addressed. METHODS: This study focused on the clinical features, laboratory parameters and outcomes of febrile infants up to 60 days old who tested positive for the virus and were hospitalised in Israel from March 2020 to January 2021. The data were extracted from a real-time prospective surveillance network for COVID-19 that includes 20 of the country's 26 hospitals. RESULTS: We identified 75 febrile young infants (60% female) with COVID-19 at a median age of 28 days (range 8-56 days). Of these, 84% had an unremarkable medical history, 29% had respiratory symptoms, and 96% had a mild illness. The Rochester criteria showed that 44% were considered at high-risk for serious bacterial infections, and we found that eight infants actually had concomitant bacterial infections. Outcomes were excellent, and no complications or fatalities were reported. CONCLUSION: The excellent outcomes of young febrile infants with COVID-19 closely resembled other respiratory viral aetiologies of fever in this age group, and there were no fatalities.","Yarden Bilavski, Havazelet; Balanson, Sarit; Damouni Shalabi, Ranaa; Dabaja-Younis, Halima; Grisaru-Soen, Galia; Youngster, Ilan; Glikman, Daniel; Ben Shimol, Shalom; Somech, Eli; Tasher, Diana; Stein, Michal; Gottesmanm, Giora; Livni, Gilat",Acta paediatr. scand,592,30

For otolaryngology evaluations, examination of the ear and oropharynx is important but difficult to achieve remotely. Objective: To assess the feasibility of patient use of low-cost digital videoscopes and smartphones for examination of the ear and oropharynx. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective quality improvement study was conducted in an academic adult otolaryngology clinic including 23 patients who presented for an in-person appointment and owned a smartphone device. The study was conducted from July 1 to 15, 2020. Interventions: Participants were asked to capture pictures and videos of their ear canals and oropharynx with digital videoscopes and their smartphones under real-time guidance over a telehealth platform. They were then surveyed about their experience. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were ratings by health care clinicians and a blinded otolaryngologist reviewer of image acceptability. Secondary outcomes included participant time to image acquisition and willingness to purchase digital videoscopes for telehealth use. Results: Of the 23 participants included, 14 were women (61%); mean age was 50 years (range, 21 to 80 years). Of the images obtained using the digital otoscope ear examination, 95% were considered acceptable by the health care clinicians and 91% were considered acceptable by the blinded reviewer; 16 participants (70%) reported that the otoscope was easy to use. The mean time to acquire images for both ears was 114 seconds (95% CI, 84-145 seconds). Twenty-one participants (91%) were willing to pay for a digital otoscope for telehealth use. For the oropharyngeal examination, a greater proportion of smartphone video examinations were considered acceptable by clinicians (63% acceptability) and the blinded reviewer (55%) compared with the digital endoscope (clinicians, 40%; blinded reviewer, 14%). The mean time required for the oropharyngeal examination smartphone video capture was shorter at 35 seconds compared with both the digital endoscope (difference, -27 seconds; 95% CI, -7 to -47 seconds) and smartphone photo capture (difference, -53 seconds; 95% CI, -20 to -87 seconds). Conclusions and Relevance: Digital otoscopes and smartphones apparently can facilitate remote head and neck physical examination in telehealth. Digital otoscopes were useful for ear examinations, and smartphone videos appeared to be the most useful for oropharyngeal examinations. Further studies are required to determine specific diagnostic capabilities in various telehealth practice settings.","Cai, Yi; Zheng, Yixuan James; Gulati, Arushi; Butrymowicz, Anna; Krauter, Roseanne; Pletcher, Steven D; Sharon, Jeffrey D; Goldberg, Andrew N; Chang, Jolie L",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t39=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions.","Gabrielli, Silvia; Rizzi, Silvia; Bassi, Giulia; Carbone, Sara; Maimone, Rosa; Marchesoni, Michele; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,592,16

Commonalities exist between the host immune response to viral infections and cancer. Here, we defined transcriptional signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection involving hundreds of genes common across lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (A549, Calu-3) and normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE), with additional signatures being specific to one or both adenocarcinoma lines. Cross-examining eight transcriptomic databases, we found that host transcriptional responses of lung adenocarcinoma cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection shared broad similarities with host responses to multiple viruses across different model systems and patient samples. Furthermore, these SARS-CoV-2 transcriptional signatures were manifested within specific subsets of human cancer, involving ~ 20% of cases across a wide range of histopathological types. These cancer subsets show immune cell infiltration and inflammation and involve pathways linked to the SARS-CoV-2 response, such as immune checkpoint, IL-6, type II interferon signaling, and NF-&#954;B. The cell line data represented immune responses activated specifically within the cancer cells of the tumor.

PDACs fast progression depends on the tumor characteristics and can be influenced by the microenvironment. The antibacterial drug acriflavine (ACF) has been shown to have anti-cancer activities in cell lines. Materials and Methods: To understand the working mechanism of ACF on cancer progression and tumor-stromal interplay, we evaluated pancreatic cancer in cell culture (Panc-1) (morphology, cell invasion and RNA expression) and the macrophage cell line THP1 (representing innate immune stromal cells). In the translational arm, the activity of ACF on xenograft models of human PDAC tumors representing different clinical subclasses was investigated (tumor growth, morphology and immunofluorescence, RNA expression and pathway analysis). Results: In vitro, ACF reduces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion of Panc-1 cells and shifts macrophage polarization to a M1-like anti-tumoral phenotype. At non-toxic concentrations, ACF downregulates cell metabolism. In xenografts, effect on tumor growth and metabolism could be confirmed; however, the innate immune stromal cells did not respond. Importantly, only in the moderately differentiated PDAC model, ACF could significantly suppress tumor growth and not in the fast-growing EMT-high model. Pathway analysis shows that ACF highly significantly downregulates metabolic pathways, especially OXPHOS and MYC/cell proliferation pathways in xenografts. Conclusion: ACF, with known pleiotropic effects on cancer cells, is in this study shown to be an attractive therapeutic based on its novel observed metabolic activity. Repurposing this compound for cancer treatment should be in the setting with other targeting agents, which offers reduced chance of resistance development in PDAC. Further evaluation should best be done in biological complex models such as human xenografts or syngeneic cancer models.","Bulle, Ashenafi; Dekervel, Jeroen; Deschuttere, Lise; Nittner, David; Van Cutsem, Eric; Verslype, Chris; van Pelt, Jos",Onco Targets Ther,592,16

Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface.

The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 µg mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability. The nanobiodevice was also tested using real patients and healthy samples, where the results had been already obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, and showed satisfactory results.

To combat this, administration of high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infection. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe antiviral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defence, cytoprotection and immunoregulation. Implementation of high-dose vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterials and antiviral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunosupportive properties. Supplemental vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the disease course and lessen complications of the disease.","Hoang, Ba X; Shaw, Graeme; Fang, Willian; Han, Bo",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,592,31

METHODS: We conducted a clinical trial involving adult outpatients with the moderate respiratory illness following COVID-19 infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either FBX or HCQ for 5 days. The measured variables were needs to hospitalisation, clinical and laboratory data including fever, cough, breathing rate, C-Reactive Protein level, lymphocytes count at onset of admission and was well as at 5 days of treatments. In addition, CT findings were evaluated on admission and 14 days after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study with a 1 to 1 ratio in FBX and HCQ groups. On admission, fever (66.7%), cough (87%), tachypnoea (44.4%), dyspnoea (35%), elevated CRP value (94.4%) and lung involvement according to chest CT (100%) were documented in enrolled patients with insignificant difference between FBX and HCQ groups. Fever, cough and tachypnoea were significantly mitigated in both groups after five days of treatments without any significant differences between groups. The mean percentages of lung involvement were significantly reduced to 7.3% and 8% after 14 days of treatment with FBX and HCQ, respectively. In adult outpatients with moderate COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness of FBX and HCQ was not different in terms of resolution of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and lung CT findings. CONCLUSION: This trial suggests that FBX is as an alternative treatment to HCQ for COVID-19 infection and may be considered in patients with a contraindication or precaution to HCQ.","Davoodi, Lotfollah; Abedi, Seyed Mohammad; Salehifar, Ebrahim; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza; Rouhanizadeh, Hamed; Khorasani, Ghasemali; Hosseinimehr, Seyed Jalal",Int J Clin Pract,592,16

In this paper, we unmask the institutionalized resilience of the Dutch health care system to pandemic crisis. Building on logics of crisis decision-making and on the notion of 'tact', we reveal how the Dutch government initially succeeded in orchestrating collective action through aligning public health purposes and installing socio-economic policies to soften societal impact. However, when the crisis evolved into a more enduring one, a more contested policy arena emerged in which decision-makers had a hard time composing and defending a united decision-making strategy. Measures have become increasingly debated on all policy levels as well as among experts, and conflicts are widely covered in the Dutch media. With the 2021 elections ahead, this means an additional test of the resilience of the Dutch socio-political and health care systems.","Wallenburg, Iris; Helderman, Jan-Kees; Jeurissen, Patrick; Bal, Roland",Health Econ Policy Law,592,16

Despite resource wealth Azerbaijan has a problem with public trust in institutions, which is revealed in the responses to Covid-19, especially its economic impacts. This research employs a mixed-method approach to explore Azerbaijan’s Covid-19 policy response and its socio-economic effects. An explorative analysis reveals the country’s poor level of preparedness before the pandemic and ambiguous public opinion on the government’s anti-pandemic policies. A substantial part of the population reports low self-perceived satisfaction with life, their financial situation and social environment, and significant concerns about the strict quarantine regime’s long duration and high probability of being unemployed. In addition, people’s satisfaction with life, financial situation, and social environment are statistically significant correlates of public opinion on Azerbaijan’s Covid-19 policy response. Therefore, the government should reconsider its current Covid-19 policy responses for future crisis management policies. Long-term disruption of economic life could have high socio-economic costs and repercussions for well-being, create institutional distrust and bring further instabilities. Enhancing public trust in the state should be a top priority in the government agenda.

CASES REPORT: We describe 2 patients with previous mild or no symptoms of COVID-19, admitted for acute stroke with recent/simultaneous myocardial infarction in whom admission polymerase chain reaction was negative but serologic testing diagnosed COVID-19. In these patients, concurrent stroke and myocardial infarction could have been promoted by COVID-19 infection. Management and evolution are detailed, and their contacts to confirm the COVID-19 infection. Pathogenic analysis of possible hypercoagulation state is described suggesting the hypothesis of endothelial dysfunction as the strongest mechanism involved in thrombus formation after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with these cases suggests that patients with mild symptoms can also present thromboembolic complications once the acute phase of COVID-19 infection has passed.","Ruiz-Ares, Gerardo; Jimenez-Valero, Santiago; Fernández-Prieto, Andrés; Arbas-Redondo, Emilio; Díaz-Pollán, Beatriz; Navia, Pedro; Meras, Pablo; Alonso de Leciñana, Maria; de Donebún, Jorge R P; Rigual, Ricardo; Fuentes, Blanca; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Neurologist,592,16

In the current mediatic era, orthopaedic surgeons need to refocus some of their time and energies from surgery to communication and constructive research. Only raising mediatic awareness on surgical site and implant-related infections may tune up the volume of silent epidemics to a level that can become audible by governing institutions.","Romanò, Carlo Luca; Drago, Lorenzo; Del Sel, Hernán; Johari, Ashok; Lob, Guenter; Mavrogenis, Andreas F; Benzakour, Thami",Int Orthop,592,26

Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However, molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward.","Gadêlha, Hermes; Hernández-Herrera, Paul; Montoya, Fernando; Darszon, Alberto; Corkidi, Gabriel",Sci. Adv,592,1

The Vilnius and Klaipeda city municipalities adopted action plans to support residents and businesses. Although there are many measures the plans have in common, they differ in the context and scope of application. Municipalities are willing to grant exemptions from various fees and taxes. They have used innovative measures: Vilnius allowed the opening of outdoor cafes, the practice, which was observed by global media. According to the research findings, the actions of municipal authorities can be successful, as municipalities are closer to the residents and can respond to their needs and those of entrepreneurs more quickly and flexibly.

However, most families do not have access to in-person, evidence-based treatment. We previously developed and tested DRIVE (Developing Relationships that Include Values of Eating and Exercise), a home-based parent training program to maintain body weight among children at risk for obesity, with the intent to eventually disseminate it nationally alongside SafeCare, a parent support program that focuses on parent-child interactions. Currently the DRIVE program has only been tested independently of SafeCare. This study created the ""mHealth DRIVE"" program by further adapting DRIVE to incorporate digital and mobile health tools, including remotely delivered sessions, a wireless scale that enabled a child-tailored weight graph, and a pedometer. Telehealth delivery via mHealth platforms and other digital tools can improve program cost-effectiveness, deliver long-term care, and directly support both families and care providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of the mHealth DRIVE program among children and parents who received it and among SafeCare providers who potentially could deliver it. METHODS: Study 1 was a 13-week pilot study of a remotely delivered mHealth family-based weight management program. Satisfaction surveys were administered, and height and weight were measured pre- and post-study. Study 2 was a feasibility/acceptability survey administered to SafeCare providers. RESULTS: Parental and child satisfaction (mean of 4.9/6.0 and 3.8/5.0, respectively) were high, and children's (N=10) BMI z-scores significantly decreased (mean -0.14, SD 0.17; P=.025). Over 90% of SafeCare providers (N=74) indicated that SafeCare families would benefit from learning how to eat healthily and be more active, and 80% of providers reported that they and the families would benefit from digital tools to support child weight management. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric mHealth weight management interventions show promise for effectiveness and acceptability by families and providers.

In this work, we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all discussion points. We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. We conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with Google Docs. We found that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. A second study demonstrated that in larger groups, Wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools.","Tian, Sunny; Zhang, Amy X.; Karger, David",,592,2

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, older people are particularly susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection developing into severe disease. The objective of this review was to examine the literature regarding factors that may explain the tendency of this population to develop severe COVID-19. Research articles considered in this review were searched for in EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science from December 2019 to December 2020. Citations were screened by two independent reviewers. Studies of the immune system in older individuals found alterations in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The adaptive system is depressed in its functions, and the innate system is in a pro-inflammatory state that can lead to chronic disease. This pro-inflammatory state may be related to a severe course of disease in COVID-19. This review shows that the level of evidence supporting an association between immune alterations in the elderly and susceptibly to severe progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally consistent. Preventive measures such as early antiviral treatment are of key importance for prevention of severe progression of COVID19.","Pedreañez, Adriana; Mosquera-Sulbaran, Jesus; Muñoz, Nelson",Arch Virol,592,29

Biochemical assessment of the spike protein is critical for understanding structure-function relationships and the roles of the protein in the viral life cycle. Coronavirus spike proteins are typically proteolytically processed and activated by host cell enzymes such as trypsin-like proteases, cathepsins, or proprotein-convertases. Analysis of coronavirus spike proteins by western blot allows the visualization and assessment of proteolytic processing by endogenous or exogenous proteases. Here, we present a method based on western blot analysis to investigate spike protein proteolytic cleavage by transient transfection of HEK-293 T cells allowing expression of the spike protein of the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the presence or absence of a cellular trypsin-like transmembrane serine protease, matriptase. Such analysis enables the characterization of cleavage patterns produced by a host protease on a coronavirus spike glycoprotein.","Whittaker, Gary R; Millet, Jean K",Methods Mol Biol,592,1

Among the three RLRs encoded by the human genome, RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, which contain N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, are activated upon the detection of viral RNAs in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. Activated RLRs induce downstream signaling via their interactions with mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins and activate the production of type I and III interferons and inflammatory cytokines. Recent studies have shown that RLR-mediated signaling is regulated by interactions with endogenous RNAs and host proteins, such as those involved in stress responses and posttranslational modifications. Since RLR-mediated cytokine production is also involved in the regulation of acquired immunity, the deregulation of RLR-mediated signaling is associated with autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Moreover, RLR-mediated signaling might be involved in the aberrant cytokine production observed in coronavirus disease 2019. Since the discovery of RLRs in 2004, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the activation and regulation of RLR-mediated signaling pathways. Here, we review the recent advances in the understanding of regulated RNA recognition and signal activation by RLRs, focusing on the interactions between various host and viral factors.","Onomoto, Koji; Onoguchi, Kazuhide; Yoneyama, Mitsutoshi",Cell Mol Immunol,592,1

However, there is little systematic tracking of global research and development. We present research on investments into infectious diseases research from funders in the G20 countries across an 18-year time period spanning 2000-17, comparing amounts invested for different conditions and considering the global burden of disease to identify potential areas of relative underfunding. METHODS: The study examined research awards made between 2000 and 2017 for infectious disease research from G20-based public and philanthropic funders. We searched research databases using a range of keywords, and open access data were extracted from funder websites. Awards were categorised by type of science, specialty, and disease or pathogen. Data collected included study title, abstract, award amount, funder, and year. We used descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation coefficient to investigate the association between research investment and disease burden, using Global Burden of Disease 2017 study data. FINDINGS: The final 2000-17 dataset included 94â074 awards for infectious disease research, with a sum investment of $104·9 billion (annual range 4·1 billion to 8·4 billion) and a median award size of $257â176 (IQR 62â562-770â661). Pre-clinical research received $61·1 billion (58·2%) across 70â337 (74·8%) awards and public health research received $29·5 billion (28·1%) from 19â197 (20·4%) awards. HIV/AIDS received $42·1 billion (40·1%), tuberculosis received $7·0 billion (6·7%), malaria received $5·6 billion (5·3%), and pneumonia received $3·5 billion (3·3%). Funding for Ebola virus ($1·2 billion), Zika virus ($0·3 billion), influenza ($4·4 billion), and coronavirus ($0·5 billion) was typically highest soon after a high-profile outbreak. There was a general increase in year-on-year investment in infectious disease research between 2000 and 2006, with a decline between 2007 and 2017. Funders based in the USA provided $81·6 billion (77·8%). Based on funding per 2017 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), HIV/AIDS received the greatest relative investment ($772 per DALY), compared with tuberculosis ($156 per DALY), malaria ($125 per DALY), and pneumonia ($33 per DALY). Syphilis and scabies received the least relative investment (both $9 per DALY). We observed weak positive correlation (r=0·30) between investment and 2017 disease burden. INTERPRETATION: HIV research received the highest amount of investment relative to DALY burden. Scabies and syphilis received the lowest relative funding. Investments for high-threat pathogens (eg, Ebola virus and coronavirus) were often reactive and followed outbreaks. We found little evidence that funding is proactively guided by global burden or pandemic risk. Our findings show how research investments are allocated and how this relates to disease burden and diseases with pandemic potential.

The in silico prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of hundred one 1,2,3-triazole-phtalimide derivatives, obtained from SciFinder® library, were investigated. Compounds that did not show good gastrointestinal absorption, violated the Lipinski's rules, proved to be positive for the AMES test, and showed to be hepatotoxic or immunotoxic in our ADMET analysis, were filtered out of our study. The hit compounds were further subjected to molecular docking on SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The ADMET analysis revealed that 43 derivatives violated the Lipinski's rules and 51 other compounds showed to be positive for the toxicity test. Seven 1,2,3-triazole-phthalimide derivatives (A7, A8, B05, E35, E38, E39, and E40) were selected for molecular docking and MFCC-ab initio analysis. The results of molecular docking pointed the derivative E40 as a promising compound interacting with multiple target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The complex E40-Mpro was found to have minimum binding energy of -10.26 kcal/mol and a general energy balance, calculated by the quantum mechanical analysis, of -8.63 eV. MD simulation and MMGBSA calculations confirmed that the derivatives E38 and E40 have high binding energies of -63.47 ± 3 and -63.31 ± 7 kcal/mol against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.

Purpose: In this study, silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-loaded nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)@ reduced graphene oxide (RGO) 3D scaffolds (AHRG scaffolds) were designed to alleviate bone infection, inhibit biofilm formation, and promote bone repair through the synergistic effects of AgNPs, RGO, and nHA. Materials and Methods: AHRGs were prepared using a one-step preparation method, to create a 3D porous scaffold to facilitate a uniform distribution of AgNPs and nHA. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was used as a model-resistant bacterium, and the effects of different silver loadings on the antimicrobial activity and cytocompatibility of materials were evaluated. Finally, a rabbit IBD model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the AHRG scaffold in vivo. Results: The results showed successful synthesis of the AHRG scaffold. The ideal 3D porous structure was verified using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction measurements revealed uniform distributions of AgNP and nHA. In vitro antibacterial and cytocompatibility indicated that the 4% AHRG scaffolds possessed the most favorable balance of bactericidal properties and cytocompatibility. In vivo evaluation of the IBD model showed promising treatment efficacy of AHRG scaffolds. Conclusion: The as-fabricated AHRG scaffolds effectively eliminated infection and inhibited biofilm formation.

Analysis included one-sided binomial exact tests and multiple linear, Poisson, and Beta regression models. The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min (10%). Age <40 years [estimated relative rate (rr) 0.017, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.207 to 0.494], cobicistat (rr 0.284, 95% CI 0.128 to 0.63), and tenofovir alafenamide (rr 0.295 95% CI 0.151 to 0.573) were associated with a decreased risk of GFR <60 mL/min. An increased AST and ALT &#8805;2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) was found in 5% and 3%, respectively. Hepatitis C and use of darunavir and lopinavir were associated with increased AST or ALT. When a GFR was <60 mL/min or an AST or ALT was &#8805;2 × ULN, no action was taken in 53% of cases. In 18% of cases the only intervention was repeat testing. The most common interventions after lipid results were calculation of a 10-year cardiovascular risk score (31%) and addition of a statin (18%). Taking action after lipid results was strongly associated with age &#8805;40 (rr 7.37, 95% CI 3.0 to 18.3).

The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise lasting at least a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT 2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ~7x10^40 erg/s, while AT 2020hat is almost one order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of Type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat shows a redder continuum already at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with velocities of 180 km/s, along with an Halpha emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity of 250 km/s. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an absolute magnitude M_F606W=-3.33+-0.09 mag and a colour F606W-F814W=1.14+-0.05 mag, which are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse supernova.

In this work we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node in a laser-cooled cloud of $^{87}$Rb atoms. We employ the DLCZ protocol where pairs of photons and single collective spin excitations (so called spin waves) are created in several temporal modes using a train of write pulses. To make the spin waves created in different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in multi-mode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout, we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each mode, we prove non-classical correlations between the first and second photon. Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory. The reported capability is a key element of a quantum repeater architecture based on multiplexed quantum memories.","Heller, Lukas; Farrera, Pau; Heinze, Georg; Riedmatten, Hugues de",,592,16

Methodology: Includes bibliographic research for thematic contextualization, and is exploratory and descriptive with practical applicability on subjects related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A search strategy was built on PubMed with 16 terms related to the theme in the MeSH Terms and Text Word fields. The study was published in 2021 in the Portuguese language. The metadata of the 85 publications were exported for analysis in a spreadsheet under the aspects of entry of the publication in PubMed, time until indexing with the MeSH terms and category of the publication. Results: About 89% of the publications, considering the sample of 62 items with MeSH Terms, had a delay in indexing of at least 15 days;and about 11% collapsed in 15 to 135 days. Conclusion: In order for researchers to be able to retrieve the most scientific content on COVID-19, it is essential that they are constructed of searches that contemplate the use of the MeSH controlled vocabulary term combined with the use of the nomenclature variations of the theme in other fields, such as Text Word, since publications may appear in the search engine, but have not yet been indexed, in order to retrieve a greater number of scientific literature already published. © 2021 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

Toward this end, we have identified a core peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated patients with COVID-19 who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression. Hence, contingent upon independent validation in other COVID-19 cohorts, individual traits within this signature may collectively and individually guide treatment options; offer insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis; and aid early, risk-based patient stratification that is particularly beneficial in phasic diseases such as COVID-19.","Laing, Adam G; Lorenc, Anna; Del Molino Del Barrio, Irene; Das, Abhishek; Fish, Matthew; Monin, Leticia; Muñoz-Ruiz, Miguel; McKenzie, Duncan R; Hayday, Thomas S; Francos-Quijorna, Isaac; Kamdar, Shraddha; Joseph, Magdalene; Davies, Daniel; Davis, Richard; Jennings, Aislinn; Zlatareva, Iva; Vantourout, Pierre; Wu, Yin; Sofra, Vasiliki; Cano, Florencia; Greco, Maria; Theodoridis, Efstathios; Freedman, Joshua; Gee, Sarah; Chan, Julie Nuo En; Ryan, Sarah; Bugallo-Blanco, Eva; Peterson, Pärt; Kisand, Kai; Haljasmägi, Liis; Chadli, Loubna; Moingeon, Philippe; Martinez, Lauren; Merrick, Blair; Bisnauthsing, Karen; Brooks, Kate; Ibrahim, Mohammad A A; Mason, Jeremy; Lopez Gomez, Federico; Babalola, Kola; Abdul-Jawad, Sultan; Cason, John; Mant, Christine; Seow, Jeffrey; Graham, Carl; Doores, Katie J; Di Rosa, Francesca; Edgeworth, Jonathan; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Hayday, Adrian C",Nat Med,592,16

Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women.

The hypothetical pathogenetic process for covid-19 could occur in three phases: a) Viral phase, asymptomatic or weakly symptomatic, with an a-specific innate immune response; b) Immunological phase, intermediately symptomatic, with an anomalous specific immune response (delayed, slow and/or low synthesis of IgM and IgG) in antigen excess conditions, immune complex formation and complement activation with tissue damages; c) Hemo-vascular phase, severely symptomatic, where complement-mediated tissue damages would induce vascular inflammation and systemic alteration of the coagulation homeostasis. This hypothesis is well supported by the immune-histochemical and microscopic demonstration in severe patient lungs of co-localized spike viral proteins, terminal components of the activated complement system (C5b-9 membrane attack complex) and microvascular deposits of small fibrin thrombi. This picture could be aggravated by the involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, releasing additional lytic and inflammatory factors. Thus, covid-19 would arise as a simple viral infection, develop as a diffuse immune complex hypersensitivity and explode as a systemic hemo-vascular pathology. If this hypothesized process would be real, suitable therapeutic interventions might be carried out, able to interfere with or block the critical factors in the various phases.","Manzo, Giovanni",Front Immunol,592,16

From an Enamine database of a billion compounds, 3978 compounds with potential antiviral activity were selected for screening and induced fit docking that funneled down to eight compounds with good docking score and docking energy. Detailed analysis of non-covalent interactions at the active site and the apparent match of the molecule with the shape of the binding pocket were assessed. All the compounds show significant interactions for tight binding.

This study explored the mechanism and prevention of such injuries and devised a novel emergent strategy, which was supported by a multicenter self-controlled study in 1161 frontline healthcare professionals. In this study, according to the anatomy of the face and the characteristics of facial pressure injuries, a respirator liner was designed using a polyurethane foam to redistribute the pressure across the face. A preclinical crossover trial was performed on eight participants to evaluate its efficacy. The strategy was then widely applied among 11 100 healthcare workers in seven frontline hospitals, and 1161 of them were sampled for a questionnaire investigation. The preclinical crossover trial showed that the novel strategy was very effective in preventing facial pressure injuries. The questionnaire investigation showed that pain score, wearing disturbance, and the incidence of pressure injury in the healthcare professionals were significantly correlated with wearing time (all &#961; = 0.986). The new strategy significantly reduced the incidence of pressure injury from 84.7% to 11.1%, pain score IQR from 5 (2) to 1 (2), and wearing disturbance rate from 91.6% to 6.3%, and the results analyzed according to individual hospitals or different wearing time showed similar trends (all P < .0005).

Tomographic experiments usually require a vast amount of tilt series to be acquired by means of high-end transmission electron microscopes with important operational running-costs. Although the throughput and reliability of automated data acquisition routines have constantly improved over the recent years, the process of selecting regions of interest at which a tilt series will be acquired cannot be easily automated and it still relies on the user's manual input. Therefore, the set-up of a large-scale data collection session is a time-consuming procedure that can considerably reduce the remaining microscope time available for tilt series acquisition. Here, the protocol describes the recently developed implementations based on the SerialEM package and the PyEM software that significantly improve the time-efficiency of grid screening and large-scale tilt series data collection. The presented protocol illustrates how to use SerialEM scripting functionalities to fully automate grid mapping, grid square mapping, and tilt series acquisition. Furthermore, the protocol describes how to use PyEM to select additional acquisition targets in off-line mode after automated data collection is initiated. To illustrate this protocol, its application in the context of high-end data collection of Sars-Cov-2 tilt series is described. The presented pipeline is particularly suited to maximizing the time-efficiency of tomography experiments that require a careful selection of acquisition targets and at the same time a large amount of tilt series to be collected.","Weis, Felix; Hagen, Wim J H; Schorb, Martin; Mattei, Simone",J. vis. exp,592,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiac involvement is a common feature of IIM and inherited muscle diseases. Frequency according to disease subtype varies, with serotype having particular influence in IIM, and genotype in the inherited muscle diseases. Innovative techniques for examining cardiac function have been investigated further, including speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance tomography. The present work has highlighted a likely underestimate of the burden of cardiac disease to date. The complex relationship between IIM, atherosclerosis, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors has been further elucidated. Consensus recommendations for managing patients with inherited muscle diseases and prominent cardiac involvement have been recently published. In addition to supportive care, disease modifying treatments are increasingly becoming available for inherited muscle diseases which may also improve cardiac outcomes. SUMMARY: Cardiac involvement is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We suggest having a low threshold for considering the possibility of cardiac involvement in all patients with muscle disease.","Lilleker, James B; Roberts, Mark; Diederichsen, Louise",Curr Opin Rheumatol,592,1

LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. &quot;Cytokine storm&quot; is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria. As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction. With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death. Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the &quot;cytokine storm&quot;. Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened. The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value. In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on &quot;cytokine storm&quot; according to the potential herbs in the &quot;National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)&quot;.

This trend is especially acute in those students who do not take STEM content during their secondary or high school education. This disinterest might be conditioned by negative emotions towards science developed by students during the different educational stages, even from an early age. In this sense, active teaching methodologies, such as gamification, play a fundamental role in fostering positive emotions towards learning STEM content. Within the wide range of gamification methodologies, we find educational Escape Rooms. Due to the current situation generated by COVID-19, many of the lessons have had to be adapted to a virtual format through various online platforms. In this study, in a preliminary manner, we aim to analyze the effects on the affective domain produced by a virtual Escape Room used in a STEM course as an instructional tool to teach contents about the Universe to teachers in training. According to the results obtained, the positive emotions of “happiness”, “satisfaction” and “fun” are significantly increased after the intervention. At the same time, some negative emotions, such as “nervousness”, “frustration” and “worry” also increase, partly due to the components typically found in this type of games. Based on these results, it is concluded that, despite the existence of both positive and negative emotions, the results are promising and the intervention is motivating and stimulating for the students. © 2021.

However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH 3cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH 3cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of I K(DR)elicitation with effective IC 50values of 10.1 or 2.8 μM, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 μM. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of I K(DR)was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)failed to be overcome by further addition of either α,β-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K +current with the IC 50value of 2.5 μM. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of I K(M)elicited by long-lasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporation-induced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC 50value of 5.8 μM. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined I K(DR)amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both I K(DR)and I K(M)occurring in a non-genomic fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which in vivo cellular functions are seriously perturbed.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Liu, Ping-Yen; Gao, Zi-Han; Lee, Shih-Wei; Lee, Wen-Kai; Wu, Sheng-Nan",Front.

The design of the device resulted from an interdisciplinary approach attempting to mix valuable techniques from User Experience exploratory research, with the typical way of conducting overcrowding investigations in outdoors and wild areas. We began by reframing both nature and overcrowding as experiences and defining overcrowding as a disturbance to the nature experience. This lead to a new idea for a more beneficial investigation of visitor's perception, which is moment-to-moment and in context. The device supports recording someone's subjective perception of overcrowding in space and time, with minimal task load or distraction from the nature experience. The streamlined design affords only two buttons with competing functionalities: one to signal ""there are too many people at the park""and another for ""the park is too empty"". The device continuously records time, location, and press-down button events, storing everything locally and anonymously, within the boundaries of European GDPR. We applied our method to a field study at the Þingvellir National Park in Iceland, both a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage. We then analyzed the collected data and visualized where and when the visitors reported overcrowding. Initial results indicate that by complementing traditional questionnaires with moment-to-moment self-reporting, we could successfully estimate the disturbance from overcrowding over time and place, thus producing a deeper insight into the quality of the experience than questionnaires alone. Our results also speak of some intrinsic qualities of the outdoor infrastructure. The outcome has the potential to make park managers, designers, landscape architects and rangers more capable of understanding the complex interrelation between infrastructure and visitor flow, thus contributing towards the goals of a long-term sustainable management of the area. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Pedica, C.; Diamanti, M.; Vilhjálmsson, H.

A multidisciplinary team of experts was assembled that worked in a collaborative manner with colleagues in Myanmar, first to identify problems related to managing snakebite and then develop interventions aimed to improve selected problem areas. A broad approach was adopted, covering antivenom production, antivenom distribution and health system management of snakebite. Problems identified in antivenom production included poor snake husbandry resulting in poor survival of captive specimens, lack of geographical diversity; poor horse husbandry, resulting in high mortality, inadequate stock acquisition protocols and data collection, and inappropriate immunisation and bleeding techniques; and inadequate production capacity for freeze dried antivenoms and quality control systems. These problems were addressed in various ways, resulting in some substantial improvements. Antivenom distribution is being reorganised to achieve better availability and utilisation of stock. Health system management of snakebite was assessed across all levels within the area selected for the study, in Mandalay region.

Motivated by the proposal of federated learning, we aim for a solution with which agents will never share their local observations with a central entity, and will be allowed to only share a private copy of his/her own information with their neighbors. We first propose a decentralized bandit algorithm \texttt{Gossip\_UCB}, which is a coupling of variants of both the classical gossiping algorithm and the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bandit algorithm. We show that \texttt{Gossip\_UCB} successfully adapts local bandit learning into a global gossiping process for sharing information among connected agents, and achieves guaranteed regret at the order of $O(\max\{ \texttt{poly}(N,M) \log T, \texttt{poly}(N,M)\log_{\lambda_2^{-1}} N\})$ for all $N$ agents, where $\lambda_2\in(0,1)$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expected gossip matrix, which is a function of $G$. We then propose \texttt{Fed\_UCB}, a differentially private version of \texttt{Gossip\_UCB}, in which the agents preserve $\epsilon$-differential privacy of their local data while achieving $O(\max \{\frac{\texttt{poly}(N,M)}{\epsilon}\log^{2.5} T, \texttt{poly}(N,M) (\log_{\lambda_2^{-1}} N + \log T) \})$ regret.","Zhu, Zhaowei; Zhu, Jingxuan; Liu, Ji; Liu, Yang",,592,16

An anonymised and validated e-survey featuring 30 questions was circulated among rheumatologists and other specialists over social media to understand preferences while choosing target journals, publishing standards, commercial editing services, preprint archiving, social media and alternative publication activities. Of 108 respondents, a significant proportion were clinicians (68%), researchers (60%) and educators (47%), with median 23 publications and 15 peer-review accomplishments. The respondents were mainly rheumatologists from India, Ukraine and Turkey. While choosing target journals, relevance to their field (69%), PubMed Central archiving (61%) and free publishing (59%) were the major factors. Thirty-nine surveyees (36%) claimed that they often targeted local journals for publishing their research. However, only 18 (17%) perceived their local society journals as trustworthy. Occasional publication in the so-called predatory journals (5, 5%) was reported and obtaining support from commercial editing agencies to improve English and data presentation was not uncommon (23, 21%). The opinion on preprint archiving was disputed; only one-third believed preprints were useful. High-quality peer review (56%), full and immediate open access (46%) and post-publication social media promotion (32%) were identified as key anticipated features of scholarly publishing in the foreseeable future. These perceptions of surveyed scholars call for greater access to free publishing, attention to proper usage of English and editing skills, and a larger role for engagement over social media.","Gupta, Latika; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Zimba, Olena; Misra, Durga Prasanna",Rheumatol Int,592,1

Study Design: Cross-sectional analytical study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Pathology, Army Medical College, in collaboration with Pak Emirates Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, from Mar to May 2020. Methodology: The sample comprised of 326 patients. Non-purposive consecutive sampling technique was used with inclusion criteria of COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test(RT-PCR) of sub acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2(SARS-CoV-2) of all age groups. ABO blood grouping was done by test tube method. The results were compared with recent surveys of ABO blood group distribution in general population of Pakistan. Results: The ABO blood group distribution of normal population was compared with COVID-19 patients. The blood group A was found to be 122(37.4%) having significant association with COVID infection and mortality but blood group O had least prevalence 71(21.8%) with COVID-19 infection. The p-value was calculated using Chi-square test which was p=0.04. Conclusion: Blood group A had a significant association where as people with blood group O had a least association for COVID-19 infection and severity. The findings of the present study can be used in clinical management of the COVID-19 and that blood group A population is more susceptible to acquire COVID-19 infection, further more can develop complications with high mortality rate.

Keeping this hypothesis intact, the present study describes for the first-time, Grazoprevir, an FDA approved anti-viral drug primarily approved for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), mediated multiple pathway control via synergistic inhibition of viral entry targeting host cell Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2)/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and viral replication targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Molecular modeling followed by in-depth structural analysis clearly demonstrated that Grazoprevir interacts with the key residues of these targets. Futher, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations showed stability and burial of key residues after the complex formation. Finally, Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) analysis identified the governing force of drug-receptor interactions and stability. Thus, we believe that Grazoprevir could be an effective therapeutics for the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic with a promise of unlikely drug resistance owing to multiple inhibitions of eukaryotic and viral proteins, thus warrants further clinical studies.","Behera, Santosh Kumar; Vhora, Nazmina; Contractor, Darshan; Shard, Amit; Kumar, Dinesh; Kalia, Kiran; Jain, Alok",Sci Rep,592,20

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries, infecting 8089 individuals and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries, with a mortality rate of ~34%. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and has spread to 220 countries, infecting over 100,000,000 people and causing more than 2,000,000 deaths to date. These three human coronaviruses cause diseases of varying severity. Most people develop mild, common cold-like symptoms, while some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The success of all viruses, including coronaviruses, relies on their evolved abilities to evade and modulate the host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory immune responses. However, we still do not fully understand the transmission, phylogeny, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Despite the rapid application of a range of therapies for SARS-CoV-2, such as convalescent plasma, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and type I interferon, no fully effective treatment has been determined. Remarkably, COVID-19 vaccine research and development have produced several offerings that are now been administered worldwide. Here, we summarise an up-to-date understanding of epidemiology, immunomodulation and ongoing anti-viral and immunosuppressive treatment strategies. Indeed, understanding the interplay between coronaviruses and the anti-viral immune response is crucial to identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention, which may even prove invaluable for the control of future emerging coronavirus.","Zhang, Yamei; Gargan, Siobhan; Lu, Yongxu; Stevenson, Nigel J",Viruses,592,1

A number of vaccines have already achieved emergency use authorization based on data from large phase 3 field efficacy clinical trials. However, our knowledge about the extent and durability of this immunity, and the breadth of vaccine coverage against SARS-CoV-2 variants is still evolving. In this narrative review, we summarize the latest and rapidly developing understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including what we have learned about the key antigens of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain), their importance in vaccine development, the immediate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, breadth of coverage of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, contributions of preexisting immunity to related coronaviruses, and duration of immunity. We also discuss lessons from newer approaches, such as systems serology, that provide insights into molecular and cellular immune responses elicited and how they relate to the trajectory of infection, and potentially inform immune correlates of protection. We also briefly examine the limited research literature on immune responses in special populations, such as pregnant women and children.","Fergie, Jaime; Srivastava, Amit",Front Immunol,592,24

Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM).

Healthcare disparities in low-income and middle-income countries and in some rural areas in developed countries make it a challenge to mitigate these health, socioeconomic and political consequences on our globalised society. As with IDs, cancer requires rapid intervention and its effective medical management and prevention encompasses the other major NCDs. Furthermore, the technology and clinical capability for cancer care enables management of NCDs and IDs. Global health initiatives that call for action to address IDs and cancer often focus on each problem separately, or consider cancer care only a downstream investment to primary care, missing opportunities to leverage investments that could support broader capacity-building. From our experience in health disparities, disaster preparedness, government policy and healthcare systems we have initiated an approach we call flex-competence which emphasises a systems approach from the outset of program building that integrates investment among IDs, cancer, NCDs and disaster preparedness to improve overall healthcare for the local community. This approach builds on trusted partnerships, multi-level strategies and a healthcare infrastructure providing surge capacities to more rapidly respond to and manage a wide range of changing public health threats.","Coleman, C Norman; Mansoura, Monique K; Marinissen, Maria Julia; Grover, Surbhi; Dosanjh, Manjit; Brereton, Harmar D; Roth, Lawrence; Wendling, Eugenia; Pistenmaa, David A; O039,; Brien, Donna M",,592,1

We aimed to compare the findings on planar PYP scintigraphy alone to that of routinely performed PYP SPECT. METHODS: PYP scintigraphy data of 133 patients (53% men; mean age 76 years) were evaluated. SPECT was routinely performed following 1-hour planar imaging, in all cases. Semiquantitative visual score and heart-to-contralateral (H/CL) ratio were determined in all patients as recommended. RESULTS: PYP images from 35 patients (26%) were considered to be positive based on SPECT myocardial uptake. Among them, 20 (57%) had a H/CL ratio &#8805;1.5 and 34 had a visual score &#8805; 2. SPECT identified myocardial uptake in one patient with a visual score < 2 and refuted the presence of myocardial uptake in two patients with a visual score &#8805; 2. Visual score correlated well with SPECT (r = 0.94; P < .0001) and had an accuracy of 98% for tomographic myocardial uptake. Addition of H/CL ratio reduced the diagnostic performance of visual score. CONCLUSIONS: Planar-derived visual score has an excellent accuracy for tomographic myocardial uptake, though it misclassifies a small proportion of patients. H/CL ratio decreases the diagnostic certainty of planar imaging. Tomographic imaging prevents misdiagnoses and should always be performed.","Asif, Talal; Gomez, Javier; Singh, Vasvi; Doukky, Rami; Nedeltcheva, Arlet; Malhotra, Saurabh",J. nucl. cardiol,592,1

A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","Palomar-Fernández, Carmen; Álvarez-Díaz, Ana",Farm Hosp,592,25

The easily transmissible SARS-CoV-2, emerging at the end of 2019 in China, spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. While the world waits for mass vaccination, there is an urgent need for effective drugs as short-term weapons to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this context, the drug repurposing approach is a strategy able to guarantee positive results rapidly. In this regard, it is well known that several nucleoside-mimicking analogs and nucleoside precursors may inhibit the growth of viruses providing effective therapies for several viral diseases, including HCoV infections. Therefore, this review will focus on synthetic nucleosides and nucleoside precursors active against different HCoV species, paying great attention to SARS-CoV-2.

RECENT FINDINGS: Healthcare facilities around the world have reported outbreaks of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast some centres have reported a decrease in baseline rates due to a number of possible factors. SUMMARY: While implementing crucial preventive measures for COVID-19, is it important to consider any collateral effects of changes in IPC and antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) practices. The disruption caused to IPC and ASP practices during the pandemic are likely to see a counter intuitive increase in transmission of MDROs.","Sun Jin, Louisa; Fisher, Dale",Curr Opin Infect Dis,592,24

Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","Brufsky, Adam",J Med Virol,592,26

METHODS: We compared serum Ig levels across platforms of viral antigens and antibodies with 15 positive and 30 negative SARS-CoV-2 controls followed by viral neutralization assessment. We then applied these platforms to a clinically relevant cohort of 114 individuals with unknown histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: In controls, the best performing virus-specific antibody detection platforms were SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG [specificity 87%, sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) 93%], spike IgG3 [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%], and nucleocapsid protein (NP) IgG [specificity 93%, sensitivity 97%, PPV 93%, NPV 97%]. Neutralization of positive and negative control sera showed 100% agreement. 20 unknown individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 16 demonstrating virus neutralization. Spike IgG3 provided the highest accuracy for predicting serologically positive individuals with virus neutralization activity [Misidentified 1/20 unknowns compared to 2/20 for RBD and NP IgG]. CONCLUSION: The coupling of virus neutralization analysis to a spike IgG3 antibody test is optimal to categorize patients for correlates of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection status.","Rathe, Jennifer A; Hemann, Emily A; Eggenberger, Julie; Li, Zhaoqi; Knoll, Megan L; Stokes, Caleb; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Netland, Jason; Takehara, Kennidy K; Pepper, Marion; Gale, Michael",J. infect. dis,592,29

Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively.

While MR-proADM is useful for risk stratification in patients with sepsis, clinical data about prediction accuracy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) is currently missing. Methods: We included consecutively adult patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at a tertiary care center in Switzerland between February and April 2020. We investigated the association of MR-proADM levels with in-hospital mortality in logistic regression and discrimination analyses. Results: Of 89 included COVID-19 patients, 19% (n=17) died while in the hospital. Median admission MR-proADM levels (nmol/L) were increased almost 1.5-fold increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (1.3 [interquartile range IQR 1.1-2.3]) vs. 0.8 [IQR 0.7-1.1]) and showed good discrimination (area under the curve 0.78). An increase of 1 nmol/L of admission MR-proADM was independently associated with a more than fivefold increase in in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 5.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-21.4, p=0.015). An admission MR-proADM threshold of 0.93 nmol/L showed the best prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 60% and a negative predictive value of 97%. Kinetics of follow-up MR-proADM provided further prognostic information for in-hospital treatment.

A standardized questionnaire was administered by phone interviews to determine patients' perceptions, attitudes, and adherence to therapy and identify the frequency of COVID-19 infection, psoriasis status, and new comorbidities during the pandemic. All patients had been receiving a biological agent including ustekinumab, etanercept, adalimumab, secukinumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, or certolizumab pegol. Ninety-one patients (68.4%) had at least one comorbid condition, including psoriatic arthritis (35.3%), hypertension (19.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.5%), obesity, coronary artery disease, and dyslipidemia.

All but one patient restarted their medications as a result of therapeutic counseling. Five patients reported suspicious symptoms, but only one had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Our findings suggest that biologic treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis would not pose an additional risk for COVID-19 infection and its life-threatening complications, even in the presence of a high frequency of cardiometabolic comorbidities, provided that all patients are informed and necessary pandemic-directed precautions are well adopted by the patients.","Polat Ekinci, Algün; Pehlivan, Gizem; Gökalp, Mehmet Onur",Dermatol Ther,592,1

The study is presented as a potential methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of statutory social distancing policy. Patients and Methods: Twenty-seven states in the United States and, separately, 12 European countries were selected which had clearly defined and dated establishment of statewide or national mandates for social distancing measures from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) data. Mandated social distancing measures considered in this study include: School closures, Prohibition on mass gatherings, business closures, stay at home orders, severe travel restrictions, and closure of non-essential businesses. The state/country Covid-19 peak mortality rate (PMR) was defined as the initial averaged normalized maximum during which social distancing mandates were in effect. Mandate-days were defined as the total days legislative mandates were in place to the PMR. Results: The normalized peak mortality rate in the US and in Europe did not demonstrate a statistically significant correlation to the total mandate days (R-squared=0.053, p=0.246, R-squared=2.4E-06, p=0.996). A significant correlation was found between normalized mortality rate and state/country population density (R-squared=0.524, p=0.00002,R-squared=0.397, p=0.0281). Discussion: The analysis appears to suggest no mandate effective reduction in Covid-19 mortality rate to its defined initial peak when interpreting their mean-effect.

The effective reproduction numbers (R) for the increasing phase, the transition phase and the state-of-emergency phase in the first wave of the disease were estimated as 1.78 (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.73-1.82), 0.74 (95% CrI: 0.71-0.78) and 0.63 (95% CrI: 0.61-0.65), respectively, in Tokyo and as 1.58 (95% CrI: 1.51-1.64), 1.20 (95% CrI: 1.15-1.25) and 0.48 (95% CrI: 0.44-0.51), respectively, in Osaka. Projections showed that a 50% decrease in the high-risk transmission is required to keep R less than 1 in both locations-a level necessary to maintain control of the epidemic and minimize the risk of resurgence.","Jung, S.

So far, there is no complete survey of older patients in a German district that includes both outpatients and inpatients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we aimed to investigate risk factors, mortality, and functional outcomes of all patients with COVID-19 aged 70 and older living in the district of Tübingen in the southwest of Germany. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all 256 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in one of the earliest affected German districts during the first wave of the disease from February to April 2020. To ensure inclusion of all infected patients, we analysed reported data from the public health department as well as the results of a comprehensive screening intervention in all nursing homes of the district (n = 1169). Furthermore, we examined clinical data of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109). RESULTS: The all-cause mortality was 18%. Screening in nursing homes showed a point-prevalence of 4.6%. 39% of residents showed no COVID-specific symptoms according to the official definition at that time. The most important predictors of mortality were the need for inpatient treatment (odds ratio (OR): 3.95 [95%-confidence interval (CI): 2.00-7.86], p<0.001) and care needs before infection (non-hospitalized patients: OR: 3.79 [95%-CI: 1.01-14.27], p = 0.037, hospitalized patients: OR: 2.89 [95%-CI 1.21-6.92], p = 0.015). Newly emerged care needs were a relevant complication of COVID-19: 27% of previously self-sufficient patients who survived the disease were not able to return to their home environment after discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the importance of a differentiated view of risk groups and long-term effects within the older population. These findings should be included in the political and social debate during the ongoing pandemic to evaluate the true effect of COVID-19 on healthcare systems and individual functional status.","Herrmann, Matthias L; Hahn, Johannes-Martin; Walter-Frank, Birgit; Bollinger, Desiree M; Schmauder, Kristina; Schnauder, Günter; Bitzer, Michael; Malek, Nisar P; Eschweiler, Gerhard W; Göpel, Siri",PLoS One,592,16

METHODS: Review of the current state of knowledge regarding the viral etiology of COVID-19, mechanisms of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effect of individual DMTs on the risk of infection and COVID-19 disease expression. RESULTS: Although data are limited, MS DMTs do not obviously increase the risk of acquiring symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The severe morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be largely the consequence of an overly robust immune response rather than the consequence of unchecked viral replication. The effects of specific MS DMTs on the immune response that may increase the risk of impaired viral clearance and their potential counterbalancing beneficial effects on the development of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are reviewed. CONCLUSION: Although there is currently insufficient real-world experience to definitively answer the question of the effect of a specific MS DMT on COVID-19, registries presently in nascent form should provide these answers. This review provides an approach to addressing these concerns while the data are being accumulated. Early insights suggest that the risk of infection and associated morbidity of COVID-19 in this population is little different than that of the population at large.","Berger, Joseph R; Brandstadter, Rachel; Bar-Or, Amit",,592,7

However, the details of RNA synthesis in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present a time-scaled, gene-comparable transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that ACGAAC functions as a core TRS guiding the discontinuous RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 from a holistic perspective. During infection, viral transcription, rather than genome replication, dominates all viral RNA synthesis activities. The most highly expressed viral gene is the nucleocapsid gene, followed by ORF7 and ORF3 genes, while the envelope gene shows the lowest expression. Host transcription dysregulation keeps exacerbating after viral RNA synthesis achieves to the top. The most enriched host pathways are metabolism-related. Two of them (cholesterol and valine metabolism) affect viral replication in reverse. Furthermore, the activation of numerous cytokines emerges before the large-scale viral RNA synthesis. Importance SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current severe global health emergency that began at the end of 2019. Although the universal transcriptional strategies of coronaviruses are preliminarily understood, the details of RNA synthesis, especially the time-matched transcription level of each SARS-CoV-2 gene and the principles of subgenomic mRNA synthesis, are not clear. The coterminal subgenomic mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 present obstacles in identifying the expression of most genes by PCR-based methods, which is exacerbated by the lack of related antibodies. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-related metabolic imbalance and cytokine storm are receiving increasing attention from both clinical and mechanistic perspectives. Our transcriptomic research provides information on both viral RNA synthesis and host responses, in which the transcription-regulating sequences and transcription levels of viral genes are demonstrated, and the metabolic dysregulation and cytokine levels identified at the host cellular level support the development of novel medical treatment strategies.","Wang, Xuefeng; Zhao, Yudong; Yan, Feihu; Wang, Tiecheng; Sun, Weiyang; Feng, Na; Wang, Wenqi; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu; Gao, Yuwei",J Virol,592,16

Because fibrosis with persistent physiological deficit is a previously described feature of patients recovering from similar coronaviruses, treatment represents an early opportunity to modify the disease course, potentially preventing irreversible impairment.Objectives: Determine the incidence of and describe the progression of persistent inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD) following SARS-CoV-2 when treated with prednisolone.Methods: A structured assessment protocol screened for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis. Eight hundred thirty-seven patients were assessed by telephone 4 weeks after discharge. Those with ongoing symptoms had outpatient assessment at 6 weeks. Thirty patients diagnosed with persistent interstitial lung changes at a multidisciplinary team meeting were reviewed in the interstitial lung disease service and offered treatment. These patients had persistent, nonimproving symptoms.Results: At 4 weeks after discharge, 39% of patients reported ongoing symptoms (325/837) and were assessed. Interstitial lung disease, predominantly organizing pneumonia, with significant functional deficit was observed in 35/837 survivors (4.8%). Thirty of these patients received steroid treatment, resulting in a mean relative increase in transfer factor following treatment of 31.6% (standard deviation [SD] ± 27.6, P < 0.001), and forced vital capacity of 9.6% (SD ± 13.0, P = 0.014), with significant symptomatic and radiological improvement.Conclusions: Following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, a cohort of patients are left with both radiological inflammatory lung disease and persistent physiological and functional deficit.

This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results.

Although human sciences research stresses the key role of social influence in behaviour change, most COVID-19 campaigns emphasize the disease's medical threat. In a global data set (n = 6,674), we investigated how social influences predict people's adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Bayesian regression analyses controlling for stringency of local measures showed that people distanced most when they thought their close social circle did. Such social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing to do. People's adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens, but only if they felt deeply bonded with their country. Self-vulnerability to the disease predicted distancing more for people with larger social circles. Collective efficacy and collectivism also significantly predicted distancing. To achieve behavioural change during crises, policymakers must emphasize shared values and harness the social influence of close friends and family.","Tunçgenç, Bahar; El Zein, Marwa; Sulik, Justin; Newson, Martha; Zhao, Yi; Dezecache, Guillaume; Deroy, Ophelia",,592,24

The aim of this study was to reach a consensus among experts as to the possible applications of telemedicine in the proctologic field. METHODS: A group of 55 clinical practice recommendations was developed by a clinical guidance group based on coalescence of evidence and expert opinion. The Telemedicine in Proctology Italian Working Group included 47 Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery nominated experts evaluating the appropriateness of each clinical practice recommendations based on published RAND/UCLA methodology in 2 rounds. RESULTS: Stakeholder median age was 53 years (interquartile range limits 40-60), and 38 (81%) were men. Nine (19%) panelists reported no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. Agreement was obtained on a minimum of 3 to 5 years of practice in the proctologic field before starting teleconsultations, which should be regularly paid, with advice and prescriptions incorporated into a formal report sent to the patient by e-mail along with a receipt. Of the panelists, 35 of 47 (74%) agreed that teleconsultation carries the risk of misdiagnosis of cancer, thus recommending an in-person assessment before scheduling any surgery. Fifteen additional clinical practice recommendations were re-elaborated in the second round and assessed by 44 of 47 (93.6%) panelists. The application of telemedicine for the diagnosis of common proctologic conditions (eg, hemorrhoidal disease, anal abscess and fistula, anal condylomas, and anal fissure) and functional pelvic floor disorders was generally considered inappropriate. Teleconsultation was instead deemed appropriate for the diagnosis and management of pilonidal disease. CONCLUSION: This e-consensus revealed the boundaries of telemedicine in Italy.

However, the data comparing between these two vaccines in the same setting are limited. ObjectivesTo determine adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 in health care workers (HCWs). DesignThis prospective study was conducted from February to July 2021. SettingA single center, university-based tertiary care center in Bangkok. ParticipantsHealthy HCWs. ExposureTwo doses of CoronaVac (4 weeks apart) or ChAdOx1 (8 weeks apart) intramuscularly. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSelf-reported AEs were collected for 7 days following each vaccination using electronic diary. The immunogenicity was determined by the level of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 subunit). The 50% plaque reduction neutralization tests against original Wuhan strain and circulating VOCs were performed in subset of samples at 2 weeks after the second dose. ResultsOf the 360 HCWs, 180 received each vaccine. The median (interquartile range: IQR) age was 35 (29-44) years old and 84.2% were female. Participants who received ChAdOx1 reported higher frequency of AEs than those received CoronaVac after both the first dose (84.4% vs. 66.1%, P < 0.001) and second dose (75.6% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.002), with more AEs in those younger than 30 years of age for both vaccines. The seroconversion rate was 75.6% and 100% following the first dose of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1, respectively. All participants seroconverted at 2 weeks after the second dose. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels induced by CoronaVac was lower than ChAdOX1 with geometric means of 164.4 and 278.5 BAU/mL, respectively (P = 0.0066). Both vaccines induced similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain, geometric mean titer (GMT) of 337.4 vs 331.2; however, CoronaVac induced significantly lower GMT against Alpha (23.1 vs. 92.5), Delta (21.2 vs. 69.7), and Beta (10.2 vs. 43.6) variants, respectively. Conclusions and RelevanceCoronaVac induces lower measurable antibodies but with lower frequency of AEs than ChAdOx1. The low neutralizing antibodies against the circulating VOCs induced by CoronaVac supports the need for earlier boosting to prevent breakthrough infections.

FindingsThis prospective study in 360 healthy health care workers reported higher frequency of adverse events following ChAdOx1 than CoronaVac particularly in those younger than 30 years old. The ChAdOx1 induced 3.3-4.3 times higher neutralising antibodies against VOCs than CoronaVac. MeaningThe 2-dose CoronaVac vaccination induced significantly lower level of neutralizing antibody against the circulating VOCs.

Gavi-supported countries continue to implement and report strategies that aim to address implementation challenges and improve equity. This paper summarizes the first mapping of these strategies from country reports. METHODS: Thirteen Gavi-supported countries were purposively selected with emphasis on Gavi's priority countries. Following a scoping of different documents submitted to Gavi by countries, 47 Gavi Joint Appraisals (JAs) for the period 2016-2019 from the 13 selected countries were included in the mapping. We used a consolidated framework synthesized from 16 different equity and health systems frameworks, which incorporated UNICEF's coverage and equity assessment approach - an adaptation of the Tanahashi model. Using search terms, the mapping was conducted using a combination of manual search and the MAXQDA qualitative analysis tool. Pro-equity strategies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and compiled in an Excel database, and then populated on a tableau visualization dashboard. RESULTS: In total, 258 pro-equity strategies were implemented by the 13 sampled Gavi-supported countries between 2016 and 2019. The framework determinants of social norms, utilization, and management and coordination accounted for more than three-quarters of all pro-equity strategies implemented in these countries. The median number of strategies reported per country was 17. Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Uganda reported the highest number of strategies that we considered as pro-equity. CONCLUSION: Findings from this mapping can be useful in addressing equity gaps, reaching partially immunized, and 'zero-dose' vaccinated children, and valuable resource for countries planning to implement pro-equity strategies, especially as immunization stakeholders reimagine immunization delivery in light of COVID-19, and as Gavi finalizes its fifth organizational strategy. Future efforts should seek to identify pro-equity strategies being implemented across additional countries, and to assess the extent to which these strategies have improved immunization coverage and equity.","Dadari, Ibrahim; Higgins-Steele, Ariel; Sharkey, Alyssa; Charlet, Danielle; Shahabuddin, Asm; Nandy, Robin; Jackson, Debra",Vaccine,592,12

Health emergencies are a critical psychosocial risk factor for nurses. In general, psychosocial risks constitute serious problems as they impact workers' health, productivity, and efficiency. Despite their importance, few studies analyze nurses' psychosocial risks during a health emergency caused by a pandemic or analyze their perception of the emergency and its relation to such risks. Objectives: To analyze the perception of COVID-19 by nurses, especially about measures, resources, and impact on their daily work. Also, to analyze these professionals' psychosocial risks and the relationship between perception of COVID-19 and these risks. Methods: A descriptive correlational study was performed in a convenience sample of 92 nurses from two public hospitals in the Valencian Community (Spain), (74 women, 79.1%), aged 24-63 (M = 43.37, SD = 11.58). Data were collected via an online self-completed questionnaire during the rise of the pandemic from March 29 to April 8, when the number of infections went from 78,797 to 146,690. Results: The measures and resources available about COVID-19 are relatively low, and the impact on their work is high. Similarly, the most prominent psychosocial risks appear to be emotional work and workload. In contrast, nurses' work engagement is medium, and their satisfaction is high. Finally, there seems to be a negative and significant relationship between the information available to nurses, the measures implemented, and resources with some of their psychosocial risks, and a positive one with job satisfaction and work engagement. There is also a positive and significant relationship only between the impact of COVID-19 and their work inequality, but not for other risks. Conclusions: The resources, measures, and information can be a protective factor facing nurses' psychosocial risks, especially during a pandemic. Studying the relationships between psychosocial risk and perception of a health emergency would be relevant and fundamental to protecting and caring for nurses, health professionals, and society.","Giménez-Espert, María Del Carmen; Prado-Gascó, Vicente; Soto-Rubio, Ana",Front Public Health,592,14

Okara is a by-product obtained during soybean processing for soy milk and soybean curd (tofu), which is rarely utilized and can be a cheap potential dietary fiber (DF) resource. In this study, the structure and physicochemical properties of insoluble dietary fiber (SIDF) extracted from okara were characterized, and the prebiotic effects on fat metabolism were investigated in vivo. The results showed that the main monosaccharides of SIDF (90.50%) identified were galactose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose and glucose. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses suggested that SIDF had a loose and porous structure, polysaccharide functional groups, and a typical crystalline cellulose I structure. In addition, SIDF had ideal oil-adsorption capacity (OAC; 7.95 g g-1) and significantly improved cholesterol adsorption (11.14 mg g-1) at pH 7.0. In vivo, IDF supplementation reduced the serum lipid levels and inhibited hepatic fat accumulation. Additionally, SIDF administration improved hepatic steatosis by stimulating lipolysis via upregulation of PPAR&#945;, CYP4a10 and CPT1a. This is the first systematic study on the composition, structure, physicochemical properties, adsorption function and biological effects of SIDF. The above results show that SIDF could be used as an ideal functional ingredient in food processing as well as play a positive role in improving the added value of okara and promoting its comprehensive utilization.","Wang, Sainan; Sun, Wanling; Swallah, Mohammed Sharif; Amin, Khalid; Lyu, Bo; Fan, Hongliang; Zhang, Zhao; Yu, Hansong",Food funct,592,1

These automatic solutions will help reduce the need for manual analysis of content. Most previous literature has cast the hate speech detection problem as a supervised text classification task using classical machine learning methods or, more recently, deep learning methods. However, work investigating this problem in Arabic cyberspace is still limited compared to the published work on English text. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify hate speech related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted by Twitter users in the Arab region and to discover the main issues discussed in tweets containing hate speech. METHODS: We used the ArCOV-19 dataset, an ongoing collection of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19, starting from January 27, 2020. Tweets were analyzed for hate speech using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model; each tweet was given a score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most hateful text. We also used nonnegative matrix factorization to discover the main issues and topics discussed in hate tweets. RESULTS: The analysis of hate speech in Twitter data in the Arab region identified that the number of non-hate tweets greatly exceeded the number of hate tweets, where the percentage of hate tweets among COVID-19 related tweets was 3.2% (11,743/547,554). The analysis also revealed that the majority of hate tweets (8385/11,743, 71.4%) contained a low level of hate based on the score provided by the CNN. This study identified Saudi Arabia as the Arab country from which the most COVID-19 hate tweets originated during the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that the largest number of hate tweets appeared during the time period of March 1-30, 2020, representing 51.9% of all hate tweets (6095/11,743). Contrary to what was anticipated, in the Arab region, it was found that the spread of COVID-19-related hate speech on Twitter was weakly related with the dissemination of the pandemic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (r=0.1982, P=.50). The study also identified the commonly discussed topics in hate tweets during the pandemic. Analysis of the 7 extracted topics showed that 6 of the 7 identified topics were related to hate speech against China and Iran. Arab users also discussed topics related to political conflicts in the Arab region during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic poses serious public health challenges to nations worldwide. During the COVID-19 pandemic, frequent use of social media can contribute to the spread of hate speech. Hate speech on the web can have a negative impact on society, and hate speech may have a direct correlation with real hate crimes, which increases the threat associated with being targeted by hate speech and abusive language. This study is the first to analyze hate speech in the context of Arabic COVID-19-related tweets in the Arab region.","Alshalan, Raghad; Al-Khalifa, Hend; Alsaeed, Duaa; Al-Baity, Heyam; Alshalan, Shahad",J Med Internet Res,592,16

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Ten hospitals in the Chicago metropolitan area. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted between March 1 and April 8, 2020, were included. We evaluated sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with intubation and prolonged intubation for acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Of the 486 hospitalized patients included in the study, the median age was 59 years (interquartile range, 47-69); 271 (55.8%) were male; and the median body mass index was 30.6 (interquartile range, 26.5-35.6). During the hospitalization, 138 (28.4%) patients were intubated; 78 (56.5%) were eventually extubated; 21 (15.2%) died; and 39 (28.3%) remained intubated at a mean ± SD follow-up of 19.6 ± 6.7 days. Intubated patients had a significantly higher median age (65 vs 57 years, P < .001) and rate of diabetes (56 [40.6%] vs 104 [29.9%], P = .031) as compared with nonintubated patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified age, sex, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, history of diabetes, and shortness of breath as factors predictive of intubation. Age and body mass index were the only factors independently associated with time to extubation. CONCLUSION: In addition to clinical signs of respiratory distress, patients with COVID-19 who are older, male, or diabetic are at higher risk of requiring intubation. Among intubated patients, older and more obese patients are at higher risk for prolonged intubation. Otolaryngologists consulted for airway management should consider these factors in their decision making.","Hur, Kevin; Price, Caroline P E; Gray, Elizabeth L; Gulati, Reeti K; Maksimoski, Matthew; Racette, Samuel D; Schneider, Alexander L; Khanwalkar, Ashoke R",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,592,20

In this study, we consider a mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission with the prosocial awareness effect. The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness-free, disease-free equilibrium are studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle invariance principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of unique awareness-free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and deaths from Colombia and India. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate and the learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for reduction in disease-related deaths.

To address this lack of PEE, new solutions have been researched. Among those, full-face snorkeling masks demonstrated to be an interesting option. Among surgical specialties otolaryngologists and thoracic surgeons are at high risk of infection, due to the close contact with airway secretions. OBJECTIVES: We tested the comfort and usability of a modified full-face snorkeling mask (Ocean Reef Mask Aria QR+) as a protective device for otolaryngologic and thoracic surgeries. METHODS: The mask was customized with a 3D-printed adaptor supporting many industrial filter types, including FFP3 and heat and moisture ex- changers (HME). We evaluated surgical performances of the mask, both subjectively, with a questionnaire filled in by the surgeons, as well as objectively, monitoring transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2 values of surgeons during surgical procedures. RESULTS: The modified full-face snorkeling mask was tested during 9 otolaryngologic and 15 thoracic surgery procedures. The device demonstrated very good overall vision quality with some limitations regarding lateral vision and almost no difficulties in usability. Water condensation into the mask was absent in almost every case. Both PO2 and PCO2 param- eters remained within normal ranges during every procedure. DISCUSSION: The modified full-face snorkeling mask can be an innovative PPE. In the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the worldwide shortage of protective masks and goggles may exploit this ready-to-use and low-cost solution, especially for high-risk surgical procedures.","Cacco, Tommaso; Fragale, Marco; Sampieri, Claudio; Castello, Eolo; Risso, Carlo; Piras, Maria Teresa; Durando, Paolo; Montecucco, Alfredo; Pariscenti, Gian Luca; Peretti, Giorgio",Med Lav,592,16

Early in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, HHFNC was underutilized due to concern for viral aerosolization. Studies have since shown that HHFNC has a similar aerosolization risk as a standard oxygen mask prompting increased usage of HHFNC in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We sought to determine if the usage of HHFNC reduced the odds of intubation or the number of ventilator days for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing electronic health record data from the University of Colorado Health System. We included all adult patients admitted to intensive care units between February 1st, 2020 and May 3rd, 2020 with a diagnosis of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and COVID-19. We divided patients into two groups: patients who received HHFNC and patients who did not receive HHFNC. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared. Results: A total of 193 patients were included, of which 41 (21.2%) received HHFNC support. Age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and comorbidities were similar between both groups. CRP was slightly higher and creatinine lower in the HHFNC group. We found that patients who used HHFNC were 76.5% less likely to receive mechanical ventilation (p&lt;0.001). Patients who were supported with HHFNC spent an average of 5.1 more days on mechanical ventilation (p=0.025). The odds of death were estimated to be 39.4% lower for those who used HHFNC after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol use, prone positioning, corticosteroid use and Remdesivir use) however this effect estimate was not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found that patients with COVID-19 who received HHFNC were less likely to be intubated, which is consistent with previously published data. Those who did require intubation remained on mechanical ventilation for a longer duration. Our study did not detect any differences in mortality between the HHFNC group and the non-HHFNC group. These findings suggest HHFNC may be a useful modality for treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 that may reduce the need for mechanical ventilators during local shortages.","Fakhri, S.; Balaban, E.; Hippensteel, J.

This retrospective study included confirmed Covid-19 hypoxemic patients treated by at least one prone position session. Primary outcome was pulse oximetry over inspired oxygen fraction ratio (SpO2/FiO2) before, during, and after prone position. Secondary outcomes were failure, adverse events, and poor tolerance rate. Twenty-seven patients were included. During first, second and third sessions, SpO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly higher during posture than before (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001 respectively). Eighteen patients were responders (defined as an improvement of SpO2/FiO2 of more than 50) during the first posture and have a shorter length of hospital stay than non-responder patients. Failure rate was 5%, and poor tolerance and adverse events rates were 8% and 7% respectively.

However, research pertaining to these effects within the afterschool setting remains limited. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of a community-based afterschool running and reading program on executive functioning in 8 to 12-year-old children. Method: Fifty participants were initially recruited to participate in this study. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection was terminated prematurely which resulted in a sample size of 15 participants. Participants (N = 10) from School 1 completed two batteries of executive function assessments (i.e., inhibition, switching, and updating) separated by 15-min of running or 15-min of sedentary reading. Whereas, only 5 participants from School 2 completed assessments of executive functioning prior to and following the running portion of the program (due to the early termination of data collection). Results: Overall, executive function scores improved across each assessment following the running condition when compared to the reading condition (School 1). Inhibition scores significantly improved, and these effects were very large (School 1). Across both schools, improvements in executive functioning following the running portion of the program ranged from small-large in effect size. Conclusion: Findings from the present study provide initial evidence for the acute effects of a community-based afterschool running and reading program on executive functioning in children.

Most commonly, subhalos are defined to reside inside a spherical overdensity boundary such as the virial radius. The resulting host-subhalo relations depend sensitively on the somewhat arbitrary overdensity threshold, but the impact of this dependence is rarely quantified. The recently proposed splashback radius tends to be larger and to include more subhalos than even the largest spherical overdensity boundaries. We systematically investigate the dependence of the subhalo fraction on the radius definition and show that it can vary by factors of unity between different spherical overdensity definitions. Using splashback radii can yet double the abundance of subhalos compared to the virial definition. We also quantify the abundance of flyby (or backsplash) halos, hosts that used to be subhalos in the past. We show that the majority of these objects are mislabeled satellites that are naturally classified as subhalos when we use the splashback radius. We compare our results to self-similar universes to show that the subhalo and flyby fractions are not universal with redshift and cosmology.","Diemer, Benedikt",,592,23

We report a fatal case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.

Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system.","Iavicoli, Sergio; Boccuni, Fabio; Buresti, Giuliana; Gagliardi, Diana; Persechino, Benedetta; Valenti, Antonio; Rondinone, Bruna Maria",PLoS One,592,1

PURPOSE: We describe the implementation of a pharmacist-provided pharmacogenomics (PGx) service in an executive health program (EHP) at an academic medical center. SUMMARY: As interest in genomic testing grows, pharmacists have the opportunity to advance the use of PGx in EHPs, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. In November 2018, a pharmacist-provided PGx service was established in the EHP at the University of Colorado Hospital. The team members included 3 physicians, a pharmacist trained in PGx, a registered dietitian/exercise physiologist, a nurse, and 2 medical assistants. We conducted 4 preimplementation steps: (1) assessment of the patient population, (2) selection of a PGx test, (3) establishment of a visit structure, and (4) selection of a billing model. The PGx consultations involved two 1-hour visits. The first visit encompassed pretest PGx education, review of the patient's current medications and previous medication intolerances, and DNA sample collection for genotyping. After this visit, the pharmacist developed a therapeutic plan based on the PGx test results, discussed the results and plan with the physician, and created a personalized PGx report. At the second visit, the pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results, personalized the PGx report, and discussed the PGx-guided therapeutic plan with the patient. Overall, the strategy worked well; minor challenges included evaluation of gene-drug pairs with limited PGx evidence, communication of information to non-EHP providers, scheduling issues, and reimbursement. CONCLUSION: The addition of a PGx service within an EHP was feasible and provided pharmacists the opportunity to lead PGx efforts and collaborate with physicians to expand the precision medicine footprint at an academic medical center.","Liko, Ina; Corbin, Lisa; Tobin, Eric; Aquilante, Christina L; Lee, Yee Ming",Am. j. health system pharm,592,10

In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10·6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 - RR. FINDINGS: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51-0·82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% [3·22-3·32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155-0·246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80·5% (95% CI 75·4-84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 [0·179-0·251], estimated protection 78·8% [74·9-82·1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7-62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% [72·1-83·2] vs female 79·1% [73·9-83·3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3-6 months of follow-up 79·3% [74·4-83·3] vs &#8805;7 months of follow-up 77·7% [70·9-82·9]). INTERPRETATION: Our findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.

The acute inflammation and coagulation abnormalities appear as the main causes for thousands of deaths worldwide. The intense inflammatory response could be involved with the formation of thrombi. For instance, the presence of uncleaved large multimers of von Willebrand (vWF), due to low ADAMTS13 activity in plasma could be explained by the inhibitory action of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1ß and C reactive protein. In addition, the damage to endothelial cells after viral infection and/or activation of endothelium by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; induces platelets and monocyte aggregation in the vascular wall and expression of tissue factor (TF). The TF expression may culminate in the formation of thrombi, and activation of cascade by the extrinsic pathway by association with factor VII. In this scenario, the phosphatidylserine-PtdSer exposure on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane as consequence of viral infection emerges as another possible underlying mechanism to acute immune inflammatory response and activation of coagulation cascade. The PtdSer exposure may be an important mechanism related to ADAM17-mediated ACE2, TNF-&#945;, EGFR and IL-6R shedding, and the activation of TF on the surface of infected endothelial cells. In this review, we address the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. Moreover, we introduce key biochemical and pathophysiological concepts that support the possible participation of PtdSer exposure on the outer side of the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells membrane, in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

In the meantime, plastic surgeons postponed their appointments due to the fair and rational allocation of medical supplies. These limitations made all junior and senior residents perform operations only on traumatic patients rather than those needing reconstructive procedures. This study aims to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on plastic surgery training programs in Iran. Also, the number of canceled surgeries will be determined to see the effects of the pandemic on the patients. Methods: This retrospective case study considers a six-month timeframe in two consecutive years before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, the researchers evaluated the number of surgeries, types of procedures, age distribution, and gender distribution. The training program data of plastic surgery residents were collected from their logbooks and then analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05 at a 95% confidence level. Results: The total number of surgeries decreased by 23.5% after the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.05). There was a 29.9% reduction in trauma cases, -78.9% in aesthetic surgeries, -17.7% in reconstructive surgeries, -51.8% in craniofacial surgeries, and -59.5%in microscopic surgeries for each resident. Conclusions: This study provides an insight into the severity of the pandemic effects on the plastic surgery training programs and the patients. The reduced number of surgeries led to a depletion in surgical skills training.

The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.","Sanchez-Guzman, Daniel; Boland, Sonja; Brookes, Oliver; Mc Cord, Claire; Lai Kuen, René; Sirri, Valentina; Baeza Squiban, Armelle; Devineau, Stéphanie",Sci Rep,592,14

The pandemic has tested the robustness of comprehensive stroke care programs. Especially during the months of confinement, an alarming increase in the incidence of several risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases was noticed, without, however, the proportional strengthening of strategies for the prevention and/or control of comorbidities. Patients who had already suffered a stroke were neglected from the secondary prevention routine and neurological rehabilitation therapies. Regarding the acute treatment, the fear of contagion in the hospital environment promoted a significant delay in the time from the onset of symptoms to admission to an emergency department as well as in the door to imaging and door to needle times. Moreover, the pandemic also exposed the enormous inequalities in the approach to cerebrovascular diseases worldwide. Actually, many consequences of COVID-19 in stroke care will persist for months even after pandemic control. Strategies to combat the pandemic must be reconciled with the fight against stroke in a way that does not exclude any patient from access to the best possible care.","Vitturi, Bruno Kusznir",SN Compr Clin Med,592,16

METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that anosmia and ageusia were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, followed by appetite loss and fever. Simultaneous losses of taste and smell but not taste preferences were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.01, odds ratio 2.28). CONCLUSIONS: Complete, but not partial, losses of taste and smell were the best predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, healthy persons with sudden simultaneous complete loss of taste and smell should be screened for COVID-19.","Trachootham, Dunyaporn; Thongyen, Supeda; Lam-Ubol, Aroonwan; Chotechuang, Nattida; Pongpirul, Wannarat; Prasithsirikul, Wisit",Int J Infect Dis,592,22

The damage frequently extends beyond the respiratory system, accompanying cardiovascular, renal, central nervous system, and/or coagulation derangements. Tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interleukins (IL)-1 and - 6 suppression may improve outcomes, as experimentally shown. Targeted therapies have been proposed, but mild therapeutic hypothermia-a more multifaceted approach-could be suitable. FINDINGS: According to evidence derived from previous applications, therapeutic hypothermia diminishes the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; in serum and at the tissue level. PaCO2 is reduced and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is increased, possibly lasting after rewarming. Cooling might mitigate both ventilator and infectious-induced lung injury, and suppress microthrombi development, enhancing V/Q mismatch. Improvements in microhemodynamics and tissue O2 diffusion, along with the ischemia-tolerance heightening of tissues, could be reached. Arrhythmia incidence diminishes. Moreover, hypothermia may address the coagulopathy, promoting normalization of both hypo- and hyper-coagulability patterns, which are apparently sustained after a return to normothermia. CONCLUSIONS: As per prior therapeutic hypothermia literature, the benefits regarding inflammatory response and organic damage might be seen. Following the safety-cornerstones of the technique, the overall infection rate and infection-related mortality are not expected to rise, and increased viral replication does not seem to be a concern. Therefore, the possibility of a low cost and widely available therapy being capable of improving COVID-19 outcomes deserves further study.","Dos Reis Ururahy, Raul; Park, Marcelo",J. crit. care,592,23

One of the reasons for the rapid spread is that the virus can be transmitted from infected individuals without symptoms. Revealing the pathological features of early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia is important for understanding of its pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the pulmonary pathology of early-phase COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with a benign lung lesion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the pathological changes in lung tissue from a 55-year-old female patient with early-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case, right lower lobectomy was performed for a benign pulmonary nodule. Detailed clinical, laboratory and radiological data were also examined. This patient was confirmed to have preoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection by the use of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA in-situ hybridisation on surgically removed lung tissues. Histologically, COVID-19 pneumonia was characterised by exudative inflammation. The closer to the visceral pleura, the more severe the exudation of monocytes and lymphocytes. Perivascular inflammatory infiltration, intra-alveolar multinucleated giant cells, pneumocyte hyperplasia and intracytoplasmic viral-like inclusion bodies were seen. However, fibrinous exudate and hyaline membrane formation, which were typical pulmonary features of SARS pneumonia, were not evident in this case. Immunohistochemical staining results showed an abnormal accumulation of CD4+ helper T lymphocytes and CD163+ M2 macrophages in the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the pulmonary pathological changes of early-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggested a role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zeng, Zhi; Xu, Li; Xie, Xiao-Yu; Yan, Hong-Lin; Xie, Bao-Jun; Xu, Wan-Zhou; Liu, Xin-An; Kang, Gan-Jun; Jiang, Wan-Li; Yuan, Jing-Ping",Histopathology,592,16

METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged &#8804; 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged &#8804; 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people's employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.","Shields, M; Dimov, S; Kavanagh, A; Milner, A; Spittal, M J; King, T L",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,592,24

FedAvg is a standard algorithm that uses fixed weights, often originating from the dataset sizes at each client, to aggregate the distributed learned models on a server during the FL process. However, non-identical data distribution across clients, known as the non-i.i.d problem in FL, could make this assumption for setting fixed aggregation weights sub-optimal. In this work, we design a new data-driven approach, namely Auto-FedAvg, where aggregation weights are dynamically adjusted, depending on data distributions across data silos and the current training progress of the models. We disentangle the parameter set into two parts, local model parameters and global aggregation parameters, and update them iteratively with a communication-efficient algorithm.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 µmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 µmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 µmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48â±â0.02]â×â10vs. 1.00â±â0.12, tâ=â150.38, Pâ<â0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 µmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46â±â0.12, vs.1.00â±â0.37, tâ=â2.42, Pâ<â0.05) and viral replication ([6.18â±â0.95]â×â10vs. 1.00â±â0.43, tâ=â3.98, Pâ<â0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and further study of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","Fan, Hua-Hao; Wang, Li-Qin; Liu, Wen-Li; An, Xiao-Ping; Liu, Zhen-Dong; He, Xiao-Qi; Song, Li-Hua; Tong, Yi-Gang",Chin Med J (Engl),592,16

This paper analyzes the division of domestic work among heterosexual couples in France during the lockdown. In particular, we analyzed the role of time constraints and availability and expected to find a more egalitarian division of domestic work among couples in which the man had more time than his partner due to not working or working from home. We used data from the ELIPSS panel, a representative survey of the French population, and ran OLS regressions on the division of domestic work among 406 couples. The results show that men’s time availability was associated with a more egalitarian division of domestic work, even if gender inequalities persisted. However, we did not find any clear differences between men who did not work and men who worked from home, leading us to hypothesize that men’s presence at home is an important factor.","Dominguez-Folgueras, Marta",Social Sciences,592,1

This study presents the measures adopted by our institute with the aim of providing information that could be useful to other academic centers promoting clinical trials during the pandemic. MAIN TEXT: After an in-depth analysis of European and Italian guidelines and consultation and analysis of publications regarding the actions implemented by international no profit clinical trial promoters during the emergency, we monitored the way in which the institute managed clinical trials, verifying compliance with regulatory guidelines and clinical procedures, and evaluating screening and recruitment trends in studies. During the pandemic, our center activated a new clinical trial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. A number of procedural changes in clinical trials were also authorized through notified amendments, in accordance with Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) guidelines. Patient screening and enrolment was not interrupted in any site participating in multicenter interventional clinical trials on drugs. The institute provided clear indications about essential procedures to be followed, identifying those that could be postponed or carried out by telephone/teleconference. All external sites were monitored remotely, avoiding on-site visits. Although home-working was encouraged, the presence of staff in the central office was also guaranteed to ensure the continuity of promoter activities. CONCLUSIONS: Some measures adopted by IRST could also be effective outside of the COVID-19 period, e.g. numerous activities relating to clinical trial management could be performed on a home-working basis, using suitable digital technologies. In the future, electronic medical records and shared guidelines will be essential for the correct identification and management of trial risks, including the protection of the rights and privacy of subjects taking part. Promoter supervision could be increased by implementing centralized monitoring tools to guarantee data quality. Closer collaboration between promoters and local study staff is needed to optimize trial management.","Valmorri, Linda; Vertogen, Bernadette; Zingaretti, Chiara; Miserocchi, Anna; Volpi, Roberta; Clemente, Alberto; Bondi, Isabella; Valli, Irene; Rudnas, Britt; Martinelli, Giovanni; Nanni, Oriana",BMC Med Res Methodol,592,5

Rapid analyses are needed to inform policy development and target interventions to at-risk groups to prevent serious health outcomes. We aim to provide an accessible research platform to determine demographic, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors for infection, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, to measure the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilisation and long-term health, and to enable the evaluation of natural experiments of policy interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Two privacy-protecting population-level cohorts have been created and derived from multisourced demographic and healthcare data. The C20 cohort consists of 3.2 million people in Wales on the 1 January 2020 with follow-up until 31 May 2020. The complete cohort dataset will be updated monthly with some individual datasets available daily. The C16 cohort consists of 3 million people in Wales on the 1 January 2016 with follow-up to 31 December 2019. C16 is designed as a counterfactual cohort to provide contextual comparative population data on disease, health service utilisation and mortality. Study outcomes will: (a) characterise the epidemiology of COVID-19, (b) assess socioeconomic and demographic influences on infection and outcomes, (c) measure the impact of COVID-19 on short -term and longer-term population outcomes and (d) undertake studies on the transmission and spatial spread of infection. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage-independent Information Governance Review Panel has approved this study. The study findings will be presented to policy groups, public meetings, national and international conferences, and published in peer-reviewed journals.","Lyons, Jane; Akbari, Ashley; Torabi, Fatemeh; Davies, Gareth I; North, Laura; Griffiths, Rowena; Bailey, Rowena; Hollinghurst, Joseph; Fry, Richard; Turner, Samantha L; Thompson, Daniel; Rafferty, James; Mizen, Amy; Orton, Chris; Thompson, Simon; Au-Yeung, Lee; Cross, Lynsey; Gravenor, Mike B; Brophy, Sinead; Lucini, Biagio; John, Ann; Szakmany, Tamas; Davies, Jan; Davies, Chris; Thomas, Daniel Rh; Williams, Christopher; Emmerson, Chris; Cottrell, Simon; Connor, Thomas R; Taylor, Chris; Pugh, Richard J; Diggle, Peter; John, Gareth; Scourfield, Simon; Hunt, Joe; Cunningham, Anne M; Helliwell, Kathryn; Lyons, Ronan",BMJ Open,592,21

We used data from telephone surveys among participants of ELSI-Brazil (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging), conducted between May and June 2020. The use of non-pharmacological prevention measures for COVID-19, reasons for leaving home according to the presence of multimorbidity and sociodemographic variables were evaluated. among 6,149 individuals. Multimorbidity was more frequent in females, married, aged 50-59 years and residents of the urban area. Most of the population left home between once and twice in the last week, increasing according to the number of morbidities (22.3% no morbidities and 38% with multimorbidity). Leaving home every day was less common among individuals with multimorbidity (10.3%) and 9.3% left home in the last week to access health care. Hand hygiene (> 98%) and always wearing a mask when leaving home (> 96%) were almost universal habits. Greater adherence to social isolation was observed among women with multimorbidity when compared to men (PR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.23-1.79). This adherence increased proportionally with age and inversely with the level of education. The protective behavior in people with multimorbidity seems to be greater in relation to the others, although issues related to social isolation and health care deserve to be highlighted. These findings can be useful in customizing strategies for coping with the current pandemic.","Batista, Sandro Rodrigues; Souza, Ana Sara Semeão de; Nogueira, Januse; Andrade, Fabíola Bof de; Thumé, Elaine; Teixeira, Doralice Severo da Cruz; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Facchini, Luiz Augusto; Nunes, Bruno Pereira",Cad Saude Publica,592,20

Epidemiological studies suggest that bats (Rhinolophus affinis) are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. By analyzing the conservation of five residues in two virus-binding hotspots of ACE2 (hotspot 31Lys and hotspot 353Lys), we predicted 80 ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. We chose 48 ACE2 orthologs among them for functional analysis, and showed that 44 of these orthologs-including domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquaria-could bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","Liu, Yinghui; Hu, Gaowei; Wang, Yuyan; Ren, Wenlin; Zhao, Xiaomin; Ji, Fansen; Zhu, Yunkai; Feng, Fei; Gong, Mingli; Ju, Xiaohui; Zhu, Yuanfei; Cai, Xia; Lan, Jun; Guo, Jianying; Xie, Min; Dong, Lin; Zhu, Zihui; Na, Jie; Wu, Jianping; Lan, Xun; Xie, Youhua; Wang, Xinquan; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",Proc.

METHODS: Retrospective review of a computerized database of patients who were admitted with acute appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during the COVID pandemic in a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients were compared with those who were admitted and operated for appendicitis in the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in the study period in 2020, compared with 109 who had surgery in 2019. During the COVID pandemic 41 patients presented with complicated appendicitis versus 22 patients in 2019 (P=0.0174).

We trained convolutional-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) networks for detecting inhalation, exhalation, continuous adventitious sound (CAS) and discontinuous adventitious sound at the recording level on the basis of Lung_V2. However, the performance of CAS detection was poor due to many reasons, one of which is the highly diversified CAS patterns. To make the original CNN-BiGRU model learn the CAS patterns more effectively and not cause too much computing burden, three strategies involving minimal modifications of the network architecture of the CNN layers were investigated: (1) making the CNN layers a bit deeper by using the residual blocks, (2) making the CNN layers a bit wider by increasing the number of CNN kernels, and (3) separating the feature input into multiple paths (the model was denoted by Multi-path CNN-BiGRU). The performance of CAS segment and event detection were evaluated. Results showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the proposed architecture-modified models. The F1 score for CAS event detection of the proposed models increased from 0.445 to 0.491-0.530, which was deemed significant. However, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model outperformed the other models in terms of the number of winning titles (five) in total nine evaluation metrics. In addition, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model did not cause extra computing burden (0.97-fold inference time) compared to the original CNN-BiGRU model. Conclusively, the Multi-path CNN layers can efficiently improve the effectiveness of feature extraction and subsequently result in better CAS detection.","Hsu, Fu-Shun; Huang, Shang-Ran; Huang, Chien-Wen; Chen, Chun-Chieh; Cheng, Yuan-Ren; Lai, Feipei",,592,1

In order to strengthen the health system response to such crisis, especially in low- to middle-income communities, this paper extends a novel multi-objective model for designing a health service network under uncertainty which simultaneously considers efficiency, social responsibility, and network cost. For efficiency, a modified data envelopment analysis model is introduced and inserted into the proposed model to decrease the inefficiency of healthcare facilities belonging to the different tiers of the health system. For social responsibility, two measures of job creation and balanced development are incorporated into the extended model. This is not only considered to cope with the increased numbers of patients and disaster victims to healthcare facilities but also to deal with the challenge of the economy and the livelihoods of people during the crisis. Moreover, a novel mixed possibilistic-flexible robust programming (MPFRP) approach is developed to protect the considered network against uncertainty. To show the applicability of the extended model, a real-world case study is presented. The results reveal that contrary to fuzzy programming models, the MPFRP performs well in terms of social responsibility (72%), cost (8%), and efficiency (28%) and is able to make a trade-off between these three measures. In this study, the resilience level of the designed network is not addressed while disregarding any short-term stoppage owing to internal or external sources of disruption in designing may bring about a considerable loss.","Haeri, Abdorrrahman; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Rezaei, Marziehsadat",Ann Oper Res,592,16

COVID-19 has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closure of schools, colleges and universities. The COVID-19 pandemic is also having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place, it becomes important to understand emotional intelligence of faculty members working in institutions of higher learning on a large scale in this pandemic. AIM: The purpose of this article is to examine the perception of faculty members toward their emotional intelligence during COVID-19 and to study the impact of demographic variables on their emotional intelligence. METHOD: The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data for the study were collected through both the primary and secondary sources. Online questionnaires were used to gather the primary data. The measuring items used for the study were sourced from existing validated scales and literature. Descriptive statistics was employed to know the descriptive information across various demographic variables on a total sample of 683. The various demographic variables, which were considered for the study, were gender and designation. RESULTS: The results revealed that the faculty members perceived their emotional intelligence at an above-average level in the present pandemic, that is, COVID-19. The results also revealed that the perception of the respondent faculty members toward their emotional intelligence from different universities and states is more or less the same and also the demographic variable gender has a significant impact on emotional intelligence during the present pandemic. CONCLUSION: Besides having theoretical implications that open pathways for conducting further research, the findings of the study may serve as a reference for service practitioners in designing strategies that will ensure superior performance of faculty members in higher educational institutions during the pandemic.","Baba, Mubashir Majid",Int J Soc Psychiatry,592,16

Everyday thousands of infected people lost their lives. What is worse, there is no specific medicine and we do not know when the end of the pandemic will come.

We believe that no matter the virus H1N1 for the 1918 influenza or 2019-nCoV for COVID-19, they are essentially the same and the final cause of death is sepsis. The definition and diagnostic/management criteria of sepsis have been modified several times but the mortality rate has not been improved until date. Over decades, researchers focus either on the immunosuppression or on the excessive inflammatory response following trauma or body exposure to harmful stimuli. But the immune response is very complex with various regulating factors involved in, such as neurotransmitter, endocrine hormone, etc. Sepsis is not a kind of disease, instead a misbalance of the body following infection, trauma or other harmful stimulation. Therefore we should re-think sepsis comprehensively with the concept of systemic biology, i.e. inflammationomics.","Liu, Gui-E; Tian, Yuan; Zhao, Wen-Jun; Song, Shuang-Ming; Li, Lei",Chin J Traumatol,592,16

Fear of infection, national lockdowns and altered healthcare priorities have the potential to impact utilisation of healthcare resources for non-communicable diseases. To survey health professionals' views of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate and timing of admission of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) administered an internet-based questionnaire to cardiologists and cardiovascular nurses across 6 continents. METHODS AND RESULTS: 3101 responses were received from 141 countries across 6 continents. 88.3% responded that their country was in ""total lockdown"" and 7.1% in partial lockdown. 78.8% responded that the number of patients presenting with STEMI was reduced since the coronavirus outbreak and 65.2% indicated that the reduction in STEMI presentations was >40%. Approximately 60% of all respondents reported that STEMI patients presented later than usual and 58.5% that >40% of STEMI patients admitted to hospital presented beyond the optimal window for primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. Independent predictors of the reported higher rate of delayed STEMI presentation were a country in total lockdown, >100 COVID-19 cases admitted locally, and the complete restructuring of the local cardiology service. CONCLUSION: The survey indicates that the impact of COVID-19 on STEMI presentations is likely to be substantial, with both lower presentations and a higher rate of delayed presentations occurring. This has potentially important ramifications for future healthcare and policy planning in the event of further waves of this pandemic.","Pessoa-Amorim, Guilherme; Camm, Christian F; Gajendragadkar, Parag; De Maria, Giovanni Luigi; Arsac, Celine; Laroche, Cecile; Zamorano, José Luis; Weidinger, Franz; Achenbach, Stephan; Maggioni, Aldo P; Gale, Chris P; Poppas, Athena; Casadei, Barbara",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,592,20

An approach well known to physics is applied, where one looks for common dynamical features, independently from differences in other factors. These features and associated scaling laws are used as a powerful tool to pinpoint regions where analytical derivations are effective, get an insight into qualitative changes of the disease progression, and infer the key infection parameters. The developed framework for joint analytical and numerical analysis of empirically observed COVID-19 growth patterns can lead to a fundamental understanding of infection progression under strong control measures, applicable to outbursts of both COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.","Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko; Ilic, Bojana; Stojku, Stefan; Salom, Igor",,592,21

Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared and spread rapidly. Hospitals had to repurpose staff and establish diagnostic testing for this new viral infection. In the background of the usual respiratory pathogen testing performed in the clinical laboratory, SARS-CoV-2 testing at the Montefiore Medical System grew exponentially, from none to hundreds per day within the first week of testing. The job of appropriately routing SARS-CoV-2 viral specimens became overwhelming. Additional staff was required to triage these specimens to multiple in-house testing platforms as well as external reference laboratories. Since medical school classes and many research laboratories shut down at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and students were eager to help fight the pandemic, we seized the opportunity to engage and train senior MD-PhD students to assist in triaging specimens. This volunteer force enabled us to establish the “Pathology Command Center,” staffed by these students as well as residents and furloughed dental associates. The Pathology Command Center staff were tasked with the accessioning and routing of specimens, answering questions from clinical teams, and updating ever evolving protocols developed in collaboration with a team of Infectious Disease clinicians. Many lessons were learned during this process, including how best to restructure an accessioning department and how to properly onboard students and repurpose staff while establishing safeguards for their well-being during these unprecedented times. In this article, we share some of our challenges, successes, and what we ultimately learned as an organization.","Campbell, Sean T.; Orner, Erika P.; Reyes Gil, Morayma Fox Amy S.; Goldstein, D.

Additionally, this reflection will shift the focus from the spring 2020 environment of SARS-CoV-2 to what EE teams and college administration can learn from those experiences. Moving forward, EE teams and administrators can be better equipped to proactively plan for future emergencies. DESCRIPTION: Using the ""What? So What? Now What?"" model of reflection, this manuscript will broadly describe the experiences of three EE administrators and their teams during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Proposed lessons learned as well as future planning strategies will be presented. ANALYSIS/INTERPRETATION: The world of education was unprepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and most sectors were left scrambling to adjust to new models very quickly with no planning or preparation. In the realm of pharmacy education, SARS-CoV-2 caused complete disruption for pharmacy students on rotations, clinical sites, preceptors, and EE teams. In reflecting on spring 2020, much can be gained and applied to future planning efforts so that institutions can be better prepared for future crises. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: While still in the pandemic, schools must plan for the coming year. EE teams can work together to prepare for emergencies, craft contingency plans, and build additional capacity into their teams and available rotation offerings.","Cooley, Janet; Larson, Suzanne; Stevens, Alison",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,592,1

Methods: A survey was offered on the crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during April 2020 (the early days of strict, social distancing restrictions). The study included 1,521 adults ages 18 years and older who resided in the US and were enrolled as MTurk workers, i.e., workers who are qualified by Amazon to complete a range of human interaction tasks, including surveys through the MTurk worker platform. Main predictors included measures of heavy drinking, marijuana, and polysubstance use. The dependent measures were measures of social distancing and personal hygiene, based on guidelines recommended at the time of the survey by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Results: We found consistent negative associations between heavy drinking and drug use and adherence to social distancing and personal hygiene. Additionally, three control variables, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were significant correlates of adherence to these measures. Conclusions: The findings here are consistent with previous research exploring links between substance use and other adverse health behaviors. Further, the negative association between heavy drinking (five or more drinks in one sitting) and adherence underscore the public health risks entailed with the unrestricted reopening of public drinking establishments.","Fendrich, Michael; Becker, Jessica; Park, Crystal; Russell, Beth; Finkelstein-Fox, Lucy; Hutchison, Morica",Subst Abus,592,16

Blood samples were taken from patients ca. 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection with further assessment of symptoms at 6 months. Some 57% of the patients had one or more persistent symptoms including respiratory-related symptoms like cough, dyspnea, and rhinorrhea or other nonrespiratory symptoms including chronic fatigue, anosmia, myalgia, or joint pain. Plasma samples were quantitatively analyzed for lipoproteins, glycoproteins, amino acids, biogenic amines, and tryptophan pathway intermediates using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Metabolic data for the follow-up patients (n = 27) were compared with controls (n = 41) and hospitalized severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 18, with multiple time-points). Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed variable patterns of functional recovery with many patients exhibiting residual COVID-19 biomarker signatures. Several parameters were persistently perturbed, e.g., elevated taurine (p = 3.6 × 10-3 versus controls) and reduced glutamine/glutamate ratio (p = 6.95 × 10-8 versus controls), indicative of possible liver and muscle damage and a high energy demand linked to more generalized tissue repair or immune function. Some parameters showed near-complete normalization, e.g., the plasma apolipoprotein B100/A1 ratio was similar to that of healthy controls but significantly lower (p = 4.2 × 10-3) than post-acute COVID-19 patients, reflecting partial reversion of the metabolic phenotype (phenoreversion) toward the healthy metabolic state. Plasma neopterin was normalized in all follow-up patients, indicative of a reduction in the adaptive immune activity that has been previously detected in active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other systemic inflammatory biomarkers such as GlycA and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio remained elevated in some, but not all, patients. Correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal-partial least-squares discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) showed that the follow-up patients were, as a group, metabolically distinct from controls and partially comapped with the acute-phase patients. Significant systematic metabolic differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic follow-up patients were also observed for multiple metabolites. The overall metabolic variance of the symptomatic patients was significantly greater than that of nonsymptomatic patients for multiple parameters (&#967;2 p = 0.014). Thus, asymptomatic follow-up patients including those with post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome displayed a spectrum of multiple persistent biochemical pathophysiology, suggesting that the metabolic phenotyping approach may be deployed for multisystem functional assessment of individual post-acute COVID-19 patients.","Holmes, Elaine; Wist, Julien; Masuda, Reika; Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Loo, Ruey Leng; Begum, Sofina; Boughton, Berin; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Chin, Sung-Tong; Hall, Drew; Ryan, Monique; Bong, Sze-How; Gay, Melvin; Edgar, Dale W; Lindon, John C; Richards, Toby; Yeap, Bu B; Pettersson, Sven; Spraul, Manfred; Schaefer, Hartmut; Lawler, Nathan G; Gray, Nicola; Whiley, Luke; Nicholson, Jeremy K",J Proteome Res,592,1

N6 -methylation of adenosine (m6A) in RNA regulates many pathophysiological processes. Here, we show that deletion of the m6A demethylase Alkbh5 sensitized tumors to cancer immunotherapy. Alkbh5 has effects on m6A density and splicing events in tumors during ICB. Alkbh5 modulates Mct4/Slc16a3 expression and lactate content of the tumor microenvironment and the composition of tumor-infiltrating Treg and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Importantly, a small-molecule Alkbh5 inhibitor enhanced the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Notably, the ALKBH5 gene mutation and expression status of melanoma patients correlate with their response to immunotherapy. Our results suggest that m6A demethylases in tumor cells contribute to the efficacy of immunotherapy and identify ALKBH5 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy outcome in melanoma, colorectal, and potentially other cancers.","Li, Na; Kang, Yuqi; Wang, Lingling; Huff, Sarah; Tang, Rachel; Hui, Hui; Agrawal, Kriti; Gonzalez, Gwendolyn Michelle; Wang, Yinsheng; Patel, Sandip Pravin; Rana, Tariq M",Proc.

Due to the dynamics of COVID-19 where many infected people are not showing symptoms or showing mild symptoms, and where different countries are employing different testing strategies, it is quite difficult to calculate the R, while the pandemic is still widespread. This paper presents a probabilistic methodology to evaluate the effective reproduction number by considering only the daily death statistics of a given country. The methodology utilizes a linearly constrained Quadratic Programming scheme to estimate the daily new infection cases from the daily death statistics, based on the probability distribution of delays associated with symptom onset and to reporting a death. The proposed methodology is validated in-silico by simulating an infectious disease through a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. The results suggest that with a reasonable estimate of distribution of delay to death from the onset of symptoms, the model can provide accurate estimates of R. The proposed method is then used to estimate the R values for two countries.","Na, Jiaming; Tibebu, Haileleol; De Silva, Varuna; Kondoz, Ahmet; Caine, Michael",Chaos Solitons Fractals,592,1

I sketch a deontological framework for assessing when it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work to protect their families from infection and when it is a dereliction of duty to patients. I argue that it is morally permissible for HCWs to abstain from work when their duty to treat is outweighed by the combined risks and burdens of that work. For HCWs who live with their families, the obligation to protect one's family from infection contributes significantly to those burdens. There are, however, a range of complicating factors including the strength of duty to treat which varies according to the HCW's role, the vulnerability of family members to the disease, the willingness of family members to risk infection and the resources available to the HCW to protect their family. In many cases, HCWs in 'frontline' roles with a weak duty to treat and families at home will be morally permitted to abstain from work given the risks posed by COVID-19; therefore, society should provide additional incentives to maintain sufficient staff in these roles.","McConnell, Doug",J Med Ethics,592,1

Here, we report that the cardioprotective properties of intravenously injected MSCs in a mouse model of pressure-overload heart failure largely depend on circulating adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted factor.

Adiponectin stimulated exosome biogenesis and secretion through binding to T-cadherin, a unique glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cadherin, on MSCs.

The biological function of &#945;-syn remains elusive; however, increasing evidence suggests that the protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion, signifying the importance of &#945;-syn-lipid interactions. We show that &#945;-syn preferentially binds to GM1-rich, liquid-ordered lipid domains on cytoplasmic membranes by using unroofed cells, which encapsulates lipid complexity and cellular topology. Moreover, proteins (Rab3a, syntaxin-1A, and VAMP2) involved in exocytosis also localize with &#945;-syn, supporting its proposed functional role in exocytosis. To investigate how these lipid/protein interactions influence &#945;-syn at the residue level, &#945;-syn was derivatized with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl [NBD]) at different N- and C-terminal sites. Measurements of NBD fluorescence lifetime distributions reveal that &#945;-syn adopts a multitude of membrane-bound conformations, which were not recapitulated in simple micelle or vesicle models, indicating an exquisite sensitivity of the protein to the complex lipid environment. Interestingly, these data also suggest the participation of the C terminus in membrane localization, which is generally overlooked and thus emphasize the need to use cellularly derived and biologically relevant membranes for biophysical characterization. Collectively, our results demonstrate that &#945;-syn is more conformationally dynamic at the membrane interface than previously appreciated, which may be important for both its physiological and pathological functions.","Kaur, Upneet; Lee, Jennifer C",Proc.

Jerk-based measures have been utilized to examine dynamic balance because of their ability to quantify changes in acceleration and may provide an understanding of the postural corrections that occur during stabilizing following a jumping task. The purpose of this study was to compare acceleration and jerk following a jump stabilization task between individuals with CAI and the uninjured controls. Thirty-nine participants volunteered to participate in this case control study. Participants completed a jump stabilization task requiring them to jump off 2 feet, touch a marker set at 50% of their maximal vertical jump height, land on a single limb, and maintain balance for 3 seconds. Acceleration was calculated as the second derivative, and jerk was calculated as the third derivative of the displacement of the resultant vector position. Participants with CAI had greater acceleration (mean difference = 55.6 cm/s2; 95% confidence interval, 10.3 to 100.90; P = .017) and jerk compared with the uninjured controls (mean difference = 1804.5 cm/s3; 95% confidence interval, 98.7 to 3510.3; P = .039).

However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps. OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. METHODS: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted. RESULTS: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Calculation of Bayes factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favored the null hypothesis compared with large associations (for level, BF=0.25; for slope, BF=0.26) but were insensitive to the detection of small associations (for level, BF=0.78; for slope, BF=1.35). CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app. Findings on the association of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a small step change or increasing trend were inconclusive.","Perski, Olga; Herbec, Aleksandra; Shahab, Lion; Brown, Jamie",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,592,22

The present study attempted to investigate the effect of SCH on IR and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, the effects of ellagic acid (EA) on SCH C57BL/6J and db/db mice were also investigated to explore potential therapeutic drug against SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. T2DM patients were recruited in our study and categorized into two groups according to thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value: T2DM without SCH group (TSH &#8804;4 µIU/ml; n = 30) and T2DM with SCH group (TSH >4µIU/ml; n = 60). Methimazole (MMI; 0.08 mg kg-1 day-1 ) was intragastrically administrated for 12 weeks to establish SCH in C57BL/6J and db/db mice. Compared with T2DM patients without SCH, poor glycemic and cholesterol control were emerged in T2DM patients with SCH and that were prominent in patients with TSH more than 10 µIU/ml. In addition, a significant positive correlation between serum TSH and fasting plasma-glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed in T2DM patients with SCH. Moreover, abnormal glucose metabolism in C57BL/6J and db/db mice with SCH has been attenuated by EA administration. Our findings provided data regarding the positive correlation between high TSH level with poor glycemic control in T2DM patients with SCH. EA might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a potential risk factor associated with abnormal glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A clinical theory of a positive correlation between high TSH level and poor glycemic control was validated in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and mouse models. Ellagic acid (EA) might be a supportive strategy for preventing SCH-induced abnormal glucose metabolism that provided a treatment option in T2DM patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in clinical practice.","Liu, Ye; Li, Xing; Zhu, Yikun; Liu, Jiong; Liu, Sunjun",J Food Biochem,592,21

METHODS: We draw upon current events, academic literature, and numerous data sources to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors place older adults at higher risk for COVID-19 relative to younger adults, and how structural racism magnifies these risks for older Black and Latinx adults. RESULTS: We identify three proximate mechanisms through which structural racism operates as a fundamental cause of racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 burden among older adults: (1) Risk of exposure; (2) Weathering processes; and (3) Health care access and quality. DISCUSSION: While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, the racial/ethnic health inequalities among older adults it has exposed are long-standing and deeply rooted in structural racism within American society. This knowledge presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers and policymakers as they seek to address the needs of older adults. It is imperative that federal, state, and local governments collect and release comprehensive data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity and age to better gauge the impact of outbreak across minority communities. We conclude with a discussion of incremental steps to be taken to lessen the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among older Black and Latinx adults, as well as the need for transformative actions that address structural racism in order to achieve population health equity.","Garcia, Marc A; Homan, Patricia A; García, Catherine; Brown, Tyson H",,592,1

The first detected cases were reported on 21 February 2020 in two Italian towns: Vo' Euganeo in the Province of Padua, Veneto region, and Codogno, in the Province of Lodi, Lombardy.

In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated. We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact. We strongly recommend that decision-makers:ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts;maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services;rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples;equip the population with protective masks.","Romagnani, Paola; Gnone, Guido; Guzzi, Francesco; Negrini, Simone; Guastalla, Andrea; Annunziato, Francesco; Romagnani, Sergio; De Palma, Raffaele",J. public health policy,592,26

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. METHODS: We used data from 46,284 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by other social or psychiatric factors. CONCLUSION: Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",PLoS One,592,2

An important aspect of qPCR data that has been largely ignored is the presence of non-detects: reactions failing to exceed the quantification threshold and therefore lacking a measurement of expression. While most current software replaces these non-detects with a value representing the limit of detection, this introduces substantial bias in the estimation of both absolute and differential expression. Single imputation procedures, while an improvement on previously used methods, underestimate residual variance, which can lead to anti-conservative inference. RESULTS: We propose to treat non-detects as non-random missing data, model the missing data mechanism, and use this model to impute missing values or obtain direct estimates of model parameters. To account for the uncertainty inherent in the imputation, we propose a multiple imputation procedure, which provides a set of plausible values for each non-detect. We assess the proposed methods via simulation studies and demonstrate the applicability of these methods to three experimental data sets. We compare our methods to mean imputation, single imputation, and a penalized EM algorithm incorporating non-random missingness (PEMM). The developed methods are implemented in the R/Bioconductor package nondetects. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical methods introduced here reduce discrepancies in gene expression values derived from qPCR experiments in the presence of non-detects, providing increased confidence in downstream analyses.","Sherina, Valeriia; McMurray, Helene R; Powers, Winslow; Land, Harmut; Love, Tanzy M T; McCall, Matthew N",BMC Bioinformatics,592,13

Before the state of emergency and lockdown, there was a repeat of many of the emotional and cognitive patterns seen in previous pandemics such us upward and downward blaming or feelings of anger and emotional fatigue. However, outward blaming patterns towards peers also emerged. Moreover, in the period following lockdown, we noted the emergence of new representations and emotions such as paralyzing distrust or resilience.

Whereas some come out stronger as a result of responding to a challenge, others find their fundamental assumptions about themselves and their lives severely challenged. In education, while some teachers might burn out and leave the profession precipitously, many survive the challenges and transform teaching into their lifelong passion. What factors help explain why some language teachers remain resilient and experience growth after trauma, while others suffer a sense of loss, depleted psychological resources, and ultimately succumb to the pressures of the job, leaving the profession or burning out? The purpose of this study was to seek answers to this question in the context of teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic, which represents a specific unprecedented type of adversity. To do this, 765 foreign language teachers worldwide answered an online questionnaire that asked three open-ended questions about the stressors and uplifts they were experiencing during the first few months of the pandemic. Respondents were invited to offer their advice to other language teachers who were facing the challenge of teaching during this time. © 2021 ACTFL","Gregersen, T.; Mercer, S.; MacIntyre, P.

This study aimed to investigate differences in admissions at a Swiss psychiatric ED from 1 April to 15 May during a ""pandemic-free"" period in 2016 and a ""during-pandemic"" period in 2020. The study included 579 consultations at psychiatric ED in the ""during-pandemic"" period and 702 in the ""pandemic-free"" period. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with psychiatric admissions during the pandemic. A reduction in total psychiatric ED admissions was documented during COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis predicted the independent variable (ED admission during the pandemic) and estimated odds ratio (OR) for being unmarried/not in a relationship, arrival in an ambulance, suicidal behavior, behavioral disorders and psychomotor agitation. Though only statistically significant in bivariate analysis, patients were also more likely to be involuntarily hospitalized. This picture appears to be reversed from a sociodemographic and clinical point of view to our observation of psychiatric ED consultation in 2016. These findings highlight that the reduction in psychiatric ED admissions during the pandemic seems to be associated with living alone and more severe psychopathologies, which must alert psychiatrists to ensure access to mental health care in times of pandemic.","Ambrosetti, Julia; Macheret, Laura; Folliet, Aline; Wullschleger, Alexandre; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Prada, Paco; Kaiser, Stefan; Bondolfi, Guido; Sarasin, François; Costanza, Alessandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),592,13

Here we address changes in dream features both during the first wave, when the Italian government imposed a total lockdown, and the second wave (autumn 2020), when a partial lockdown was effected. In April 2020 (total lockdown), 1,622 participants (Mage = 34.1 ± 13.6â years; 1171F) completed an online survey including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a set of questions on dream features and their possible changes relative to the month preceding the lockdown (pre-total lockdown). In November 2020 (partial lockdown), 214 participants (Mage = 36.78 ± 14.2 years; 159F) from the previous sample completed the same survey. Approximately half of the subjects reported increased or decreased dream frequency (30.5% and 21.8%), length (27.1% and 15.8%) and vividness (31.5% and 17.1%) during total lockdown as well as during partial lockdown (frequency: 30.3% and 13.5%; length: 23.3% and 12.6%; vividness: 31.6% and 24.1%). Dream affect became significantly more negative in total lockdown relative to pre-total lockdown and in partial lockdown relative to pre-partial lockdown (both p < .001). Both in total lockdown and partial lockdown, increased negative dream emotionality significantly predicted changes in dream frequency, length and vividness, and was significantly predicted, in turn, by worsened sleep quality. Our data confirm that dream features are significantly affected by major life changes such as those imposed by a pandemic. The fact that between lockdowns negative dream affect returned almost to baseline level suggests that dream emotionality is closely related to lifestyle and wake-time emotional changes. Also, our findings point to a modulating role of sleep quality on dream emotionality.","Conte, Francesca; Rescott, Marissa Lynn; De Rosa, Oreste; Cellini, Nicola; Coppola, Alessia; Cerasuolo, Mariangela; Malloggi, Serena; Giganti, Fiorenza; Ficca, Gianluca",J Sleep Res,592,12

For several FOMC announcements dates, emerging market economies' exchange rate strengthened relative to the US dollar, in contrast to what the standard theory predicts. These results are in line with the information effect, which denote the Federal Reserve's disclosure of information about the state of the economy. Using Jarocinski \&Karadi 2020's identification scheme relying on sign restrictions and high-frequency surprises of multiple financial instruments, I show how different US monetary policy shocks imply different spillovers on emerging markets financial flows and macroeconomic performance. I emphasize the contrast in dynamics of financial flows and equity indexes and how different exchange rate regimes shape aggregate fluctuations. Using a structural DSGE model and IRFs matching techniques I argue that ignoring information shocks bias the inference over key frictions for small open economy models.","Camara, Santiago",,592,29

Whether elevated biomarkers truly represent myocardial dysfunction is not known. The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of ventricular dysfunction and assess its relationship with biomarker analyses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study ran from April 1 to May 12, 2020, and consisted of all consecutively admitted patients to the Radboud university medical centre nursing ward for COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high-sensitivity Troponin T and N­terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic evaluation focused on left and right ventricular systolic function and global longitudinal strain (GLS). RESULTS: In total, 51 patients were included, with a median age of 63 years (range 51-68 years) of whom 80% was male. Troponin T was elevated (>14â¯ng/l) in 47%, and a clinically relevant Troponin T elevation (10â¯× URL) was found in three patients (6%). NT-proBNP was elevated (>300â¯pg/ml) in 24 patients (47%), and in four (8%) the NT-proBNP concentration was >1,000â¯pg/ml. Left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <52% and/or GLS >-18%) was observed in 27%, while right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE <17â¯mm and/or RV S'â¯< 10â¯cm/s) was seen in 10%. There was no association between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP and left or right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism had normal right ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised patients, it seems that COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, while cardiac dysfunction occurs less often. Based on a single echocardiographic evaluation, we found no relation between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP, and ventricular dysfunction. Echocardiography has limited value in screening for ventricular dysfunction.","van den Heuvel, F M A; Vos, J L; Koop, Y; van Dijk, A P J; Duijnhouwer, A L; de Mast, Q; van de Veerdonk, F L; Bosch, F; Kok, B; Netea, M G; Hoogerwerf, J; Hoefsloot, W; Tjwa, E T T L; de Korte, C L; van Kimmenade, R R J; Nijveldt, R",Neth Heart J,592,1

It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations. National strategies include mass vaccination, the timely provision of guidance documents and interventions from regulatory bodies that are patient-centred, adaptable, and cost effective.","Hartigan, Irene; Kelleher, Ann; McCarthy, Joan; Cornally, Nicola",Nurs Ethics,592,16

COVID-19 pneumonia PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the purpose of identifying clinical manifestations and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, we reviewed all cases of COVID-19 pneumonia which were published by the homepage of the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases from Feb 5 2020 until April 30 2020, including our cases. All patients were diagnosed based on positive results of the novel coronavirus-real-time RT-PCR with chest computed tomography (CT) findings. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 66 years (range 16-92 years). For all, 50 (54%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hypertension in 32 (36%). Any comorbidity was seen in 60 (67%). The mortality rate was 4 (6%). In terms of clinical symptoms on an initial visit, fever and cough were confirmed in 66 (72%) and 37 (40%). Forty-three (47%) had no respiratory symptoms. As for radiological findings by chest CT scan, ground-glass opacities (GGO)s, peripheral distribution, bilateral lung involvements were seen in 88 (96%), 76 (83%) and 78 (85%), respectively. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to diagnose as COVID-19 pneumonia due to poor respiratory symptoms. Chest CT findings typically show GGO, peripheral and bilateral shadows. Patients should have chest CT performed if suspected for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, resulting in a favorable outcome and prevention of secondary nosocomial transmitted infection.","Asai, Nobuhiro; Sakanashi, Daisuke; Nakamura, Akiko; Kishino, Takaaki; Kato, Hideo; Hagihara, Mao; Shiota, Arufumi; Koizumi, Yusuke; Yamagishi, Yuka; Mikamo, Hiroshige",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,592,16

Although there is biological plausibility for its use, the evidence supporting its effectiveness is scarce, and the risks associated with it may be significant. Thus, based on a virtual case simulation, we estimated the risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease. METHODS: Lifetime attributable risks (LAR) of RIC were calculated for the lung, liver, esophagus, and breast of female patients. The cardiovascular risk of exposure-induced death (REID) due to ischemic heart disease was also calculated. The doses received by the organs involved in the treatment were obtained from a simulation of conformal radiotherapy (RT) treatment, delivering a dose of 0.5 Gy-1.5 Gy to the lungs. We considered a LAR and REID <1% as acceptable, 1-2% cautionary, and >2% unacceptable. RESULTS: The lung was at the highest risk for RIC (absolute LAR below 5200 cases/100,000 and 2250 cases/100,000 for women and men, respectively). For women, the breast had the second-highest LAR, especially for young women. The liver and esophagus had LARs below 700/100,000 for both sexes, with a higher incidence of esophageal cancer in women and liver cancer in men. Regarding the LAR cutoff, we observed an unacceptable or cautionary LAR for lung cancer in all women and men <60 years with an RT dose >1 Gy. LAR for lung cancer with an RT dose of 1 Gy was cautionary for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. No LAR estimation was unacceptable for the RT dose &#8804;0.7 Gy in all groups irrespective of sex or age at exposure. Only 0.5 Gy had an acceptable REID. CONCLUSIONS: A RT dose &#8804;0.5 Gy provides an acceptable LAR estimate (&#8804;1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses &#8804;0.5 Gy to maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who fail or do not have any other treatment option.","Arruda, Gustavo Viani; Weber, Raissa Renata Dos Santos; Bruno, Alexandre Colello; Pavoni, Juliana Fernandes",Int J Radiat Biol,592,11

A key part of this project, reported here, was the development of a competency framework for education in EBP and clinical effectiveness to ensure responsiveness of education standards and curricula of healthcare professionals in this area. METHODS: Following a review of national and international reports, professional guidance documents and empirical literature pertaining to clinical effectiveness education (CEE), a preliminary competency framework was developed. Stakeholder consultations were conducted over a 6-month period, which consisted of 13 focus groups (n=45) and included representatives from clinical practice, higher education and professional training sectors, regulator/accrediting bodies, the Department of Health (Ireland) and patient/service user groups. RESULTS: An overarching interprofessional competency framework for CEE was proposed and included the following domains: EBP, quality improvement processes, implementation strategies and collaborative practice: a total of 16 competencies and 60 indicators. CONCLUSION: A competency framework for CEE for health and social care professionals is presented. It is intended that this framework will provide guidance to healthcare educators and regulators in the construction and revision of curricula, learning outcomes, teaching and assessment strategies, and graduate/clinician attributes.","Lehane, Elaine; Agreli, Heloise; O039,; Connor, Simone; Hegarty, Josephine; Leahy Warren, Patricia; Bennett, Deirdre; Blake, Catherine; Burke, Frank; Corrigan, Mark; Drennan, Jonathan; Hayes, Martina; Heffernan, Elizabeth; Horgan, Frances; Lynch, Helen; McVeigh, Joseph; Müller, Nicole; Keeffe, Elizabeth; Rourke, Niamh; Toole, Eve; Tuathaigh, Colm; Sahm, Laura; Savage, Eileen",BMJ Evid.

To meet this increased patient demand for diagnostic testing, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) authorized licensed pharmacists to order and administer FDA authorized COVID-19 tests. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to update the previous national benching report and examine both the number of pharmacies in the United States with CLIA Certificates of Waiver before and after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the state-by-state differences in the percentage of pharmacies with CLIA Certificates of Waiver. METHODS: Data were collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CLIA Laboratory Search website May 3rd, 2015, August 4th, 2019 and November 26th, 2020. The website allows for exportation of demographic data on all CLIA-waived facilities by state. RESULTS: Pharmacies exhibited the largest growth both in number (4865 new locations) and by percent (45%) of CLIA-waived facilities between 2015 and 2020. The total number of pharmacies with a CLIA-waiver grew from 10,626 (17.94%) locations in 2015 to 12,157 (21.43%) locations in 2019, to 15,671 (27.63%) locations in 2020. States demonstrated considerable variability in the percentage of pharmacies with a CLIA-waiver, with a range of 2.92%-56.52%. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies have become an increasingly important location for patients to access CLIA-waived tests in the United States, now serving as the second largest provider of CLIA-waived tests by the total number of locations. Most of this growth occurred between 2019 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and concentrated efforts will be necessary to sustain this momentum.","Klepser, Nicklas S; Klepser, Donald G; Adams, Jennifer L; Adams, Alex J; Klepser, Michael E",Res. soc. adm. pharm,592,20

Gastrointestinal (aOR 0.49; 95%CI 0.26-0.92) or mucocutaneous symptoms (aOR 0.31; 95%CI 0.15-0.64), treatment with intravenous immune globulin (aOR 0.33; 95%CI 0.17-0.65), and MIS-C (aOR 0.26; 95%CI 0.11-0.64) were associated with lower mortality. ConclusionsWe identified age-related differences in presentation and mortality for critical pediatric COVID-19 that should prompt more attention to improving management in younger children, especially in developing countries. Table of Contents SummaryThis is a multinational study describing critical pediatric COVID-19 clinical spectrum and related mortality in high and low-middle income countries during 2020. Whats known on this subjectPediatric critical illness due to COVID-19 is uncommon and have lower mortality compared to adults when hospitalized. While larger cohorts are from high-income countries (HICs), studies including data from low-middle-income countries (LMICs) remain scarce. What this study addsIn our multinational cohort of critical pediatric COVID-19, we identified higher mortality than previously reported and age-related disease patterns. Children <2 years old had more respiratory disease and higher mortality, and older children had more non-pulmonary disease and better outcomes.","Gonzalez-Dambrauskas, Sebastian; Vasquez-Hoyos, Pablo; Camporesi, Anna; Cantillano, Edwin Mauricio; Dallefeld, Samantha; Dominguez-Rojas, Jesus; Francoeur, Conall; Gurbanov, Anar; Mazzillo-Vega, Liliana; Shein, Steven; Yock-Corrales, Adriana; Karsies, Todd; Investigators, - Critical Coronavirus and Kids Epidemiological Study",,592,16

However, auscultation is a subjective practice and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) where automated analyses could help decentralise care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardised collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modelling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation. METHODS: A total of 1000 consecutive, patients aged &#8805; 16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e., discharge, hospitalisation, intubation and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the current episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine classifier will be trained on these audio recordings to derive an automated prediction of diagnostic (COVID positive vs negative) and risk stratification categories (mild to severe). The performance of this model will be compared to a human prediction baseline on a random subset of lung sounds, where blinded physicians are asked to classify the audios into the same categories. DISCUSSION: This approach has broad potential to standardise the evaluation of lung auscultation in COVID-19 at various levels of healthcare, especially in the context of decentralised triage and monitoring.

This retrospective study aimed to examine the consumption of antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 admitted into the five hospitals in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. We collected data on the consumption of antibiotics, classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve), within two months-August and September, 2020, and the corresponding months in 2019. Consumption of antibiotics was presented as daily define dose (DDD) per 100 occupied bed-days. Eight different classes of antibiotics were prescribed to patients with COVID-19 without culture tests being performed, with the prescribing of antibiotics of the Watch category was especially prevalent. The consumption of antibiotics was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period: the consumption of azithromycin increased from 11.5 DDDs per 100 occupied bed-days in 2019 to 17.0 DDDs per 100 occupied bed-days in 2020, while the consumption of ceftriaxone increased from 20.2 DDDs per 100 occupied bed-days in 2019 to 25.1 DDDs per 100 occupied bed-days in 2020. The current study revealed non-evidence-based utilization of antibiotics among patients with COVID-19 admitted into the hospitals in Pakistan.

As of April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 140,000,000 and caused more than 3,000,000 deaths globally. In November 2020, the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab was approved by the FDA for non-hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. This provided a treatment option that may help prevent hospitalization. METHODS: Patients who regularly received ambulatory care at a military treatment facility and who were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 were treated with a single, intravenous infusion (700 mg) of the virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was improvement of self-reported symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of receiving the infusion. The secondary outcome was prevention of disease progression requiring emergency department (ED) utilization or hospitalization related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion. Bamlanivimab was administered in accordance with the FDA's approval and Defense Health Agency's guidance, including follow-up within 72 hours of administration. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained. RESULTS: Of the COVID-19 patients who were given the option of a bamlanivimab infusion, 40 accepted and 6 did not (40/46, 86.9%). Thirty-six of 40 patients in the treatment group were contacted within 72 hours. ED/hospitalization information was available for all 46 patients. In the treatment group, 94.4% (34/36) reported global improvement. Three of 40 (7.5%) patients in the treatment group required inpatient admission, and 2 of 40 patients (5%) required ED evaluation within 30 days of infusion. Therefore, 5 of 40 (12.5%) patients required evaluation shortly after infusion, while 2 of 6 (33.3%) patients who declined treatment required hospital evaluation or admission related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: Global improvement of symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of infusion was reported by 94.4% of patients receiving bamlanivimab; however, statistical significance could not be determined due to the small sample size and lack of placebo group due to study design. Furthermore, ED visits and hospital admissions were analyzed, but with only six patients in the comparison group, the relative risk was not statistically significant and could not be precisely estimated. In the future, this study can be replicated with both larger control/treatment arms to validate the initial results of this small, retrospective, cohort study.","Karr, Eric; Chung, Theodore; Burtson, Kathryn; Markert, Ronald; Kelly, Devin",Mil. med,592,26

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a molecular platform that promotes inflammation via cleavage and activation of key inflammatory molecules including active caspase-1 (Casp1p20), IL-1ß, and IL-18. Although participation of the inflammasome in COVID-19 has been highly speculated, the inflammasome activation and participation in the outcome of the disease are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and is active in COVID-19 patients. Studying moderate and severe COVID-19 patients, we found active NLRP3 inflammasome in PBMCs and tissues of postmortem patients upon autopsy. Inflammasome-derived products such as Casp1p20 and IL-18 in the sera correlated with the markers of COVID-19 severity, including IL-6 and LDH. Moreover, higher levels of IL-18 and Casp1p20 are associated with disease severity and poor clinical outcome. Our results suggest that inflammasomes participate in the pathophysiology of the disease, indicating that these platforms might be a marker of disease severity and a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Rodrigues, Tamara S; de Sá, Keyla S G; Ishimoto, Adriene Y; Becerra, Amanda; Oliveira, Samuel; Almeida, Leticia; Gonçalves, Augusto V; Perucello, Debora B; Andrade, Warrison A; Castro, Ricardo; Veras, Flavio P; Toller-Kawahisa, Juliana E; Nascimento, Daniele C; de Lima, Mikhael H F; Silva, Camila M S; Caetite, Diego B; Martins, Ronaldo B; Castro, Italo A; Pontelli, Marjorie C; de Barros, Fabio C; do Amaral, Natália B; Giannini, Marcela C; Bonjorno, Letícia P; Lopes, Maria Isabel F; Santana, Rodrigo C; Vilar, Fernando C; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Luppino-Assad, Rodrigo; de Almeida, Sergio C L; de Oliveira, Fabiola R; Batah, Sabrina S; Siyuan, Li; Benatti, Maira N; Cunha, Thiago M; Alves-Filho, José C; Cunha, Fernando Q; Cunha, Larissa D; Frantz, Fabiani G; Kohlsdorf, Tiana; Fabro, Alexandre T; Arruda, Eurico; de Oliveira, Renê D R; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Zamboni, Dario S",,592,24

Method In this national level cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was administered to 173 technicians engaged in EEG at four clinics specializing in epilepsy care and 20 hospitals accredited as (quasi-) epilepsy centers or epilepsy training facilities in Japan from March 1 to April 30, 2021. We collected data on participants’ profiles, information about work, and psychological distress outcome measurements, such as the K-6 and Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP). Linear regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for psychological distress. Factors that were significantly associated with psychological distress in the univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis. Results Among the 142 respondents (response rate: 82%), 128 were included in the final analysis. As many as 35.2% of EEG technicians have been under psychological distress. In multivariate linear regression analysis for K-6, female sex, examination for patients (suspected) with COVID-19, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress. Contrastingly, in multivariate linear regression analysis for TMDP, female sex, presence of cohabitants who had to be separated from the respondent due to this pandemic, and change in salary or bonus were independent associated factors for psychological distress.

The present study aimed to assess the gender-dependent hand hygiene and personal protective behaviors in a national sample of Polish adolescents. The Polish Adolescents' COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study was conducted in a group of 2323 secondary school students (814 males, 1509 females). Schools were chosen based on the random quota sampling procedure. The participants were surveyed to assess their knowledge and beliefs associated with hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as their actual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of respondents gave proper answers when asked about their knowledge. However, females displayed a higher level of knowledge (p < 0.05). Most of the respondents declared not leaving home, handwashing, using alcohol-based hand rub, avoiding contact with those who may be sick, and avoiding public places as their personal protective behaviors. They declared using face masks and gloves after the legal regulation requiring people to cover their nose and mouth in public places was enacted in Poland. Regarding the use of face masks and not touching the face, no gender-dependent differences were observed, while for all the other behaviors, females declared more adherence than males (p < 0.05). Females also declared a higher daily frequency of handwashing (p < 0.0001) and washing their hands always when necessary more often than males (68.2% vs. 54.1%; p < 0.0001). Males more often indicated various reasons for not handwashing, including that there is no need to do it, they do not feel like doing it, they have no time to do it, or they forget about it (p < 0.0001), while females pointed out side effects (e.g., skin problems) as the reason (p = 0.0278). Females more often declared handwashing in circumstances associated with socializing, being exposed to contact with other people and health (p < 0.05), and declared always including the recommended steps in their handwashing procedure (p < 0.05). The results showed that female secondary school students exhibited a higher level of knowledge on hand hygiene and personal protection, as well as better behaviors, compared to males. However, irrespective of gender, some false beliefs and improper behaviors were observed, which suggests that education is necessary, especially in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guzek, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Glabska, Dominika",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),592,20

However, these recommendations are based on studies that did not take into account the extended use of respirators, which can degrade respirator fit. METHODS: We investigated the impact of extended use and decontamination with VHP on N95 Respirator Fit. We performed a prospective cohort study to determine the number of times respirators can be decontaminated before respirator fit test failure. The primary outcome was the overall number of cycles required for half of the respirators to fail (either mechanical failure or fit test failure). RESULTS: Thirty-six participants completed 360 hours of respirator usage across 90 cycles. The median number of cycles completed by participants before respirator failure was 2. The overall number of cycles required for half of respirators to fail was 1, 3, 5, and 4 for the 3M 1860(S), 3M 1870+, Moldex 151X and ProGear 88020 respirators, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of prolonged usage and VHP decontamination was associated with early failure. Decontamination and prolonged usage of respirators must be done cautiously.","Lieu, Anthony; Mah, Jordan; Zanichelli, Veronica; Exantus, Rose Carmel; Longtin, Yves",Am J Infect Control,592,23

OBJECTIVES: To report the epidemiological and clinical futures of the 200 patients infected with COVID-19 in Yichang, Hubei Province, China. STUDY DESIGN: 200 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Yichang from Jan 30 to Feb 8, 2020 were investigated retrospectively. The epidemiological data and clinical characteristics were collected. The data between the ICU patients and non-ICU patients were compared. The patients were followed up till Feb 26, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 98 (49.0 %) were male, and the mean age was 55 years. Eighty-seven (43.5 %) had no linkage to Wuhan or contact history. Familial clustering was found in 34 patients. Sixtyfive (32.5 %) suffered from chronic diseases. The common symptoms included fever (171[85.5 %]), cough (116[58.0 %]), and fatigue (64[32 %]). Most patients had lymphopenia. One hundred and seventy-two (86 %) patients showed typical imaging findings of viral pneumonia. Most patients received antiviral, antibiotic, and corticosteroid treatment. Compared with the non-ICU patients, 29 (14.5 %) patients in the ICU were older and more likely to show dyspnea and complications including ARDS. As of Feb 26, 15 (51.7 %) patients in the ICU had died. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 infection was of clustering onset and can cause severe respiratory disease and even death. The mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19 was considerably high.","Yang, Luhuan; Liu, Jinglan; Zhang, Rong; Li, Mingwu; Li, Zifeng; Zhou, Xiaojing; Hu, Chuanjun; Tian, Fei; Zhou, Fating; Lei, Yunhong",J Clin Virol,592,1

This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises during the winter, considering company size. METHODS: This study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Individuals who were registered as full-time workers were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the P-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. RESULTS: For the 27 036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working was implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 20% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well-implemented, especially in smaller enterprises. The findings suggest that occupational health support for MSMEs is urgently needed to mitigate the current wave of COVID-19.","Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Nagata, Masako; Hino, Ayako; Yamashita, Satoshi; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,592,16

It is caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which plays a key role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process, is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 subunit mediates viral cell membrane fusion. Hence, it is a key target for developing neutralizing antibodies. Here, we have performed phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is found highly conserved. The overall percent protein sequence identity from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from the NCBI database was 99.68%. The functional domains of the S protein reveal that the S1 subunit was highly conserved (99.70%) than the S2 subunit (99.66%). Further, the 319-541 residues (RBD) of amino acids within the S1 domain were 100% similar among the spike protein. The 3D modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein indicated that S protein has four domains with five protein units and the S1 subunit from 1 to 289 amino acid of domain 1 is highly conserved without any change in the ligand interaction site. This analysis clearly suggests that the S1 subunit (RBD 319-541) can be used as a target region for stable and safe vaccine development.","S N, Nagesha; B N, Ramesh; C, Pradeep; K S, Shashidhara; Ramakrishnappa, Thippeswamy; B T, Krishnaprasad; S M, Jnanashree; M, Manohar; N, Arunkumar; D, Dhanush Patel; T V, Rakesh; E, Girish; Bagoji, Mahantesh; Chandaragi, Shreeram S",,592,1

The reason older patients and males show increased risk of severe disease and death remains uncertain. Sex hormones, such as estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone, might be implicated in the age-dependent and sex-specific severity of COVID-19. High testosterone levels could upregulate transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), facilitating the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Data from patients with prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy seem to confirm this hypothesis. Clinical studies on TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat, nafamostat, and bromhexine, are ongoing. Antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide, are also under investigation. Conversely, other studies suggest that the immune modulating properties of androgens could protect from the unfavorable cytokine storm, and that low testosterone levels might be associated with a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Some evidence also supports the notion that estrogens and progesterone might exert a protective effect on females, through direct antiviral activity or immune-mediated mechanisms, thus explaining the higher COVID-19 severity in post-menopausal women. In this perspective, we discuss the available evidence on sex hormones and hormone therapy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and we highlight the possible implications for cancer patients, who can receive hormonal therapies during their treatment plans.","Cattrini, Carlo; Bersanelli, Melissa; Latocca, Maria Maddalena; Conte, Benedetta; Vallome, Giacomo; Boccardo, Francesco",,592,1

The purpose of this study is to identify medications associated with altered disease outcomes in COVID-19. A retrospective cohort comprised of all adult inpatient admissions to our centre with COVID-19 was analysed. Data concerning all antecedent prescriptions were collected and agents brought forward for analysis if prescribed to at least 20 patients in our cohort. Forty-two medications and 22 classes of medication were examined. Groups were propensity score matched and analysed by logistic and linear regression. The majority of medications did not show a statistically significant relationship with altered disease outcomes. Lower mortality was associated with use of pregabalin (p = 0.049, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.92]), inhalers of any type (p = 0.015, HR = 0.33 [0.14-0.80]) and specifically beclomethasone (p = 0.032, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.82]), tiotropium (p = 0.035, HR = 0.07 [0.01-0.83]) and steroid containing inhalers (p = 0.013, HR = 0.35 [0.15-0.79]).

There is no approved vaccine and no proven treatment for this infection. Some potential treatments that have already been associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are under investigation. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a photon-based therapy that uses light to mediate a variety of metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a branch of photodynamic therapy based on the reaction between a photosensitizing agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen, which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the viral structures such as proteins and nucleic acids. This chapter aims to discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of PBMT and aPDT in the context of the novel coronavirus. Studies indicate that PBMT and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS, but we found no direct study on SARS-CoV-2. With a combination of PBMT and aPDT, we may be able to combat COVID-19 with minimal interference with pharmaceutical agents. It might improve the efficacy of PBMT and aPDT by using monoclonal antibodies and preparing new photosensitizers at the nanoscale that target the lung tissue specifically. More animal and human studies would need to take place to reach an effective protocol. This chapter would encourage other scientists to work on this new platform.","Fekrazad, Reza; Asefi, Sohrab; Pourhajibagher, Maryam; Vahdatinia, Farshid; Fekrazad, Sepehr; Bahador, Abbas; Abrahamse, Heidi; Hamblin, Michael R",Adv Exp Med Biol,592,24

The study aimed to identify factors associated with anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers involved in COVID-19 response in Nepal. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional web-based survey conducted between April 26 and May 12, 2020. A total of 475 health workers participated in the study. Anxiety and depression were measured using a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: 0-21) and insomnia was measured by using a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI: 0-28). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 41.9% of health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depression symptoms and 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia. Stigma faced by health workers was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.62-3.76), depression (AOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.34-3.11) and insomnia (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.46-3.84). History of medication for mental health problems was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 3.40; 95% CI:1.31-8.81), depression (AOR: 3.83; 95% CI: 1.45-10.14) and insomnia (AOR: 3.82; 95% CI: 1.52-9.62) while inadequate precautionary measures in the workplace was significantly associated with higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.12-3.19) and depression (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.16-3.37). Nurses (AOR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.21-4.47) were significantly more likely to experience anxiety symptoms than other health workers. CONCLUSION: The study findings revealed a considerate proportion of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among health workers during the early phase of the pandemic in Nepal. Health workers facing stigma, those with history of medication for mental health problems, and those reporting inadequate precautionary measures in their workplace were more at risk of developing mental health outcomes. A focus on improving mental wellbeing of health workers should be immediately initiated with attention to reduction of stigma, ensuring an adequate support system such as personal protective equipments, and family support for those with history of mental health problems.","Khanal, Pratik; Devkota, Navin; Dahal, Minakshi; Paudel, Kiran; Joshi, Devavrat",Global Health,592,4

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and at the time of writing this review, just over three million individuals have been infected with more than 200,000 deaths globally. Numerous countries are in 'lockdown', social distancing is the new norm, even the most advanced healthcare systems are under pressure, and a global economic recession seems inevitable. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the aetiological agent. From experience with previous coronavirus epidemics, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2004 and 2012 respectively, it was postulated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is a possible port of cell entry. ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system and is also associated with lung and cardiovascular disorders and inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that ACE2 is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Male sex, advanced age and a number of associated comorbidities have been identified as risk factors for infection with COVID-19. Many high-risk COVID-19 patients with comorbidities are on ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and this has sparked debate about whether to continue these treatment regimes. Attention has also shifted to ACE2 being a target for future therapies or vaccines against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss COVID-19 and its complex relationship with ACE2.","Zemlin, Annalise E; Wiese, Owen J",Ann Clin Biochem,592,6

It has been reported that many compounds inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. Anthocyanins are flavonoid pigments present in fruits and vegetables, which are known to suppress symptoms related with Alzheimer's disease. However, the influence of anthocyanins on the amyloid fibril remains unclear. Here, we succeeded in the direct monitoring of the disaggregation reaction of single amyloid ß (Aß) fibrils by anthocyanins using total-internal-reflection-fluorescence microscopy with a quartz-crystal microbalance (TIRFM-QCM). It is found that the disassembly activity to the Aß fibrils depends on the number of hydroxyl groups in six-membered ring B of anthocyanin, and only delphinidin-3-galactoside, possessing three hydroxyl groups there, shows high disassembly activity. Our results show the importance of the number of hydroxyl groups and demonstrate the usefulness of TIRFM-QCM as a powerful tool in studying interactions between amyloid fibrils and compounds.","Noi, Kentaro; Ikenaka, Kensuke; Mochizuki, Hideki; Goto, Yuji; Ogi, Hirotsugu",Anal Chem,592,21

A late and uncontrolled inflammatory response characterized by high activity of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages develops in predisposed individuals and is potentially harmful in some cases. Interleukin (IL)-17 is one of the many cytokines released during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IL-17 is crucial in recruiting and activating neutrophils, cells that can migrate to the lung, and are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. During the infection T helper 17 (Th17) cells and IL-17-related pathways are associated with a worse outcome of the disease. All these have practical consequences considering that some drugs with therapeutic targets related to the Th17 response may have a beneficial effect on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we present the arguments underlying our assumption that blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis using targeted biological therapies as well as drugs that act indirectly on this pathway such as convalescent plasma therapy and colchicine may be good therapeutic options.","Sarmiento-Monroy, Juan Camilo; Parra-Medina, Rafael; Garavito, Edgar; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana",Viral Immunol,592,1

The prognostic value of GDF-15 in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. METHODS: Consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the prospective, observational COVID Mechanisms Study. Biobank samples were collected at baseline, day 3 and day 9. The primary end point was admission to the intensive care unit or death during hospitalization, and the prognostic performance of baseline and serial GDF-15 concentrations were compared with that of established infectious disease and cardiovascular biomarkers. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients enrolled, 35 (28%) reached the primary end point; these patients were older, more often had diabetes, and had lower oxygen saturations and higher National Early Warning Scores on baseline. Baseline GDF-15 concentrations were elevated (>95th percentile in age-stratified healthy individuals) in 97 (79%), and higher concentrations were associated with detectable SARS-CoV-2 viremia and hypoxemia (both P<0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had higher concentrations of GDF-15 (median, 4225 [IQR, 3197-5972] pg/mL versus median, 2187 [IQR, 1344-3620] pg/mL, P<0.001). The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.86). The association between GDF-15 and the primary end point persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (P<0.001) and was superior and incremental to interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Increase in GDF-15 from baseline to day 3 was also greater in patients reaching the primary end point (median, 1208 [IQR, 0-4305] pg/mL versus median, -86 [IQR, -322 to 491] pg/mL, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 is elevated in the majority of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and higher concentrations are associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, hypoxemia, and worse outcome.

AIM: To evaluate the knowledge, awareness, perception, and response of the general public to COVID-19 in China. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire comprising 47 questions designed in both English and Chinese was developed. The survey was conducted via WeChat, a multipurpose messaging, social media, and mobile payment app that is widely used by the Chinese population. In total, 1006 participants responded, and most of them were from different provinces of mainland China. RESULTS: Overall, this comprehensive survey revealed that the general public in China is highly aware of the basic information concerning COVID-19 and its precautions. Interestingly, more respondents (99.3%) were aware of the term severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) than COVID-19 (97.2%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (73.4%). Among them, 2.4%, 1.6%, and 0.9% said that they or their family members or friends were affected by COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Presenteeism (going to work ill) is a phenomenon studied from different perspectives, and it has become especially important during the current COVID-19 outbreak; its connection to high healthcare costs, patient safety breaches and negative nurse well-being has been proved. INTRODUCTION: The nursing profession is particularly associated with caring for the culture of teamwork, loyalty to colleagues and professional identity. This condition enhances the 'super nurse phenomenon', even though nurses do not feel physically and psychologically able to work. METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted in three different country contexts: Oviedo (Spain), Porto (Portugal) and São Paulo (Brazil). Nurses performing functions in hospitals and primary health care were enrolled. Informed consent and data collection questionnaires were hand delivered. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6 was applied. RESULTS: A total of 659 nurses participated. Portuguese nurses showed greater prevalence of presenteeism, followed by Brazilian and Spanish nurses. Younger nurses with less professional experience presented lower levels of presenteeism but greater psychological commitment. Male participants showed lower capacity to complete work when ill than female participants. CONCLUSIONS: Age and length of professional experience proved to be significant predictors of total presenteeism, although only professional experience revealed statistical significance in the adjusted model. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The knowledge of this phenomenon among nurses highlights the need for the development of strategies in the curriculum of nursing students and organizations. Resilience and ergonomic training should be applied in the training programmes of the students and reinforced by the health centre managers. It is essential that healthcare systems design worksite wellness programmes that pursue greater physical and mental well-being for healthcare professionals.","Mosteiro-Díaz, Maria-Pilar; Baldonedo-Mosteiro, María; Borges, Elisabete; Baptista, Patricia; Queirós, Cristina; Sánchez-Zaballos, Marta; Felli, Vanda; Abreu, Margarida; Silva, Fábio; Franco-Correia, Sara",Int. nurs. rev,592,21

Results showed that the amylose content of Tartary buckwheat starch (TBS) and common buckwheat starch (CBS) was 3-4% lower than that of wheat starch. However, no significant difference in the digestibility was found between them. The fast digestion rate coefficient of TBS was negatively correlated with the amount of long amylopectin chains (24 < DP &#8804; 36), and the total digested starch percentage of CBS was negatively correlated with the amount of medium-long amylopectin chains (13 < DP &#8804; 24). This suggests that the digestibility of fully gelatinized starch had no association with the botanical sources but may be more influenced by starch structure.","Du, Jin; Pan, Ruirong; Obadi, Mohammed; Li, Haiteng; Shao, Feng; Sun, Jun; Wang, Yifan; Qi, Yajing; Xu, Bin",Food Chem,592,20

Would it be appropriate to say that rigorous hand hygiene practices among health care workers (HCWs) have reduced HAIs in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan? This commentary is written to understand the effect of rigorous hand hygiene among HCWs on number of HAIs during COVID-19 pandemic. Given the seriousness of this outbreak, it was observed that the hand hygiene has occupied a new place of importance in the minds of HCWs. We observed 4 times increase in the consumption of hand sanitizers after COVID-19 outbreak. The increased consumption of hand sanitizers was reflected in improved hand hygiene practices. A reduction was observed in the number of HAIs after the COVID-19 outbreak, and we assume that the dip in HAIs is associated with the improvement in hand hygiene practices in the recent months.

Our findings raise doubt about the efficiency of minimally enforced social distancing policies, as well as commonly assumed motivations for compliance. Our results also imply that those with preexisting health conditions may not voluntarily comply, resulting in higher health care congestion than otherwise expected.","Sheth, Ketki; Wright, Greg C",Rev Econ Househ,592,1

In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.

Further testing for antigen processing yielded 826 peptides of which 451 were 9-mers that were analyzed for potential antigenicity. Antigenic properties were predicted for 102 of the 451 peptides. Further assessment for potential allergenicity and toxicity narrowed the number of candidate CTL epitopes to 50 peptide sequences, 45 of which were present in all strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were tested. The predicted CTL epitopes were then tested to eliminate those with MHC class II binding potential, a property that could induce hyperinflammatory responses mediated by TH2 cells in immunized hosts.

In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

Rapid increases in patient volumes have exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems and challenged our ability to provide optimal patient care and adequate safety measures to healthcare workers (HCWs). OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that US neurologists were experiencing significant challenges with lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid changes in practice and varying institutional protocols, we conducted this survey study. METHODS: A 36-item survey was distributed to neurologists around the US through various media platforms. RESULTS: Over a one-week period, 567 responses were received. Of these, 56% practiced in academia. A total of 87% had access to PPE with 45% being asked to reuse PPE due to shortages. The pandemic caused rapid changes in practice, most notably a shift towards providing care by teleneurology, although a third experienced challenges in transitioning to this model. Wide variations were noted both in testing and in the guidance provided for the exposed, sick or vulnerable HCWs. Notably, 59% of respondents felt that their practices were doing what they could, although 56% did not feel safe taking care of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results from our survey demonstrate significant variability in preparedness and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic in neurology, impacted by region, health care setting and practice model. Practice guidelines from professional societies and other national entities are needed to improve protection for physicians and their patients, promote recommended practice changes during a pandemic, and optimize future preparedness for public health emergencies.","Sharma, Akanksha; Maxwell, Christina R; Farmer, Jill; Greene-Chandos, Diana; LaFaver, Kathrin; Benameur, Karima",Neurology,592,26

Individual schools, school systems, or local or regional governments have different policies with respect to whether, and what kind of, exemptions may be allowed. In the setting of the current pandemic, questions regarding the acceptability of exemptions have resurfaced, as schools and local governments struggle with how to safely return children to school. Anticipating that school attendance will be facilitated by the development of a vaccine, school systems will face decisions about whether to mandate vaccination and whether to permit exemptions. The American Academy of Pediatrics promulgates policy favoring the elimination of nonmedical exemptions generally in schools. This discussion considers whether schools should eliminate nonmedical exemptions to vaccination as proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics policy, ultimately concluding that broad elimination of exemptions is not justified and advocating a more nuanced approach that encourages school attendance while promoting vaccination and broader public health goals.","Paquette, Erin Talati",J Pediatr,592,16

We compared the frequency of acute respiratory and febrile presentations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between groups and with data available from the previous year. In children with asthma, we also compared current and historical disease control. RESULTS: During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison with the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were improved during the pandemic. When compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, or hospitalizations during the pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged. CONCLUSION: Childhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Custovic, Adnan; Deschildre, Antoine; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Wong, Gary; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Abou-Taam, Rola; Agache, Ioana; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A; Chen, Zhimin; Cros, Pierrick; Dubus, Jean-Christophe; El-Sayed, Zeinab Awad; El-Owaidy, Rasha; Feleszko, Wojciech; Fierro, Vincenzo; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Garcia-Marcos, Luis; Goh, Anne; Hossny, Elham M; Huerta Villalobos, Yunuen R; Jartti, Tuomas; Le Roux, Pascal; Levina, Julia; López García, Aida Inés; Ramos, Ángel Mazón; Morais-Almeida, Mário; Murray, Clare; Nagaraju, Karthik; Nagaraju, Major K; Navarrete Rodriguez, Elsy Maureen; Namazova-Baranova, Leyla; Nieto Garcia, Antonio; Pozo Beltrán, Cesar Fireth; Ratchataswan, Thanaporn; Rivero Yeverino, Daniela; Rodríguez Zagal, Eréndira; Schweitzer, Cyril E; Tulkki, Marleena; Wasilczuk, Katarzyna; Xu, Dan",Allergy,592,1

RESULTS: During the pandemic, children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and hospitalizations due to asthma, in comparison with the preceding year. Sixty-six percent of asthmatic children had improved asthma control while in 33% the improvement exceeded the minimal clinically important difference. Pre-bronchodilatation FEV1 and peak expiratory flow rate were improved during the pandemic. When compared to non-asthmatic controls, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTIs, episodes of pyrexia, emergency visits, or hospitalizations during the pandemic. However, an increased risk of URTIs emerged. CONCLUSION: Childhood asthma outcomes, including control, were improved during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, probably because of reduced exposure to asthma triggers and increased treatment adherence. The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; Custovic, Adnan; Deschildre, Antoine; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Wong, Gary; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Abou-Taam, Rola; Agache, Ioana; Castro-Rodriguez, Jose A; Chen, Zhimin; Cros, Pierrick; Dubus, Jean-Christophe; El-Sayed, Zeinab Awad; El-Owaidy, Rasha; Feleszko, Wojciech; Fierro, Vincenzo; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Garcia-Marcos, Luis; Goh, Anne; Hossny, Elham M; Huerta Villalobos, Yunuen R; Jartti, Tuomas; Le Roux, Pascal; Levina, Julia; López García, Aida Inés; Ramos, Ángel Mazón; Morais-Almeida, Mário; Murray, Clare; Nagaraju, Karthik; Nagaraju, Major K; Navarrete Rodriguez, Elsy Maureen; Namazova-Baranova, Leyla; Nieto Garcia, Antonio; Pozo Beltrán, Cesar Fireth; Ratchataswan, Thanaporn; Rivero Yeverino, Daniela; Rodríguez Zagal, Eréndira; Schweitzer, Cyril E; Tulkki, Marleena; Wasilczuk, Katarzyna; Xu, Dan",Allergy,592,16

A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren; Yi, Grace; Jaleel, Afareen; Nwosu, Chikaodinaka; Limaye, Rupali",Hum Vaccin Immunother,592,1

The present study is mainly related to the airborne transmission of novel coronavirus through airway. Similarly, our mother planet is suffering from drastic effects of air pollution. There are sufficient probabilities or evidences proven for contagious virus transmission through polluted airborne-pathway in formed aerosol molecules. The pathways and sources of spread are detailed along with the best possible green control technologies or ideas to hinder further transmission. The combined effects of such root causes and unwanted outcomes are similar in nature leading to acute cardiac arrest of our planet. To maintain environmental sustainability, the prior future of such emerging unknown biological hazardous air emissions is to be thoroughly researched. So it is high time to deal with the future of hazardous air pollution and work on its preventive measures. The lifetime of such an airborne virus continues for several hours, thus imposing severe threat even during post-lockdown phase. The world waits eagerly for the development of successful vaccination or medication but the possible outcome is quite uncertain in terms of equivalent economy distribution and biomedical availability. Thus, risk assessments are to be carried out even during the post-vaccination period with proper environmental surveillance and monitoring. The skilled techniques of disinfection, sanitization, and other viable wayouts are to be modified with time, place, and prevailing climatic conditions, handling the pandemic efficiently.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed analyzing claims data from a large German Hospital network during the COVID-19 outbreak (study period: March 13-May 21, 2020) as compared to periods directly before the outbreak (same year control: January 1-March 12, 2020) and one year earlier (previous year control: March 13-May 21, 2019). RESULTS: A total of 13,151 emergency hospital admissions for psychiatric diagnoses were included in the analysis. For all psychiatric diagnoses combined, emergency admissions significantly decreased during the study period with mean (interquartile range) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 0.68 (0.65, 0.71) and 0.70 (0.67, 0.73) as compared to the same and previous year controls, respectively (both p < 0.00001). IRR ranged from 0.56 for mood affective disorders (F30-F39) to 0.75 for mental disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19; all p < 0.00001). Mean (standard deviation) length of hospital stay for all psychiatric diagnoses was significantly shorter during the study period [9.8 (11.6) days] as compared to same [14.7 (18.7) days] and previous [16.4 (23.9) days] year controls (both p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: Both emergency hospital admissions and length of hospital stay significantly decreased for psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak.

In this study, we applied ground- and satellite-based data of five criteria air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO) and meteorological factors from March 8 to May 15, 2020 (before, partial-, and full-lockdown). The generalized additive models (GAMs), wavelet coherence, and random forest (RF) model were employed to explore the relationship between air quality indicators and COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka city. Results show that overall, 26, 20.4, 17.5, 9.7 and 8.8% declined in PM 2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO concentrations, respectively, in Dhaka City during the partial and full lockdown compared to the period before the lockdown. The implementation of lockdown policy for containing COVID-19 transmission played a crucial role in reducing air pollution. The findings of wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence demonstrate no standalone coherence, but interestingly, multiple wavelet coherence indicated a strong short-term coherence among air pollutants and meteorological factors with the COVID-19 outbreak. Outcomes of GAMs indicated that an increase of 1-unit in long-term exposure to O3 and CO (lag1) was associated with a 2.9% (95% CI: -0.3%, -5.6%), and 53.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, -107.9%) decreased risk of COVID-19 infection rate during the full-lockdown period. Whereas, COVID-19 infection and MT (mean temperature) are modulated by a peak during full-lockdown, which is mostly attributed to contact transmission in Dhaka city. RF model revealed among the parameters being studied, MT, RH (relative humidity), and O3 were the dominant factors that could be associated with COVID-19 cases during the study period. The outcomes reported here could elucidate the effectiveness of lockdown scenarios for COVID-19 containment and air pollution control in Dhaka city.","Rahman, Md Siddiqur; Azad, Md Abul Kalam; Hasanuzzaman, Md; Salam, Roquia; Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul; Rahman, Md Mostafizur; Hoque, Mir Md Mozammal",Sci Total Environ,592,20

All but one of these introductions were not from China, suggesting that border closure with China has helped delay establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Russia. These introductions resulted in at least 9 distinct Russian lineages corresponding to domestic transmission. A notable transmission cluster corresponded to a nosocomial outbreak at the Vreden hospital in Saint Petersburg; phylodynamic analysis of this cluster reveals multiple (2-3) introductions each giving rise to a large number of cases, with a high initial effective reproduction number of 3.0 [1.9, 4.3].","Komissarov, Andrey B; Safina, Ksenia R; Garushyants, Sofya K; Fadeev, Artem V; Sergeeva, Mariia V; Ivanova, Anna A; Danilenko, Daria M; Lioznov, Dmitry; Shneider, Olga V; Shvyrev, Nikita; Spirin, Vadim; Glyzin, Dmitry; Shchur, Vladimir; Bazykin, Georgii A",Nat Commun,592,3

SARS-CoV-2 replication in ACE-2-expressing pneumocytes can drive the diffuse alveolar injury through the cytokine storm and immunothrombosis by upregulating the transcription of chemokine/cytokines, unlike several other respiratory viruses. Here we report histopathology data obtained in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19, showing the increased density of perivascular and septal mast cells (MCs) and IL-4-expressing cells (n = 6), in contrast to the numbers found in pandemic H1N1-induced pneumonia (n = 10) or Control specimens (n = 10). Noteworthy, COVID-19 lung biopsies showed a higher density of CD117+ cells, suggesting that c-kit positive MCs progenitors were recruited earlier to the alveolar septa. These findings suggest that MC proliferation/differentiation in the alveolar septa might be harnessed by the shift toward IL-4 expression in the inflamed alveolar septa. Future studies may clarify whether the fibrin-dependent generation of the hyaline membrane, processes that require the diffusion of procoagulative plasma factors into the alveolar lumen and the endothelial dysfunction, are preceded by MC-driven formation of interstitial edema in the alveolar septa.","Motta Junior, Jarbas da Silva; Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia Ribeiro Dos Santos; Nagashima, Seigo; de Paula, Caroline Busatta Vaz; Baena, Cristina Pellegrino; Scharfstein, Julio; de Noronha, Lucia",Front Immunol,592,10

From here, I argue for the imperative to centre an expansive conception of care in critical community psychology work. Specifically, I posit that by working with and alongside activist care workers, community psychologists can assist in building socially just modalities of care. After reflecting on my work with collective caring initiatives, I offer five (tentative) guiding principles for a community psychology that is committed to addressing the crisis of care, namely: (1) commitment to building political coalitions; (2) commitment to refuting capitalist conceptions of care; (3) commitment to expanding conceptions of care; (4) commitment to embracing the psychological consequences of care work; and (5) a politicoethical commitment.","Malherbe, Nick",J Community Psychol,592,13

These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others. At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance. The current situation represents a good opportunity for us all to change habits to implement a less sedentary lifestyle, for now and the future. This can start with changes we can make at home during lockdown.","Diamond, Rowan; Byrd, Erin",J Affect Disord,592,1

Combining experimental, numerical, and theoretical analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the transport of motile bacteria in shear flows. Experimentally, we obtain with high accuracy and, for a large range of flow rates, the spatially resolved velocity and orientation distributions. They are in excellent agreement with the simulations of a kinematic model accounting for stochastic and microhydrodynamic properties and, in particular, the flagella chirality. Theoretical analysis reveals the scaling laws behind the average rheotactic velocity at moderate shear rates using a chirality parameter and explains the reorientation dynamics leading to saturation at large shear rates from the marginal stability of a fixed point. Our findings constitute a full understanding of the physical mechanisms and relevant parameters of bacteria bulk rheotaxis.","Jing, Guangyin; Zöttl, Andreas; Clément, Éric; Lindner, Anke",Sci.

DIAGNOSES: Diagnostic work-up and differential diagnosis were made difficult by patient isolation, absence of lab tests, and his visit via telemedicine, even though signs of first metacarpophalangeal joint involvement were clear. INTERVENTIONS: Due to the inefficacy of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the patient was prescribed oral steroids with a rapid benefit. OUTCOMES: The patient's response to oral steroid was prompt and maintained even after therapy tapering. Even so, a formal diagnosis was not possible due to a difficult diagnostic work-up and lack of a long-term follow-up.

In psoriatic patients treated with biologic agents, evidence is not yet available on susceptibility to infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and data about the perception of COVID-19 and its impact on these patients are lacking. AIMS: The aim of this observational, spontaneous study was the evaluation of the impact of anti COVID-19 measures in ""fragile population"" such as patients with a chronic inflammatory disease. Thus, we evaluated the impact of perceived risk on quality of life of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, in our outpatient clinic, and how their perceptions changed before and after the adoption of Covid-19 emergency measures following the Italian Ministerial Decree in March 9, 2020. METHODS: Using a series of questions, our study surveyed adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving treatment with biologic agents (n = 591), before and after the adoption of COVID-19 emergency measures. RESULTS: Most patients (97%) had been sufficiently informed by healthcare staff about COVID-19 spread. A significant change was observed in social activity reduction before and after the adoption of the measures (18% vs. 90% of patients; P < 0.0001). Similarly, patients were more likely to suspend ongoing therapy after the measures were adopted than before (87% vs. 34% of patients; P < 0.0001). Following the measures, older patients were significantly more inclined to suspend therapy and reduce social activities than younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Government COVID-19 emergency measures further curtailed already reduced social activities in psoriatic patients, and led to a greater inclination to suspend biologic therapy, more so in older patients, despite there being no evidence to support this suspension. These vulnerable patients may need support from clinicians in order to maintain treatment adherence.","Bernardini, N; Skroza, N; Spagnoli, A; Marchesiello, A; Balduzzi, V; Tolino, E; Mambrin, A; Michelini, S; Maddalena, P; Volpe, S; Proietti, I; Vestri, A; Potenza, C",J Infect Public Health,592,14

Antiviral therapy is the most important treatment for COVID-19. Among the drugs under investigation, anti-malarials, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are being repurposed as treatment for COVID-19. CQ/HCQ were shown to prevent receptor recognition by coronaviruses, inhibit endosome acidification, which interferes with membrane fusion, and exhibit immunomodulatory activity. These multiple mechanisms may work together to exert a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. A number of in vitro studies revealed inhibitory effects of CQ/HCQ on various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 although conflicting results exist. Several clinical studies showed that CQ/HCQ alone or in combination with a macrolide may alleviate the clinical symptoms of COVID-19, promote viral conversion, and delay disease progression, with less serious adverse effects. However, recent studies indicated that the use of CQ/HCQ, alone or in combination with a macrolide, did not show any favorable effect on patients with COVID-19. Adverse effects, including prolonged QT interval after taking CQ/HCQ, may develop in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, current data are not sufficient enough to support the use of CQ/HCQ as therapies for COVID-19 and increasing caution should be taken about the application of CQ/HCQ in COVID-19 before conclusive findings are obtained by well-designed, multi-center, randomized, controlled studies.","Sun, JingKang; Chen, YuTing; Fan, XiuDe; Wang, XiaoYun; Han, QunYing; Liu, ZhengWen",Postgrad Med,592,2

The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse glucocorticoid therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoronaVirus (CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections and describe a case-series of COVID-19 patients treated with off-label pulse doses of methylprednisolone. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review on safety and efficacy of pulse therapy for betacoronaviridae infections as described in the protocol registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020190183). All consecutive patients admitted to Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova di Reggio Emilia or Guastalla Hospital with COVID-19 between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and treated with methylprednisolone 1 gram/day for at least three days were included in the case series. A retrospective review of available computed tomography (CT) scan and chest x-ray was performed independently by two radiologists blinded to clinical data, and discordances were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Twenty papers were included for SARS, but only two were comparative and were included in the primary endpoint analysis. Likewise, eleven papers were included for COVID-19, four of which were comparative and were considered for the primary outcome analysis. Included studies for both SARS and COVID-19 are mostly retrospective and highly heterogeneous, with lethality ranging from 0% to 100% and ICU admission rate ranging from 9% to 100%. Fourteen patients were included in our case series, 7 males and 7 females. CONCLUSIONS: No randomised controlled trial is available yet for corticosteroids pulse-therapy defined as at least &#8805;500mg/day methylprednisolone in patients with emerging coronavirus pneumonia. Lethality among our cohort is high (4/14), but this finding should be interpreted with caution due to the fact that in our setting pulse-steroids were used in patients not eligible for other treatments because of comorbidities or as rescue therapy.

Our previously reported first-in-class bacterial transcription inhibitors ""nusbiarylins"" presented a promising prospect towards the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents with a novel mechanism. Here we investigated and characterised the lead nusbiarylin compound, MC4, and several of its chemical derivatives in both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and the S. aureus type strains, demonstrating their capacity for the arrest of growth and cellular respiration, impairment of RNA and intracellular protein levels at subinhibitory concentrations. In some instances, derivatives of MC4 were also shown to attenuate the production of staphylococcal virulence factors in vitro, such as the exoproteins &#945;-toxin and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Trends observed from quantitative PCR assays suggested that nusbiarylins elicited these effects possibly by acting via but not limited to the modulation of global regulatory pathways, such as the agr regulon, which coordinates the expression of S. aureus genes associated with virulence. Our findings encourage the continued development of more potent compounds within this novel family of bacterial transcription inhibitors.","Chu, Adrian Jun; Qiu, Yangyi; Harper, Rachel; Lin, Lin; Ma, Cong; Yang, Xiao",,592,1

Innovative approaches for evaluating the biological activity of these cytokines in vivo are urgently needed to complement clinical trials of therapeutic targeting of IL-1ß and IL-6 in COVID-19. We show that the expression of IL-1ß or IL-6 inducible transcriptional signatures (modules) reflects the bioactivity of these cytokines in immunopathology modelled by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and rheumatoid arthritis. In COVID-19, elevated expression of IL-1ß and IL-6 response modules, but not the cytokine transcripts themselves, is a feature of infection in the nasopharynx and blood, but is not associated with severity of COVID-19 disease, length of stay or mortality. We propose that IL-1ß and IL-6 transcriptional response modules provide a dynamic readout of functional cytokine activity in vivo, aiding quantification of the biological effects of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Bell, Lucy Ck; Meydan, Cem; Kim, Jacob; Foox, Jonathan; Butler, Daniel; Mason, Christopher E; Shapira, Sagi D; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Pollara, Gabriele",iScience,592,16

The primary roles of the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein are to interact with the viral genome and pack them into ribonucleoprotein complex. It also plays critical roles at many stages of the viral life cycle. Herein, we explore the N protein of SARS-CoV2 to identify promising epitope-based vaccine candidates and target the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein for potential inhibitors using an integrative bioinformatics approach. We identified B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes that are non-toxic, non-allergenic, capable of inducing IFN-Î³ and structurally stable with high global population coverage of response. The 404SKQLQQSMSSADS416 and 92RRIRGGDGKMKDL104 sequences of N-protein were identified to induce B-cell immunity. We also identified 79SSPDDQIGY87 and 305AQFAPSASAFFGMSR319 as potential T-cell epitopes that form stable structures with human leucocyte antigens. We have also identified zidovudine triphosphate, an anti-HIV agent, as a potential inhibitor of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 N-protein based on docking and simulation analysis and should be considered for experimental validations.

Here, we profiled SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses in a cohort of 22 hospitalized individuals. Despite inter-individual heterogeneity, distinct antibody signatures resolved individuals with different outcomes. Although no differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels were observed, spike-specific humoral responses were enriched among convalescent individuals, whereas functional antibody responses to the nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals. Furthermore, this enriched immunodominant spike-specific antibody profile in convalescents was confirmed in a larger validation cohort. These results demonstrate that early antigen-specific and qualitative features of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies point to differences in disease trajectory, highlighting the potential importance of functional antigen-specific humoral immunity to guide patient care and vaccine development.","Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Zohar, Tomer; Slein, Matthew D; Burke, John; Loos, Carolin; McCulloch, Denise J; Newman, Kira L; Wolf, Caitlin; Yu, Jingyou; Shuey, Kiel; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake Marie; Caradonna, Tim; Schmidt, Aaron G; Suscovich, Todd J; Linde, Caitlyn; Cai, Yongfei; Barouch, Dan; Ryan, Edward T; Charles, Richelle C; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Chu, Helen; Alter, Galit",Immunity,592,16

Effective drugs are urgently needed to decrease the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently unavailable. Herein, we systematically evaluated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of both lung tissue and blood from COVID-19 patients using transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed potential core mechanism of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in which IFN-&#945;, IFN-ß, IFN-Î³, TNF and IL6 triggered cytokine storm mediated by neutrophil, macrophage, B and DC cells. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two gene modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits of COVID-19 patients, and confirmed that over-activation of immune system-mediated cytokine release syndrome is the underlying pathogenic mechanism for acute phase of COVID-19 infection. It suggested that anti-inflammatory therapies may be promising regimens for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, drug repurposing analysis of thousands of drugs revealed that TNF&#945; inhibitor etanercept and Î³-aminobutyric acid-B receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen showed most significant reversal power to COVID-19 gene signature, so we are highly optimistic about their clinical use for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, our results suggested that adalimumab, tocilizumab, rituximab and glucocorticoids may also have beneficial effects in restoring normal transcriptome, but not chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or interferons.

Now they are highly politicized with battles about mask-wearing protocols breaking out in public. Although masks have obtained a new urgency and ubiquity in the context of COVID-19, people have thought about both the literal and metaphorical role of masks in medicine for generations. In this paper, we discuss three such metaphors-the masks of objectivity, of infallibility, and of benevolence-and their powerful role in medicine. These masks can be viewed as inflexible barriers to communication, contributing to the traditional authoritarian relationship between doctor and patient and concealing the authenticity and vulnerability of physicians. COVID masks, by contrast, offer a more nuanced and morally complex metaphor for thinking about protecting people from harm, authentic and trustworthy communication, and attention to potential inequities both in and beyond medical settings. We highlight the morally relevant challenges and opportunities that masks evoke and suggest that there is much to be gained from rethinking the mask metaphor in medicine.","Grubbs, Lindsey; Geller, Gail",J Med Humanit,592,26

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among adults in China and its variation among provinces and by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Between May 8 and June 8, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among adults in China who were registered with the private survey company KuRunData. We set a target sample size of 10,000 adults, aiming to sample 300-360 adults from each province in China. Participants were asked 25 questions that tested their knowledge about COVID-19, including measures to prevent infection, common symptoms, and recommended care-seeking behavior. We disaggregated responses by age; sex; education; province; household income; rural-urban residency; and whether or not a participant had a family member, friend, or acquaintance who they know to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. All analyses used survey sampling weights. RESULTS: There were 5079 men and 4921 women who completed the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. Out of 25 knowledge questions, participants answered a mean and median of 21.4 (95% CI 21.3-21.4) and 22 (IQR 20-23) questions correctly, respectively. A total of 83.4% (95% CI 82.7%-84.1%) of participants answered four-fifths or more of the questions correctly. For at least one of four ineffective prevention measures (using a hand dryer, regular nasal irrigation, gargling mouthwash, and taking antibiotics), 68.9% (95% CI 68.0%-69.8%) of participants answered that it was an effective method to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although knowledge overall was similar across provinces, the percent of participants who answered the question on recommended care-seeking behavior correctly varied from 47.0% (95% CI 41.4%-52.7%) in Tibet to 87.5% (95% CI 84.1%-91.0%) in Beijing. Within provinces, participants who were male, were middle-aged, were residing in urban areas, and had higher household income tended to answer a higher proportion of the knowledge questions correctly. CONCLUSIONS: This online study of individuals across China suggests that the majority of the population has good knowledge of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion still holds misconceptions or incorrect beliefs about prevention methods and recommended health care-seeking behaviors, especially in rural areas and some less wealthy provinces in Western China. This study can inform the development of tailored public health policies and promotion campaigns by identifying knowledge areas for which misconceptions are comparatively common and provinces that have relatively low knowledge.","Yu, Fengyun; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Meierkord, Anne; Yang, Juntao; Chen, Qiushi; Jiao, Lirui; Abou-Arraj, Nadeem E; Pan, An; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till; Chen, Simiao",J Med Internet Res,592,4

This survey study sought to identify practice changes, to understand current personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and to determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers vs in states with low case numbers. METHODS: A 14-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country through REDCap from April 14 to April 21, 2020, with responses closed on April 23, 2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). RESULTS: A total of 121 vascular surgeons responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE. The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between states with high and low COVID-19 case volumes (P = .285). States with high case volume were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs 77.5%; P = .046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attending vascular surgeons worked with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attending vascular surgeons have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in states with high case volume compared with low case volume (P = .039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons think that they do not have adequate PPE to perform their clinical duties. CONCLUSIONS: The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases, with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty; however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey.","Latz, Christopher A; Boitano, Laura T; Png, C Y Maximilian; Tanious, Adam; Kibrik, Pavel; Conrad, Mark; Eagleton, Matthew; Dua, Anahita",J. vasc. surg,592,32

An Amazon Mechanical Turk sample of 829 individuals was evaluated with a series of instruments assessing the severity of the OCRDs before and during the pandemic. Additional questionnaires about sociodemographic factors, personal and family histories of OCRD, COVID-19 related events, compulsivity and impulsivity traits, schizotypal symptoms, and the severity of depression, anxiety and stress levels, were also used. Participants reported that OCD, hoarding disorder (HD) and skin picking disorder (SPD) symptoms significantly worsened during the pandemic along with increased disability, more affective symptoms and reduced quality of life. Female gender, a higher number of COVID-19 related stressful events, and higher pre-COVID-19 fear of harm and symmetry symptoms predicted more severe OCD symptoms during the pandemic, whereas lack of a HD diagnosis by a mental health professional and more severe schizotypal symptoms predicted worsened hoarding symptoms. Greater compulsivity traits were associated with more severe COVID-19 pandemic obsessive-compulsive and hoarding symptoms. These data indicate that the immense distress resulting from the COVID-19 included significant deterioration of OCRDs' symptoms, particularly of OCD, HD and SPD. It was also possible to identify a pre-pandemic profile of people most at risk of pandemic-related deterioration in OCRDs' symptoms, which may prove valuable for preventative initiatives in relation to the likely future waves of COVID-19 or of other communicable diseases.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of human viruses can be a useful tool for population-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease, particularly within urban centres. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis (March-July 2020) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the UK (total population equivalent 3 million) by q(RT-)PCR and viral genome sequencing. Our results demonstrate that levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres, with a marked decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures. The strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. Further, sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co-circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites, and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar SNPs observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrate how WBE can be used for both community-level detection and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus' prevalence, and can inform public health policy decisions. Although, greater understanding of the factors that affect SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater are needed for the full integration of WBE data into outbreak surveillance. In conclusion, our results lend support to the use of routine WBE for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and assessment of the effectiveness of disease control measures.","Hillary, Luke S; Farkas, Kata; Maher, Kathryn H; Lucaci, Anita; Thorpe, Jamie; Distaso, Marco A; Gaze, William H; Paterson, Steve; Burke, Terry; Connor, Thomas R; McDonald, James E; Malham, Shelagh K; Jones, David L",Water Res,592,16

This study aims to identify the characteristics of patients in whom imaging progression occurred while clinical symptoms were relieved and to guide radiological reexamination. Methods: This retrospective study included 73 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All patients received CT reexaminations within 24 h after symptomatic remission. We divided patients into two groups according to the matching degree between clinical and imaging outcomes. Results: 21 patients displayed imaging progression while symptoms relieved. Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46–65) v 47 (37–60.75), P = 0.030]; lymphopenia (66.7% v 40.4%, P = 0.042) and low level of C-reactive protein [mg/L: 5.7 (1.9–20.2) v 18.9 (6.7–38.9), P = 0.038]. An age over 50 was an independent risk factor for imaging progression (OR = 3.41, 95%CI 1.14–10.20, P = 0.028).

Healthcare workers (HCW) in radiology departments are exposed to a high infection risk similar to HCWs in the ICU or dedicated COVID wards. The goal of our paper is to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 among radiology HCWs in two different hospitals and regions in Germany with a low and high COVID-19 prevalence and to compare it to the prevalence in other clinical personnel. Additionally, we assessed the number of radiological procedures performed in patients with a positive PCR test (C+) followed by a short review of the risk for nosocomial infections of radiology HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first COVID-19 wave between March and July 2020, we evaluated a region with one of the highest COVID-19 rates (776-1570/100â000) in Germany (Hospital A). Additionally, we assessed Hospital B in a region with a low prevalence (65/100â000). We tested the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among the whole staff with a subgroup analysis for radiology in both hospitals. We calculated the total number of different radiological procedures performed in C+ patients. RESULTS: In Hospital A 594 PCR-proven C+ patients were treated resulting in 2723 radiological procedures. 24â% (nâ=â6) of the radiology technicians and 13.35 (nâ=â2) of radiologists had a positive IgG test. The rates were similar to positive rates in HCWs in COVID-19 wards and ICUs within the hospital. The most frequently performed procedures in C+ patients were chest X-rays (3.17/patient) and CT examinations (1.15/patient). In Hospital B 50 C+ patients were treated, resulting in 64 radiological procedures. None of the HCWs tested IgG positive. The most frequently performed examinations were also chest X-rays (1.04/patient) and CT (0.2/patient). CONCLUSION: HCWs in radiology have a high occupational infection risk similar to that of HCWs in ICUs and dedicated COVID wards. KEY POINTS: · The risk of acquiring COVID-19 increases with the amount of contact with infected individuals.. · The occupational risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection for radiology staff is similar to that of nurses and physicians in COVID wards.. · Hygiene concepts and medical resources have to be adapted for further COVID outbreaks.. · Reporting of an occupational disease can be considered in the case of seropositive staff..

However, selection into medical school is the gateway to medicine in many countries, and it is critical to use processes which are evidence-based, valid and reliable even under challenging circumstances. Our challenge was to plan and conduct a multiple-mini interview (MMI) in a dynamic and stringent safe distancing context.Methods: This paper reports a case study of how to plan, re-plan and conduct MMIs in an environment where substantially tighter safe distancing measures were introduced just before the MMI was due to be delivered.Results: We report on how to design and implement a fully remote, online MMI which ensured the safety of candidates and assessors.Discussion: We discuss the challenges of this approach and also reflect on broader issues associated with selection into medical school during a pandemic. The aim of the paper is to provide broadly generalizable guidance to other medical schools faced with the challenge of selecting future students under difficult conditions.","Cleland, Jennifer; Chu, Jowe; Lim, Samuel; Low, Jamie; Low-Beer, Naomi; Kwek, Tong Kiat",Med Teach,592,22

We find two different growth patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate scaling exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling exponents of 8-11. In the case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By means of data analysis we confirm that instituting strict measures of lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are effective means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted measures there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so far where such lock-downs led to a significant reduction of the growth rate.

Several pulmonary and systemic manifestations of the illness have been described since the discovery of this virus. However, there have been higher-risk populations in which this infection has not been well studied nor documented. One of these populations includes the pregnant cohort. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection in the pregnant population and review the implications and sequelae of the infection throughout pregnancy and outcomes of live births. Also, we summarize the understanding and safety of current treatments and vaccination in pregnancy. This comprehensive review article comprises several case reports, case series, cohort studies, retrospective studies, and randomized clinical trials. Findings regarding maternal morbidity included an increased risk of acquiring severe COVID-19 infection requiring a higher level of inpatient hospital care along with an increased risk of preterm labor and cesarean delivery. Neonatal COVID-19 vertical transmission was shown to have conflicting data as there was a presence of transmission in certain retrospective studies and absence in others. There was also no evidence of teratogenicity from maternal COVID-19 infection. In conclusion, in part due to the unique physiologic state of pregnancy and part due to unknown factors, pregnant patients are at increased risk for negative outcomes of COVID-19 infection and must be classified as a high-risk population.","Hapshy, Vera; Aziz, Daniel; Kahar, Payal; Khanna, Deepesh; Johnson, Kenneth E; Parmar, Mayur S",SN Compr Clin Med,592,26

Attention initially focused on severe presentations, intensive care capacity, and the timely supply of equipment. While general practice has seen a rapid uptake of technology to allow for virtual consultations, little is known about the pattern of suspected COVID-19 presentations in primary care. AIM: To quantify the prevalence and time course of clinically suspected COVID-19 presenting to general practices, to report the risk of suspected COVID-19 by ethnic group, and to identify whether differences by ethnicity can be explained by clinical data in the GP record. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study using anonymised data from the primary care records of approximately 1.2 million adults registered with 157 practices in four adjacent east London clinical commissioning groups. The study population includes 55% of people from ethnic minorities and is in the top decile of social deprivation in England. METHOD: Suspected COVID-19 cases were identified clinically and recorded using SNOMED codes. Explanatory variables included age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, and measures of social deprivation. Clinical factors included data on 16 long-term conditions, body mass index, and smoking status. RESULTS: GPs recorded 8985 suspected COVID-19 cases between 10 February and 30 April 2020.Univariate analysis showed a two-fold increase in the odds of suspected COVID-19 for South Asian and black adults compared with white adults. In a fully adjusted analysis that included clinical factors, South Asian patients had nearly twice the odds of suspected infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.83 to 2.04). The OR for black patients was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.38 to 1.57). CONCLUSION: Using data from GP records, black and South Asian ethnicity remain as predictors of suspected COVID-19, with levels of risk similar to hospital admission reports. Further understanding of these differences requires social and occupational data.","Hull, Sally A; Williams, Crystal; Ashworth, Mark; Carvalho, Chris; Boomla, Kambiz",Br J Gen Pract,592,21

Objective: To assess patterns of telehealth use across surgical specialties before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: Insurance claims from a Michigan statewide commercial payer for new patient visits with a surgeon from 1 of 9 surgical specialties during one of the following periods: prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (period 1: January 5 to March 7, 2020), early pandemic (period 2: March 8 to June 6, 2020), and late pandemic (period 3: June 7 to September 5, 2020). Exposures: Telehealth implementation owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) Conversion rate defined as the rate of weekly new patient telehealth visits divided by mean weekly number of total new patient visits in 2019. This outcome adjusts for a substantial decrease in outpatient care during the pandemic. (2) Weekly number of new patient telehealth visits divided by weekly number of total new patient visits. Results: Among 4405 surgeons in the cohort, 2588 (58.8%) performed telehealth in any patient care context. Specifically for new patient visits, 1182 surgeons (26.8%) used telehealth. A total of 109 610 surgical new outpatient visits were identified during the pandemic. The median (interquartile range) age of telehealth patients was 46.8 (34.1-58.4) years compared with 52.6 (38.3-62.3) years for patients who received care in-person. Prior to March 2020, less than 1% (8 of 173â¯939) of new patient visits were conducted through telehealth. Telehealth use peaked in April 2020 (week 14) and facilitated 34.6% (479 of 1383) of all new patient visits during that week. The telehealth conversion rate peaked in April 2020 (week 15) and was equal to 8.2% of the 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volume. During period 2, a mean (SD) of 16.6% (12.0%) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 5.1% of 2019 mean weekly new patient visit volumes). During period 3, 3.0% (2168 of 71 819) of all new patient surgical visits were conducted via telehealth (conversion rate of 2.5% of 2019 new patient visit volumes). Mean (SD) telehealth conversion rates varied by specialty with urology being the highest (14.3% [7.7%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Results from this study showed that telehealth use grew across all surgical specialties in Michigan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While rates of telehealth use have declined as in-person care has resumed, telehealth use remains substantially higher across all surgical specialties than it was prior to the pandemic.","Chao, Grace F; Li, Kathleen Y; Zhu, Ziwei; McCullough, Jeff; Thompson, Mike; Claflin, Jake; Fliegner, Maximilian; Steppe, Emma; Ryan, Andrew; Ellimoottil, Chad",JAMA Surg,592,10

As a result, the world is currently facing a face mask shortage, and some countries have placed limits on the number of masks that can be bought by each person. Although the surgical grade N95 mask provides the highest level of protection currently available, its filtration efficiency for sub-300 nm particles is around 85% due to its wider pore size (â¼300 nm). Because the COVID-19 virus shows a diameter of around 65-125 nm, there is a need for developing more efficient masks. To overcome these issues, we demonstrate the development of a flexible, nanoporous membrane to achieve a reusable N95 mask with a replaceable membrane and enhanced filtration efficiency. We first developed a flexible nanoporous Si-based template on a silicon-on-insulator wafer using KOH etching and then used the template as a hard mask during a reactive ion etching process to transfer the patterns onto a flexible and lightweight (<0.12 g) polymeric membrane. Pores with sizes down to 5 nm were achieved with a narrow distribution. Theoretical calculations show that airflow rates above 85 L/min are possible through the mask, which confirms its breathability over a wide range of pore sizes, densities, membrane thicknesses, and pressure drops. Finally, the membrane is intrinsically hydrophobic, which contributes to antifouling and self-cleaning as a result of droplets rolling and sliding on the inclined mask area.","El-Atab, Nazek; Qaiser, Nadeem; Badghaish, Huda; Shaikh, Sohail F; Hussain, Muhammad Mustafa",ACS Nano,592,16

The pandemicity is because the virus is highly contagious with very high transmissibility and spread from person to person by infected respiratory droplets and contacts. As no specific drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 are available in the market, so preventive measures that break the chain of transmission are the mainstay to prevent COVID-19 infections. The present systematic review article highlights the current updates on preventive measures in the context of disinfection practices, droplet precautions, airborne precautions and biomedical waste management based on various research articles, national guidelines by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Central Pollution Control Board, Government of India and international guidelines by WHO, CDC. Search was conducted in Medline, Embase and Google Scholar with articles published in English language from 1st January 2020 to 20th July 2020 and were taken for reviewing. A systematic review protocol was developed based on PRISMA checklist and the PRISMA statement and was conducted to synthesise adoptable best practices based on current evidences. Three disinfectants have become most important to combat this novel corona virus, which are 70-85% ethanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite for routine environmental disinfection and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite for large spillage management and &gt;0.5% hydrogen peroxide with a minimal contact time of 1 minute for all three disinfectants. Fogging of unoccupied rooms and testing laboratories can be done by 2% hydrogen peroxide solution. UV radiation at 240-260 nm have wide applications in routine terminal disinfection of unoccupied rooms and biosafety cabinets and also used for decontamination of N95 masks for reuse. Based on available evidences from WHO and ICMR it is suggested to take respiratory droplets and contact precautions in every health care settings taking care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, and airborne precautions are recommended when aerosol generating procedures are performed. According to CDC droplets and contact precautions are essential in routine health care settings and airborne precautions are essential when aerosol generating procedures are performed and are also recommended when taking care of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases depending on resource availability. Whether airborne precaution is essential for all settings is debatable and is still unclear based on available evidences. Proper handling of biomedical waste, segregation at source and disposal as per classification along with proper disposal of PPE after doffing can help in preventing the disease in community and among health care providers. Evidence on the modes of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to individuals is yet to be established. Steps to be followed are based on Government Guidelines. However scholarly article depicting desirable and undesirable effects of dead body handling strategy is lacking.","Chakraborty, Bipasa Ray Raja Roy Pritam",Journal of Medical &amp; Allied Sciences,592,27

There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. In this paper, we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18 (arXiv:1806.02284). This model enhances the capabilities of CCS significantly, as it eliminates the need for human annotated label ground-truth for every unseen document layout. This proved particularly useful when applied to a huge corpus of PDF articles related to COVID-19.","Livathinos, Nikolaos; Berrospi, Cesar; Lysak, Maksym; Kuropiatnyk, Viktor; Nassar, Ahmed; Carvalho, Andre; Dolfi, Michele; Auer, Christoph; Dinkla, Kasper; Staar, Peter",,592,1

Here, we use artificial neural networks to analyze the binding of SARS-CoV-2 peptides with polymorphic human MHC class I molecules. In this way, we identify two sets of haplotypes present in specific human populations: the first displays weak binding with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while the second shows strong binding and T cell propensity.

The Covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis that touches every aspect of social life, including politics, the economy, healthcare systems, poverty, forced human migration, climate change, and importantly, education. To potentially address future crises through curriculum, the article first problematizes the present in education and society-specifically, the 50-year neoliberal project that has transformed society and education. It connects the crisis in education to a transformed social, political, and economic system that has introduced what Gordon Lafer has called a revolution of falling expectations through a hollowing-out of public institutions. The article then returns to the crisis of curriculum, contextualized in Joseph Schwab's The Practical: A Language for Curriculum, which presaged the reconceptualization of the curriculum field. It dialogues with Schwab's advocacy for an eclectic, deliberative, and practical curricular ethic as a form of post-reconceptualization curriculum study to contribute to understanding and managing future disruptions, such as those inevitably associated with the climate crisis. Finally, the article connects to the concept of liquidity in curriculum, through which to embody curricular eclecticism and provoke teachers and students to author a vision for a more just future that will not reinscribe the pathologies of the past.","Burns, James P; Cruz, Christopher",Prospects (Paris),592,1

However, mobility data capturing detailed interpersonal transmission at a large scale are not available. In this study, we aimed to objectively assess the influence of key built environment factors, which create spaces for activities-""inferred activity"" rather than ""actually observed activity""-on the spread of COVID-19 across townships in China at its initial stage through a random forest approach. Taking data for 2994 township-level administrative units, the spread is measured by two indicators: the ratio of cumulative infection cases (RCIC), and the coefficient of variation of infection cases (CVIC) that reflects the policy effect in the initial stage of the spread. Accordingly, we selected 19 explanatory variables covering built environment factors (urban facilities, land use, and transportation infrastructure), the level of nighttime activities, and the inter-city population flow (from Hubei Province). We investigated the spatial agglomerations based on an analysis of bivariate local indicators of spatial association between RCIC and CVIC. We found spatial agglomeration (or positive spatial autocorrelations) of RCIC and CVIC in about 20% of all townships under study. The density of convenience shops, supermarkets and shopping malls (DoCSS), and the inter-city population flow (from Hubei Province) are the two most important variables to explain RCIC, while the population flow is the most important factor in measuring policy effects (CVIC). When the DoCSS gets to 21/km2, the density of comprehensive hospitals to 0.7/km2, the density of road intersections to 72/km2, and the density of gyms and sports centers to 2/km2, their impacts on RCIC reach their maximum and remain constant with further increases in the density values. Stricter policy measures should be taken at townships with a density of colleges and universities higher than 0.5/km2 or a density of comprehensive hospitals higher than 0.25/km2 in order to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.","Ma, Shuang; Li, Shuangjin; Zhang, Junyi",Sci Rep,592,13

At present, the most important International Societies, such as WHO and UNICEF, promote breastfeeding and mother-baby contact as long as adequate measures to control COVID-19 infection are followed. In cases where maternal general health conditions impede direct breastfeeding or in cases of separation between mother and baby, health organizations encourage and support expressing milk and safely providing it to the infants. METHODS: A series of 22 case studies of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 infection from March 14th to April 14th, 2020 was conducted. Mothers and newborns were followed for a median period of 1.8 consecutive months. RESULTS: Out of 22 mothers, 20 (90.9%) chose to breastfeed their babies during hospital admission. Timely initiation and skin to skin contact at delivery room was performed in 54.5 and 59.1%, respectively. Eighty two percent of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 were fed with breast milk after 1 month, decreasing to 77% at 1.8 months. Six of 22 (37.5%) mothers with COVID-19 required transitory complementary feeding until exclusive breastfeeding was achieved. During follow-up period, there were no major complications, and no neonates were infected during breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience shows that breastfeeding in newborns of mothers with COVID-19 is safe with the adequate infection control measures to avoid mother-baby contagion. Supplementing feeding with pasteurized donor human milk or infant formula may be effective, until exclusive breastfeeding is achieved.","Pereira, Augusto; Cruz-Melguizo, Sara; Adrien, Maria; Fuentes, Lucia; Marin, Eugenia; Forti, Azul; Perez-Medina, Tirso",Int Breastfeed J,592,1

Therefore, the aim of this study was to review studies that evaluated physical and mental health problems post-COVID-19. METHODS: Articles for inclusion in this scoping review were identified by searching the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for items dated from 1 January to 7 November 2020. Observational studies evaluating physical health (musculoskeletal symptoms, functional status) or mental health status with a follow-up period longer than 1 month after discharge or after the onset of symptoms were included. RESULTS: This scoping review included 34 studies with follow-up periods of up to 3 months post-COVID-19. The most commonly reported physical health problems were fatigue (range 28% to 87%), pain (myalgia 4.5% to 36%), arthralgia (6.0% to 27%), reduced physical capacity (six-minute walking test range 180 to 561 m), and declines in physical role functioning, usual care and daily activities (reduced in 15% to 54% of patients). Common mental health problems were anxiety (range 6.5% to 63%), depression (4% to 31%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (12.1% to 46.9%). Greater fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression were reported in female patients and individuals admitted to intensive care. An overall lower quality of life was seen up to 3 months post-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the presence of several physical and mental health problems up to 3 months post-COVID-19.

Myocardial involvement has been proved to be one of the primary manifestations of COVID-19 infection, according to laboratory test, autopsy, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the middle-term outcome of cardiac involvement after the patients were discharged from the hospital is yet unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate mid-term cardiac sequelae in recovered COVID-19 patients by CMR METHODS: A total of 47 recovered COVID-19 patients were prospectively recruited and underwent CMR examination. The CMR protocol consisted of black blood fat-suppressed T2 weighted imaging, T2 star mapping, left ventricle (LV) cine imaging, pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). LGE were assessed in mixed both recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. The LV and right ventricle (RV) function and LV mass were assessed and compared with healthy controls. RESULTS: A total of 44 recovered COVID-19 patients and 31 healthy controls were studied. LGE was found in 13 (30%) of COVID-19 patients. All LGE lesions were located in the mid myocardium and/or sub-epicardium with a scattered distribution. Further analysis showed that LGE-positive patients had significantly decreased LV peak global circumferential strain (GCS), RV peak GCS, RV peak global longitudinal strain (GLS) as compared to non-LGE patients (p < 0.05), while no difference was found between the non-LGE patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Myocardium injury existed in 30% of COVID-19 patients. These patients have depressed LV GCS and peak RV strains at the 3-month follow-up. CMR can monitor the COVID-19-induced myocarditis progression, and CMR strain analysis is a sensitive tool to evaluate the recovery of LV and RV dysfunction.","Wang, Hui; Li, Ruili; Zhou, Zhen; Jiang, Hong; Yan, Zixu; Tao, Xinyan; Li, Hongjun; Xu, Lei",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,592,1

Although various annotation volumes (AVs) for the mouse brain have been proposed, it is common in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mouse brain that regions-of-interest (ROIs) for brain structures (nodes) are created arbitrarily according to each researcher's necessity, leading to inconsistent ROIs among studies. One reason for such a situation is the fact that earlier AVs were fixed, i.e. combination and division of nodes were not implemented. This report presents a pipeline for constructing a flexible annotation atlas (FAA) of the mouse brain by leveraging public resources of the Allen Institute for Brain Science on brain structure, gene expression, and axonal projection. A mere two-step procedure with user-specified, text-based information and Python codes constructs FAA with nodes which can be combined or divided objectively while maintaining anatomical hierarchy of brain structures. Four FAAs with total node count of 4, 101, 866, and 1381 were demonstrated. Unique characteristics of FAA realized analysis of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) across the anatomical hierarchy and among cortical layers, which were thin but large brain structures.

Even in the COVID-19 epidemic some sex/gender differences emerged. OBJECTIVES: to analyze COVID-19 epidemic data by gender and age in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden, characterized by having implemented different pandemic containment policies, with the aim of observing any characteristics that can be interpreted with the lens of sex/gender differences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we used confirmed cases and deaths associated with COVID-19 for Italy, Spain, Germany, and Sweden from respective national surveillance databases. Mortality data for Italy were also analysed. The period of investigation was March-May 2020. As indicators, we used the case fatality ratio adjusted for time delay and SMR for mortality. RESULTS: women are more vulnerable to COVID- 19 infection in the 30-60-year age group. Case fatality ratio is higher in men than women, with a ratio men/women equal to 1.7 in Italy, Spain, and Sweden and 1,4 in Germany. The ratio increases in the lower age groups. The analysis of the mortality data observed/expected in Italy in the same period with respect to 2015-2019 shows a comparable excess with SMR equal to 132 for men and 127 for women. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affects both genders with some differences in the incidence, higher in women, and lethality, higher in men. These differences highlight the need to better understand the sex/gender and age interaction both for epidemiological surveillance and for a better gender-appropriateness of the ongoing prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This would be possible if all health indicators (symptoms, past illnesses, primary and hospital-level health care, hospitalization, etc.) were provided by age and gender. Analysis of the causes of death could help to better understand the increase in mortality for both genders, in particular for women, for whom a lower lethality for COVID-19 appears from data.","Mangia, Cristina; Russo, Antonello; Civitelli, Serenella; Gianicolo, Emilio Antonio Luca",Epidemiol Prev,592,16

We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive adult patients supported with peripheral venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome at a single institution with the hypothesis that early tracheostomy (within 7 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation) decreases the duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The primary endpoint was duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Secondary endpoints included mortality, overall and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and time from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation to liberation from ventilator, intensive care unit discharge, and hospital discharge. Overall and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-associated hospital costs were compared. A total of 50 patients were identified for inclusion (early n = 21; late n = 29). Baseline characteristics including indices of disease severity were similar between groups. Duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was significantly shorter in the early tracheostomy group (12 vs. 21 days; p = 0.005). Median extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related costs were significantly decreased in the early tracheostomy group ($3,624 vs. $5,603, p = 0.03).

Some countries collapsed under surge conditions, while others (such as Malta) showed resilience. Public health measures in Malta quickly reined in COVID-19 spread. This review summarizes pandemic preparedness measures in Malta and the impact on routine services. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Google, Google Scholar and PubMed and by reviewing Maltese online newspapers. A comprehensive summary of internal operations conducted at Mater Dei Hospital (MDH) was made available. RESULTS: A hospital 'Incident Command Group' was set up to plan an optimal COVID-19 response strategy. A 'rapid response team' was also created to cater for the logistics and management of supplies. A 'COVID-19 Emergency Operation Centre' simulated different COVID-19 scenarios. All elective services were suspended and all staff were mandatorily trained in wearing personal protective equipment. Staff were also retrained in the care of COVID-19 patients. In preparation for potential admission surges, MDH underwent rapid expansion of normal and intensive care beds. Swabbing was ramped up to one of the highest national rates worldwide. The cost for hospital COVID-19 preparedness exceeded 100 million for Malta's half a million population. CONCLUSION: Malta and its sole acute hospital coped well with the first wave with 680 cases and 9 deaths. The increased ability to deal with COVID-19 (a principally respiratory pathogen) will serve well for the anticipated combined annual influenza and the COVID-19 second wave this coming winter.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Falzon, Celia; Janulova, Lina; Aguis, Steve; Busuttil, Walter; Psaila, Noel; Farrugia, Karl; Debono, Joseph; Grech, Victor",Int. j. qual. health care,592,15

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and have worse outcomes than patients with COVID-19 who do not have cancer. Virtual care has been introduced quickly and extemporaneously in cancer treatment centers worldwide to maintain COVID-19-free zones. The outbreak of COVID-19 in a cancer center could have devastating consequences. The virtual care intervention that was first used in our cancer center, as well as many others, was a landline telephone in an office or clinic that connected a clinician with a patient. There is a lack of virtual care evaluation from the perspectives of patients and oncology health care providers. A number of factors for assessing oncology care delivered through a virtual care intervention have been described, including patient rapport, frailty, delicate conversations, team-based care, resident education, patient safety, technical effectiveness, privacy, operational effectiveness, and resource utilization. These factors are organized according to the National Quality Forum framework for the assessment of telehealth in oncology. This includes the following 4 domains of assessing outcomes: experience, access to care, effectiveness, and financial impact or cost. In terms of virtual care and oncology, the pandemic has opened the door to change. The lessons learned during the initial period of the pandemic have given rise to opportunities for the evolution of long-term virtual care. The opportunity to evaluate and improve virtual care should be seized upon.","Levine, Oren Hannun; McGillion, Michael; Levine, Mark",JMIR Cancer,592,1

People in China have gradually returned to normal life; however, in the protracted pandemic, people may still follow certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. This study was the second stage of a longitudinal nutritional survey conducted in post-lockdown China that was aimed at exploring post-lockdown dietary behaviors and their effects on dietary diversity. In line with the first stage of the survey, the current dietary behaviors used to cope with COVID-19 and ways of purchasing food were determined. In addition, changes in dietary behavior compared to the same period in 2019 and those behaviors recommended to ensure food safety were also investigated. The Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) was used to assess dietary diversity; this was also used in the first stage of the survey. Linear regression was used to model the associations between the HDDS, participants' characteristics, and dietary behaviors. The data of 1994 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.2 ± 2.0. Compared to the same period in 2019, a substantial proportion of participants self-reported that they had recently decreased eating in restaurants (61.6%) and reduced intakes of seafood (53.1%), imported frozen food (57.1%), and raw food (60.5%), while 64.8% of participants reported increased cooking at home. People with an increased consumption of seafood (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04)) and raw food (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.74 (0.27, 1.21)) had a significantly higher HDDS. Participants who changed their consumption of imported frozen food (both increased and decreased) had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04) and 0.27 (0.09, 0.44), respectively). People who depended more on purchasing food online had a significantly higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.29 (0.02, 0.55)). Compared to the data from stage 1, the proportion of people choosing healthy products to cope with COVID-19 did not greatly change and those people had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.31 (0.19, 0.42)). Although this study found that the proportion of people who chose to use alcohol or vinegar to prevent COVID-19 had decreased substantially compared to during lockdown, there were still 5.3% and 9.8% who followed these irrational behaviors. Regarding the dietary behavior regarding food safety, except for cooking food fully, fewer than half of participants followed the recommended dietary behaviors, including individual food servings (44.2%), using serving chopsticks and spoons (44.8%), and preparing raw and cooked food separately (43.3%). People who followed these behaviors had a better dietary diversity. In conclusion, during the post-lockdown period, people still followed certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. While some dietary behaviors were adopted to help prevent infection, irrational dietary behaviors were still followed. These behaviors were associated with the dietary diversity in Chinese adults.","Zhang, Jian; Zhao, Ai; Ke, Yalei; Huo, Shanshan; Ma, Yidi; Zhang, Yumei; Ren, Zhongxia; Li, Zhongyu; Liu, Keyang",Nutrients,592,22

While effective, these data-driven approaches rely on large amount of data annotation to achieve good performance, which stops these models from being deployed in emergencies during which data annotation is either too costly or cannot be obtained fast enough. One popular solution is to use synthetic data for training. Unfortunately, due to domain shift, the resulting models generalize poorly on real imagery. We remedy this shortcoming by training with both synthetic images, along with their associated labels, and unlabeled real images. To this end, we force our network to learn perspective-aware features by training it to recognize upside-down real images from regular ones and incorporate into it the ability to predict its own uncertainty so that it can generate useful pseudo labels for fine-tuning purposes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain crowd counting ones without any extra computation at inference time.","Liu, Weizhe; Durasov, Nikita; Fua, Pascal",,592,24

Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated nurses' influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey SETTINGS: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age = 40.79, SD = 10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, nursing profession is not ready to accept it.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin-Kit; Wei, Wan In; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Lee, Shui Shan",Int J Nurs Stud,592,20

Previous literature has developed bi-level models of the work starting time choice considering both labor output and urban mobility. Yet, most analytical studies assume the single trip purpose in peak hours (to work) only and do not consider the household travels (daycare drop-off/pick-up). In fact, as one of the main reasons to adopt flextime, household travel plays an influential role in travelers' decision making on work schedule selection. On this account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time choice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work start time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration economies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in work schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal schedule choices with two system performance indicators.

Users like startups have to operate on a limited budget and similarly others hope to reduce their costs. While interacting with a CSP, central to their concerns is the process of cost-effectively utilizing different purchase options possibly in addition to self-owned instances. A job in data-intensive applications is typically represented by a directed acyclic graph which can further be transformed into a chain of tasks. The key to achieving cost efficiency is determining the allocation of a specific deadline to each task, as well as the allocation of different types of instances to the task. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines the optimal allocation of deadlines to tasks. The framework also features an optimal policy to determine the allocation of spot and on-demand instances in a predefined time window, and a near-optimal policy for allocating self-owned instances. The policies are designed to be parametric to support the usage of online learning to infer the optimal values against the dynamics of cloud markets. Finally, several intuitive heuristics are used as baselines to validate the cost improvement brought by the proposed solutions. We show that the cost improvement over the state-of-the-art is up to 24.87% when spot and on-demand instances are considered and up to 59.05% when self-owned instances are considered.","Wu, Xiaohu; Yu, Han; Casale, Giuliano; Gao, Guanyu",,592,14

Here, based on month-level records of suicides covering the entire Japanese population in 1,848 administrative units, we assessed whether suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. Using difference-in-difference estimation, we found that monthly suicide rates declined by 14% during the first 5 months of the pandemic (February to June 2020). This could be due to a number of complex reasons, including the government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure. By contrast, monthly suicide rates increased by 16% during the second wave (July to October 2020), with a larger increase among females (37%) and children and adolescents (49%). Although adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain in the long term, its modifiers (such as government subsidies) may not be sustained.

The public health crisis underscores the importance of global health research partnerships and collaborations to develop and evaluate the requisite health technologies to assist in containing COVID-19, other diseases, and health-related concerns that defy national borders. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the member countries of the United Nations in September 2015, provide a framework for global development efforts including global health research. SDG3, which promotes health and well-being for the world populations across the age spectrum, highlights disease areas for special focus which can be adapted in specific global health research programs to serve local health needs. SDG17 promotes partnerships between high income (HIC) and low and middle-income countries (LMIC) for sustainable and equitable global development. However, given the wide disparities in fiscal and overall capacity for research between researchers in HIC and their counterparts in LMIC as well as the greater vulnerabilities of the LMIC communities when serving as research locations, a spotlight on the nature of such global health research partnerships in the context of the SDGs is desirable. This is to ensure that they are meaningful and mutually-beneficial partnerships which address local health concerns and promote long-term value for the communities involved. The objective of this commentary is, therefore, to provide a brief overview of the SDGs by way of context; explore the power differences at play when researchers from HIC are seeking research opportunities in LMIC; examine the social determinants of health and the disproportionate burden of global diseases carried by populations in LMIC to establish their vulnerability; discuss global research partnerships; and attempt to make a case for why community-based participatory research may be the preferred type of global health research partnership in the context of the SDGs.","Addo-Atuah, Joyce; Senhaji-Tomza, Batoul; Ray, Dipan; Basu, Paramita; Loh, Feng-Hua Ellen; Owusu-Daaku, Frances",Res Social Adm Pharm,592,22

METHODS: Data from a national chat-based crisis hotline for the first half of 2019 (pre-COVID-19), were compared to data from the first half of 2020 (during COVID-19). Chat sessions were classified by content and demographics and the data compared between the two time periods. OUTCOME: Total chats (n = 6756) were 48% higher during COVID-19 (p < .05). Suicide-related chat (SRC) number was also higher, although the proportion relative to all chats was slightly lower during COVID-19, compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .05). SRCs increased during the COVID-19 lockdown. The number of severe SRCs resulting in urgent police intervention, increased during the lockdown (April-May 2020) compared with the same period in 2019 (p = .04). Issues of anxiety were higher in 2020 (19.4%) vs. 2019 (16.5%) (p < .00001) while issues of depression were lower (22.4% vs 33%, respectively) (p < .00001). The overall use of chats among adults aged >50 yrs increased during COVID-19 and likewise, the rate of SRCs in this age-group increased 30-fold in this period when compared to pre-COVID-19 (p < .00001). SRCs included more women than men (p < .0001) in both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 period, when the proportion of women increased from 62% in 2019 to 73% during COVID-19 (p < .0001). INTERPRETATION: The rise in total chats, SRCs and SRCs resulting in police action, commenced during lockdown and was ameliorated by end of the lockdown, indicating that distress created by the lockdown was more impactful than mourning deaths of loved ones, fear and uncertainty, because all these factors persisted beyond the end of the lockdown. Older populations were probably more distressed due to greater risk and less adaptability to isolation, social media and staying home. More calls by women may reflect women's better help-seeking capacity. The increase in SRCs indicates the potential for more suicides and the need for bolstering mental health services and reach-out to older people during pandemic lock-downs.","Zalsman, Gil; Levy, Yael; Sommerfeld, Eliane; Segal, Avi; Assa, Dana; Ben-Dayan, Loona; Valevski, Avi; Mann, J John",J Psychiatr Res,592,16

Accordingly, as a consequence of IoT and AI, multiple forms of data are incorporated in these systems, e.g. social, implicit, local and personal information, which can help in improving recommender systems' performance and widen their applicability to traverse different disciplines. On the other side, energy efficiency in the building sector is becoming a hot research topic, in which recommender systems play a major role by promoting energy saving behavior and reducing carbon emissions. However, the deployment of the recommendation frameworks in buildings still needs more investigations to identify the current challenges and issues, where their solutions are the keys to enable the pervasiveness of research findings, and therefore, ensure a large-scale adoption of this technology. Accordingly, this paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first timely and comprehensive reference for energy-efficiency recommendation systems through (i) surveying existing recommender systems for energy saving in buildings; (ii) discussing their evolution; (iii) providing an original taxonomy of these systems based on specified criteria, including the nature of the recommender engine, its objective, computing platforms, evaluation metrics and incentive measures; and (iv) conducting an in-depth, critical analysis to identify their limitations and unsolved issues. The derived challenges and areas of future implementation could effectively guide the energy research community to improve the energy-efficiency in buildings and reduce the cost of developed recommender systems-based solutions.","Himeur, Yassine; Alsalemi, Abdullah; Al-Kababji, Ayman; Bensaali, Faycal; Amira, Abbes; Sardianos, Christos; Dimitrakopoulos, George; Varlamis, Iraklis",,592,15

La literatura mundial describe mayor incidencia de parto prematuro y cesáreas en pacientes infectadas por COVID-19 principalmente de origen iatrogénico, sin embargo, existen escasos datos del pronóstico del embarazo al decidir diferir el parto hasta después del período infeccioso del virus. Este trabajo reporta un grupo de embarazadas diagnosticadas con COVID-19 en tercer trimestre donde se decidió no interrumpir el embarazo y diferir su parto hasta recuperación de la patología. MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional retrospectivo que analiza resultados materno-perinatales en 9 casos de mujeres infectadas por COVID, diagnosticadas posterior a las 33 semanas y cuyo parto se verificó después de recuperadas del COVID. RESULTADOS: Se observó un 77% de pacientes sintomáticas, 77% requirieron hospitalización, 33% por COVID, todas ingresaron a unidad de paciente crítico, sólo una requirió ventilación mecánica no invasiva. Dos cursaron con cetoacidosis normo-glicémica y dos con neumonía por COVID-19. Un 88% resultó en parto de término, sólo una paciente tuvo parto prematuro de causa obstétrica. La vía de parto fue un 67% vaginal y 33% por cesárea, todas por indicación obstétrica. La latencia al parto promedio fue de 17.3 días. Los puntajes de Apgar fueron todos mayor a 7 al minuto y 5 minutos. CONCLUSIÓN: Los resultados de esta serie sugieren que, en casos seleccionados, los partos posteriores al período infeccioso del COVID se asocian a buenos resultados materno-perinatales, sin embargo, resulta importante aumentar la casuística.","Vega Rojas, Denise; Carreño Manríquez, Leonardo; Díaz Echeverría, Claudia",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of non-pharmacological initiatives (NPI) against COVID-19 on the number of hospitalizations due to pediatric acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of pediatric hospitalizations in Porto Alegre, Brazil. We analyzed the monthly incidence of hospital admissions from 2018 to 2020 due to ARIs included in the study. The time series was divided into the period before introducing NPI (2018 and 2019), and the period when NPI were running (2020). We compared means between the years with Student's t-test. The Dickey-Fuller test was used for secular trend analysis. For seasonality, Fischer's G test was performed. Dynamic linear univariate and multivariate models were used to estimate the association between the predictors (the introduction of NPI, secular trend, and seasonality) and outcome (the incidence of ARI admissions). For the statistical analysis, the cut-off probability for rejecting the null hypothesis was defined as <5%. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020, 10,109 hospital admissions were due to the respiratory causes included in this study. There was a significant decrease in 2020 in the mean incidence of the ARIs studied compared with 2018 and 2019. The number of hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases in children decreased by 64% for asthma and 93% for bronchiolitis. A secular trend of monthly admissions rates due to ARIs was only observed in the laryngotracheitis data (pâ¯=â¯0.485), but seasonality was detected in all analyses. According to the univariate and multivariate analysis, the introduction of NPI was associated with a decrease in the incidence of ARI admissions. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in hospital admissions due to ARIs in children. Our data suggest a significant impact of NPI on reducing the spread of viruses associated with ARIs in children.

In many cases, such as for membrane transporters, the bacterial toxicity or the aggregation of the target protein hamper the expression limiting the application of this tool. The aim of this study was finding the appropriate conditions for the expression of reluctant proteins that is the human neutral amino acid transporters ASCT2 and B0AT1, that have great relevance to human health in cancer therapy and in COVID-19 research, respectively. The cDNAs coding for the proteins of interest were cloned in the pCOLD I vector and different E. coli strains (BL21 codon plus RIL, and RosettaGami2) were cultured in absence or in presence of glucose (0.5-1%), at low temperature (15 °C), and low inducer concentrations (10-100 µM). Cell growth and protein production were monitored by optical density measurements and western blotting assay, respectively. Even though in different conditions, the expression of both amino acid transporters was obtained.Reducing the growth rate of specific E. coli strains by lowering the temperature and the IPTG concentration, together with the addition of glucose, two reluctant human neutral amino acid transporters have been expressed in E. coli. The results have a potentially great interest in drug discovery since ASCT2 is an acknowledged target of anticancer therapy, and B0AT1 together with ACE2 is part of a receptor for the SARS-Cov-2 RBD proteins.","Galluccio, Michele; Pantanella, Marta; Giudice, Deborah; Brescia, Stefania; Indiveri, Cesare",Mol Biol Rep,592,0

In this paper, the novel application of cognitive radio (CR) based IoT specific for the medical domain referred to as Cognitive Internet of Medical Things (CIoMT) is explored to tackle the global challenge. This concept of CIoT is best suited to this pandemic as every person is to be connected and monitored through a massive network that requires efficient spectrum management. METHODS: An extensive literature survey is conducted in the Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Research Gate, and IEEE Xplore databases using the terms ""COVID-19"" and ""Cognitive IoT"" or ""Corona virus"" and ""IoMT"". The latest data and inputs from official websites and reports are used for further investigation and analysis of the application areas. RESULTS: This review encompasses different novel applications of CIoMT for fighting the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis. The CR based dynamic spectrum allocation technique is the solution for accommodating a massive number of devices and a wide number of applications. The CIoMT platform enables real-time tracking, remote health monitoring, rapid diagnosis of the cases, contact tracking, clustering, screening, and surveillance thus, reducing the workload on the medical industry for prevention and control of the infection. The challenges and future research directions are also identified.

The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance. In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets' air-dispersion and the healthcare workers' contamination. The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia. It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability. However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls. It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation. Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Rizzi, Maurizio; Pini, Stefano; Saad, Marina; Chiumello, Davide Alberto; Santus, Pierachille",,592,1

COVID-19 started in China in 2019, and it is still spreading even now. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan are the most important imaging techniques for diagnosing COVID-19. All researchers are looking for effective solutions and fast treatment methods for this epidemic. To reduce the need for medical experts, fast and accurate automated detection techniques are introduced. Deep learning convolution neural network (DL-CNN) technologies are showing remarkable results for detecting cases of COVID-19. In this paper, deep feature concatenation (DFC) mechanism is utilized in two different ways. In the first one, DFC links deep features extracted from X-ray and CT scan using a simple proposed CNN. The other way depends on DFC to combine features extracted from either X-ray or CT scan using the proposed CNN architecture and two modern pre-trained CNNs: ResNet and GoogleNet. The DFC mechanism is applied to form a definitive classification descriptor. The proposed CNN architecture consists of three deep layers to overcome the problem of large time consumption. For each image type, the proposed CNN performance is studied using different optimization algorithms and different values for the maximum number of epochs, the learning rate (LR), and mini-batch (M-B) size. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other modern and state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f_score.","Saad, Waleed; Shalaby, Wafaa A; Shokair, Mona; El-Samie, Fathi Abd; Dessouky, Moawad; Abdellatef, Essam",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,592,16

Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were rapidly developed and approved for emergency use of vaccination in humans, supply and production difficulties are slowing down the global vaccination program. The efficacy of many different versions of vaccine candidates and adjuvant effects remain unknown, particularly in the elderly. In this study, we compared the immunogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (S) ectodomain in young adult and aged mice, S1 with receptor binding domain, and S2 with fusion domain. Full-length S was more immunogenic and effective in inducing IgG antibodies after low dose vaccination, compared to the S1 subunit. Old-aged mice induced SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity after high dose S vaccination. With an increased vaccine dose, S1 was highly effective in inducing neutralizing and receptor-binding inhibiting antibodies, although both S1 and S2 subunit domain vaccines were similarly immunogenic. Adjuvant effects were significant for effective induction of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, neutralizing and receptor-binding inhibiting antibodies, and antibody-secreting B cell and interferon-Î³ secreting T cell immune responses.

Many patients may have sudden clinical worsening and may be already compromised at hospitalisation. We investigated the burden of lung involvement according to the time to hospitalisation. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 55 consecutive COVID-19-related pneumonia patients were admitted to the Emergency Medicine Unit. Groups of lung involvement at computed tomography were classified as follows: 0 (<5%), 1 (5%-25%), 2 (26%-50%), 3 (51%-75%) and 4 (>75%). We also investigated in-hospital death and the predictive value of Yan-XGBoost model and PREDI-CO scores for death. RESULTS: The median age was 74 years and 34 were men. Time to admission increased from 2 days in group 0 to 8.5-9 days in groups 3 and 4. A progressive increase in LDH, CRP and d-dimer was found across groups, while a decrease of lymphocytes paO2 /FiO2 ratio and SpO2 was found. Ten (18.2%) patients died during the in-hospital staying. Patients who died were older, with a trend to lower lymphocytes, a higher d-dimer, creatine phosphokinase and troponin T. The Yan-XGBoost model did not accurately predict in-hospital death with an AUC of 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.76), which improved after the addition of the lung involvement groups (AUC 0.68, 95%CI 0.45-0.90). Conversely, a good predictive value was found for the original PREDI-CO score with an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-0.93) which remained similar after the addition of the lung involvement (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-0.94). CONCLUSION: We found that delayed hospital admission is associated with higher lung involvement. Hence, our data suggest that patients at risk for more severe disease, such as those with high LDH, CRP and d-dimer, should be promptly referred to hospital care.","Marino, Luca; Suppa, Marianna; Rosa, Antonello; Servello, Adriana; Coppola, Alessandro; Palladino, Mariangela; Mazzocchitti, Anna Maria; Bresciani, Emanuela; Petramala, Luigi; Bertazzoni, Giuliano; Pastori, Daniele",Int J Clin Pract,592,20

Bladder cancer, on the contrary, is a well-known disease burdened by a high rate of affected patients and risk of recurrence, progression and death. SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) often involves mild clinical symptoms but in some cases, it can lead to pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Factors associated with developing a more severe disease are increased age, obesity, smoking and chronic underlying comorbidities (including diabetes mellitus). High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) progression and worse prognosis are also characterized by a higher incidence in patients with risk factors similar to COVID-19. Immune system response and inflammation have been found as a common hallmark of both diseases. Most severe cases of COVID-19 and high-risk NMIBC patients at higher recurrence and progression risk are characterized by innate and adaptive immune activation followed by inflammation and cytokine/chemokine storm (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8). Alterations in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets accompany the systemic inflammatory response to cancer and infections. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for example have been recognized as factors related to poor prognosis for many solid tumors, including bladder cancer, and their role has been found important even for the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key Messages: All these mechanisms should be further analyzed in order to find new therapeutic agents and new strategies to block infection and cancer progression. Further than commonly used therapies, controlling cytokine production and inflammatory response is a promising field.","Busetto, Gian Maria; Porreca, Angelo; Del Giudice, Francesco; Maggi, Martina; D039,; Agostino, Daniele; Romagnoli, Daniele; Musi, Gennaro; Lucarelli, Giuseppe; Palmer, Katie; Colonna di Paliano, Ascanio; Muto, Matteo; Hurle, Rodolfo; Terracciano, Daniela; de Cobelli, Ottavio; Sciarra, Alessandro; De Berardinis, Ettore; Ferro, Matteo",Urol Int,592,30

Our evaluation reveals that the extension which retains the original noise model of the noisy images and additionally has a comprehensive connectivity of 2D and temporal image information at both pixel and patch levels, gives the best results. Additionally, we find a surprising change in performance of one the four extensions due to the specific application of the VST. Finally, we also introduce a simple low-pass filtering as a preprocessing step for the best performing extension.

We observed, in a total of 153 COVID-19 patients, that the serum levels of TGF-ß1 were increased significantly at the early and middle stages of COVID-19, and correlated with the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, as well as with the APACHE-II score in patients with severe disease. In view of the genetic association of the TGF-ß1 activator THBS3 with severe COVID-19 identified by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, this study suggests TGF-ß1 may play a key role in COVID-19.","Wang, Er-Yi; Chen, Hao; Sun, Bao-Qing; Wang, Hui; Qu, Hui-Qi; Liu, Yichuan; Sun, Xi-Zhuo; Qu, Jingchun; Fang, Zhang-Fu; Tian, Lifeng; Zeng, Yi-Feng; Huang, Shau-Ku; Hakonarson, Hakon; Liu, Zhi-Gang",FEBS lett,592,1

We systematically investigated the impact of PAF units in a mock classroom, as a supplement to background ventilation, on localized and whole-room surface deposition and particle concentration. Fluorescently tagged particles with a volumetric mean diameter near two micrometers were continuously introduced into the classroom environment via a breathing simulator with a prescibed inhalation-exhalation waveform. Deposition velocities were inferred on >50 horizontal and vertical surfaces throughout the classroom, while aerosol concentrations were spatially monitored via optical particle spectrometry. Results revealed a particle decay rate consistent with expectations based upon the reported clean air delivery rates of the PAF units. Additionally, the PAF units reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest concentrations observed and led to a statistically significant reduction in deposition velocities for horizontal surfaces >2.5 m from the aerosol source. Our results not only confirm PAF units can reduce particle concentrations but also demonstrate that they may lead to reduced particle deposition throughout an indoor environment when properly positioned. Practical ImplicationsO_LIPortable air filtration units should be prioritized in classrooms as part of a multi-layed strategy to mitigate potentially infectious particle transmission by direct aerosol transmission via inhalation and indirect aerosol transmission via particle deposition to surfaces and later contact with said surfaces.

METHODS: We examined the repercussions of the first wave of the pandemic on the trauma surgery clinic of a Level I Trauma Center and compared the data with data from 58 other trauma clinics. The results could aid in orientating the distribution of structural, financial, and human resources (HR) during the second wave. The period between March 16 and April 30, 2020 was compared with the data over the same period during 2019. Information was collected from the HR department, central revenue management, and internal documentation. RESULTS: The proportion of trauma surgical patients in the emergency room decreased by 22%. The number of polytrauma cases increased by 53%. Hospital days of trauma surgery patients in the intensive and intermediate care wards increased by 90%. The number of operations decreased by 15%, although the operating time outside of normal working hours increased by 44%. Clinics with more than 600 beds recorded a decrease in cases and emergencies by 8 and 9%, respectively, while the Trauma Center showed an increase of 19 and 12%. The results reflect the importance of level I trauma centers in the lockdown phase. CONCLUSION: To reduce the risk of an increased burden on the healthcare infrastructure, it suggests the care of trauma and COVID-19 patients should be separated locally, when possible.","Wähnert, Dirk; Colcuc, Christian; Beyer, Georg; Kache, Markus; Komadinic, Adrian; Vordemvenne, Thomas",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,592,9

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. OBJECTIVE: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is patient viral load measured by lower respiratory tract sample. Secondary outcomes include severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344. CONCLUSIONS: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","Bonfanti, Nathaniel; Gundert, Emily; Drewry, Anne M; Goff, Kristina; Bedimo, Roger; Kulstad, Erik",PLoS One,592,22

No contexto da pandemia, reflete-se que nenhuma das três perspectivas podem ser consideradas isoladamente. Foi discutida a necessidade de articulação das diferentes abordagens a fim de se prover intervenções sanitárias socialmente contextualizadas. Em seguida, são apresentados os quatro principais modelos teóricos presentes na literatura internacional que fundamentam as práticas de participação comunitária em diversos países. Para a análise da participação comunitária no contexto da COVID-19 foi utilizada a sistematização conceitual fundamentada em duas metanarrativas: a utilitarista e a da justiça social. A perspectiva utilitarista envolve ações direcionadas às medidas de restrição do contato social. Nesse sentido, a participação é entendida como colaboração na execução de ações que contribuam para o controle do agravo. A perspectiva da justiça social aborda sobretudo os determinantes sociais da saúde e a redução das desigualdades sociais. Trata-se de abordagem voltada ao empoderamento comunitário e à busca de soluções para os problemas sociais e econômicos determinantes da disseminação da COVID-19 e de outras doenças. Conclui-se sobre as peculiaridades e a importância de cada uma das abordagens.

This study investigated, for the first time, COVID-19 patients' nutrition status and its effects on their inflammatory and immune responses. METHODS: Forty-seven COVID-19 patients were recruited for this prospective study. According to the subjective global assessment at admission, patients were divided into the normal nutrition (NN), risk of malnutrition (RMN), or MN group. Serum cytokines and whole blood T-cell subpopulations were measured to assess the inflammatory and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Analysis of covariance and &#967;2 tests were used. RESULTS: On admission, the incidences of MN and the RMN in COVID-19 patients were 17.0% and 38.3%, respectively. The MN group had a higher proportion with severe/critical COVID-19 and a longer hospitalization duration than the NN group. Serum interleukin (IL) 6 concentrations were elevated in 97.9% of the patients and were the highest in malnourished patients. The IL-4 and IL-10 levels were elevated in 46.8% and 48.9% of the patients, respectively. The proportion of CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in the MN group than in the NN group. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients are malnourished or at risk of malnuourishment, especially those with severe disease. MN is associated with hyperinflammation and immunosuppression in COVID-19 patients, and it may contribute to disease progression.","Liu, Heng; Zhou, Liang; Wang, Hugen; Wang, Xiaobo; Qu, Guangbo; Cai, Jing; Zhang, Hong",,592,26

Treatment options for CoVs are largely lacking. Here, we show that clofazimine, an anti-leprosy drug with a favorable safety and pharmacokinetics profile, possesses pan-coronaviral inhibitory activity, and can antagonize SARS-CoV-2 replication in multiple in vitro systems, including the human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and ex vivo lung cultures. The FDA-approved molecule was found to inhibit multiple steps of viral replication, suggesting multiple underlying antiviral mechanisms. In a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine significantly reduced viral load in the lung and fecal viral shedding, and also prevented cytokine storm associated with viral infection. Additionally, clofazimine exhibited synergy when administered with remdesivir. Since clofazimine is orally bioavailable and has a comparatively low manufacturing cost, it is an attractive clinical candidate for outpatient treatment and remdesivir-based combinatorial therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in developing countries. Taken together, our data provide evidence that clofazimine may have a role in the control of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2, endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoVs of the future.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Yin, Xin; Meng, XiangZhi; Chan, Jasper; Ye, Zi-Wei; Riva, Laura; Pache, Lars; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Lai, Pok-Man; Chan, Chris; Poon, Vincent; Matsunaga, Naoko; Pu, Yuan; Yuen, Chun-Kit; Cao, Jianli; Liang, Ronghui; Tang, Kaiming; Sheng, Li; Du, Yushen; Xu, Wan; Sze, Kong-Hung; Zhang, Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Kok, Kin-Hang; To, Kelvin; Jin, Dong-Yan; Sun, Ren; Chanda, Sumit; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",,592,24

The nationwide lockdown worsened the non-forest income-generating activities of the forest-dependent communities leading to increased pressure on neighbouring forests. Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) data reveal spurred deforestation alerts in May 2020, and about 222 ha forest area had been cleared during January to October 2020, which is 8% more than the whole year of 2019. Despite some positive information about the free movement of wildlife in the forest, a total of 112 animals were killed, which is 28 times more than that of the same lockdown period in 2019. At the same time, wildlife rescuing plummeted by more than 40%. Complete banning of tourism activities brought a significant reduction in income and employment, leading to the collapse of the tourism industry. Lack of tourists, on the other hand, brought a blessing to the wildlife, allowing them to roam freely. Both air and water quality were improved in Dhaka city, and increased aquatic wildlife activities were recorded in the major rivers.

The few empirical studies that have examined pandemic related changes in rates of child maltreatment have relied predominantly on reports of suspected maltreatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examines rates of documented, substantiated child maltreatment resulting in foster care placement, as well as demographic correlates of child maltreatment within the foster care system, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data were available for all youth in the FL foster care system from January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2020 (i.e., > 304,000 youth; > 1.1 million total placements). METHODS: This study utilizes data from the Florida State Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). RESULTS: Results revealed a decrease in the number of youths placed in the FL foster care system during the COVID-19 pandemic with the greatest reduction in April, 2020 during the Safer-at-Home Order (24 % fewer youth in 2020 than 2019). In contrast, the percentage of placements into foster care due to maltreatment increased by 3.34 %. Demographic-linked differences were observed in placement rates and exposure to maltreatment. CONCLUSIONS: While prior work suggests that reports of child maltreatment have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that overall rates of substantiated maltreatment resulting in foster care placement have increased for White youth, while rates of placement of due to inadequate supervision, emotional neglect, and/or parental substance use have decreased for Black youth.

As the early-stage and entry-level product of the voice-enabled smart home industry, the smart speakers have been going through rapid development and rising fierce market competition globally in recent years. China, one of the most populous and largest markets in the world, has tremendous business potential in the smart home industry. The market sales of smart speakers in China have gone through rapid growth in the past three years. However, the market penetration rate of related smart home devices and equipment still stays extremely low and far from mass adoption. Moreover, the market sales of smart speakers have also entered a significant slowdown and adjustment period since 2020. Chinese consumers have moved from early impulsive consumption to a rational consumption phase about this early-stage smart home product. Trust in the marketing field is considered an indispensable component of all business transactions, which plays a crucial role in adopting new technologies. This study explores the influencing factors of Chinese users' perceived trust in the voice-enabled smart home systems, uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the interaction mechanism between different variables, and establishes a perceived trust model through 475 valid samples. The model includes six variables: system quality, familiarity, subjective norm, technology optimism, perceived enjoyment, and perceived trust. The result shows that system quality is the essential influence factor that impacts all other variables and could significantly affect the perceived trust. Perceived enjoyment is the most direct influence variable affected by system quality, subjective norm, and technology optimism, and it positively affects the perceived trust in the end. The subjective norm is one of the most distinguishing variables for Chinese users, since China has a collectivist consumption culture. People always expect their behavior to meet social expectations and standards to avoid criticism and acquire social integration. Therefore, policy guidance, authoritative opinions, and people with important reference roles will significantly affect consumers' perceived trust and purchase intention. Familiarity and technology optimism are important influential factors that will have an indirect impact on the perceived trust. The related results of this study can help designers, practitioners, and researchers of the smart home industry produce products and services with higher perceived trust to improve consumers' adoption and acceptance so that the market penetration rate of related products and enterprises could be increased, and the maturity and development of the voice-enabled smart home industry could be promoted.","Liu, Yuqi; Gan, Yan; Song, Yao; Liu, Jing",Sensors (Basel),592,1

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included patients &#8805;18 years) admitted April-August 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or 1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had an incomplete patient file. Kaplan-Meier (KM) models were used to estimate median time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, median time to discharge was 10 days (95%CI = 9-10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14-16) in the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI = 1.56-2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir (HRadj = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04-0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality (HRadj = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73-3.36). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HRadj = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.99-7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.","Alamer, Ahmad; Alrashed, Ahmed A; Alfaifi, Mashael; Alosaimi, Bandar; AlHassar, Fatimah; Almutairi, Malak; Howaidi, Jude; Almutairi, Wedad; Mohzari, Yahya; Sulaiman, Tarek; Al-Jedai, Ahmed; Alajami, Hamdan N; Alkharji, Fatima; Alsaeed, Ali; Alali, Alaa H; Baredhwan, Abdullah A; Abraham, Ivo; Almulhim, Abdulaziz S",Curr Med Res Opin,592,10

While ezetimibe gained Food and Drug Administration approval in 2002, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. Here, we present two cryo-electron microscopy structures of NPC1L1, one in its apo form and the other complexed with ezetimibe. The apo form represents an open state in which the N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts loosely with the rest of NPC1L1, leaving the NTD central cavity accessible for cholesterol loading. The ezetimibe-bound form signifies a closed state in which the NTD rotates ~60°, creating a continuous tunnel enabling cholesterol movement into the plasma membrane. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol transport by occluding the tunnel instead of competing with cholesterol binding. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol transport and ezetimibe inhibition, paving the way for more effective therapeutic development.","Huang, Ching-Shin; Yu, Xinchao; Fordstrom, Preston; Choi, Kaylee; Chung, Ben C; Roh, Soung-Hun; Chiu, Wah; Zhou, Mingyue; Min, Xiaoshan; Wang, Zhulun",Sci.

Pleural complications are one relevant issue. We aimed in this study to analyse pleural complications, such as pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and empyema, in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of patients who have pleural complications of Covid-19 pneumonia and were consulted about thoracic surgery between March 2020 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The data of the patients were analyzed according to age, gender, length of stay, treatment method for pleural complications, mortality, severity of covid-19 pneumonia, tube thoracostomy duration and presence of a mechanical ventilator. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study. There were 11 female (35.5%) and 20 male (65.5%) patients. The most common complication was pneumothorax in 20 patients (65%). The median duration of hospitalization was 22 days and the mortality rate was 71%. Mortality was significantly higher in patients on mechanical ventilation (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate is very high in patients with pleural complications of Covid-19 pneumonia.

Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with &#8805; 5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of &#8805; 10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04153864 .

CLOCC are among the recently described neurological associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case of CLOCC in a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with auditory hallucinations and rapidly developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man with no past medical and psychiatric history presented with auditory hallucinations, restlessness, and suicidal ideations. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2. A brain MRI revealed an isolated oval-shaped lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, suggestive of CLOCC. After a dramatic hospital course associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and severe intra-abdominal and cerebral bleeding, he developed cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 15. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it suggests that CLOCC can be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with unexplained neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, leading to poor outcome.","Elkhaled, Walid; Ben Abid, Fatma; Akhtar, Naveed; Abukamar, Mohamed R; Ibrahim, Wanis H",Am J Case Rep,592,16

DESIGN: Anonymised blood samples and clinical data were collected in 47 hospitals, clinics and medical centres in six Russian cities/regions in the period from 20 March to 15 June 2020. Three hundred and seventy-six HIV/COVID-19 patients were studied (171 without ART and 205 with ART). The control group consisted of 382 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients without HIV infection. Lymphocyte and cytokine amounts were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA. This work is a retrospective study. RESULTS: COVID-19 led to rapid augmentation of the process of T-cell exhaustion initially caused by HIV, and this T cell degradation was most pronounced in patients without ART. A rise in IL-10 and TGFß serum concentrations was observed. Diminishing CD4+/CD8+ cell and Th1/Th2 cell ratios characteristic for HIV progression were accompanied by a surge in exhausted T cell count with simultaneous exacerbation of COVID-19-related respiratory distress. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection without ART may be a very serious comorbidity of COVID-19, whereas immunity of HIV/COVID-19 patients with proper ART is not generally affected by SARS-CoV-2. HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are likely to exhibit a synergic effect, and exhausted T lymphocyte dynamics may be its effective marker.","Sharov, Konstantin S",Int J Infect Dis,592,5

We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer &#8805;1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, of them, 30 were on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray was present in 36 patients (84%). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% from the National Statistics and 30% from a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26/30 patients and 3/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related).

The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of VTE among patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the United States and whether there is a need for more aggressive prophylaxis. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review of PubMed and Cochrane database from inception to September 2020 was performed for studies that evaluated the incidence of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE), and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the United States. We used “(Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS-Cov-2) AND (venous thromboembolism, VTE OR deep vein thrombosis, DVT OR pulmonary embolism (PE) )”. Finally, we screened reference lists from evaluated full texts. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Case reports and studies including cancer populations were excluded. Results: A total of 973 patients hospitalized in the United States were included from, 3 multicenter and 2 single-center retrospective studies. Of those, 3 retrospective studies determined the incidence of VTE in critically ill patients only. Most studies reported universal in-hospital (95.3%). The overall incidence of VTE was 16.8% and 12% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. Interestingly, subgroup analysis in critically ill patients demonstrated an incidence of VTE of 27.5% and 26.5% despite prophylactic anticoagulation. The overall incidence of DVT was 7.3% and 22.5% in critically ill patients admitted to ICU. PE with or without DVT occurred in 9.5% of patients, 5% in critically ill patients and 2.9% was detected despite anticoagulation. Conclusions: VTE was found at an alarming rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States and often presented as PE. Assessment of VTE risk is strongly recommended in patients with COVID-19. Given the observed higher than average pulmonary embolism incidence despite prophylactic anticoagulation, randomized trials are needed to determine whether there is any potential benefit of prophylactic IVC filter placement in patients with COVID-19, especially in the critical care setting.","Acosta, L.; Jayavarapu, R.; Raissi, D.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,592,1

There is therefore an urgent need to reduce the risks associated with multiple hospital visits and their anti-cancer treatment. One recommendation is to consider alternative dose-fractionation schedules or radiotherapy techniques. This would also increase radiotherapy service capacity for operable patients with stage I-III lung cancer, who might be unable to have surgery during the pandemic. Here we identify reduced-fractionation for curative-intent radiotherapy regimes in lung cancer, from a literature search carried out between 20/03/2020 and 30/03/2020 as well as published and unpublished audits of hypofractionated regimes from UK centres. Evidence, practical considerations and limitations are discussed for early-stage NSCLC, stage III NSCLC, early-stage and locally advanced SCLC.

In this study, we report a novel library of aminoglycoside-derived lipopolymers nanoparticles (LPNs) for the simultaneous delivery of different molecular cargoes including nucleic acids and small-molecules. The LPN library was screened for transgene expression efficacy following delivery of plasmid DNA, and lead LPNs that showed high transgene expression efficacies were characterized using hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. LPNs demonstrated significantly higher efficacies for transgene expression than 25 kDa polyethyleneamine (PEI) and lipofectamine, including in presence of serum. Self-assembly of these cationic lipopolymers into nanoparticles also facilitated the delivery of small molecule drugs (e.g. doxorubicin) to cancer cells. LPNs were also employed for the simultaneous delivery of the small-molecule histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor AR-42 together with plasmid DNA to cancer cells as a combination treatment approach for enhancing transgene expression. Taken together, our results indicate that aminoglycoside-derived LPNs are attractive vehicles for simultaneous delivery of imaging agents or chemotherapeutic drugs together with nucleic acids for different applications in medicine and biotechnology.","Godeshala, Sudhakar; Miryala, Bhavani; Dutta, Subhadeep; Christensen, Matthew D; Nandi, Purbasha; Chiu, Po-Lin; Rege, Kaushal",,592,1

In this sample (n = 95) of psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries, the majority were female (79.1%), training in adult psychiatry (77.9%). A vast majority (87.0%) of psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries have 'ever' considered leaving the country; almost half (in Estonia) or more than a half (in Lithuania and Latvia) were considering leaving 'now'; yet a minority took 'practical steps' towards migration. For all trainees in the Baltic states, personal reasons were the most important to stay in their country. Whilst regarding reasons to leave, financial was top in Lithuania, while trainees from Estonia and Latvia indicated personal reasons as key to emigrate. Several psychiatric trainees in the Baltic countries had considered migration, with many calling for improvements in their salaries.

Existing tools usually make forecasts at the daily or weekly level to assist in planning for staffing requirements. Prompted by new COVID-related capacity constraints placed on our pediatric hospital's emergency department, we developed an hourly forecasting tool to make predictions over a 24 hour window. These forecasts would give our hospital sufficient time to be able to martial resources towards expanding capacity and augmenting staff (e.g. transforming wards or bringing in physicians on call). Using Gaussian Process Regressions (GPRs), we obtain strong performance for both point predictions (average R-squared: 82%) as well as classification accuracy when predicting the ordinal tiers of our hospital's capacity (average precision/recall: 82%/74%). Compared to traditional regression approaches, GPRs not only obtain consistently higher performance, but are also robust to the dataset shifts that have occurred throughout 2020.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does sleep study-derived circulation time (Ct) predict mortality, independent of CV risks and SDB severity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We derived average lung to finger Ct (LFCT) from sleep studies in older men enrolled in the multi-center Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men (MrOS Sleep) study. LFCT was defined as the average time between end of scored respiratory events and nadir oxygen desaturations associated with those events. We calculated the hazards ratio (HR) for the CV and all-cause mortality by LFCT quartiles adjusting for the demographic, body habitus, baseline CV risk and disease (CVD). Additional model included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), time with SpO2 below 90%, and hypoxic burden. We also repeated analyses after excluding those with CVD at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 2631 men (mean age 76.4 +- 5.5 years) were included in this study. LFCT median [IQR] was 18 [15-22] s. During average follow up of 9.9 +/- 3.5 years, 427 (16%) and 1205 (46%) men experienced CV death and all-cause death, respectively. In multivariate analysis, men in the 4th quartile of LFCT (22-52 s) had a HR of 1.36 [95% CI =1.02, 1.81] and of 1.35 [1.14, 1.60] for CV and all-cause mortality, respectively, when compared to men in the 1st quartile (4-15 s). The results were similar when additionally adjusting for AHI, time with SpO2 below 90%, or hypoxic burden. Results were stronger among men with no history of CVD at baseline. INTERPRETATION: LFCT is associated with both CV and all-cause mortality in older men, independent of baseline CV burden and SDB metrics. LFCT may be a novel physiologic marker for CV vulnerability and adverse outcomes in patients with SDB.","Kwon, Younghoon; Sands, Scott A; Stone, Katie L; Taranto-Montemurro, Luigi; Alex, Raichel M; White, David P; Wellman, Andrew; Redline, Susan; Azarbarzin, Ali",Chest,592,0

Effects can range from mild changes in nutrient intake to a significant decrease in quality of life. Olfactory dysfunction can follow clinical problems such as trauma to the brain and nose. During recent months, in the setting of the current worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it has become clear that olfaction can also be damaged by viruses that enter the body through the nose. METHODS: To learn more about this important clinical problem, we reviewed the current literature about smell sensation and the contextual application of altered olfaction in the setting of COVID-19. Knowledge about this topic, along with other clinical aspects of COVID-19, is expanding quickly. CONCLUSION: Nurses perform assessments, assist with implementing treatment interventions, and provide vital education to patients and their families. These interventions help patients with olfactory dysfunction achieve the best possible functional outcome.","Mortimer, Diane Schretzman; Duverneau-Salifu, Moira",J Neurosci Nurs,592,16

The impact of vaccines on asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive, asymptomatic adult patients (n = 39,156) within a large United States healthcare system who underwent 48,333 pre-procedural SARS-CoV-2 molecular screening tests between December 17, 2020 and February 8, 2021. The primary exposure of interest was vaccination with at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was relative risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test among those asymptomatic persons who had received at least one dose of vaccine, as compared to persons who had not received vaccine during the same time period. Relative risk was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, patient residence relative to the hospital (local vs. non-local), healthcare system regions, and repeated screenings among patients using mixed effects log-binomial regression. RESULTS: Positive molecular tests in asymptomatic individuals were reported in 42 (1.4%) of 3,006 tests performed on vaccinated patients and 1,436 (3.2%) of 45,327 tests performed on unvaccinated patients (RR=0.44 95% CI: 0.33-0.60; p<.0001). Compared to unvaccinated patients, the risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower among those >10 days after 1 st dose (RR=0.21; 95% CI: 0.12-0.37; p<.0001) and >0 days after 2 nd dose (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.44; p<.0001) in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccination with an mRNA-based vaccine showed a significant association with a reduced risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as measured during pre-procedural molecular screening. The results of this study demonstrate the impact of the vaccines on reduction in asymptomatic infections supplementing the randomized trial results on symptomatic patients.","Tande, Aaron J; Pollock, Benjamin D; Shah, Nilay D; Farrugia, Gianrico; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie; Breeher, Laura; Binnicker, Matthew; Berbari, Elie F",Clin. infect. dis,592,20

In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models’ effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD–single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.","da Silva, Ramon Gomes; Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin; Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos",Chaos Solitons Fractals,592,26

It remains unclear how different reopening strategies obstruct the local virus containment and impact the economy. We develop a model with travelers across heterogeneous epicenters. A low-risk area attempts to safely reopen utilizing internal policies, such as social distancing and contact tracing, and external policies, including capacity quota, quarantine, and tests. Simulations based on the COVID-19 scenario show that external policies differ in efficacy. They can substitute each other and complement internal policies. Simultaneous relaxation of both channels may lead to a new wave of COVID-19 and large economic costs. This work highlights the importance of quantitative assessment prior to implementing reopening strategies.","Zhong, Ling",PLoS One,592,16

Because of health emergencies during this period, widespread fear has resulted in compromised patient safety, especially for patients with cancer. It is very challenging to treat such cancer patients because of the complexity of providing care and treatment, along with COVID-19. Hence, an effective treatment comparison strategy is needed. We need to have a handy tool to understand cancer progression in this unprecedented scenario. Linking different events of cancer progression is the need of the hour. It is a huge challenge for the development of new methodology. METHODS: This article explores the time lag effect and makes a statistical inference about the best experimental arm using Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model and regression methods. The work is presented as the occurrence of other events as a hazard rate after the first event (relapse). The time lag effect between the events is linked and analysed. RESULTS: The results were presented as a comprehensive analytical strategy by joining all disease progression. An AFT model applied with the transition states, and the dependency structure between the gap times was used by the auto-regression model. The effects of arms were compared using the coefficient of auto-regression and accelerated failure time (AFT) models. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the solutions to overcome the issue with intervals between two consecutive events in motivating head and neck cancer (HNC) data. COVID-19 is not going to leave us soon. We have to conduct several cancer clinical trials in the presence of COVID-19. A comprehensive analytical strategy to analyse cancer clinical trial data during COVID-19 pandemic is presented.","Bhattacharjee, Atanu; Vishwakarma, Gajendra K; Banerjee, Souvik; Shukla, Sharvari",BMC Med Res Methodol,592,1

Prostate cancer (PCa) services across the globe have been on hold due to changing medical and surgical priorities. There is also epidemiological evidence that PCa patients have increased incidence and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to gender differences, age, and higher propensity for risk factors (eg, respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and smoking status). Objective: To contribute to the emerging body of knowledge on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection to PCa patients and, in the face of PCa treatment delays, provide evidence-based recommendations for ongoing management of specific PCa patient groups. Evidence acquisition: A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science) as well as the media to harness emerging data on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its influence on PCa. Eligibility criteria were originality of data and relevance to PCa management. The authors note that during these unprecedented times, retrospective data are constantly being updated from multiple sources globally. Evidence synthesis: A total of 72 articles and data sources were found initially. Owing to repetition, lack of originality, or nonrelevance, six articles were rejected, leaving 23 retrospective studies, seven basic science research articles, 15 societal and journal guidelines, and 21 epidemiological data sources, from countries at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These were analyzed qualitatively to produce evidence-based guidelines for the management of PCa patients at different stages of the patient journey, with strategies to reduce the risk of viral spread. Conclusions: PCa patients may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as morbidity and mortality if infected. Once appropriately triaged, and to reduce viral spread, PCa patients can have surveillance by telemedicine, and institute lifestyle changes and social quarantining measures. If risk stratification suggests that treatment should be planned, androgen deprivation therapy can be started, or potentially surgery or radiation therapy is possible on a case-by-case basis. Patient summary: Prostate cancer patients can be followed up remotely until the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic resolves, but higher-risk cases may have treatment expedited to limit any negative impact on prostate cancer outcomes. Prostate cancer (PCa) patients may have an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mortality. Most can be followed up remotely until the pandemic resolves, but, once appropriately triaged, higher-risk cases can have treatment expedited to limit any negative impact on PCa outcomes.","Dovey, Zachary; Mohamed, Nihal; Gharib, Yasmine; Ratnani, Parita; Hammouda, Nada; Nair, Sujit S.; Chakravarty, Dimple; Sobotka, Stanislaw; Lantz, Anna; Wiklund, Peter; Kyprianou, Natasha; Tewari, Ash",Eu.

As diagnostic options, swabs from the anterior nose, from the nasopharynx, from the oropharynx or the extraction of throat rinse water or saliva are possible. The laboratory methods available are antigen tests that can be read in a few minutes or more lengthy RT-PCR methods in a lab. Swabs are carried out by physicians, medical staff, laypeople and in the self-test, in each case according to prior instructions. Many of these factors therefore have an influence on the informative value and the sensitivity of the entire diagnostic process. The PCR laboratory method is more sensitive than the antigen method; the swabs from the nasopharynx are considered the most valid smear site; correct execution of a test can be achieved even with non-professional individuals with good instructions. Complications with such swabs are reported very rarely, given the assumed number of procedures performed. Short-term nosebleeds after traumatic smears can be assumed without publications about it being found. Broken parts of swabs had to be removed by an ENT doctor. There are only very few reports on injuries to the skullbase with CSF-leaks, including 2 times with anomalies such as meningoceles.

With regard to prevention there is no vaccine, thus, we proposed to explore the spike protein due to its presence on the viral surface, and it also contains the putative viral entry receptor as well as the fusion peptide (important in the genome release). In this work we have employed In Silico techniques such as immunoinformatics tools which permit the identification of potential immunogenic regions on the viral surface (spike glycoprotein). From these analyses, we identified four epitopes E332-370, E627-651, E440-464 and E694-715 that accomplish essential features such as promiscuity, conservation grade, exposure and universality, and they also form stable complexes with MHCII molecule.

We assessed the reliability and validity of the instrument in a sample of 1089 adults in Norway (response rate 73%). Internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha (0.88) was acceptable. Omega alphaHierarchical (&#969;t = 0.69) was lower indicating that the general factor is less reliable, explaining 69% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the FCV-19S is not strictly unidimensional. Exploratory graph analysis and confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor model (cognitive and somatic fear), which were highly correlated (r = 0.84). The Norwegian version of the FCV-19S showed an underlying two-factor structure. However, the high correlation means the two latent factors (cognitive and somatic fear) act as indicators for a second-order general factor and support use of the FCV-19S sum score. The FCV-19S appears to be a valid instrument to assess fear of COVID-19 with good psychometric properties.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of population median age and mean ambient temperature on the COVID-19 global pandemic burden. METHODS: We used databases from open access public domains to record population median age, mean ambient temperature, and the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths on days 14 and 28 from the pandemic outbreak for each country in the world. We then calculated the correlation between these parameters. RESULTS: The analysis included 202 countries. A univariate analysis showed that population median age significantly correlated with the cumulative number of cases and deaths, while mean ambient temperature showed a significant inverse correlation with the cumulative number of deaths on days 14 and 28 from the epidemic outbreak. After a multivariate logistic regression analysis only population median age retained its statistically significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: Country population median age significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic burden while mean ambient temperature shows a significant inverse correlation only in univariate analysis. Countries with older populations encountered a heavier burden from the COVID-19 pandemic. This information may be valuable for health systems in planning strategies for combating this global health hazard.","Zilberlicht, A.; Abramov, D.; Kugelman, N.; Lavie, O.; Elias, Y.; Abramov, Y.",Israel Medical Association Journal: Imaj,592,26

The availability of filtering facepiece class 3 (FFP3) respirators could be greatly increased if they could be reused after sterilisation. Aims: To determine the effects of repeated autoclave cycles on the fit and filter function of the 3M 1863 FFP3 disposable respirator. Methods: Participants underwent fit tests with 3M 1863 FFP3 respirators. Respirators were subjected to autoclave cycles and a repeat fit test was conducted after each cycle until failure. The filter function of both unused and autoclaved respirators was determined by quantitatively assessing the differential pressures and filter penetration of aerosolised sodium chloride particles. Mask structural inspection was also carried out by light microscopy. Results: A total of 38 participants were recruited. Repeat fit testing with a new respirator was passed by 30 of 38 (79%) participants in comparison with 31 of 38 (82%) of participants after the respirator had undergone one autoclave cycle. There was fit test failure with further rounds of autoclave. There was no evidence of structural changes after one autoclave cycle, but the nose foam began to separate from the mask following further cycles. Filter efficiency of all 15 autoclaved respirators that underwent filter testing was 97.40% or more. Differential pressure (breathability) of respirators was unaffected by autoclaving. Conclusions: 3M 1863 FFP3 respirator retains good fit and filter function after a single autoclave cycle. Addressing nose foam separation and further testing to EN149 standards would be required before respirators could be considered for reuse.","Desai, N.; Naveed, H.; Koenig, M.; Huber, J.; Kapur, N.; Bhutta, M.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to develop an online referral pathway that would allow us to provide definitive orthopaedic management plans and reduce face-to-face contact at the fracture clinics. Methods: All patients presenting to the emergency department from 21March 2020 with a musculoskeletal injury or potential musculoskeletal infection deemed to require orthopaedic input were discussed using a secure messaging app. A definitive management plan was communicated by an on-call senior orthopaedic decision-maker. We analyzed the time to decision, if further information was needed, and the referral outcome. An analysis of the orthopaedic referrals for the same period in 2019 was also performed as a comparison. Results: During the study period, 295 patients with mean age of 7.93 years (standard error (SE) 0.24) were reviewed. Of these, 25 (9.8%) were admitted, 17 (5.8%) were advised to return for planned surgical intervention, 105 (35.6%) were referred to a face-to-face fracture clinic, 137 (46.4%) were discharged with no follow-up, and seven (2.4%) were referred to other services. The mean time to decision was 20.14 minutes (SE 1.73). There was a significant difference in the time to decision between patients referred to fracture clinic and patients discharged (mean 25.25 minutes (SE 3.18) vs mean 2.63 (SE 1.42); p < 0.005). There were a total of 295 referrals to the fracture clinic for the same period in 2019 with a further 44 emergency admissions. There was a statistically significant difference in the weekly referrals after being triaged by the VFC (mean 59 (SE 5.15) vs mean 21 (SE 2.17); p < 0.001). Conclusion: The use of an electronic referral pathway to deliver a point of care virtual fracture clinic allowed for efficient use of scarce resources and definitive management plan delivery in a safe manner.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:293-301.","McIntyre, Tom Vincent; Kelly, Enda Gerard; Clarke, Trevor; Green, Connor J",Bone Jt Open,592,1

Ships are in an isolated environment, and most of the merchant ships do not carry medical personnel or medical supplies. Telemedicine offers a real possibility to provide reasonable quality medical assistance to seagoing vessels. The fact that ships may touch ports in affected areas, the difficulties for seafarers to be assisted ashore due to quarantine measures and the crews' lack of turnover make medical assistance at sea difficult. This study has compared maritime telemedical assistance data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to propose prevention measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on the data from medical records of Centro Internazionale Radio Medico (C.I.R.M.) database of seafarers assisted from January 1 to June 30, in the years 2017-2020. The data were collected separately for each year. Age, sex, rank, and pathologies affecting the assisted seafarers were considered. Common signs of COVID-19 infection such as fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, and other respiratory symptoms were analysed. RESULTS: From January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019, C.I.R.M. assisted 15,888 patients on board ships. During the first 6 months of the years under evaluation, C.I.R.M. assisted 2,419 patients in 2017, 2,444 patients in 2018, 2,694 patients in 2019, and 3,924 in 2020. The number of assisted cases almost doubled in the first 6 months (from January to June) of 2020 compared to the same period of the previous years. Gastrointestinal disorders, injuries/traumas, and dermatological pathologies were the first, second, and third most often reported causes of illness on board over the 4-year study period. A higher number of seafarers with fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath were assisted during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the coronavirus outbreak. Medical requests for fever increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period from 2017 to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The requests for medical advice for fever, sore throat, and shortness of breath were significantly more common during the coronavirus epidemic. Close follow-up, regular health education on preventing coronavirus transmission, personal protective equipment, adequate environmental hygiene, and applying other standard precautions could help minimise the risk factors for the spread of COVID-19.","Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Battineni, Gopi; Chintalapudi, Nalini; Di Canio, Marzio; Amenta, Francesco",Int Marit Health,592,29

METHODS: We developed a compartment queue model to describe the process from case confirmation, home-based isolation, hospitalization, ICU, recovery, and death. By using public assessed data in Lombardy, Italy, we estimated two congestion indices for isolation wards and ICU. The excess ICU needs were estimated in Lombardy, Italy, and other countries when data were available, including France, Spain, Belgium, New York State in the USA, South Korea, and Japan. RESULTS: In Lombardy, Italy, the congestion of isolation beds had increased from 2.2 to the peak of 6.0 in March and started to decline to 3.9 as of 9th May, whereas the demand for ICU during the same period has not decreased yet with an increasing trend from 2.9 to 8.0. The results showed the unmet ICU need from the second week in March as of 9th May. The same situation was shown in France, Spain, Belgium, and New York State, USA but not for South Korea and Japan. The results with data until December 2020 for Lombardy, Italy were also estimated to reflect the demand for hospitalization and ICU after the occurrence of viral variants. CONCLUSION: Two congestion indices for isolation wards and ICU beds using open assessed tabulated data with a compartment queue model underpinning were developed to monitor the clinical capacity in hospitals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jen, Grace Hsiao-Hsuan; Chen, Shey-Ying; Chang, Wei-Jung; Chen, Chiung-Nien; Yen, Amy Ming-Fang; Chang, Ray-E",J.

Here, we report on the use of this system, which received over 3 million responses within two months, for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data.

Particularly in these times, it is important to maintain individual health. Therefore, it is important to take part in routine health checkups. Consequently, our objective was to describe the frequency and to identify the determinants of postponed routine health checkups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data from the nationally representative online-survey ""COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO)"" was used (wave 17; July 2020). METHODS: In sum, 974 individuals were included in our analytical sample (average age was 45.9 years, SD: 16.5, 18-74 years). Postponed routine health checkups (yes or no) since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. RESULTS: More than 16% of the individuals reported postponed routine health checkups in the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, individuals aged 30-49 years had postponed health checkups (21%). The probability of postponed health checkups was positively associated with the presence of chronic diseases (odds ratio [OR]: 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.47), higher affect regarding COVID-19 (OR: 1.44, 95%-CI: 1.16-1.78), and higher presumed severity of COVID-19 (OR: 1.17, 95%-CI: 1.01-1.35), whereas the outcome measure was not associated with socioeconomic factors. Data showed that a sizeable part (about one of six individuals) of the population reported postponed routine health checkups due to the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Postponed checkups should not be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals at risk for postponed health checkups should be appropriately addressed.","Hajek, A; De Bock, F; Kretzler, B; König, H-H",Public Health,592,18

These locally 'ordinary' pharmaceutical commodities are used as tokens of care, enablers of treatment and legitimisers of illness to navigate in everyday healthcare infrastructures. Patients express embodied experiences of antibiotics circulating in their blood stream to reveal the abundance of antibiotic use in their medical histories. Yet access to antibiotics is becoming increasingly regulated, which is necessitating negotiations of care and trust amongst patient, doctors and pharmacists. Antibiotics, which for a long time have been reliable and easily accessible objects of care, are now proving less effective as treatment. With the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the over-the-counter sales of antibiotics have stopped in Turkey since 2015. Which means that antibiotics are only legally available through a doctor's prescription. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has recently limited doctor consultations, further restricting access to prescription medication. This paper explores the implications of the recent regulations and AMR on prescription practices, patient experiences and patient-doctor relationships within antibiotic infrastructures. The research draws on a three-month ethnographic fieldwork in Istanbul, Turkey, to understand negotiations of care and trust in processes of prescribing and acquiring antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framework of the research is rooted in medical anthropology. Drawing on qualitative interviews with doctors, pharmacists and patients, as well as participant observation in an unfolding pandemic, this study shows that antibiotic prescription processes are becoming embedded in negotiations between patients, doctors and pharmacists. Moreover, despair amidst tension and uncertainty is increasing the contingency of navigating care and trust in the healthcare system to enable alternative ways of access to antibiotics.","Azak, A.

The understanding of the molecular mechanism of transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We integrate the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolates, 130 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis, and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-escape variants. We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein RBD can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more vaccine-resistant. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, Brazil, and Germany, etc. We envision that natural selection through infectivity will continue to be the main mechanism for viral evolution among unvaccinated populations, while antibody disruptive co-mutations will fuel the future growth of vaccine-breakthrough variants among fully vaccinated populations. Finally, we have identified the co-mutations that have the great likelihood of becoming dominant: [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [V401L, L452R, T478K], [K417N, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y]. We predict they, particularly the last four, will break through existing vaccines.

Long-term treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections. Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0). Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [reference range 1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT. Fingolimod medication was stopped. On the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly. Over the following two days, oxygenation improved, and the patient was transferred to a normal ward five days after admission. CONCLUSION: The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex. As an S1P analogue, fingolimod might enhance lung endothelial cell integrity. In addition, in case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation might be beneficial to reduce mortality. Future studies are needed to explore the risks and therapeutic effects of fingolimod in COVID-19 patients.","Foerch, Christian; Friedauer, Lucie; Bauer, Boris; Wolf, Timo; Adam, Elisabeth H",Mult Scler Relat Disord,592,10

This survey was developed and conducted to assess the impact of lockdown on Indian optometry practice. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was designed and circulated across the optometrists practicing in India through multiple social media platforms. All the data were extracted and only valid response were analyzed and reported. RESULTS: A total of 691 optometrists participated in the survey. Most of the participants (22.25%) were in private practice followed by academics (14.89%). Among the valid responses collected, it was found that 43.37% of the respondents were consulting patients during the lockdown. Of these, 27.17% of optometrists were examining infectious cases and 48.68% were examining all the patients who came for consultation. Approximately 50.94% of the participated optometrist had begun telephonic/e­mail/video consultations. In addition, 64.48% reported that optometrists were at an equal risk of clinching COVID­19 on comparison with other domains during patient examination. Nearly 30.44% respondents felt that optometrists would face challenges in approaching the patient post COVID-19 considering the close working distance. CONCLUSION: A proportion of optometrist have switched to some form of teleconsultation in order to aid patients during this prevailing pandemic. Regulatory bodies should issue appropriate guidelines regarding the safe optometry practice for the betterment of both patient and practitioners during face-to-face consultation.","K Karthikeyan, Siddharth; Nandagopal, Pooja; R, Vivek Suganthan; Nayak, Anush",J. optom.

Exploring Uncertainties in the Age-VSL Relationship,15.924518,4.9571147,2021,"Optimizing the impact on the economy of control strategies aiming at containing the spread of COVID-19 is a critical challenge. We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with the implemented system of reopening 'in phases'. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields progressively stricter measures of social distancing. We finally compute the optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the period over which vaccines are administered to the population.","Shirin, Afroza; Lin, Yen Ting; Sorrentino, Francesco",Sci Rep,592,24

However, little is known about the clinical symptoms which discriminate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 among outpatients in general practitioner clinics, which is important for efficient case detection. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical symptoms to discriminate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases among outpatients in general practitioner clinics during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan in August 2020. METHODS: The records of 360 patients who visited a clinic with suspicion of infectious disease and underwent COVID-19 PCR test between 1 and 14 August 2020 were used. The patients filled out a questionnaire on possible clinical symptoms and transmission routes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between clinical symptoms and COVID-19 status. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients were 17 (4.7%). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that anosmia (odds ratio (OR), 25.94 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.15-94.14; p < 0.001), headache (OR, 3.31 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.98-11.20; p = 0.054), sputum production (OR, 3.32 CI, 1.01-10.90; p = 0.048) and history of visiting an izakaya or bar (OR, 4.23 CI, 0.99-18.03; p = 0.051) were marginally significantly associated withbeing COVID-19 positive. This model showed moderate predictive power (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.870 CI, 0.761 to 0.971). CONCLUSIONS: We found that anosmia, headache, sputum production, history of visiting an izakaya or bar were associated with COVID-19, which can be used to detect patients with COVID-19 in out-patient clinics in Japan. The findings of this study need to be verified in other clinics and hospitals in Japan and other countries with universal healthcare coverages.","Sonoda, Shiro; Kuramochi, Jin; Matsuyama, Yusuke; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Fujiwara, Takeo",,592,16

The longer high levels of viral multiplication occur - permitted by high levels of transmission -, the more the virus can adapt to the human host and find ways to success. The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is starting in different parts of the world, emphasizing that transmission containment measures that are being imposed are not adequate. Part of the consideration in determining containment measures is the rationale that vaccination will soon stop transmission and allow a return to normality. However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine-resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll-out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic. In the absence of effective antivirals, it is not improbable that SARS-CoV-2 infection prophylaxis will involve an annual vaccination campaign against 'dominant' viral variants, similar to influenza prophylaxis. Living with COVID-19 will be an issue of SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolution. It is therefore crucial to understand how SARS-CoV-2 evolves and what constrains its evolution, in order to anticipate the variants that will emerge. Thus far, the focus has been on the receptor-binding spike protein, but the virus is complex, encoding 26 proteins which interact with a large number of host factors, so the possibilities for evolution are manifold and not predictable a priori. However, if we are to mount the best defence against COVID-19, we must mount it against the variants, and to do this, we must have knowledge about the evolutionary possibilities of the virus. In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution. We now have the wherewithal - viral genome sequencing, protein structure determination/modelling, protein interaction analysis - to functionally characterize viral variants, but access to comprehensive genome data is extremely uneven. Yet, to develop an understanding of the impacts of such evolution on transmission and disease, we must link it to transmission (viral epidemiology) and disease data (patient clinical data), and the population granularities of these. In this editorial, we explore key facets of viral biology and the influence of relevant aspects of human polymorphisms, human behaviour, geography and climate and, based on this, derive a series of recommendations to monitor viral evolution and predict the types of variants that are likely to arise.","Luo, Ruibang; Delaunay-Moisan, Agnès; Timmis, Kenneth; Danchin, Antoine",Environ Microbiol,592,1

Relevant case reports and case series describing clinical and imaging features of AHLE associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, data compiled, and critically reviewed. RESULTS: Acute onset encephalopathy and rapidly deteriorating neurological status is the common clinical presentation in AHLE. CSF analysis reveals elevated proteins and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Typical neuroimaging features include multifocal, variable-sized, poorly defined cerebral white matter lesions with cortical sparing. Involvement of the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and deep grey matter can also occur, although rarely. Lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, hypointense on T1W images, and show microhemorrhages, variable diffusion restriction, and post-contrast enhancement. Extensive microhemorrhages, brainstem involvement, and gross hemorrhage often portend a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Heightened awareness about the clinical and imaging presentation of COVID-19-related AHLE can positively alter the outcome in a select few by enabling early diagnosis and aggressive management.","Varadan, Baskaran; Shankar, Abhinaya; Rajakumar, Akila; Subramanian, Shubha; Sathya, A C; Hakeem, Abdul Rahman; Kalyanasundaram, Srinivasan",Neuroradiology,592,8

METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric study was performed using a nonrandom convenience sampling from the general population (&#8805;18 years-old) of 6 countries (Brazil, Italy, France, Portugal, Germany, and Spain) adopting social isolation (SI). The validated self-administered online survey (PEF-COVID19) was used. The tests T-test and Chi-square with Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analysis and a multivariate logistic regression model (p Ë 0.05). RESULTS: We included 3194 replies and ~80% of the respondents were in SI. Brazilian sample was highly influenced by the pandemic considering PEx practice and habits, pain, anxiety, and stress (p Ë 0.05). Among the European countries, Italy presented the major changes.

We propose a novel causal reduction method that replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders with a single latent confounder that lives in the same space as the treatment variable without changing the observational and interventional distributions entailed by the causal model. After the reduction, we parameterize the reduced causal model using a flexible class of transformations, so-called normalizing flows. We propose a learning algorithm to estimate the parameterized reduced model jointly from observational and interventional data. This allows us to estimate the causal effect in a principled way from combined data. We perform a series of experiments on data simulated using nonlinear causal mechanisms and find that we can often substantially reduce the number of interventional samples when adding observational training samples without sacrificing accuracy. Thus, adding observational data may help to more accurately estimate causal effects even in the presence of unobserved confounders.","Ilse, Maximilian; Forr'e, Patrick; Welling, Max; Mooij, Joris M.",,592,16

Since then, surgeons have been taught that hair more easily penetrates wet skin, leading to the assumption that sweating promotes PSD. This postulate, however, has never been proven. Thus we used pilocarpine iontophoresis to assess sweating in the glabella sacralis. 100 patients treated for PSD and 100 controls were matched for sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Pilocarpine iontophoresis was performed for 5 min, followed by 15 min of sweat collection. PSD patients sweated less than their matched pairs (18.4 ± 1.6 µl vs. 24.2 ± 2.1 µl, p = 0.03). Men sweated more than women (22.2 ± 1.2 µl vs. 15.0 ± 1.0 µl in non-PSD patients (p < 0.0001) and 20.0 ± 1.9 µl vs. 11.9 ± 2.0 µl in PSD patients (p = 0.051)).

Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.","Lythgoe, Katrina A; Hall, Matthew; Ferretti, Luca; de Cesare, Mariateresa; MacIntyre-Cockett, George; Trebes, Amy; Andersson, Monique; Otecko, Newton; Wise, Emma L; Moore, Nathan; Lynch, Jessica; Kidd, Stephen; Cortes, Nicholas; Mori, Matilde; Williams, Rebecca; Vernet, Gabrielle; Justice, Anita; Green, Angie; Nicholls, Samuel M; Ansari, M Azim; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Moore, Catrin E; Peto, Timothy E A; Eyre, David W; Shaw, Robert; Simmonds, Peter; Buck, David; Todd, John A; Connor, Thomas R; Ashraf, Shirin; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Shepherd, James; Thomson, Emma C; Bonsall, David; Fraser, Christophe; Golubchik, Tanya",Science (Wash.),592,5

Safety measures and precautions taken by many countries seem insufficient, especially with no specific approved drugs against the virus. This has created an urgent need to fast track the development of new medication against the virus in order to alleviate the problem and meet public expectations. The SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease (Mpro) is one of the most attractive targets in the virus life cycle, which is responsible for the processing of the viral polyprotein and is a key for the ribosomal translation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this work, we targeted this enzyme through a structure-based drug design (SBDD) protocol, which aimed at the design of a new potential inhibitor for Mpro. The protocol involves three major steps: fragment-based drug design (FBDD), covalent docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the calculation of the designed molecule binding free energy at a high level of theory. The FBDD step identified five molecular fragments, which were linked via a suitable carbon linker, to construct our designed compound RMH148. The mode of binding and initial interactions between RMH148 and the enzyme active site was established in the second step of our protocol via covalent docking. The final step involved the use of MD simulations to test for the stability of the docked RMH148 into the Mpro active site and included precise calculations for potential interactions with active site residues and binding free energies. The results introduced RMH148 as a potential inhibitor for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme, which was able to achieve various interactions with the enzyme and forms a highly stable complex at the active site even better than the co-crystalized reference.","Hassab, Mahmoud A.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to present the prevalence of overall and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in pregnant women admitted to the hospital, and assess the diagnostic accuracy of maternal symptoms and lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in detecting the infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary center in Istanbul, Turkey, for a month period starting from 27 April 2020. Women with a confirmed pregnancy regardless of the gestational week admitted to the obstetric unit with any indication were consecutively underwent LUS and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were included for the final analysis. The universal screening strategy diagnosed 23 pregnant women (7.77%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 was found as 3.72% (n = 11) and 4.05% (n = 12), respectively. Four of nine women who underwent a second testing for SARS-CoV-2 upon abnormal LUS findings were found positive eventually (17.4%, n = 4/23). The asymptomatic pregnant women with LUS score of 1 and those with normal LUS findings were considered as likely to be normal. Symptomatic patients with LUS score of 1 and those with score of 2 or 3 were considered as abnormal. On a secondary diagnostic performance analysis, the positive predictive value and the sensitivity were found as 44% and 47.8% for the triage based on maternal symptoms and, 82.3% and 60.9% for the triage based on LUS, respectively. CONCLUSION: A one-month trial period of universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR in pregnant women who admitted to the hospital showed an overall and asymptomatic infection diagnose rate of 7.77% and 4%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, physics driven domain specific transporter framework with an attention mechanism to identify relevant key points with applications in ultrasound imaging. The proposed framework identifies key points that provide a concise geometric representation highlighting regions with high structural variation in ultrasound videos. We incorporate physics driven domain specific information as a feature probability map and use the radon transform to highlight features in specific orientations. The proposed framework has been trained on130 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 113 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos and validated on 100 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 58 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos acquired from multiple centers across the globe. Images from both datasets were independently assessed by experts to identify clinically relevant features such as A-lines, B-lines and pleura from LUS and radial metaphysis, radial epiphysis and carpal bones from WUS videos. The key points detected from both datasets showed high sensitivity (LUS = 99\% , WUS = 74\%) in detecting the image landmarks identified by experts. Also, on employing for classification of the given lung image into normal and abnormal classes, the proposed approach, even with no prior training, achieved an average accuracy of 97\% and an average F1-score of 95\% respectively on the task of co-classification with 3 fold cross-validation. With the purely unsupervised nature of the proposed approach, we expect the key point detection approach to increase the applicability of ultrasound in various examination performed in emergency and point of care.","Tripathi, Arpan; Rakkunedeth, Abhilash; Panicker, Mahesh Raveendranatha; Zhang, Jack; Boora, Naveenjyote; Knight, Jessica; Jaremko, Jacob; Chen, Yale Tung; Narayan, Kiran Vishnu; Kesavadas, C",,592,1

This paper summarized the latest outcomes of corresponding study from Chinese centers and clarified the hematopoietic abnormality caused by SARS-CoV-2 and potential mechanism. Lymphopenia was common in the early stage after the onset of COVID-19. A significant decrease was observed in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. As the illness progressed, neutrophilia emerged in several cases, and patients with severe critical pulmonary conditions showed higher neutrophils than common type. Thrombocytopenia was resulting from the consumption and/or the reduced production of platelets in damaged lungs. Anemia was not observed notably, but the decrease in hemoglobin was frequent. The activation of monocyte-macrophage system aggravates the immune damage of lung and other tissues, which leads to the increase of D-dimer, prothrombin time, and platelet consumption.","Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Run; He, Guangsheng",Ann Hematol,592,20

However, there is little data on the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on chemosensory function. METHODS: Twenty three SARS-CoV-2-positive patients diagnosed in spring 2020 with subjective hyposmia (out of 57 positive patients, 40.3%) were compared to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients without hyposmia (n = 19) and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (n = 14). Chemosensory function was assessed by the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), Taste Strips (TS), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), and the SNOT-22. The initial cohort with hyposmia were also examined at 8 weeks and 6 months after initial examination. RESULTS: There were no differences between the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort without hyposmia and negative controls in terms of BSIT (8.5 ± 2.6 vs. 10.2 ± 1.8), TS (3.4 ± 0.6 vs. 3.9 ± 0.3) or VAS (2.1 ± 1.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.5); yet the SNOT-22 was significantly elevated (27.7 ± 11.2 vs. 16.4 ± 10.8). The SARS-CoV-2-positive group with hyposmia performed significantly poorer in BSIT (4.0 ± 1.7 vs. 8.5 ± 2.6/10.2 ± 1.8), TS (2.6 ± 1.3 vs. 3.4 ± 0.6/3.9 ± 0.3), and VAS (7.9 ± 2.2 vs. 2.1 ± 1.3/1.1 ± 0.5) compared to both control groups. At week 8 and month 6 control, six and five patients, respectively, still suffered from subjectively and objectively impaired chemosensory function. The other patients had recovered in both respects. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 patients with subjectively impaired chemosensory function regularly perform poorly in objective measurements. About 70% of patients suffering from olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 quickly recover-the rest still suffers from considerable impairment 6 months after infection.","Bertlich, Mattis; Stihl, Clemens; Lüsebrink, Enzo; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Scherer, Clemens; Freytag, Saskia; Spiegel, Jennifer Lee; Stoycheva, Ivelina; Canis, Martin; Weiss, Bernhard G; Ihler, Friedrich; Haubner, Frank",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,592,16

Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. METHODS: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (CT). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. CT value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33 &#8804; CT < 35.3 CT range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings. CONCLUSION: The simple workflow modification eliminating the SDD led to an overall improvement in the detection of positive specimens and also simplified workflow and reduced hands-on time.","Zhen, Wei; Whitfield, Natalie N; Smith, Elizabeth; Shaw, Christine; Ivy, Cristina; Douglas, Caylee; Bickford, Stephanie; Berry, Gregory J",,592,16

However, this is impractical or impossible for the many disabled people who do not live in care facilities, but still require caregivers. We seek to determine which interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their caregivers. We simulate transmission with a model that includes susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatically ill, hospitalized, and removed individuals. The networks on which we simulate disease spread incorporate heterogeneity in the risks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening measures, and contact distributions for four different groups (caregivers, disabled people, essential workers, and the general population). We find the probability of becoming infected is largest for caregivers and second largest for disabled people. Our analysis of network structure illustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all groups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- most reduce the cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group spreads COVID-19 most readily by seeding infections in a subset of each group. We find caregivers are the most potent spreaders of COVID-19, particularly to other caregivers and to disabled people. We test where to use limited vaccine doses most effectively and find (1) vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating the general population or essential workers and (2) vaccinating caregivers protects disabled people about as much as vaccinating disabled people themselves. Our results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing, contact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the exposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.","Valles, Thomas E.; Shoenhard, Hannah; Zinski, Joseph; Trick, Sarah; Porter, Mason A.; Lindstrom, Michael R.",,592,32

During the COVID-19 surge (April – June 2020) with centralization of paediatric surgical care and risks from anaesthetics to both patients and staff a NOM pathway was used to manage clinically diagnosed appendicitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC). Methods Prospective data collection was undertaken of all children (&lt;16 years) diagnosed with appendicitis who entered the NOM pathway in RBHSC from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. This was compared to a cohort from the same timeframe in 2019. Primary end-points were inpatient success rate of NOM and 30-day success rate of NOM (success defined as no appendectomy performed). Results 47 patients completed the NOM pathway, with 43% (20/47) suspected to have complicated appendicitis. The cohort was similar to that of 2019 in terms of age (p=0.1) and sex (p=0.8), but was 155% larger (42 v. 20). For those with simple appendicitis, there was a 96% (26/27) success rate of NOM on discharge, with a 93% (25/27) 30-day success rate. For complicated appendicitis, there was a 40% (8/20) success rate on discharge, with a 30% (6/20) 30-day success rate. Conclusion The use of a NOM pathway for paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in Northern Ireland was safe and effective for staff and patients. With a small sample size and restricted follow up more evidence is required to prove if this is an effective treatment modality with a return to normal theatre availability. In the interests of antibiotic stewardship we would not advocate NOM pathways utilisation by nonsurgical clinicians.","Colvin, D.; Lawther, S.",Ulster Medical Journal,592,1

Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country should consider the context of their own country.","Lee, Ji Ho; Lee, Hocheol; Kim, Ji Eon; Moon, Seok Jun; Nam, Eun Woo",Global Health,592,16

In this paper, we investigate the problem of maximizing algebraic connectivity in multilayer networks by allocating interlink weights subject to a budget while allowing arbitrary interconnections. For budgets below a threshold, we identify an upper-bound for maximum algebraic connectivity which is independent of interconnections pattern and is reachable with satisfying a certain regularity condition. For efficient numerical approaches in regions of no analytical solution, we cast the problem into a convex framework that explores the problem from several perspectives and, particularly, transforms into a graph embedding problem that is easier to interpret and related to the optimum diffusion phase. Allowing arbitrary interconnections entails regions of multiple transitions, giving more diverse diffusion phases with respect to one-to-one interconnection case. When there is no limitation on the interconnections pattern, we derive several analytical results characterizing the optimal weights by individual Fiedler vectors. We use the ratio of algebraic connectivity and the layer sizes to explain the results. Finally, we study the placement of a limited number of interlinks by greedy heuristics, using the Fiedler vector components of each layer.","Tavasoli, Ali; Ardjmand, Ehsan; Shakeri, Heman",,592,12

Although many zoonotic transmissions occur on industrial-scale factory farms, public discussions mainly blame wild animal (""wet"") markets or focus on reactionary solutions, posing a psychological obstacle to preventing future pandemics. In two pre-registered studies early in the 2020 pandemic, we examined whether British adults fail to recognize factory farming in causing epidemics, and whether such dismissal represents motivated cognition. Cross-sectional data (Study 1, N = 302) confirmed that people blame factory farms and global meat consumption less than wild animal trade and consumption or lack of government preparedness, especially among meat-committed persons. Experimental exposure (Study 2, N = 194) to information blaming factory farms (vs. wild animal markets) produced lower endorsement of preventive solutions than of reactionary solutions, which was exacerbated among meat-committed persons. These findings suggest that people, especially those highly committed to eating meat, willfully disregard solutions targeting animal agriculture and global meat consumption to prevent future pandemics precisely because such solutions implicate their dietary habits. Better understanding motivated beliefs about the causes of and solutions to pandemics is critical for developing interventions.","Dhont, Kristof; Piazza, Jared; Hodson, Gordon",Appetite,592,16

We describe a rapidly implemented COVID-adapted diagnostic pathway to mitigate risk and maximize cancer diagnosis in patients referred with symptoms of suspected CRC. METHOD: The 'COVID-adapted pathway' integrated multiple quantitative faecal immunochemical tests (qFIT) to enrich for significant colorectal disease with judicious use of CT with oral contrast to detect gross pathology. Patients reporting 'high-risk' symptoms were triaged to qFIT+CT and the remainder underwent an initial qFIT to inform subsequent investigation. Demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected. Outcomes comprised cancer detection frequency. RESULTS: Overall, 422 patients (median age 64 years, 220 women) were triaged using this pathway. Most (84.6%) were referred as 'urgent suspicious of cancer'. Of the 422 patients, 202 (47.9%) were triaged to CT and qFIT, 211 (50.0%) to qFIT only, eight (1.9%) to outpatient clinic and one to colonoscopy. Fifteen (3.6%) declined investigation and seven (1.7%) were deemed unfit. We detected 13 cancers (3.1%), similar to the mean cancer detection rate from all referrals in 2017-2019 (3.3%). Compared with the period 1 April-31 May in 2017-2019, we observed a 43% reduction in all primary care referrals (1071 referrals expected reducing to 609). CONCLUSION: This COVID-adapted pathway mitigated the adverse effects on diagnostic capacity and detected cancer at the expected rate within those referred. However, the overall reduction in the number of referrals was substantial. The described risk-mitigating measures could be a useful adjunct whilst standard diagnostic services remain constrained due to the ongoing pandemic.","Miller, Janice; Maeda, Yasuko; Au, Stephanie; Gunn, Frances; Porteous, Lorna; Pattenden, Rebecca; MacLean, Peter; Noble, Colin L; Glancy, Stephen; Dunlop, Malcolm G; Din, Farhat V N",Colorectal dis,592,26

In some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. High serum levels of IL-6, IL-10 and an immune hyperresponsiveness referred to as a 'cytokine storm' have been associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite the large numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, information on the phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is limited. Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with 'common cold' coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.","Weiskopf, Daniela; Schmitz, Katharina S; Raadsen, Matthijs P; Grifoni, Alba; Okba, Nisreen M A; Endeman, Henrik; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Molenkamp, Richard; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Gorp, Eric C M; Haagmans, Bart L; de Swart, Rik L; Sette, Alessandro; de Vries, Rory D",Sci. immunol,592,16

Since a majority of the SARS-CoV-2 deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a strategy to mitigate the same could save countless lives. Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5. However, targeting a single cytokine with an expensive monoclonal antibody could be a less pragmatic approach. We propose the use of cyclophosphamide as an immunomodulator, given its proven role in various settings including autoimmune diseases, and in the post-haploidentical stem cell transplant. Cyclophosphamide could deplete cytotoxic and effector T cell populations while relatively sparing the regulatory T cells (Tregs). Cyclophosphamide could tip the balance away from the overtly pro-inflammatory and could be a less expensive and effective alternative to the currently investigated monoclonal antibodies.","Revannasiddaiah, Swaroop; Kumar Devadas, Santhosh; Palassery, Rasmi; Kumar Pant, Nirdosh; Maka, Vinayak V",Med Hypotheses,592,20

Academic medical centers and the major cardiology organizations responded to a global call to end racism with bold statements and initiatives. Interventional cardiologists utilize advanced equipment to mechanically treat a wide spectrum of heart problems, yet this technology has not been applied in an equitable manner. Interventional therapies are often underutilized in Blacks, exacerbating healthcare disparities and contributing to the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities.

Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19 disease or COVID-19 pneumonia. SEARCH METHODS: On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID-19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 disease and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta-analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID-19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID-19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID-19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self-isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.","Struyf, Thomas; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Davenport, Clare; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Spijker, René; Hooft, Lotty; Emperador, Devy; Dittrich, Sabine; Domen, Julie; Horn, Sebastiaan R A; Van den Bruel, Ann",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,592,1

DESCRIPTION: The Florida Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Initiative funds perinatal home visiting for pregnant women and families with infants throughout the state. Florida MIECHV has shown resilience to disasters and times of crises in the past, while generating a culture of adaptation and continuous quality improvement among local implementing agencies. Florida MIECHV responded to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis within the first few days of the first reported case in Florida by providing guidance on virtual home visits and working remotely. ASSESSMENT: Findings highlight the role of administrative leadership and communication, staff willingness/morale, logistical considerations, and the needs of enrolled families who face hardships during the pandemic such as job loss, limited supplies, food insecurity, technology limitations, and stress. Home visitors support enrolled families by connecting them with resources, providing public health education and delivering evidence-based home visiting curricula virtually. They also recognized the emotional burden surrounding COVID-19 impacts and uncertainties along with achieving work-life balance by caring for their own children. CONCLUSION: This evaluation helped in understanding the impact of the pandemic on this maternal and child health program and fundamentals of transition to virtual home visiting services. Virtual home visiting appears to be feasible and provides an essential connection to supports for families who may not otherwise have the means or knowledge to access them.","Marshall, Jennifer; Kihlström, Laura; Buro, Acadia; Chandran, Vidya; Prieto, Concha; Stein-Elger, Rafaella; Koeut-Futch, Keryden; Parish, Allison; Hood, Katie",Matern Child Health J,592,23

This study aimed to characterize the prevalence, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of feeding intolerance in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We examined 323 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Massachusetts General Hospital between March 11 and June 28, 2020 who received enteral nutrition. Systematic chart review determined prevalence, clinical characteristics, and hospital outcomes (ICU complications, length of stay, and mortality) of feeding intolerance. RESULTS: Feeding intolerance developed in 56% of the patients and most commonly manifested as large gastric residual volumes (83.9%), abdominal distension (67.2%), and vomiting (63.9%). Length of intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), &#8805;1 GI symptom on presentation (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97), and severe obesity (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.66) were independently associated with development of feeding intolerance. Compared to feed-tolerant patients, patients with incident feeding intolerance were significantly more likely to suffer cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hematologic complications during their hospitalization. Feeding intolerance was similarly associated with poor outcomes including longer ICU stay (median [IQR] 21.5 [14-30] vs. 15 [9-22] days, P < 0.001), overall hospitalization time (median [IQR] 30.5 [19-42] vs. 24 [15-35], P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (33.9% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001). Feeding intolerance was independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.97-5.6). CONCLUSIONS: Feeding intolerance is a frequently encountered complication in critically ill COVID-19 patients in a large tertiary care experience and is associated with poor outcomes.","Liu, Rebecca; Paz, Mary; Siraj, Layla; Boyd, Taylor; Salamone, Silvia; Lite, Thúy-Lan Võ; Leung, Krystle M; Chirinos, Josue D; Shang, Helen H; Townsend, Matthew J; Rho, Junsung; Ni, Peiyun; Ranganath, Kushi; Violante, April D; Zhao, Zezhou; Silvernale, Casey; Ahmad, Imama; Krasnow, Nira A; Barnett, Erica S; Harisinghani, Mukesh; Kuo, Braden; Black, Katharine E; Staller, Kyle",Clin. nutr.

Official names have been announced for the novel human coronavirus responsible for the pneumonia outbreak in China, and the disease it causes has been announced Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite great efforts worldwide to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the spread of the virus has recently reached a pandemic. Currently, infection prevention and control of this virus are the primary concerns for public health officials and professionals. In this review, the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential treatment options of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and the possible reasons for milder presentations of COVID-19 in children than in adults were discussed to provide an insight into the further characterization of COVID-19 in children. Evidence Acquisition: The most recent evidence about the clinical features and potential reasons for the non-susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been provided in the present narrative review. A systematic search was performed in some databases/search engines, including ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Then, the relevant published articles were reviewed. The keywords utilized for finding related articles were Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pediatric, COVID-19, treatment, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), clinical feature, coronavirus, and pneumonia. Results: Based on the findings, respiratory infections caused by the virus are more frequent in children aged five years or younger than in other age groups. However, the currently available data suggest that COVID-19 infection in children seems to be uncommon. Moreover, in the case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the disease presentation is frequently milder than in adults and the overall burden in children was reported to be relatively low. Conclusions: Several explanations have been suggested to justify the milder symptoms in children than in adults, including differences in immunity systems of children and adults and differences in ACE2 expression as a receptor for virus attachment. Moreover, while children tend to present mild symptoms of infection, their role in the spread of the disease in the community should not be ignored.","Moghadam, Solmaz Ohadian; Afshar, Davoud",Arch.

This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available.","Sapp, John L; Alqarawi, Wael; MacIntyre, Ciorsti J; Tadros, Rafik; Steinberg, Christian; Roberts, Jason D; Laksman, Zachary; Healey, Jeff S; Krahn, Andrew D",Can J Cardiol,592,16

Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from blood-derived DNA genotyping, are structural somatic variants associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality3-11. Whether mCAs represent independent risk factors for infection is unknown. Here we use genome-wide genotyping of blood DNA to show that mCAs predispose to diverse infectious diseases. We analyzed mCAs from 767,891 individuals without hematological cancer at DNA acquisition across four countries. Expanded mCA (cell fraction >10%) prevalence approached 4% by 60 years of age and was associated with diverse incident infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. A genome-wide association study of expanded mCAs identified 63 significant loci.

METHODS: Cross sectional survey data was collected from 2,068 parents in the Northeastern US. Parents reported personal and household experiences of COVID-19 stressors, their level of distress, and use of neglectful parenting and discipline practices for a randomly selected child in their home. Analyses estimated rates of COVID-19 related stress and parenting practices. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of COVID-19 stress to parenting behaviors. RESULTS: Individual and household stressor level, as well as distress were each positively associated with likelihood of neglect. Personal exposure to stressors was minimally related to discipline, but household stressor level and parents' distress were positively associated with harsh and positive discipline. DISCUSSION: Indicators of COVID-19 stress (e.g., exposure to stressors and distress) each uniquely predicted parents' use of neglect, particularly physical and family-based sub-types, and use of harsh and positive discipline practices. Results suggest that parents may require additional support to provide appropriate care for their children while coping with the increased rates of stress associated with the pandemic and the resulting public health response.","Connell, Christian M; Strambler, Michael J",Child Maltreat,592,16

RT-qPCR has become the diagnostic standard for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in most countries. COVID-19 diagnosis generally relies upon RT-qPCR-mediated identification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, which is costly, labor-extensive, and requires specialized training and equipment. Herein, we established a novel one-tube rapid diagnostic approach based upon formamide and colorimetric RT-LAMP (One-Pot RT-LAMP) that can be used to diagnose COVID-19 without the extraction of specific viral RNA. The technique could visually detect SARS-CoV-2 within 45 min with a limit of detection of 5 copies per reaction in extracted RNA, and about 7.66 virus copies per µL in viral transport medium. The One-Pot RT-LAMP test showed a high specificity without cross-reactivity with 12 viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human infectious influenza virus (H1N1/H3N2 of influenza A and B virus, ect. We validated this One-Pot RT-LAMP approach by its successful use for the analysis of 45 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples, yielding results identical to those of traditional RT-qPCR analyses, while achieving good selectivity and sensitivity relative to a commercial RT-qPCR approach. As such, this One-Pot RT-LAMP technology may be a valid means of conducting high-sensitivity, low-cost and rapid SARS-CoV-2 identification without the extraction of viral RNA.","Li, Junmin; Hu, Xuejiao; Wang, Xiaoming; Yang, Jianing; Zhang, Lei; Deng, Qianyun; Zhang, Xiqin; Wang, Zixia; Hou, Tieying; Li, Shan",Anal Chim Acta,592,22

METHODS: This was a descriptive study focusing on year 2017, having as main source the Brazilian Ministry of Health's hospital information system. Child hospitalizations were considered to encompass those of individuals under 13 years of age whose main diagnosis was included in Chapter V of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10). RESULTS: The most prevalent diagnostic group was F10-F19, with 24.1% (21.8-26.3), followed by groups F30-39, F80-F89, F90-F99, F20-F29, with no statistical difference among them. Hospitalizations occurred more frequently in non-psychiatric hospitals, with 93.1% (91.7-94.4); most hospitalizations lasted for up to one week - 75.5% (73.2-77.8). The national hospitalization rate was 4.3 (4.1-4.5)/100,000, showing variations according to macro-regions. The highest rate was found in the South macro-region and the lowest in the Northeast, with values of 10.9 (9.9-12.0)/100,000 and 1.9 (1.6-2.2)/100,000, respectively. Intermediate values were found in the other macro-regions. CONCLUSION: Some specificities of the characteristics of hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons in this age group could be attested, as well as important variations in their occurrence among the different macro-regions of the country.","Souza, Maximiliano Loiola Ponte de; Lima, Rossano Cabral",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,592,16

This work considers the offline identification of partially observed nonlinear systems. We empirically show that the certainty-equivalent approximation to expectation-maximization can be a reliable and scalable approach for high-dimensional deterministic systems, which are common in robotics. We formulate certainty-equivalent expectation-maximization as block coordinate-ascent, and provide an efficient implementation. The algorithm is tested on a simulated system of coupled Lorenz attractors, demonstrating its ability to identify high-dimensional systems that can be intractable for particle-based approaches. Our approach is also used to identify the dynamics of an aerobatic helicopter. By augmenting the state with unobserved fluid states, a model is learned that predicts the acceleration of the helicopter better than state-of-the-art approaches.

Urban spaces often became off-limits and depopulated, filled with borders isolating people confined at home. Nevertheless, in these trying times new forms of urban gamification surfaced, allowing citizens to engage their surroundings playfully, to connect with others and to escape these dire situations. In this paper, we propose an overview of the many playful activities that emerged in the cities hit by the pandemic, organised according to the urban borders they engage (windows, balconies, rooftops). We then focus on how several borders can be engaged by the same play practice, through a gamified application called Window Expeditions, which aims at participatory data generation, while addressing some of the issues related to isolation and reduced mobility of its users. In the conclusions, we discuss the potential role of urban gamification during the pandemic and, in particular, its ability to comfort, connect, increase curiosity and encourage exploration.

The public were advised to avoid unnecessary hospital attendances and health professionals were advised to avoid aerosol-generating procedures wherever possible. The authors hypothesised that these measures would result in a reduction in the number of patients presenting to hospital with acute appendicitis and alter treatment choices. METHODS: A multicentred, prospective observational study was undertaken during April 2020 to identify adults treated for acute appendicitis. Searches of operative and radiological records were performed to identify patients treated during April 2018 and April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were treated for acute appendicitis pre-lockdown compared with 64 patients treated during lockdown. Patients treated during the pandemic were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (p = 0.049) and to have delayed their presentation to hospital (2 versus 3 days, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, the use of computed tomography (CT) increased from 36.3% to 85.9% (p < 0.001), the use of an antibiotic-only approach increased from 6.2% to 40.6% (p < 0.001) and the rate of laparoscopic appendicectomy reduced from 85.3% to 17.2% (p < 0.001). The negative appendicectomy rate decreased from 21.7% to 7.1% during lockdown (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis and a significant shift in the management approach. The increased use of CT allows the identification of simple appendicitis for conservative treatment and decreases the negative appendicectomy rate.","Mowbray, N G; Hurt, L; Powell-Chandler, A; Reeves, N; Chandler, S; Walters, E; Cornish, J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,592,26

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 pneumonia (n=405) and H1N1 influenza pneumonia (n=78), retrospectively. All patients were confirmed by RT-PCR. Four hundred and five cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were confirmed in nine hospitals of Zhejiang province, China from January 21 to February 20, 2020. Seventy-eight cases of H1N1 influenza pneumonia were confirmed in our hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 29, 2020. Their clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and CT imaging characteristics were compared. RESULTS: COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed less proportions of underlying diseases, fever and respiratory symptoms than those of H1N1 pneumonia patients (p<0.01). White blood cell count, neutrophilic granulocyte percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase in H1N1 pneumonia patients were higher than those of COVID-19 pneumonia patients (p<0.05). H1N1 pneumonia was often symmetrically located in the dorsal part of inferior lung lobes, while COVID-19 pneumonia was unusually showed as a peripheral but non-specific lobe distribution. Ground glass opacity was more common in COVID-19 pneumonia and consolidation lesions were more common in H1N1 pneumonia (p<0.01). COVID-19 pneumonia lesions showed a relatively clear margin compared with H1N1 pneumonia. Crazy-paving pattern, thickening vessels, reversed halo sign and early fibrotic lesions were more common in COVID-19 pneumonia than H1N1 pneumonia (p<0.05). Pleural effusion in COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly less common than H1N1 pneumonia (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with H1N1 pneumonia in Zhejiang, China, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia were more concealed with less underlying diseases and slighter respiratory symptoms.

RESULTS: There was a 55 per cent decrease in referrals but diagnostic yield rose from 2.9 per cent in January to 8.06 per cent in April. In both months, 100 per cent of patients met the 31- and 62-day targets, with similar 14-day wait time success (97.83 per cent for January vs 98.33 per cent for April). Referrals for laryngopharyngeal reflux rose from 27.5 per cent to 41.9 per cent. Referrals for those aged over 60 years fell from 42 per cent to 26 per cent. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that further research be conducted into the reasons why fewer patients were referred, particularly elderly patients, and why laryngopharyngeal reflux is so prevalent in fast-track referrals.","Taylor, R; Omakobia, E; Sood, S; Glore, R J",J Laryngol Otol,592,20

A deliberative study,15.943232,4.7144985,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It emerged as a global pandemic in early 2020, affecting more than 200 countries and territories. The infection is highly contagious, with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children. It spreads through person-to-person contact via aerosol and droplets. The practice of social distancing-maintaining a distance of 1-2 m or 6 ft-between people has been recommended widely to slow or halt the spread. In orthodontics, this distance is difficult to maintain, which places orthodontists at a high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection. The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during the disease crisis. This review should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control, and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March 2020 using COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19 2020), PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics. RESULTS: This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures. Compliance with the highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak. Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines are required. CONCLUSIONS: Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within orthodontic settings. Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists, and the disease is still emerging. Further studies are required.","Turkistani, Khadijah A",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,592,16

The search for earth-abundant alternatives is usually limited by the time required to screen new catalyst combinations; however, here, we utilize newly designed and developed high-throughput photoreactors for the parallel synthesis of novel WRCs and colorimetric screening of hydrogen evolution. This unique approach allowed rapid optimization of photocatalytic water reduction using the organic photosensitizer Eosin Y and the archetypal cobaloxime WRC [Co(GL1)2pyCl], where GL1 is dimethylglyoxime and py is pyridine. Subsequent combinatorial synthesis generated 646 unique cobalt complexes of the type [Co(LL)2pyCl], where LL is a bidentate ligand, that identified promising new WRC candidates for hydrogen production. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed on such cobaloxime derivative complexes demonstrated that reactivity depends on hydride affinity.

An abrupt halt in the majority of the urban activities reduced the generation of anthropogenic heat which often exacerbates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in the urban pockets of the country. We studied the lockdown impact on seven highly populated and polluted mega urban agglomerations across India, namely Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, using near-anniversary Landsat 8 data. The results revealed that the lockdowns have improved the air quality and reduced the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and hence the UHI effect over these cities. Each of the cities experienced an improved Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 18 to 151 units except Chennai (with a marginal 8 units increase in AQI), a decrease in mean LST in the range of 0.27 °C to 7.06 °C except Kolkata which showed an increment by â¼4 °C, and a reduction in daily averaged air temperature ranging from 0.3 °C to 10.88 °C except Hyderabad which witnessed an increase of 0.09 °C during the lockdown (April 2020) compared to the previous years (April 2019 and 2018). Delhi exhibited the maximum positive impact of the lockdown in all aspects with two-fold improved air quality, and Ahmedabad showed the least improvement. In addition to the variations in regional land use and land cover and proportion of essential industries that remained operational throughout the lockdown, the geographic location, topography, local meteorology and climate were some of the other factors also responsible for either aiding or overcompensating the large scale LST variabilities observed in these cities. These results hint at an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of periodic planned lockdowns as a possible mitigating measure to reduce LST spikes and degraded air quality in urban areas in the future.","Nanda, Dhruv; Mishra, Deepk R; Swain, Debadatta",Environ Sci Process Impacts,592,24

No data exist on this topic. We, therefore, aimed to examine the risk of severe respiratory infection in children after pulmonary resection. METHODS: A chart review was conducted on all pediatric patients who underwent pulmonary resection between August 1st, 2009 and January 31st, 2019. Collected data included patient characteristics, operation, complications and any admission for respiratory infection. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Resections included lobectomy (45.6%), segmentectomy (14.0%), and wedge resection (40.4%). Twelve (21.1%) were immunocompromised and 6 (10.5%) had post-operative complications. Within 1 year of surgery, 2 (3.5%) patients were hospitalized for a viral upper respiratory illness (URI), 1 (1.8%) for bacterial pneumonia, and none due to influenza. CONCLUSION: In the general pediatric population, the risk of admission for respiratory illness is 3-21%. At this institution, overall risk of respiratory infection after lung resection appears comparable to baseline community risk.

To conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in the United States, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) was created using the existing infrastructure of the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) (4) and the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET). This report presents age-stratified COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates for patients admitted during March 1-28, 2020, and clinical data on patients admitted during March 1-30, 2020, the first month of U.S. surveillance. Among 1,482 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 74.5% were aged &#8805;50 years, and 54.4% were male. The hospitalization rate among patients identified through COVID-NET during this 4-week period was 4.6 per 100,000 population. Rates were highest (13.8) among adults aged &#8805;65 years. Among 178 (12%) adult patients with data on underlying conditions as of March 30, 2020, 89.3% had one or more underlying conditions; the most common were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%). These findings suggest that older adults have elevated rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and the majority of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions. These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain) to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public. In addition, older adults and persons with serious underlying medical conditions should avoid contact with persons who are ill and immediately contact their health care provider(s) if they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) (5).

The unplanned lockdown imposed by the Indian government affected paddy transplantation, a labour-intensive activity in Punjab primarily due to interstate restrictions on movement. Drawing on a primary survey in a village from the Malwa region of Punjab, the paper examines the changes in agrarian relations in rural Punjab due to the Covid-19 pandemic by critically analysing the dynamics of capital labour relations. The restriction on labour movement and unilateral imposition of transplantation wage rates by a few Panchayats in Punjab (dominated by capitalist landlords and rich peasants) has intensified class conflict in the state. The Punjab government's policies, which are driven by the capitalist landlords and rich peasants, have played a significant role in the increased exploitation of workers. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the changes induced by Covid-19 in the agrarian political economy of Punjab.","Kaur, Navpreet Kaur Amanpreet",Journal of Agrarian Change,592,16

Current literature suggests minimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 manifestations appear similar between pregnant and nonpregnant women. We present a case of placental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus in a woman with mild COVID-19 disease, then review the literature. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed with specific monoclonal antibodies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen or to identify trophoblasts. A 29-year-old multigravida presented at 40-4/7 weeks for labor induction. With myalgias 2 days prior, she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate maternal vascular malperfusion, with no fetal vascular malperfusion, as well as SARS-CoV-2 virus in chorionic villi endothelial cells, and also rarely in trophoblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of placental SARS-CoV-2 despite mild COVID-19 disease (no symptoms of COVID-19 aside from myalgias); patient had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath, but only myalgias and sick contacts. Despite her mild COVID-19 disease in pregnancy, we demonstrate placental vasculopathy and presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus across the placenta. Evidence of placental COVID-19 raises concern for placental vasculopathy (potentially leading to fetal growth restriction and other pregnancy complications) and possible vertical transmission-especially for pregnant women who may be exposed to COVID-19 in early pregnancy. This raises important questions of whether future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions, such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms, increased antenatal surveillance, and possibly routine COVID-19 testing throughout pregnancy.","Hsu, Albert L; Guan, Minhui; Johannesen, Eric; Stephens, Amanda J; Khaleel, Nabila; Kagan, Nikki; Tuhlei, Breanna C; Wan, Xiu-Feng",J. med. virol,592,24

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the short-term effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, staging, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden on newly diagnosed PCa cases and on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed between 18 March 2020 and 2 June 2020 were compared with those in the corresponding time periods in 2017-2019, as reported until January 31 of the year after each study period. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, 36% fewer PCa cases were registered in NPCR compared with the corresponding time period in previous years: 1458 cases in 2020 vs a mean of 2285 cases in 2017-2019. The decrease in new PCa registrations was more pronounced in men above age 75 years, down 51%, than in men aged 70-75, down 37%, and in men below age 70, down 28%. There was no decrease in the number of radical prostatectomies and number of radical radiotherapy courses increased by 32%.

However, in about 20% of patients, the infection progresses to severe interstitial pneumonia and can induce an uncontrolled host-immune response, leading to a life-threatening condition called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS represents an emergency scenario of a frequent challenge, which is the complex and interwoven link between infections and autoimmunity. Indeed, treatment of CRS involves the use of both antivirals to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressive agents to dampen the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the host. Several trials, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in rheumatic diseases, are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 and CRS, some of which are achieving promising results. However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient's clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results. Autoimmune patients receiving immunosuppressants could be prone to SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, suspension of the ongoing therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and a consequent increase in the infection risk.","Picchianti Diamanti, Andrea; Rosado, Maria Manuela; Pioli, Claudio; Sesti, Giorgio; Laganà, Bruno",,592,16

There are some similarities in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and mustard gas in immune system disruption and pulmonary infection. SARS-CoV-2 and mustard gas inducing oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, cytokine storm, and overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor in lungs that act as functional entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, Iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure are more susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-19. It is suggested that the principles of COVID-19 infection prevention and control be adhered to more stringently in Iranian survivors of mustard gas exposure than others who have not been exposed to mustard gas. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the different pathologic aspects of lung injury caused by mustard gas and also the relationship between this damage and the increased susceptibility of Iranian mustard gas exposed survivors to COVID-19.","Farnoosh, Gholamreza; Ghanei, Mostafa; Khorramdelazad, Hossein; Alishiri, Gholamhossein; Jalali Farahani, Alireza; Shahriary, Alireza; Hosseini Zijoud, Seyed Reza",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,592,20

METHODS: This is a county-level population-based study using a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was July 12-October 6, 2020. We included 73 out of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollment statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 residents at the county level. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest (ß) is estimated at 3.36 (95% CI: 1.91-4.81; p < 0.001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages. CONCLUSION: In-person primary and secondary school is associated with a statistically significant but proportionally small increase in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 cases.","Bosslet, Gabriel T; Pollak, Micah; Jang, Jeong Hoon; Roll, Rebekah; Sperling, Mark; Khan, Babar",Clin. infect. dis,592,8

This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.","Nie, Xue-Dan; Wang, Qin; Wang, Min-Nan; Zhao, Shuai; Liu, Lei; Zhu, Yu-Lan; Chen, Hong",Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract,592,16

In this study we generated a rabbit MAb (RAb) detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP), which has cross-reaction with SARS-CoV-1 NP, but not with NPs of MERS and common human CoVs (OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1). With truncated NP fragments and synthesized peptides, the linear epitope detected by RAb was mapped in peptide N4-8, 393-407 amino acid residue (TLLPAADLDDFSKQL) of SARS-CoV-2 NP. This epitope N4-8 was highly conserved in SARSr-CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and bat CoV RaTG13 strain. However, the corresponding peptide of bat SARSr-CoV BtKY72 strain could not be recognized by RAb, which indicates amino acid D399 may be critical for N4-8 epitope detected by RAb.

Indeed, the presence of physical frailty has recently led to higher mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, no longitudinal studies have investigated the role of neuropsychogeriatric factors associated with lockdown fatigue in healthy cognitive aging. Eighty-one healthy older adults were evaluated for their neuropsychological characteristics, including physical frailty, before the pandemic (T0). Subsequently, 50 of them agreed to be interviewed and neuropsychologically re-assessed during the lockdown (T1) and immediately after it (T2). Moreover, during another home confinement, they performed a psychological screening (T3) to evaluate possible mood changes and fatigue. According to Fried's frailty criteria, at T0, 63% of the sample was robust, 34.5% pre-frail, and only 2.5% frail. Significantly, these subjects presented a decrease in handgrip strength and walking speed (29.6 and 6.1%, respectively). Results from Principal Component Analyses and multiple regression models highlighted the contribution of ""cognitive"" and ""psychological"" factors (i.e., attentive-executive performance and mood deflections) in explaining handgrip strength and gait speed. At T3, lockdown fatigue was explained by higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and lower scores on the Trail Making Test part A. Results from a moderated-mediation model showed that the effect of psychomotor speed on lockdown fatigue was mediated by depression, with a moderating effect of gait speed. Our findings highlight the complex interrelationship between cognitive, psychological, and physical factors in the emergence of pandemic fatigue in a carefully selected older population.","Amanzio, M.; Canessa, N.; Bartoli, M.; Cipriani, G.

In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections. First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk. Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on S. pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy). Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication. Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate.

Although nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) remains the gold standard for detecting and theoretically quantifying SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in various specimen types, antigen assays may be considered a suitable alternative, under specific circumstances. Rapid antigen tests are meant to detect viral antigen proteins in biological specimens (e.g. nasal, nasopharyngeal, saliva), to indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We explored the self-reported immunity to varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella, reasons for receiving the influenza vaccine or not, and opinions on vaccination of HCWs against varicella, MMR, pertussis, diphtheria, and influenza among staff from departments with a high risk of exposure to infectious agents. METHODS: From May 2019 to August 2019, a structured questionnaire was distributed to clinical and non-clinical HCWs at a tertiary and a general paediatric department in Denmark. Self-reported immunity was defined as either previous infection or vaccination against the disease. RESULTS: Of 619 employed HCWs, 555 (90%) were included. A large proportion were unsure of or denied previous vaccination or infection with measles (20.1%), mumps (30.2%), rubella (21.4%), varicella (12.1%), pertussis (44.1%), and diphtheria (32.1%). Non-clinical personnel and employees born in 1974-1983 had the lowest level of self-reported immunity. Mandatory vaccination of non-immune HCWs was approved by 54-68.9% of participants, and any kind of vaccination (mandatory or as an offer at hospitals) was approved of up to 95.3% of all participants depending on the disease. During the season 2018/19, 214 (38.6%) HCWs received the influenza vaccine, including 20.3% of non-clinical staff, 34.8% of nurses and 56.5% of doctors (Pâ¯<â¯0.001). Reasons for lack of vaccine uptake were mainly employees considering themselves rarely sick, the vaccine was not regarded as necessary, forgetfulness or lack of time. Only 37.8% was in favour of mandatory influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of paediatric HCWs were not aware of their immune status against important vaccine-preventable diseases. >90% supported vaccination of HCWs, with two out of three supporting mandatory MMR, pertussis and diphtheria vaccination. Better information and an official immunisation policy of non-immune HCWs in Denmark is warranted.","von Linstow, Marie-Louise; Nordmann Winther, Thilde; Eltvedt, Anna; Bybeck Nielsen, Allan; Yde Nielsen, Alex; Poulsen, Anja",Vaccine,592,30

Our hospital was immediately closed and re-opened after 15 days as a reference Covid Hospital. Among services involved in a process of destruction and rebirth there was also the Vascular Access Team. METHODS: We analyzed our Vascular Access Team activity comparing data from the first month (March) in which basically it did not work and data from the following month (April) in which we began to re-build the Team adapting it to the new reality. RESULTS: In all patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit a Centrally Inserted Central Catheter multilumen was placed, but in March only 5.5% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit had a catheter different from the short peripheral cannula while in April it was possible to guarantee a more suitable catheter 31.7% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (p < 0.000). In April, compared to March, a significant higher number of Midline were implanted in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (36/139 vs 12/238 p < 0.000) where also a higher number of Centrally Inserted Central Catheter and Femoral Inserted Central Catheter were implanted (8/139 vs 1/238 p = 0.003). This change allowed us to implant more vascular accesses in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit favoring Midline with a longer average duration. Only one patient with Midline developed a catheter vein thrombosis, and in only one patient the device was removed for suspected infection. CONCLUSIONS: The experience we gained will allow us to be more prepared in the future and our experience has highlighted that a structured Vascular Access Team is necessary to respond adequately to COVID-19 patients' needs, to ensure the effectiveness of the maneuver, to reduce complications and to avoid the waste of resources, always working in safe condition.","Deganello, Elisa; Gastaldo, Francesco; Masiero, Sonia; Fasson, Milena; Colopi, Riccardo Ivan; Girotto, Luciano; Monticelli, Jacopo; Marcante, Elena; Furlan, Patrizia; Baldo, Vincenzo; Pilerci, Claudio; Realdon, Piero; Montemurro, Domenico; Rigo, Alberto; Benini, Patrizia; Baratto, Fabio",J Vasc Access,592,1

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent [Formula: see text] queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","Furman, Eugene; Cressman, Alex; Shin, Saeha; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Razak, Fahad; Verma, Amol; Diamant, Adam",Health Care Manag Sci,592,27

The International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) has taken upon itself the task of providing guidance and best practice policies for all practicing gynaecological endoscopists. Factors affecting decision making processes in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) vary depending on factors such as the phase of the pandemic, policies on control and prevention, expertise and existing infrastructure. Our responsibility remains ensuring the safety of all health care providers, ancillary staff and patients during this unusual period. We reviewed the current literature related to gynecological and endoscopic surgery during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) crisis. Regarding elective surgery, universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out wherever possible 40 h prior to surgery. In case of confirmed positive case of SARS-CoV-2, surgery should be delayed. Priority should be given to relatively urgent cases such as malignancies. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for benign non-life-threatening surgeries. When possible, we recommend to perform cases by laparoscopy and to allow early discharges. Any procedure with risk of bowel involvement should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) in stool. Regarding urgent surgery, each unit should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Patients should be screened for symptoms and symptomatic patients must be tested. In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases. We recommend to avoid intubation and ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized. Patients who screen or test negative may have general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery while strict protocols of infection control are upheld. Surgery in screen-positive as well as SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that cannot be safely postponed should be undertaken with full PPE with ensuring that only essential personnel are exposed. If available, negative pressure theatres should be used for patients who are positive or screen high risk. During open and vaginal procedures, suction can be used to minimize droplet and bioaerosol spread. In a patient who screens low risk or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered. We recommend, during minimal access surgeries, to use strategies to reduce production of bioaerosols (such as minimal use of energy, experienced surgeon), to reduce leakage of smoke aerosols (for example, minimizing the number of ports used and size of incisions, as well as reducing the operating pressures) and to promote safe elimination of smoke during surgery and during the ports' closure (such as using gas filters and smoke evacuation systems). During the post-peak period of pandemic, debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. In conclusion, based on the existent evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international trends favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis, recognizing the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries.","Thomas, Viju; Maillard, Charlotte; Barnard, Annelize; Snyman, Leon; Chrysostomou, Andreas; Shimange-Matsose, Lusandolwethu; Van Herendael, Bruno",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,592,24

However, its effects on pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have not been clarified yet. LILRA3 is mainly expressed in monocytes, whereas its effects on biological behaviors of monocytes have not been systematically reported. To investigate the association between LILRA3 polymorphism and IBD susceptibility, LILRA3 polymorphism was assessed in 378 IBD patients and 509 healthy controls in our study, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to detect the LILRA3 expression in IBD patient blood and intestinal samples. Human U937 monocyte cell line was employed to establish LILRA3-overexpressing cells and the effects of LILRA3 on the biological behaviors of U937 cells were systematically explored. Despite no association of the polymorphism with IBD development was found, LILRA3 expression was markedly increased in IBD patients compared with healthy controls. Overexpression of LILRA3 in monocytes led to significant decreases in secretion of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Additionally, LILRA3 abated monocyte migration by reducing the expression of several chemokines and enhanced monocyte phagocytosis by increasing CD36 expression. Furthermore, LILRA3 promoted monocyte proliferation through a combination of Akt and MEK/Erk signaling pathways. We report for the first time that LILRA3 is related to IBD and functions as an anti-inflammatory modulator in U937 cells.","Lan, Xiucai; Liu, Fenghua; Ma, Jiaming; Chang, Ying; Lan, Xiuhua; Xiang, Li; Shen, Xizhong; Zhou, Feng; Zhao, Qiu",Clin. exp. immunol,592,30

We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of heme metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD harbors a dominant epitope, access to which can be controlled by an allosteric mechanism that is regulated through recruitment of a metabolite.","Rosa, Annachiara; Pye, Valerie E; Graham, Carl; Muir, Luke; Seow, Jeffrey; Ng, Kevin W; Cook, Nicola J; Rees-Spear, Chloe; Parker, Eleanor; Dos Santos, Mariana Silva; Rosadas, Carolina; Susana, Alberto; Rhys, Hefin; Nans, Andrea; Masino, Laura; Roustan, Chloe; Christodoulou, Evangelos; Ulferts, Rachel; Wrobel, Antoni G; Short, Charlotte-Eve; Fertleman, Michael; Sanders, Rogier W; Heaney, Judith; Spyer, Moira; Kjær, Svend; Riddell, Andy; Malim, Michael H; Beale, Rupert; MacRae, James I; Taylor, Graham P; Nastouli, Eleni; van Gils, Marit J; Rosenthal, Peter B; Pizzato, Massimo; McClure, Myra O; Tedder, Richard S; Kassiotis, George; McCoy, Laura E; Doores, Katie J; Cherepanov, Peter",Sci.

To account for the endogeneity of many of these variables, and the possibility of correlated latent (unobservable) country characteristics, I estimate a four structural model of the evolution of case growth rates, death growth rates, average changes in mobility and the determination of the severity of NPIs. There are strongly decreasing returns to the stringency of NPIs, especially for extreme lockdowns, as no significant improvement in the main outcome measures is found beyond NPIs corresponding to a Stringency Index range of 51-60 for cases and 41-50 for deaths. A non-restrictive policy of extensive and open testing has half of the impact on pandemic dynamics as the optimal NPIs, with none of the associated social and economic costs resulting from the latter. Decreases in mobility were found to increase, rather than decrease case growth rates, consistent with arguments that within-household transmission-resulting from spending more time at residences due to mobility restrictions-may outweigh the benefits of reduced community transmission. Vaccinations led to a fall in case and death growth rates, however the effect size must be re-evaluated when more data becomes available. Governments conditioned policy choice on recent pandemic dynamics, and were found to de-escalate the associated stringency of implemented NPIs more cautiously than in their escalation, i.e., policy mixes exhibited significant hysteresis. Finally, at least 90% of the maximum effectiveness of NPIs can be achieved by policies with an average Stringency index of 31-40, without restricting internal movement or imposing stay at home measures, and only recommending (not enforcing) closures on workplaces and schools, accompanied by public informational campaigns. Consequently, the positive effects on case and death growth rates of voluntary behavioral changes in response to beliefs about the severity of the pandemic, generally trumped those arising from mandatory behavioral restrictions. The exception being more stringent mandatory restrictions on gatherings and international movement, which were found to be effective. The findings suggest that further work should be directed at re-evaluating the effectiveness of NPIs, particularly towards empirically determining the optimal policy mix and associated stringency of individual NPIs.","Spiliopoulos, Leonidas",,592,16

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals' perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.","Farooq, Ali; Laato, Samuli; Islam, A K M Najmul",J Med Internet Res,592,16

The aim of this work is to point out various factors affecting the potential of myostatin as a biomarker of muscle wasting. Based on the literature review, we can say that recent studies produced conflicting results and revealed a number of potential confounding factors influencing their use in sarcopenia diagnosing. These factors include physiological variables (such as age, sex and physical activity) as well as a variety of disorders (including heart failure, metabolic syndrome, kidney failure and inflammatory diseases) and differences in laboratory measurement methodology. Our conclusion is that although myostatin alone might not prove to be a feasible biomarker, it could become an important part of a recently proposed panel of muscle wasting biomarkers. However, a thorough understanding of the interrelationship of these markers, as well as establishing a valid measurement methodology for myostatin and revising current research data in the light of new criteria of sarcopenia, is needed.","Baczek, Jan; Silkiewicz, Marta; Wojszel, Zyta Beata",Nutrients,592,25

Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. SETTING: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. POPULATIONS: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. RESULTS: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 2152 (99.9%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 329 (15.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 305 (14.2%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 80.7 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14-1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50-2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. Ongoing studies will be needed to continue to evaluate these risks, particularly in the setting of evolving treatment guidelines.","McPadden, Jacob; Warner, Frederick; Young, H Patrick; Hurley, Nathan C; Pulk, Rebecca A; Singh, Avinainder; Durant, Thomas J S; Gong, Guannan; Desai, Nihar; Haimovich, Adrian; Taylor, Richard Andrew; Gunel, Murat; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Farhadian, Shelli F; Siner, Jonathan; Villanueva, Merceditas; Churchwell, Keith; Hsiao, Allen; Torre, Charles J; Velazquez, Eric J; Herbst, Roy S; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ko, Albert I; Mortazavi, Bobak J; Krumholz, Harlan M; Schulz, Wade L",PLoS One,592,1

However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health).","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego",JMIR Ment Health,592,23

The majority of studies published have been conducted on inpatient cases and a shortage of tests has encouraged screening only of patients with classic presentation. A positive COVID-19 case of a healthy military male, with the chief complaint of anosmia and ageusia, instigated local re-evaluation of the screening protocol for possible COVID-19 patients. Multiple studies in Europe have implicated anosmia and ageusia as symptoms associated with COVID-19, and subsequently, anosmia and ageusia have been added to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidelines as well.

Large cohort study suggested a protective potential of lipid-lowering drugs in COVID-19 outcomes, but the nature of observational study precludes it to draw a causal inference. ObjectivesTo assess the causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitors) on COVID-19 outcomes using 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study. MethodsWe used two kinds of genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of lipid-lowering drugs, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of drugs target genes, and genetic variants within or nearby drugs target genes associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWASs of COVID-19 outcomes (susceptibility, hospitalization and very severe disease) were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and inverse-variance weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to calculate the effect estimates. ResultsSMR analysis found that a higher expression of HMGCR was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.38, 95%CI=1.06-1.81; P=0.019). Similarly, IVW-MR analysis observed a positive association between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.00-1.74; P=0.049). No consistent evidence from both SMR and IVW-MR analyses was found for the association of HMGCR inhibitors with COVID-19 susceptibility or very severe disease, or for the association of PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitor with COVID-19 outcomes. ConclusionsIn this 2-sample MR study, we found potential causal evidence that HMGCR inhibitors could reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic role of statins for COVID-19.","Huang, Wuqing; Xiao, Jun; Ji, Jianguang; Chen, Liang-Wan",,592,1

However, when a similar virus spread globally triggering the COVID-19 pandemic, we were harshly reminded that several other neglected diseases might also be waiting for the perfect opportunity to become mainstream. As climate change drives urbanization, natural selection of pathogens and their intermediate vectors and reservoirs, the risk of neglected diseases emerging within a larger susceptible pool becomes an even greater threat. Availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 is widely considered the only way to end this pandemic. Similarly, vaccines are also seen as the best tools available to control the spread of neglected (sometimes referred to as emerging or re-emerging) diseases, until the water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure is improved in areas of their prevalence. Vaccine production is usually cost and labour intensive and thus minimal funding is directed towards controlling and eliminating neglected diseases (NDs). A customised but sustainable approach is needed to develop and deploy vaccines against NDs. While safety, efficacy and public trust are the three main success pillars for most vaccines, affordability is vital when formulating vaccines for neglected diseases.","Madhav, Archana; Mehrotra, Tanshi; Sinha, Pallavi; Mutreja, Ankur",Semin Immunol,592,0

However, many delays in construction projects have been occurring in recent years throughout the world because of unexpected events such as financial crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, six case studies from five companies were chosen for this work, and were supplemented with face-to-face interviews, documentation, and direct observations. This strategy allowed the research evidence to be triangulated, and thus garnered more confidence in testing a particular concept or theory. Hence, a maturity model for risk response development has been outlined and validated to achieve construction success in preconstruction and during execution.

Using multi-agent network technology and big data on population migration, this paper constructed a city-based epidemic and mobility model (CEMM) to stimulate the spatiotemporal of COVID-19. Compared with traditional models, this model is characterized by an urban network perspective and emphasizes the important role of intercity population mobility and high-speed transportation networks. The results show that the model could simulate the inter-city spread of COVID-19 at the early stage in China with high precision. Through scenario simulation, the paper quantitatively evaluated the effect of control measures ""city lockdown"" and ""decreasing population mobility"" on containing the spatial spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. According to the simulation, the total number of infectious cases in China would have climbed to 138,824 on February 2020, or 4.46 times the real number, if neither of the measures had been implemented. Overall, the containment effect of the lockdown of cities in Hubei was greater than that of decreasing intercity population mobility, and the effect of city lockdowns was more sensitive to timing relative to decreasing population mobility.","Wei, Ye; Wang, Jiaoe; Song, Wei; Xiu, Chunliang; Ma, Li; Pei, Tao",Cities,592,16

METHODS: A total of 61 patients who underwent cesarean section and had positive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 with nasopharyngeal swabs were included in the study. Patient demographics and information about anesthesia were analyzed retrospectively from the patient medical files. RESULTS: A total of 61 parturients undergoing cesarean section that had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were assessed. General anesthesia was applied to only three patients (4.9%), while spinal anesthesia was administered to the remaining 58 patients (95.1%). The incidence of hypotension was 25.9% in the spinal anesthesia group. Forty-one (67.2%) parturients were asymptomatic. While the rate of pneumonia in symptomatic patients was 45% (9/20), the pneumonia incidence among all SARS-CoV-2 PCR (+) parturients was 14% (9/61). Three (4.9%) COVID-19 patients required intensive care in the perioperative period.

The roots of this inequality predate the pandemic and even the global financial crisis. They lie rather in the uneasy relationship between labor and capital under conditions of declining economic growth, such as those who have prevailed in advanced economies for almost half a century. This paper explores the dynamics of that relationship using a simple stock-flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic model of a closed economy. It examines in particular the role of two key factors—the savings rate and the substitutability (elasticity of substitution) between labor and capital—on the severity of systemic inequality under conditions of declining growth. The paper goes on to test the efficacy of three redistributive measures—a graduated income tax, a tax on capital and a universal basic income—under two distinct structural scenarios for an economy with a declining growth rate. We find that none of these measures is sufficient to control structural inequality when institutions aggressively favor capital over labor (hyper-capitalism). Taken in combination, however, under conditions more favorable to wage labor (proto-socialism), these same measures have the potential to eliminate inequality, almost entirely, even as the growth rate declines. © 2021 The Authors.

As pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aims at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. OBJECTIVE: To understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, non-pregnant and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. METHODS: We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in one of three ways: by email, advertisement flyers and distribution of QR codes at virtual townhalls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into three mutually exclusive groups: (1) non-pregnant respondents (2) pregnant respondents and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. RESULTS: The survey was administered from January 7, 2021 to January 29, 2021 with 1,012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as Non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as Non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2) as Non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 (IQR 25-47) years. Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were non-pregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Non-pregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%, p<0.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%, p<0.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents and Spanish speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination(Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-asian races were more likely to decline vaccination compared to non-pregnant and breast-feeding respondents. Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine acceptance.","Sutton, Desmond; D039,; Alton, Mary; Zhang, Yijia; Kahe, Ka; Cepin, Ana; Goffman, Dena; Staniczenko, Anna; Yates, Hope; Burgansky, Anna; Coletta, Jaclyn; Williams, Zev; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,592,1

These may have significant implications for the management of cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a systematic review of published evidence to assess the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases and their management. METHODS: Studies that evaluated volume of hospitalisations for cardiometabolic conditions and their management with comparisons between the COVID-19 and pre-COVID periods were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and the reference list of relevant studies from January 2020 to 25 February 2021. RESULTS: We identified 103 observational studies, with most studies assessing hospitalisations for acute cardiovascular conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic strokes and heart failure. About 89% of studies reported a decline in hospitalisations during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times, with reductions ranging from 20.2 to 73%. Severe presentation, less utilization of cardiovascular procedures, and longer patient- and healthcare-related delays were common during the pandemic. Most studies reported shorter length of hospital stay during the pandemic than before the pandemic (1-8 vs 2-12 days) or no difference in length of stay. Most studies reported no change in in-hospital mortality among hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: Clinical care of patients for acute cardiovascular conditions, their management and outcomes have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be educated via population-wide approaches on the need for timely medical contact and health systems should put strategies in place to provide timely care to patients at high risk.

We develop an extension of the SEIR epidemic model that captures the effects of changes in human mobility on the spread of the disease. The parameters of the model are learned using a multitask learning approach that leverages both data on the number of deaths across a set of regions, and cellphone data on individuals' mobility patterns specific to each region. Using this model, we propose a nonlinear optimal control problem aiming to find the optimal mobility-based intervention strategy that curbs the spread of the epidemic while obeying a budget on the economic cost incurred. We also show that the solution to this nonlinear optimal control problem can be efficiently found, in polynomial time, using tools from geometric programming. Furthermore, in the absence of a straightforward mapping from human mobility data to economic costs, we propose a practical method by which a budget on economic losses incurred may be chosen to eliminate excess deaths due to over-utilization of hospital resources.

We sought to ascertain the impact of rapid isothernal nucleic acid based testing for COVID-19 in an unselected cohort of pregnant women attending our maternity unit. We also assessed the correlation between community prevalence and asymptomatic carriage. METHODS: Data for the retrospective cohort study were collected from a large UK tertiary maternity unit over a 4-week period using computerised hospital records. Literature searches were performed across multiple repositories. COVID-19 prevalence was extracted from online repositories. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 457/465 (98%) women during the study period. The median turnaround time for results was 5.3 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-8.9 h), with 92% of the results returned within 24 h. In our cohort, only one woman tested positive, giving a screen positive rate of 0.22% (1/457; 95% CI: 0.04-1.23%). One woman who tested negative developed a fever postnatally following discharge but was lost to follow-up. From our literature review, we did not find any correlation between asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women and the reported regional prevalence of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Testing using the SAMBA-II machine was acceptable to the vast majority of pregnant women requiring admission and had a low turnaround time. Asymptomatic carriage is low, but not correlated to community prevalence rates.

We assessed opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination, willingness to be vaccinated, and reasons for vaccination hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs). MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey among 3,793 HCWs in December 2020 in the Canton of Solothurn, Switzerland, before the start of the national COVID-19 vaccination campaign. ResultsMedian age was 43 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-53), 2,841 were female (74.9%). 1,511 HCWs (39.8%) reported willingness to accept vaccination, while 1,114 (29.4%) were unsure, and 1,168 (30.8%) would decline vaccination. Among medical doctors, 76.1% were willing, while only 27.8% of nurses expressed willingness. Among 1,168 HCWs who would decline vaccination, 1,073 (91.9%) expressed concerns about vaccine safety and side effects. The willingness of HCWs to be vaccinated was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.97, 95%Cl 1.71-2.27) and having been vaccinated for influenza this year (aOR 2.70, 95%Cl 2.20-3.31).

METHODS: This study was a case series conducted at a designated infectious diseases hospital. Twelve SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with partial pressure of arterial oxygen/percentage of inspired oxygen (P/F) ratio < 300 were treated with PMX-DHP on two consecutive days each during hospitalization. We defined day 1 as the first day when PMX-DHP was performed. PMX-DHP efficacy was assessed on days 7 and 14 after the first treatment based on eight categories. Subsequently, improvement in P/F ratio and urinary biomarkers on days 4 and 8, malfunctions, and ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation avoidance rates were also evaluated. RESULTS: On day 14 after the first treatment, disease severity decreased in 58.3% of the patients. P/F ratio increased while urine ß2-microglobulin decreased on days 4 and 8. Cytokine measurement pre- and post-PMX-DHP revealed decreased levels of interleukin-6 and the factors involved in vascular endothelial injury, including vascular endothelial growth factor. Twenty-two PMX-DHPs were performed, of which seven and five PMX-DHPs led to increased inlet pressure and membrane coagulation, respectively. When the membranes coagulated, the circuitry needed to be reconfigured. Circuit problems were usually observed when D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels were high before PMX-DHP. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies are expected to determine the therapeutic effect of PMX-DHP on COVID-19. Because of the relatively high risk of circuit coagulation, coagulation capacity should be assessed beforehand.","Katagiri, Daisuke; Ishikane, Masahiro; Asai, Yusuke; Izumi, Shinyu; Takasaki, Jin; Katsuoka, Hiyori; Kondo, Isao; Ide, Satoshi; Nakamura, Keiji; Nakamoto, Takato; Nomoto, Hidetoshi; Akiyama, Yutaro; Miyazato, Yusuke; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Kinoshita, Noriko; Ogawa, Tatsunori; Togano, Tomiteru; Suzuki, Manabu; Hashimoto, Masao; Sakamoto, Keita; Kusaba, Yusaku; Katsuno, Takashi; Fukaya, Takashi; Hojo, Masayuki; Sugiyama, Masaya; Mizokami, Masashi; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Kimura, Akio; Noiri, Eisei; Ohmagari, Norio; Hinoshita, Fumihiko; Sugiyama, Haruhito",,592,20

Tremendous efforts are dedicated to advance reliable and effective detection of coronaviruses. Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis mainly relies on the detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic materials by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. However, simpler and more rapid and reliable alternatives are needed to meet high demand during the pandemic. Biosensor-based diagnosis approaches become alternatives for selectively and rapidly detecting virus particles because of their biorecognition elements consisting of biomaterials that are specific to virus biomarkers. Here, we summarize biorecognition materials, including antibodies and antibody-like molecules, that are designed to recognize SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers and the advances of recently developed biosensors for COVID-19 diagnosis. The design of biorecognition materials or layers is crucial to maximize biosensing performances, such as high selectivity and sensitivity of virus detection. Additionally, the recent representative achievements in developing bioelectronics for sensing coronavirus are included. This review includes scholarly articles, mainly published in 2020 and early 2021. In addition to capturing the fast development in the fields of applied materials and biodiagnosis, the outlook of this rapidly evolving technology is summarized. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 could help prevent the spread of this contagious disease and provide significant information to medical teams to treat patients.","Limsakul, Praopim; Charupanit, Krit; Moonla, Chochanon; Jeerapan, Itthipon",Emergent Mater,592,20

We hypothesized that the regional prevalence of specific class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which shape the anti-viral immune response, might partly underlie these differences. Through an ecological approach, we analyzed whether a set of HLA alleles (A, B, C), known to be involved in the immune response against infections, correlates with COVID-19 incidence. COVID-19 data were provided by the National Civil Protection Department, whereas HLA allele prevalence was retrieved through the Italian Bone-Marrow Donors Registry. Among all the alleles, HLA-A*25, B*08, B*44, B*15:01, B*51, C*01, and C*03 showed a positive log-linear correlation with COVID-19 incidence rate fixed on 9 April 2020 in proximity of the national outbreak peak (Pearson's coefficients between 0.50 and 0.70, p-value < 0.0001), whereas HLA-B*14, B*18, and B*49 showed an inverse log-linear correlation (Pearson's coefficients between -0.47 and -0.59, p-value < 0.0001). When alleles were examined simultaneously using a multiple regression model to control for confounding factors, HLA-B*44 and C*01 were still positively and independently associated with COVID-19: a growth rate of 16% (95%CI: 0.1-35%) per 1% point increase in B*44 prevalence; and of 19% (95%CI: 1-41%) per 1% point increase in C*01 prevalence. Our epidemiologic analysis, despite the limits of the ecological approach, is strongly suggestive of a permissive role of HLA-C*01 and B*44 towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, which warrants further investigation in case-control studies. This study opens a new potential avenue for the identification of sub-populations at risk, which could provide Health Services with a tool to define more targeted clinical management strategies and priorities in vaccination campaigns.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Mutti, Luciano; Pentimalli, Francesca; Baglio, Giovanni; Saladino, Rita Emilena; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Giordano, Antonio",,592,32

This was intended to create capacity in the healthcare system to manage the pandemic. AIM OF THE WORK: To analyze whether the number of work and commuting injuries decreased during the lockdown compared to the years 2015-2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All work and commuting accidents treated at the Klinikum rechts der Isar and the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik Murnau during the observational period 16 March-4 May 2020 were retrospectively compared with the figures from the same observation period in the years 2015-2019. The data on case numbers according to the transit physician procedure (DAV) were further broken down into cases of the injury type procedure (VAV) and severe injury type procedure (SAV) according to the injury type index of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV). In addition, the collected data were compared with data from the Federal Statistical Office on the numbers of traffic accidents and traffic fatalities. RESULTS: A total of 4313 cases were considered. In 2020, the number of work and commuting accidents decreased by 31% compared to the observation period 2015-2019. VAV cases were decreased by 26% in 2020. SAV cases decreased by 5% in 2020. Road traffic accidents decreased by 17% in thre first four months in 2020 compared to the first four months in 2019. Traffic fatalities decreased by 11%. DISCUSSION: There was a 31% decrease in work and commuting accidents. This contributed to resource reallocation in the context of the pandemic. Nevertheless, almost constant numbers of severely injured patients and accidental deaths occurred, which shows the relevance of trauma surgery structures especially in times of crisis and makes it indispensable to include them in the calculation of intensive care resources.","Hoffeld, Kai; Pflüger, Patrick; Pförringer, Dominik; Hofmeister, Martin; Stuby, Fabian; Biberthaler, Peter",Unfallchirurg,592,24

While challenges associated with the COVID-19 trial landscape have been discussed previously, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to assess the reporting, design, and data sharing practices of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to gain insight into the current landscape of reporting, methodological design, and data sharing practices for COVID-19 RCTs. DATA SOURCES: We conducted three searches to identify registered clinical trials, peer-reviewed publications, and pre-print publications. STUDY SELECTION: After screening eight major trial registries and 7844 records, we identified 178 registered trials and 38 publications describing 35 trials, including 25 peer-reviewed publications and 13 pre-prints. DATA EXTRACTION: Trial ID, registry, location, population, intervention, control, study design, recruitment target, actual recruitment, outcomes, data sharing statement, and time of data sharing were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 178 registered trials, 112 (62.92%) were in hospital settings, median planned recruitment was 100 participants (IQR: 60, 168), and the majority (nâ¯=â¯166, 93.26%) did not report results in their respective registries.

Clinical evidence has implicated the emergence of cytokine release syndrome as the prominent cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we observed massive elevation of plasma Galectin-9 (Gal-9) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). By using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, we found that a baseline of 2,042 pg/ml plasma Gal-9 can differentiate SARS-CoV-2-infected from noninfected individuals with high specificity/sensitivity (95%). Analysis of 30 cytokines and chemokines detected a positive correlation of the plasma Gal-9 with C-reactive protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), IP-10, MIP-1&#945;, and MCP-1 but an inverse correlation with transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) in COVID-19 patients. In agreement, we found enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; by monocytes and NK cells of COVID-19 patients once treated with the recombinant human Gal-9 in vitro Also, we observed that although the cell-membrane expression of Gal-9 on monocytes does not change in COVID-19 patients, those with higher Gal-9 expression exhibit an activated phenotype. Furthermore, we noted significant downregulation of surface Gal-9 in neutrophils from COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. Our further investigations indicated that immune activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection results in Gal-9 shedding from neutrophils. The strong correlation of Gal-9 with proinflammatory mediators suggests that inhibition of Gal-9 may severe as a therapeutic approach in COVID-19 infection. Besides, the plasma Gal-9 measurement may be used as a surrogate diagnostic biomarker in COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection has enormously impacted our lives. Clinical evidence has implicated the emergence of cytokine release syndrome as the prominent cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. We observed substantial elevation of the plasma Galectin-9 (Gal-9) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Gal-9 is an abundant protein in many immune and nonimmune cells. We found that Gal-9 detection assay can differentiate SARS-CoV-2-infected from noninfected individuals with a specificity/sensitivity of 95%. Importantly, we found a positive correlation of the plasma Gal-9 with a wide range of proinflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients. In agreement, we found enhanced expression and production of such proinflammatory molecules by immune cells of COVID-19 patients once treated with Gal-9 in vitro Our results propose Gal-9 as an important contributing factor in cytokine release syndrome; therefore, Gal-9 inhibition may serve as a beneficial therapeutic approach by suppressing the hyperimmune activation in COVID-19 patients.","Bozorgmehr, Najmeh; Mashhouri, Siavash; Perez Rosero, Eliana; Xu, Lai; Shahbaz, Shima; Sligl, Wendy; Osman, Mohammed; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J; MacIntyre, Erika; O039,; Neil, Conar R; Elahi, Shokrollah",mBio (Online),592,1

The nonstructural protein nsp5, also called 3C-like protease, is responsible for processing viral polyprotein precursors in coronavirus (CoV) replication. Previous studies have shown that PDCoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 to disrupt interferon (IFN) production and signaling, respectively. Whether PDCoV nsp5 also cleaves IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules, remains unclear. In this study, we screened 14 classical ISGs and found that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved the porcine mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) through its protease activity. Similar cleavage of endogenous pDCP1A was also observed in PDCoV-infected cells. PDCoV nsp5 cleaved pDCP1A at glutamine 343 (Q343), and the cleaved pDCP1A fragments, pDCP1A1-343 and pDCP1A344-580, were unable to inhibit PDCoV infection. Mutant pDCP1A-Q343A, which resists nsp5-mediated cleavage, exhibited a stronger ability to inhibit PDCoV infection than wild-type pDCP1A. Interestingly, the Q343 cleavage site is highly conserved in DCP1A homologs from other mammalian species. Further analyses demonstrated that nsp5 encoded by seven tested CoVs that can infect human or pig also cleaved pDCP1A and human DCP1A, suggesting that DCP1A may be the common target for cleavage by nsp5 of mammalian CoVs.IMPORTANCE Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction through IFN signaling is important to create an antiviral state and usually directly inhibits virus infection. The present study first demonstrated that PDCoV nsp5 can cleave mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1A) to attenuate its antiviral activity. Furthermore, cleaving DCP1A is a common characteristic of nsp5 proteins from different coronaviruses (CoVs), which represents a common immune evasion mechanism of CoVs. Previous evidence showed that CoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2. Taken together, CoV nsp5 is a potent IFN antagonist because it can simultaneously target different aspects of the host IFN system, including IFN production and signaling and effector molecules.","Zhu, Xinyu; Chen, Jiyao; Tian, Liyuan; Zhou, Yanrong; Xu, Shangen; Long, Siwen; Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",J. virol,592,27

Several centers are developing reusable stop-gap respirators as alternatives to disposable N95 respirators during public health emergencies, using techniques such as 3D-printing, silicone moulding and plastic extrusion. Effective sealing of the mask, combined with respiratory filters should achieve 95% or greater filtration of particles less than 1um. Quantitative fit-testing (QNFT) data from these stop-gap devices has not been published to date. Our team developed one such device, the ""SSM"", and evaluated it using QNFT. METHODS: Device prototypes were iteratively evaluated for comfort, breathability and communication, by team members wearing them for 15-30min. The fit and seal were assessed by positive and negative pressure user seal checks. The final design was then formally tested by QNFT, according to CSA standard Z94.4-18 in 40 volunteer healthcare providers. An overall fit-factor >100 is the passing threshold. Volunteers were also tested by QNFT on disposable N95 masks which had passed qualitative fit testing (QLFT) by institutional Occupational Health and Safety Department. RESULTS: The SSM scored 3.5/5 and 4/5 for comfort and breathability. The median overall harmonic mean fit-factors of disposable N95 and SSM were 137.9 and 6316.7 respectively. SSM scored significantly higher than disposable respirators in fit-test runs and overall fit-factors (p <0.0001). Overall passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators on QNFT were 65% and 100%. During dynamic runs, passing rates in disposable and SSM respirators were 68.1% and 99.4%; harmonic means were 73.7 and 1643. CONCLUSIONS: We present the design and validation of a reusable N95 stop-gap filtering facepiece respirator that can match existent commercial respirators. This sets a precedence for adoption of novel stop-gap N95 respirators in emergency situations.","Ng, William C K; Mbadjeu Hondjeu, Arnaud Romeo; Syrett, Andrew; Caragata, Rebecca; Rozenberg, Dmitry; Xiao, Zixuan; Anwari, Vahid; Trac, Jessica; Mashari, Azad",PLoS One,592,16

However, its successful application to medical images is severely handicapped with the limited amount of annotated training data. Transfer learning is commonly adopted for the medical imaging tasks. However, a large covariant shift between the source domain of natural images and target domain of medical images results in poor transfer learning. Moreover, scarcity of annotated data for the medical imaging tasks causes further problems for effective transfer learning. To address these problems, we develop an augmented ensemble transfer learning technique that leads to significant performance gain over the conventional transfer learning. Our technique uses an ensemble of deep learning models, where the architecture of each network is modified with extra layers to account for dimensionality change between the images of source and target data domains. Moreover, the model is hierarchically tuned to the target domain with augmented training data. Along with the network ensemble, we also utilize an ensemble of dictionaries that are based on features extracted from the augmented models. The dictionary ensemble provides an additional performance boost to our method. We first establish the effectiveness of our technique with the challenging ChestXray-14 radiography data set. Our experimental results show more than 50% reduction in the error rate with our method as compared to the baseline transfer learning technique.

It is unknown whether these measures are associated with depression and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: To investigate meta-analytic global levels of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the implementation of mitigation strategies (i.e. public transportation closures, stay-at-home orders, etc.) impacted such disorders. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Current Content Connect, PsycINFO, CINAHL, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv databases for depression and anxiety prevalences; Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker for the containment and closure policies indexes; Global Burden of Disease Study for previous levels of depression and anxiety. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original studies conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, which assessed categorical depression and anxiety, using PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales (cutoff â©¾10). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: General population, healthcare providers, students, and patients. National physical distancing measures. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Meta-analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: In total, 226 638 individuals were assessed within the 60 included studies. Global prevalence of both depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0% and 21.3%, respectively. There were differences in the prevalence of both anxiety and depression reported across regions and countries. Asia (17.6% and 17.9%), and China (16.2% and 15.5%) especially, had the lowest prevalence of both disorders. Regarding the impact of mitigation strategies on mental health, only public transportation closures increased the prevalence of anxiety, especially in Europe. LIMITATIONS: Country-level data on physical distancing measures and previous anxiety/depression may not necessarily reflect local (i.e. city-specific) contexts. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Mental health concerns should not be viewed only as a delayed consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also as a concurrent epidemic. Our data provide support for policy-makers to consider real-time enhanced mental health services, and increase initiatives to foster positive mental health outcomes.","Castaldelli-Maia, João M; Marziali, Megan E; Lu, Ziyin; Martins, Silvia S",Psychol Med,592,24

METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Randelli, Pietro Simone; Compagnoni, Riccardo",Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,592,1

This number exceeds the number of fatalities in China (3,301) recorded from January to March, even though the number of diagnosed cases was similar (85,000 Italy vs. 80,000 China). Case Fatality Rates (CFR) could be somewhat unreliable because the estimation of total case numbers is limited by several factors, including insufficient testing and limitations in test kits and materials, such as NP swabs and PPE for testers. Sero prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help in more accurate estimations of the total number of cases. Nevertheless, the disparity in the differences in the total number of fatalities between Italy and China suggests investigation into several factors, such as demographics, sociological interactions, availability of medical equipment (ICU beds and PPE), variants in immune proteins (e.g., HLA, IFNs), past immunity to related CoVs, and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, could impact survival of severe COVID-19 illness survival and the number of case fatalities.","Rubino, Salvatore; Kelvin, Nikki; Bermejo-Martin, Jesús F; Kelvin, David",J Infect Dev Ctries,592,13

The main protease (Mpro , also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for treatment of COVID-19. A Mpro homodimer structure suitable for docking simulations was prepared using a crystal structure (PDB ID: 6Y2G; resolution 2.20 Å). Structural refinement was performed in the presence of peptidomimetic &#945;-ketoamide inhibitors, which were previously disconnected from each Cys145 of the Mpro homodimer, and energy calculations were performed. Structure-based virtual screenings were performed using the ChEMBL database. Through a total of 1 485 144 screenings, 64 potential drugs (11 approved, 14 clinical, and 39 preclinical drugs) were predicted to show high binding affinity with Mpro . Additional docking simulations for predicted compounds with high binding affinity with Mpro suggested that 28 bioactive compounds may have potential as effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.

Public health experts have communicated clear and emphatic strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hygiene rules and social distancing practices have been implemented by entire populations, including 'stay-at-home' orders in many countries. The long-term health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet known. MAIN TEXT: During this time of crisis, some chiropractors made claims on social media that chiropractic treatment can prevent or impact COVID-19. The rationale for these claims is that spinal manipulation can impact the nervous system and thus improve immunity. These beliefs often stem from nineteenth-century chiropractic concepts. We are aware of no clinically relevant scientific evidence to support such statements. We explored the internet and social media to collect examples of misinformation from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand regarding the impact of chiropractic treatment on immune function. We discuss the potential harm resulting from these claims and explore the role of chiropractors, teaching institutions, accrediting agencies, and legislative bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Members of the chiropractic profession share a collective responsibility to act in the best interests of patients and public health. We hope that all chiropractic stakeholders will view the COVID-19 pandemic as a call to action to eliminate the unethical and potentially dangerous claims made by chiropractors who practise outside the boundaries of scientific evidence.","Axén, Iben; Bergström, Cecilia; Bronson, Marc; Côté, Pierre; Nim, Casper Glissmann; Goncalves, Guillaume; Hébert, Jeffrey J; Hertel, Joakim Axel; Innes, Stanley; Larsen, Ole Kristoffer; Meyer, Anne-Laure; O039,; Neill, Søren; Perle, Stephen M; Weber, Kenneth A; Young, Kenneth J; Leboeuf-Yde, Charlotte",Chiropr Man Therap,592,1

O estudo conclui que, após a declaração pela Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) de que a infecção causada pelo Covid-19 era uma pandemia, estados e capitais passaram a adotar diversas medidas de distanciamento social, embora em momentos e com graus de rigor distintos. Ao se comparar os estados, conclui-se que Acre, Alagoas, Ceará, Goiás, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Santa Catarina e Sergipe foram os que adotaram medidas legais mais restritivas. Ao se comparar as capitais, as medidas mais restritivas foram adotadas por Belo Horizonte, Boa Vista, Cuiabá, João Pessoa, Porto Alegre, Porto Velho, Rio de Janeiro e Teresina. Os dados indicam também que a relação entre as políticas dos estados e as das capitais tende a ser inversa, ou seja, medidas mais restritivas em uma capital, por exemplo, tendem a estar associadas a medidas menos restritivas nos estados. Isto decorre de um dos seguintes fatores: políticas não precisaram ser restritas nas capitais, pois políticas estaduais foram consideradas suficientes; ou políticas nas capitais precisaram ser restritas, pois as políticas estaduais foram consideradas insuficientes. Os dados também sugerem que medidas legais de distanciamento social contribuíram para que o isolamento social se ampliasse.

However, the results could not reach an agreement. This meta-analysis was conducted to confirm the relationship between adult meningioma risk and the use of a wireless phone. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase up to August 2018. The random- or fixed-effects model was used to combine the results depending on the heterogeneity of the analysis. The publication bias was evaluated using Egger's regression asymmetry test. The subgroup analysis was performed by time since the first use of wireless phone and laterality (ipsilateral/contralateral). Results: Eight studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled results suggested that the ever use of wireless phone led to a borderline decreased adult meningioma risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.99] with no heterogeneity (I 2 = 5.3%; p = 0.391). A decreased risk of meningioma was seen in short-term (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) users. Neither decreased nor increased risk of meningioma was observed in mid-term (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.75-1.16) and long-term (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.93-1.19) users. Neither ipsilateral (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.90-1.22) nor contralateral (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.62-1.18) wireless phone use was associated with the risk of meningioma. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggested a relationship between decreased meningioma risk and wireless phone use. However, the findings need further validation.","Chen, Fajun; Wang, Peng; Lan, Jiaying; Hu, Mingzhe; Zheng, Jiantao; Li, Yanwen; Hou, Chongxian; Zhou, Dong",Br J Neurosurg,592,32

Partial lockdown measures came into force in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on March 23. While CO and NO2 levels showed significant reductions, PM10 levels were only reduced in the first partial lockdown week. By contrast, ozone levels increased in all studied locations. In this study, the factors leading to this behavior were analyzed. Monitoring data obtained at two automatic monitoring stations showed higher ratios between non-methane hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NMHC/NOx) during the partial lockdown (up to 37.3%). The increase in ozone concentrations during the social distancing measures could be attributed to the increase in NMHC/NOx ratios since atmospheric chemistry in Rio de Janeiro is under VOC-controlled conditions. However, the increase was higher when air masses arrived from the industrial areas, not only because of the higher NMHC/NOx ratios, but also because the reactivity of VOC was highly increased by these air masses, which are rich in aromatic compounds.","Siciliano, Bruno; Dantas, Guilherme; da Silva, Cleyton M; Arbilla, Graciela",Sci Total Environ,592,16

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 throughout the world determined a series of modifications of several National Health Service organisations, with a potential series of psychological consequences among nurses, who were particularly afflicted by this situation of changes and precariousness. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February-April 2020. METHODS: A total of 1,005 nurses employed in different Italian hospital wards, during the COVID-19 pandemic, were recruited. Analyses were based on descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies was used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep disturbances, moderate anxiety and low self-efficacy was 71.4%, 33.23% and 50.65%, respectively. We found a positive correlation between anxiety and sleep quality (0.408; p < .0001) and negative correlations between self-efficacy and anxiety (-0.217; p < .0001) and sleep quality and self-efficacy (-0.134; p < .0001). The factor independently associated with all variables was gender. Females were more prone to sleep disturbances, anxiety and low levels of self-efficacy than males (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety, sleep disorders and low self-efficacy among Italian nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was high. Healthcare managers should recognise and consider these results to reduce the risk of the onset of major mental problems that could result in post-traumatic stress disorder. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses facing major incidents as COVID-19 pandemic are among healthcare personnel exposed to a high risk to develop psychological disturbance that should be assessed and recognised, in order to find helpful coping strategies to inform support services and avoid to hesitate in post-traumatic stress disorders.","Simonetti, Valentina; Durante, Angela; Ambrosca, Rossella; Arcadi, Paola; Graziano, Giusi; Pucciarelli, Gianluca; Simeone, Silvio; Vellone, Ercole; Alvaro, Rosaria; Cicolini, Giancarlo",J. clin. nurs,592,16

Methods: All laboratory-confirmed cases with SARS-Cov-2 infection who were hospitalized and monitored in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were recruited from January 20 to February 10. Results: A total of 275 patients were included in this study. The median patient age was 49 years, and 63.6% had exposure to Wuhan. The median virus incubation period was 6 days. Fever (70.5%) and dry cough (56.0%) were the most common symptoms. A decreased albumin level was found in 51.3% of patients, lymphopenia in 33.5%, and pneumonia based on chest computed tomography in 86%. Approximately 16% of patients (nâ =â 45) had severe disease, and there were no deaths. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease were older, had a higher frequency of coexisting conditions and pneumonia, and had a shorter incubation period (all Pâ <â .05). There were no differences between patients who likely contacted the virus in Wuhan and those who had no exposure to Wuhan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that older age, male sex, and decreased albumin level were independently associated with disease severity.

ARDS patients display elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cells, and T and B cell lymphocytes have been implicated in this dysregulated immune response. Mast cells are abundant resident cells of the respiratory tract and are able to release different inflammatory mediators rapidly following stimulation. Recently, mast cells have been associated with tissue damage during viral infections, but their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. In this study, we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) and decreased serotonin levels in their serum when compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils, and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, whereas serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, our results show that serum CPA3 and serotonin levels are relevant biomarkers during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that mast cells and basophils are relevant players in the inflammatory response in COVID-19 and may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.","Soria-Castro, Rodolfo; Meneses-Preza, Yatsiri G; Rodríguez-López, Gloria M; Romero-Ramírez, Sandra; Sosa-Hernández, Víctor A; Cervantes-Díaz, Rodrigo; Pérez-Fragoso, Alfredo; Torres-Ruíz, José J; Gómez-Martín, Diana; Campillo-Navarro, Marcia; Álvarez-Jiménez, Violeta D; Pérez-Tapia, Sonia M; Chávez-Blanco, Alma D; Estrada-Parra, Sergio; Maravillas-Montero, José L; Chacón-Salinas, Rommel",J. leukoc. biol,592,1

As new-generation AEDs continue to enter the market, evidence on their safety during pregnancy is limited yet necessary. To date, there are no published reviews summarizing the evidence of new-generation AED exposure in utero and the development of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring. The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the available evidence on the risk of ADHD after maternal exposure to new-generation AEDs during pregnancy. We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE for articles published from January 1988 to April 2020. New-generation AEDs were considered if marketed after 1988. ADHD was defined as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hyperkinetic disorder, hyperkinesis, or conduct disorder. Of the total articles screened (n = 805), eight publications were finally included (seven cohort studies and one systematic review). Across the studies, the sample size of pregnant women exposed to AEDs ranged from 1 to 1383. Monotherapy was examined in six studies (mostly lamotrigine), while only two studies examined polytherapy. The included studies reported a range of adjusted relative risks, from 0.84 [0.59-1.19] to 1.63 [0.41-6.06]. Lamotrigine monotherapy holds the largest body of evidence, concluding that no significant risk of ADHD exists among the offspring. However, the available evidence is considered scarce and has several methodological limitations. Disentangling the effect of AEDs from epilepsy itself and examining polytherapies are challenges that merit additional investigations. Further comparative safety studies with longer follow-up periods and large sample sizes are needed to accurately quantify the true impact of new-generation AED exposure during pregnancy and ADHD in children.","Vaccaro, Christine; Shakeri, Ahmad; Czaplinski, Emily; Eltonsy, Sherif",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,592,32

Obesity is a common metabolic disease, affecting 42.4% of U.S. adults (5), and is a risk factor for other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices considers obesity to be a high-risk medical condition for COVID-19 vaccine prioritization (6). Using data from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR),§ CDC assessed the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] or stepdown unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death). Among 148,494 adults who received a COVID-19 diagnosis during an emergency department (ED) or inpatient visit at 238 U.S. hospitals during March-December 2020, 28.3% had overweight and 50.8% had obesity. Overweight and obesity were risk factors for invasive mechanical ventilation, and obesity was a risk factor for hospitalization and death, particularly among adults aged <65 years. Risks for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were lowest among patients with BMIs of 24.2 kg/m2, 25.9 kg/m2, and 23.7 kg/m2, respectively, and then increased sharply with higher BMIs. Risk for invasive mechanical ventilation increased over the full range of BMIs, from 15 kg/m2 to 60 kg/m2. As clinicians develop care plans for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs, especially for those with severe obesity. These findings highlight the clinical and public health implications of higher BMIs, including the need for intensive COVID-19 illness management as obesity severity increases, promotion of COVID-19 prevention strategies including continued vaccine prioritization (6) and masking, and policies to ensure community access to nutrition and physical activities that promote and support a healthy BMI.","Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Goodman, Alyson B; Belay, Brook; Freedman, David S; Sucosky, Marissa S; Lange, Samantha J; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Boehmer, Tegan K; Blanck, Heidi M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,592,20

Analysis of the HRM data is important for several applications, such as, for detection of diseases (e.g., influenza, zika virus, SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 diseases) in health, for identification of spoiled foods in food industry, for analysis of crime scene evidence in forensic investigation, etc. However, the characteristics of the HRM data can change due to the experimental conditions or instrumental settings. In addition, it becomes laborious and time-consuming process as the number of samples increases. Because of these reasons, the analysis and classification of the HRM data become challenging for species which have similar characteristics. METHODS: To improve the classification accuracy of HRM data, we propose to use image (visual) representation of HRM data, which we call HRM images, that are generated using recurrence plots, and propose convolutional neural network (CNN) based models for classifying HRM images. In this study, two different types of recurrence plots are generated, which are black-white recurrence plots (BW-RP) and gray scale recurrence plots (GS-RP) and four different CNN models are proposed for classifying HRM data. RESULTS: The classification performance of the proposed methods are evaluated based on average classification accuracy and F1 score, specificity, recall, and precision values for each yeast species. When BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the best classification accuracy of 95.2% is obtained. The classification accuracies of CNN models for melting curve and GS-RP data representations of HRM data are 90.13% and 86.13%, respectively.

Moreover, when BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the F1 score, specificity, recall and precision values are the highest for almost all of species.

Objectives: For oral healthcare professionals it is imperative to understand details regarding personal protective equipment. This is because they are in proximity to the patients while carrying out treatments and as such are at a high risk of transmission because of various aerosol-generating procedures. Different types of masks are available which have different efficiency levels in terms of filtration, fluid resistance and shielding from the virus. Description and Results: This article reviews the different types of masks and respirators available and how effective they are in providing protection and safety against virus transmission. Conclusion: Use of an appropriate mask or respirator, depending on the procedure being done, is the need of the hour along with proper personal protective measures.","Chaudhary, G.; Chaudhry, A.; Malik, G.; Chaudhry, N.; Kochhar, A.

We used an accurate rapid diagnostic test kit detecting immunoglobulins (Ig) in 504 adults. Of the 499 participants who obtained a valid antibody test, 54 (10.8%) had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test (0.4% IgM+, 1.8% both IgM+ and IgG+, and 8.6% IgG+). A statistically significant association with infection was found for geographic area (compared to Milan, adjusted odds ratio was 2.79, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01-7.68 for eastern and 2.82, 95% CI: 1.34-5.94, for southern Lombardy). The clinical staff did not result positive to SARS-CoV-2 more frequently than the administrative staff. This is the first study using antibody test in the dental staff personnel. It shows that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lombardy region was around 10%, in line with estimates on other healthcare professionals.

Higher risks of infection and mortality among racialized minorities are a consequence of structural racism, reflected in specific policies that date back centuries and persist today. Yet, our surveillance activities do not reflect what we know about how racism structures risk. When measuring racial and ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19, the CDC statistically accounts for the geographic distribution of deaths throughout the US to reflect the fact that deaths are concentrated in areas with different racial and ethnic distributions than that of the larger US. In this commentary, we argue that such an approach misses an important driver of disparities in COVID-19 mortality, namely the historical forces that determine where individuals live, work, and play, and consequently determine their risk of dying from COVID-19. We explain why controlling for geography downplays the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on racialized minority groups in the US. Finally, we offer recommendations for the analysis of surveillance data to estimate racial disparities, including shifting from distribution-based to risk-based measures, to help inform a more effective and equitable public health response to the pandemic.","Zalla, Lauren C; Martin, Chantel L; Edwards, Jessie K; Gartner, Danielle R; Noppert, Grace A",Am. j. epidemiol,592,16

According to the American Hospital Association, the pandemic has created a $202 billion loss across the healthcare industry, forcing health care systems to lay off workers and making hospitals scramble to minimize supply chain costs. However, as the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) grows, hospitals have sacrificed sustainable solutions for disposable options that, although convenient, will exacerbate supply strains, financial burden, and waste. We advocate for reusable gowns as a means to lower health care costs, address climate change, and improve resilience while preserving the safety of health care workers. Reusable gowns' polyester material provides comparable capacity to reduce microbial cross-transmission and liquid penetration. In addition, previous hospitals have reported a 50% cost reduction in gown expenditures after adopting reusable gowns; given the current 2000% price increase in isolation gowns during COVID-19, reusable gown use will build both healthcare resilience and security from price fluctuations. Finally, with the United States' medical waste stream worsening, reusable isolation gowns show promising reductions in energy and water use, solid waste, and carbon footprint. The gowns are shown to withstand laundering 75-100 times in contrast to the single-use disposable gown. The circumstances of the pandemic forewarn the need to shift our single-use PPE practices to standardized reusable applications. Ultimately, sustainable forms of protective equipment can help us prepare for future crises that challenge the resilience of the healthcare system.","Baker, Natalie; Bromley-Dulfano, Rebecca; Chan, Joshua; Gupta, Anshal; Herman, Luciana; Jain, Navami; Taylor, Anita Lowe; Lu, Jonathan; Pannu, Jaspreet; Patel, Lisa; Prunicki, Mary",Front Public Health,592,24

These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of gay and bisexual men in Australia. METHODS: Between April 4, 2020, and April 29, 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19 and whether they engaged in sexual behavior with regular or casual partners or ""fuckbuddies"" in the 6 months before becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""before COVID-19""), and following the date, they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as ""since COVID-19""). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the 6 months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION: Gay and bisexual men in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioral changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken before resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.","Hammoud, Mohamed A; Maher, Lisa; Holt, Martin; Degenhardt, Louisa; Jin, Fengyi; Murphy, Dean; Bavinton, Benjamin; Grulich, Andrew; Lea, Toby; Haire, Bridget; Bourne, Adam; Saxton, Peter; Vaccher, Stefanie; Ellard, Jeanne; Mackie, Brent; Batrouney, Colin; Bath, Nicky; Prestage, Garrett",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,592,29

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that there is a common source for these infections. The overall sequence similarities between the spike protein of 2019-nCoV and that of SARS-CoV are known to be around 76% to 78% and 73% to 76% for the whole protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. Thus, they have the potential to serve as the drug and/or vaccine candidate. However, the individual response against 2019-nCoV differs due to genetic variations in the human population. Understanding the variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that may affect the severity of 2019-nCoV infection could help in identifying individuals at a higher risk from the COVID-19. A number of potential drugs/vaccines as well as antibody/cytokine-based therapeutics are in various developmental stages of preclinical/clinical trials against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV with substantial cross-reactivity, and may be used against COVID-19. For diagnosis, the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard test for initial diagnosis of COVID-19. A kit based on serological tests are also recommended for investigating the spread of COVID-19 but this is challenging due to the antibodies cross-reactivity.

However, a general and stereoselective method towards the rapid construction of this structure remains challenging due to the inherent instability and complex stereochemistry of polyketide.

This direct enantioselective cascade reaction is achieved by a Au(I)/chiral Sc(III) bimetallic catalytic system. Experimental studies indicate that the key hetero-Diels-Alder reaction involves a stepwise pathway, and the steric hindrance between in-situ generated isochromene and t-Bu group of Sc(III)/N,N'-dioxide complex is responsible for the enantioselectivity in the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction step.","Lin, Xiangfeng; Liu, Xianghui; Wang, Kai; Li, Qian; Liu, Yan; Li, Can",Nat Commun,592,16

Interventions aiming to reduce incidence of these infections can be focused on preventing spillover or reducing human-to-human transmission, or sometimes both at once, and typically are governed by resource constraints that require policymakers to make choices. Despite increasing emphasis on using mathematical models to inform disease control policies, little attention has been paid to guiding rational disease control at the animal-human interface. Methods: We introduce a modeling framework to analyze the impacts of different disease control policies, focusing on pathogens exhibiting subcritical transmission among humans (i.e. pathogens that cannot establish sustained human-to-human transmission). We quantify the relative effectiveness of measures to reduce spillover (e.g. reducing contact with animal hosts), human-to-human transmission (e.g. case isolation), or both at once (e.g. vaccination), across a range of epidemiological contexts. Results: We provide guidelines for choosing which mode of control to prioritize in different epidemiological scenarios and considering different levels of resource and relative costs. We contextualize our analysis with current zoonotic pathogens and other subcritical pathogens, such as post-elimination measles, and control policies that have been applied. Conclusions: Our work provides a model-based, theoretical foundation to understand and guide policy for subcritical zoonoses, integrating across disciplinary and species boundaries in a manner consistent with One Health principles.","Mummah, Riley O; Hoff, Nicole A; Rimoin, Anne W; Lloyd-Smith, James O",One Health Outlook,592,16

DESIGN: A case-control gender study performed from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A gender and age matched-paired sample of 74 nurses was recruited and divided into men (n = 37) and women (n = 37). FFP3 filtering respirators and surgical masks fit factors were compared between male and female nurses by Mann-Whitney U tests. These measurements were tested to pass or fail according to the OSHA (&#8805;100) and AIHA (&#8805;50) criteria by Fisher exact tests for a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Global fit factor mean (standard deviation) was 2.86 (2.73) and 3.55 (6.34) for male and female nurses wearing surgical masks (p = .180), respectively, and nobody passed neither OSHA nor AIHA criteria (p = 1.00). Nevertheless, global fit factor were 30.82 (28.42) and 49.65 (43.04) for male and female nurses wearing FFP3 respirators, respectively, being significantly lower and worse in male nurses (p = .037). According to OSHA criteria, only 2.70% and 13.51% of male and females nurses, respectively, passed with non-significant difference (p = .199), meanwhile 21.62% and 48.64% of male and female nurses, respectively, passed AIHA criteria showing significant differences (p = .027) wearing FFP3 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: All male and female nurses wearing surgical masks failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria. Global fit factor of the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators was decreased and worse in male than female nurses. IMPACT: Our recommendation is to avoid surgical masks use for protective purposes and use the proposed FFP3 filtering respirators among nurses. Each nurse should be fit tested for its own respirator with special caution in male nurses due to their lower fit factor achieved and most of them failed to pass OSHA and AIHA criteria, especially during COVID-19 pandemic.","De-Yñigo-Mojado, Borja; Madera-García, Javier; Becerro-De-Bengoa-Vallejo, Ricardo; Losa-Iglesias, Marta E; Rodríguez-Sanz, David; Calvo-Lobo, Cesar; López-López, Daniel; Casado-Hernández, Israel; San-Antolín, Marta",J. adv. nurs,592,31

In view of the high death rate for Covid-19 patients over 70 years of age, and given the fact that BCG vaccination is typically given early in life, we compared countries that had introduced BCG in the 1950s with those that had not. No effect on Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) or number of deaths per population could be demonstrated. Since some countries test for Covid-19 more than others, the effect of tests performed per million population on reported deaths per million was also assessed, but again did not demonstrate an effect of BCG vaccination in the 1950s. Whether countries had never used the vaccine, had historically used it but since ceased to do so, or were presently vaccinating with BCG did not correlate with national total number of deaths or CFR.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have died (including the number of comorbidities) are extremely relevant, especially to define those with a higher risk of mortality. Health authorities recommend influenza (flu) vaccinations in a number of categories at risk of serious medical complications, including: people aged &#8805;65 years, or patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal failure, cancer, immunodeficiencies, chronic hepatopathies, and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. The seasonal flu peak certainly preceded that of the pandemic; however, it would seem clear that the two viruses have been simultaneously circulating in Italy for a while. Hence, after the peak of seasonal flu, influenza-like illness-related (ILI) deaths started to grow again. While some of the excess mortality reported in the ILI group may be attributable to COVID-19, a question arises: do we have to consider this observation as a result of a random sequence of events or a potential relationship between the two viruses play a role? A cooperation mechanism intended at establishing an absolute advantage over the host could also be assumed; this system often takes place to boost the reproductive probabilities. A characterization of those who died due to virus-related reasons can be performed by cross-linking data (stored in different warehouses) from the same geographical area and developing electronic health records. It would be of great relevance to identify people at very high risk of mortality as a result of an overlapping or combination of risk factors that were separately reported in patients who died from COVID-19 or influenza. A description of the subgroup of people at higher risk of mortality will be crucial for prioritizing and implementing future public health prevention and treatment programs.","Capone, Alessandro",Int J Infect Dis,592,24

Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kwok, Stephen Wai Hang; Vadde, Sai Kumar; Wang, Guanjin",J Med Internet Res,592,31

Unlike the traditional recycling approaches whereby C&D waste is transported to off-site facilities for treatment, construction managers are actively exploring the possibility of on-site recycling where C&D waste is treated directly at source. This study reports the barriers and facilitators of implementing on-site C&D waste recycling by contextualizing it in Hong Kong. It does so by adopting a mixed-method approach combining case study, site visits, and interviews. It is discovered that the barriers include (1) site space constraints, (2) narrow window of opportunity to trade recycled products, (3) vulnerable business case, (4) lack of support from off-site recycling, and (5) lack of government policy support. A series of facilitating measures are also proposed, including (1) developing customized on-site recycling equipment, (2) establishing a demand-supply information-sharing platform, (3) developing more thriving off-site recycling, and (4) providing more government support. This study probes into the real-life on- and off-site waste recycling practices in Hong Kong's prominent C&D management system.

At individual sample level, most of the paired samples had <1 log10 difference. Significant positive Spearman rank correlations were obtained between two laboratories for the HF183 (Rs = 0.65; p < 0.05), CPQ_056 (Rs = 0.79; p < 0.05), and PMMoV (Rs = 0.54; p < 0.05) marker genes. Several factors such as standards, qPCR platforms, PCR inhibitors, nucleic acid extraction efficiency and low levels of targets in some samples may have contributed to the observed discrepancies. Results presented in this study highlight the importance of standardized protocol, laboratory equipment (such as digital PCR), sample processing strategies and appropriate quality controls that may need implementation to further improve accuracy and precision of results between laboratories.","Ahmed, Warish; Payyappat, Sudhi; Cassidy, Michele; Harrison, Nathan; Besley, Colin",Sci Total Environ,592,23

In order to mimic the penetration of this type of molecules, based upon previously reported structure activity relationship studies, we designed a new molecule containing a quinazoline moiety tethered to a p-nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) moiety [molecular weight (MW) 700]. Despite its size, AL906 growth inhibitory activity was superior to that of the clinical drug gefitinib. Furthermore, AL906 retained significant EGFR inhibitory activity and good cellular penetration with abundant distribution in the perinuclear region of the cells. In an isogenic NIH3T3 transfected cell panel, it selectively inhibited the growth of the NIH3T3-EGFR and HER2 transfectants. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that it was capable of penetrating multilayer aggregates although to a lesser extent than FD105, a small inhibitor of EGFR inhibitor of the same class (MW 300). Its ability to inhibit EGFR auto-phosphorylation in monolayer culture was stronger than in the aggregates. The results suggest that our strategy did not negatively affect EGFR inhibitory potency, EGFR selectivity and growth inhibition. However, its molecular size may account for its decreased aggregate penetration when compared with a smaller EGFR inhibitor of the quinazoline class.","Golabi, Nahid; Larroque, Anne-Laure; Peyrard, Lisa; Williams, Christopher; Jean-Claude, Bertrand J",Invest. new drugs,592,24

This abrupt change provided a unique opportunity to examine students' motivation, engagement and perceptions of success and cheating under two learning conditions, namely traditional and remote. We used a single survey to collect retrospective self-report data from a convenience sample of Canadian undergraduate students (n = 98) about their motivation, engagement and perceptions of success and cheating before COVID-19 and then in remote learning. Students' achievement goals, engagement and perceptions of success all significantly decreased, while their perceptions of cheating increased. Moreover, we used regression analyses to examine associations amongst achievement goals and engagement, perceptions of success and cheating concerns. Mastery-approach goals were positively associated with more engagement and higher perceptions of success. Achievement goals were unrelated to cheating. Students in large classes and who were originally concerned about cheating became more concerned about cheating in remote learning conditions. Our study provides information to researchers and instructors about how achievement goals relate to student outcomes across learning conditions. By extension, we provide timely recommendations for instructors as they continue to wrestle with how to deliver their courses during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daniels, Lia M; Goegan, Lauren D; Parker, Patti C",Soc Psychol Educ,592,15

Among them, SRD5A2 is a critical enzyme in steroid metabolism that catalyzes testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Mutations on its gene have been linked to 5α-reductase deficiency and prostate cancer. Finasteride and dutasteride as SRD5A2 inhibitors are widely used anti-androgen drugs for benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, which have recently been indicated in the treatment of COVID-19. The molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme catalysis and inhibition had remained elusive for SRD5A2 and other eukaryotic integral membrane steroid reductases due to a lack of structural information. We recently solved a crystal structure of human SRD5A2 at 2.8 Å with finasteride using the lipid mesophase (or LCP) crystallization method. The structure reveals a unique structural topology of 7-transmembrane helices and an intermediate adduct of finasteride and NADPH as NADP-dihydrofinasteride, which binds in a largely enclosed binding cavity inside the membrane. To our knowledge, similar NADPH adducts have not been reported previously. Structural analysis together with computational and mutagenesis studies reveals molecular mechanisms for the 5α-reduction of testosterone and the semi-irreversible finasteride inhibition involving residues E57 and Y91 of SRD5A2. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate high conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region of SRD5A2 including three cytosolic loops regulating the NADPH/NADP+ exchange and their entry into the transmembrane region of SRD5A2. Mapping disease-causing mutations of SRD5A2 to our structure suggests molecular mechanisms for their pathological effects. In summary, our results offer critical and unprecedented structural insights into the function of integral membrane steroid reductases and will facilitate drug development.","Zhang, Cheng Wei Zhiyi",The FASEB Journal,592,10

Much of this COVID-19 research depends on distributed computing. In this article, I review distributed architectures -- various types of clusters, grids and clouds -- that can be leveraged to perform these tasks at scale, at high-throughput, with a high degree of parallelism, and which can also be used to work collaboratively. High-performance computing (HPC) clusters will be used to carry out much of this work. Several bigdata processing tasks used in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require high-throughput approaches, and a variety of tools, which Hadoop and Spark offer, even using commodity hardware. Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT -- for ensemble docking high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and high-throughput gene analysis -- and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to explore natural products. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.","Alnasir, Jamie J",,592,16

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study analyzing data prospectively collected from COVID-19-positive subjects who were admitted into a single-center Singapore EXPO CCF from 1st May 2020 to 1st July 2020. The following variables were collected: age, gender, ethnicity, anosmia, ageusia and acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. Symptoms of anosmia and ageusia were self-declared via a mandatory questionnaire administered on admission. RESULTS: A total of 1983 subjects were included. The overall prevalence of anosmia and ageusia is 3.0% and 2.6%, respectively. 58% of anosmic subjects have co-existent ageusia and 72.6% of anosmic subjects have no concurrent sinonasal symptoms. OTD is less likely to present in subjects who are asymptomatic for ARI, compared to those symptomatic for ARI (anosmia: 2.0% versus 4.4% p = 0.002; ageusia: 1.6% versus 4.2% p < 0.001). There is a difference in the prevalence of OTD between the different ethnic groups (Indian, Chinese, Bangladeshi and Others), with Chinese and Bangladeshi reporting a higher prevalence (p < 0.043) CONCLUSION: The true prevalence of OTD in COVID-19-positive subjects may be low with aggressive screening of all subjects, including those asymptomatic for ARI.","Soh, Sharon H L; See, Anna; Teo, Neville W Y; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Palaniappan, Gautham; Lim, Melvin L A; Kadir, Hanis B Abdul; Toh, Song Tar",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,592,24

In the current study, we investigated experienced stress in 693 healthcare workers, with hair samples for cortisol analysis collected from a subset of 67 female nurses. The HCCs in two 3 cm hair segments corresponding to periods before and during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 were compared. To evaluate the effect of working in the first line, the sample was divided into two groups based on the COVID-19 risk estimated by the nurses. Covariates in the model included perceived stress (PSS), perceived social support (MSPSS), and quality of sleep (PSQI) measured via an online questionnaire. The data showed that more than 75% of healthcare workers agreed that COVID-19 led to increased stress at their workplace. The hair cortisol analysis showed higher HCCs in the hair segments corresponding to the time of the pandemic compared to hair corresponding to an earlier period (partial Î·290%CI = 0.123-0.397); in the same model, higher HCCs were also found in nurses from high-risk environments compared to low-risk ones (partial Î·290%CI = 0.002-0.176).

Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases. The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression. If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent. Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For those rare children who develop severe or critical disease, this guidance offer an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data.

While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown.

Compared with normal times, internet-based medical platforms including the Haodf website were visited by 1.11 billion people, the number of new registered users of all platforms increased by 10, and the number of new users' daily consultations increased by 9 during the pandemic. The continuous participation of physicians is a major factor in the success of the platform, and economic return is an important reason for physicians to provide internet-based services. However, no study has provided the effectiveness of interactive tools in online health care communities to influence physicians' returns. OBJECTIVE: The effect of internet-based effort on the benefits and effectiveness of interactive effort tools in internet-based health care areas remains unclear. Thus, the goals of this study are to examine the effect of doctors' internet-based service quality on their economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions, to examine the effect of mutual help groups on doctors' economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions, and to explore the moderating effect of disease privacy on doctors' efforts and economic returns during COVID-19 social restrictions. METHODS: On the basis of the social exchange theory, this study establishes an internet-based effort exchange model for doctors. We used a crawler to download information automatically from Haodf website. From March 5 to 7, 2020, which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, cross-sectional information of 2530 doctors were collected. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression showed that disease privacy (ß=.481; P<.001), reputation (ß=.584; P<.001), and service quality (ß=.560; P<.001) had a significant positive effect on the economic returns of the physicians. The influence of mutual help groups on earnings increases with an increase in the degree of disease privacy (ß=.189; P<.001), indicating that mutual help groups have a stronger effect on earnings when patients ask questions about diseases regarding which they desire privacy. CONCLUSIONS: For platform operators, the results of this study can help the platform understand how to improve doctors' economic returns, especially regarding helping a specific doctor group improve its income to retain good doctors. For physicians on the platform, this study will help doctors spend their limited energy and time on tools that can improve internet-based consultation incomes.

Oncology services have been reorganized to decrease the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, but changes in treatment pathways and follow-up cancer care can result in patients receiving suboptimal or delayed care. Herein, we describe a cross-sectional nested cohort study conducted to evaluate delays in care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) in post-treatment follow-up or palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northeast Brazil and its impact on health outcomes. Information was extracted from medical records and supplemented by telephone interviews. We compared the following health outcomes: self-perception of anxiety or sadness, fear of COVID-19 infection, cancer-related complications during social isolation, self-medication, diagnosis of COVID-19, and death between patients with and without delayed cancer care. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Thirty-one HNC patients were included in the study, and no case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was found. Delayed cancer care due to restriction in health services was reported in 58.1% of cases, and there was no report of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancer-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic were described for most patients (67.7%) and included pain or discomfort, swelling, and dyspnea. Eight (25.8%) patients reported use of prescribed morphine or codeine to manage pain and six (19.4%) patients reported self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We found an association between delayed HNC care and the use of self-medication (p = 0.028). This study indicated that patients with delayed HNC care during the COVID-19 outbreak are more likely to use self-medication with NSAIDs for pain management. Better strategies to follow HNC patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities need to be discussed and implemented.","Mahl, Claudiane; Melo, Luís Ricardo Santos de; Almeida, Maria Helena Andrade; Carvalho, Catarina Sampaio; Santos, Lois Lene Silva; Nunes, Paula Santos; Quintans-JÚnior, Lucindo José; AraÚjo, Adriano Antunes de Souza; Santos, Victor Santana; Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo",Braz Oral Res,592,26

RESEARCH AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to determine changes to breastfeeding support services during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic according to trained lactation providers. The secondary aim was to assess strengths and limitations of telehealth services. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted entirely online using the Qualtrics platform during June 2020. Gatekeepers at Connecticut agencies and breastfeeding networks were forwarded an anonymous survey link to distribute to eligible lactation staff. RESULTS: A variety of participants (N = 39) completed the survey and the majority (69.2%; n = 27) were providing only telehealth services. More than half (58.1%; n = 18) of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in-person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistical difficulties, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth. Strengths related to virtual support included the flexibility and convenience of home-based support, expanded communication strategies, and safety from virus exposure. Further, visits with a lactation professional decreased significantly during the pandemic. Limited in-hospital and pediatrician support were also noted, particularly among groups without access to telehealth resources. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the pandemic and associated shifts in lactation services, breastfeeding disparities may be further exacerbated among those without equitable access to lactation support. Challenges and innovations in virtual support may influence adaptive options in the field moving forward.","Schindler-Ruwisch, Jennifer; Phillips, Kathryn E",J Hum Lact,592,27

Here we evaluated the transcriptomic responses of the model cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme after exposure to each of these conditions. Overall, response to UVA was characterized by more gene down-regulation than the UVB or ROS response, although UVB affected over four-fold more genes than UVA or ROS. Regarding expression patterns, responses to UVA and ROS were more similar and differentiated from those to UVB. For example, genes involved in ROS metabolism were up-regulated under both UVA and ROS. However, when it came to RNA and protein metabolism, there were more up-regulated genes under UVB and ROS compared to UVA. This suggests that the response to UVB and ROS is more active than the response to UVA, which stimulated more genes in secondary metabolism. Histidine kinases and response regulators were often differentially expressed, demonstrating that regulatory systems were at the base of the patterns. This study provides background for future studies targeting different genes, proteins, and systems sensitive to these conditions. It also highlights the significance of considering multiple stress conditions.","Soule, Tanya; Ferreira, Daniela; Lothamer, Justin; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran",Photochem. photobiol,592,20

In order to determine the cytoplasmic location signal of PEDV ORF3, we constructed a series of recombinant plasmids carrying full-length or truncated segments of PEDV DR13 ORF3 protein. When the acquired plasmids were transfected into Vero cells, expression and distribution of the EGFP-fused full-length ORF3 protein and its truncated forms in the cells were observed by laser confocal microscopy. The results showed that ORF3 protein or their truncated forms containing 40-91 aa segment including two transmembrane domains were localized in the cytoplasm, whereas ORF3 truncated peptides without the 40-91 aa segment were distributed in the whole cell (in both cytoplasm and nucleus). This suggests that the 40-91 aa is the key structural domain determining cytoplasmic location of PEDV ORF3 protein.

The objective of this paper is to specify and examine early indicators of disease spread risk in cities during the initial stages of outbreak based on patterns of human activities obtained from digital trace data. In this study, the Venables distance (D_v), and the activity density (D_a) are used to quantify and evaluate human activities for 193 US counties, whose cumulative number of confirmed cases was greater than 100 as of March 31, 2020. Venables distance provides a measure of the agglomeration of the level of human activities based on the average distance of human activities across a city or a county (less distance could lead to a greater contact risk). Activity density provides a measure of level of overall activity level in a county or a city (more activity could lead to a greater risk). Accordingly, Pearson correlation analysis is used to examine the relationship between the two human activity indicators and the basic reproduction number in the following weeks. The results show statistically significant correlations between the indicators of human activities and the basic reproduction number in all counties, as well as a significant leader-follower relationship (time lag) between them. The results also show one to two weeks' lag between the change in activity indicators and the decrease in the basic reproduction number. This result implies that the human activity indicators provide effective early indicators for the spread risk of the pandemic during the early stages of the outbreak. Hence, the results could be used by the authorities to proactively assess the risk of disease spread by monitoring the daily Venables distance and activity density in a proactive manner.","Gao, Xinyu; Fan, Chao; Yang, Yang; Lee, Sanghyeon; Li, Qingchun; Maron, Mikel; Mostafavi, Ali",,592,1

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, COPD patients were identified from primary care electronic medical records (EMRs). Twelve process indicators concerning diagnosis, preventative measures and therapeutic processes were developed as a measure of QOC. Educational interventions consisted of clinical seminars and audits on COPD QOC at baseline, and at 12 and 24â months. QOC indicators were stratified by gender: odds ratios (ORs) (males as reference group) of having a good QOC indicator were calculated at baseline, 12 and 24â months, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using hierarchical generalised linear models. Results: Of 46â326 people registered in the EMRs, 1463 COPD patients (3.1%) were identified, of which 37% were women. QOC indicators reflecting best practice 24â months after the educational programme were generally not different to baseline, often favouring men. On the other hand, the composite global QOC indicator suggested that while a good overall QOC at baseline was significantly higher in men than women (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57-0.96), it became nonsignificant at 24â months (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.72-1.29). Conclusions: Specific QOC indicators among COPD patients often favoured men. However, several gender disparities seen at baseline disappeared at 24â months, suggesting that even general educational interventions which do not target gender can improve the gender disparity in QOC.","Isgrò, Valentina; Sultana, Janet; Fontana, Andrea; Ientile, Valentina; Alecci, Umberto; Scoglio, Riccardo; Magliozzo, Francesco; Scondotto, Salvatore; Caramori, Gaetano; Cazzola, Mario; Trifirò, Gianluca",ERJ open res,592,26

COVID-19-positive patients were older and non-White and had more co-morbidities. Furthermore, inflammatory markers and N-terminal-proB-type-natriuretic peptide were higher in COVID-19-positive AMI patients. Only 20.0% (17) of COVID-19-positive patients underwent coronary angiography. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in AMI patients with concomitant COVID-19-positive status (27.9%) than in patients without COVID-19 during the same period (3.7%; p < 0.001). Patients with AMI and COVID-19 tended to be older, with more co-morbidities, when compared to those with an AMI and without COVID-19.

In this literature review, we have focused on the known and postulated mechanisms of action of omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites on various components of the haemostatic system, in particular on blood platelets and endothelium. We have also made an attempt to provide a comprehensive review of epidemiological studies with particular regard to clinical trials. Notably, the results of these studies are contradictory, and some of them failed to report the beneficial effects of taking or supplementing omega-3 PUFAs in the diet. A potential explanation, in our opinion, could be the need to use higher doses of omega-3 PUFAs and a proper ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs. An additional problem which is difficult to solve is the use of a proper neutral placebo for interventional studies. Despite some controversies regarding the beneficial effects of supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs in cardiovascular disease, our review suggests that a promising aspect of future studies and applications is to focus on the anti-thrombotic properties of these compounds.

A fusion system over $S$ is realized by a finite group $G$ if $S$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and morphisms in the category are those induced by conjugation in $G$. One recurrent question in this subject is to find criteria as to whether a given saturated fusion system is realizable or not. One main result in this paper is that a saturated fusion system is realizable if all of its components (in the sense of Aschbacher) are realizable. Another result is that all realizable fusion systems are tame: a finer condition on realizable fusion systems that involves describing automorphisms of a fusion system in terms of those of some group that realizes it. Stated in this way, these results depend on the classification of finite simple groups, but we also give more precise formulations whose proof is independent of the classification.","Broto, Carles; Moller, Jesper; Oliver, Bob; Ruiz, Albert",,592,16

A sample of US adults (N = 1,200) were surveyed in late April to mid-May 2020. The factor structure of adherence was examined using exploratory factor analysis. Machine learning regression models using elastic net regularization were used to examine predictors of adherence. Two factors characterized adherence: avoidance and cleaning. Elastic net models identified differential demographic and psychological predictors of these two forms of adherence. Religious affiliation, denial coping, full-time employment, substance use coping, and being 60 or older predicted lower avoidance adherence. Behavioral and mindfulness emotion regulation skills, agreeableness, and Democrat political affiliation predicted greater avoidance adherence. For cleaning adherence, interpersonal and behavioral emotion regulation skills and conscientiousness emerged as strong predictors of greater cleaning. Efforts to promote compliance with COVID-19 health guidelines may benefit from distinguishing avoidance and cleaning adherence and considering predictors of each of these aspects of adherence.","Bailey, Brooklynn; Whelen, Megan L; Strunk, Daniel R",Applied psychology.

In Germany, a multitude of telemedical systems are already being used, while new approaches are rapidly being developed in response to the crisis. However, the extent of the current implementation within different health care settings, the user's acceptance and perception, as well as the hindering technical and regulatory obstacles remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to assess the current status quo of the availability and routine use of telemedical solutions, user acceptance, and the subjectively perceived burdens on telemedical approaches. Furthermore, we seek to assess the perception of public information quality among professional groups and their preferred communication channels. METHODS: A national online survey was conducted on 14 consecutive days in March and April 2020, and distributed to doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals in the German language. RESULTS: A total of 2827 medical professionals participated in the study. Doctors accounted for 65.6% (n=1855) of the professionals, 29.5% (n=833) were nursing staff, and 4.9% (n=139) were identified as others such as therapeutic staff. A majority of participants rated the significance of telemedicine within the crisis as high (1065/2730, 39%) or neutral (n=720, 26.4%); however, there were significant differences between doctors and nurses (P=.01) as well as between the stationary sector compared to the ambulatory sector (P<.001). Telemedicine was already in routine use for 19.6% (532/2711) of German health care providers and in partial use for 40.2% (n=1090). Participants working in private practices (239/594, 40.2%) or private clinics (23/59, 39.0%) experienced less regulatory or technical obstacles compared to university hospitals (586/1190, 49.2%). A majority of doctors rated the public information quality on COVID-19 as good (942/1855, 50.8%) or very good (213/1855, 11.5%); nurses rated the quality of public information significantly lower (P<.001). Participant's age negatively correlated with the perception of telemedicine's significance (&#961;=-0.23; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has a broad acceptance among German medical professionals. However, to establish telemedical structures within routine care, technical and regulatory burdens must be overcome.","Peine, Arne; Paffenholz, Pia; Martin, Lukas; Dohmen, Sandra; Marx, Gernot; Loosen, Sven H",J Med Internet Res,592,29

This review was conducted to evaluate the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with concurrent co-infections based on the publications reported to date. An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with tuberculosis (RR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.75-2.51; I2 = 0%), influenza (RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 0.15-28.25, I2 = 99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19; I2 = 30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73-1.81; I2 = 10%).

A further caveat is that vitamin D mediates multiple diverse effects. Some of these (anti-fibrosis) are likely beneficial in patients with COVID-19 and pancreatic cancer, whereas others (reduced immunity), may be beneficial through attenuation of the cytokine storm in patients with advanced COVID-19, but detrimental in pancreatic cancer.

In this study, we examined cross-phosphorylation of RprY on tyrosine residues and its importance for RprY function. We show that RprY reacts with phosphotyrosine antibodies, and found that the tyrosine (Y) residue at position 41 is predicted to be solvent accessible. Loss of RprY increased the level of heterotypic community development with Streptococcus gordonii, and the community-suppressive function of RprY required Y41. Expression of the Mfa1 fimbrial adhesin was increased in the rprY mutant and in the mutant complemented with rprY containing a Y41F mutation. In a microscale thermophoresis assay, recombinant RprY protein bound to the promoter region of mfa1, and binding was diminished with RprY containing the Y41F substitution. RprY was required for virulence of P. gingivalis in a murine model of alveolar bone loss. Transcriptional profiling indicated that RprY can control the expression of genes encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS) machinery and virulence factors secreted through the T9SS, including the gingipain proteases and peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD). Collectively, these results establish the RprY response regulator as a component of the tyrosine phosphorylation regulon in P. gingivalis, which can independently control heterotypic community development through the Mfa1 fimbriae and virulence through the T9SS.","Shen, Daonan; Perpich, John D; Stocke, Kendall S; Yakoumatos, Lan; Fitzsimonds, Zackary R; Liu, Chengcheng; Miller, Daniel P; Lamont, Richard J",Mol. oral microbiol.

In this study, we analyzed the molecular, biochemical, and antioxidant properties of GST alpha-4 from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaGSTA-4). Also, the spatial and temporal expression of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge with abiotic and biotic stimulants were evaluated. The HaGSTA-4 ORF encodes 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.7 kDa, and an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 8.47. It consists of the GST_C superfamily and thioredoxin-like superfamily domain. The phylogenetic tree revealed that HaGSTA-4 is evolutionarily conserved with its GST alpha class counterparts. From pairwise alignment, the highest values of identity (78.5%) and similarity (85.7%) were with Parambassis ranga GSTA-4. Protein rHaGSTA-4 exhibited the highest conjugation activity towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) at pH 7 and 20 °C. A disk diffusion assay showed that rHaGSTA-4 significantly protects cells from the stress of exposure to ROS inducers such as CuSO4, CdCl2, and ZnCl2. Furthermore, overexpressed HaGSTA-4 defended cells against oxidative stress caused by H2O2; evidence of selenium-independent peroxidase activity. From qPCR, the tissue-specific expression profile demonstrates that HaGSTA-4 is most highly expressed in the kidney, followed by the intestine and stomach, among fourteen different tissues extracted from healthy seahorses. The mRNA expression profile of HaGSTA-4 upon immune challenge varied depending on the tissue and the time after challenge. Altogether, this study suggests that HaGSTA-4 may be involved in protection against oxidative stress, in immune defense regulation, and xenobiotic metabolism.","Nadarajapillai, Kishanthini; Liyanage, D S; Sellaththurai, Sarithaa; Jeong, Taehyug; Lee, Sukkyoung; Lee, Jehee",Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,592,16

The data of body mass index (BMI) was obtained from follow-up of surviving patients. According to BMI, normal weight was defined as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2 and obesity as > 28.0 kg/m2. Results: A total of 463 patients were enrolled, of which 242 (52.3%) patients were in the normal weight group; 179 (38.7%) were in the overweight group; and 42 (9.1%) were in the obesity group.

Yet, there are few randomized trials demonstrating that reducing SB improves cardiovascular health. The Effect of Reducing Sedentary Behavior on Blood Pressure (RESET BP) randomized clinical trial addresses this gap by testing the effect of a 3-month SB reduction intervention on resting systolic BP. Secondary outcomes include other BP measures, pulse wave velocity, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, and objectively-measured SB (via thigh-mounted activPAL) and physical activity (via waist-worn GT3X accelerometer). RESET BP has a targeted recruitment of 300 adults with desk jobs, along with elevated, non-medicated BP (systolic BP 120-159 mmHg or diastolic BP 80-99 mmHg) and physical inactivity (self-reported aerobic physical activity below recommended levels). The multi-component intervention promotes 2-4 fewer hours of SB per day by replacing sitting with standing and light-intensity movement breaks. Participants assigned to the intervention condition receive a sit-stand desk attachment, a wrist-worn activity prompter, behavioral counseling every two weeks (alternating in-person and phone), and twice-weekly automated text messages. Herein, we review the study rationale, describe and evaluate recruitment strategies based on enrollment to date, and detail the intervention and assessment protocols. We also document our mid-trial adaptations to participant recruitment, intervention deployment, and outcome assessments due to the intervening COVID-19 pandemic. Our research methods, experiences to date, and COVID-specific accommodations could inform other research studying BP and hypertension or targeting working populations, including those seeking remote methods.","Barone Gibbs, Bethany; Conroy, Molly B; Huber, Kimberly; Muldoon, Matthew F; Perera, Subashan; Jakicic, John M",Contemp Clin Trials,592,16

However, only limited PRMCECL nanoluminophores and their applications in ratiometric biosensors eliminating proportional errors have been reported. Herein, a novel PRMCECL nanoluminophore was synthesized by encapsulating CdS quantum dots (CdSQDs) into MOF-5 (CdSQDs@MOF-5). Using K2S2O8 as a coreactant, two electrochemiluminescence (ECL) peaks, ECL-1 centered at 685 nm and ECL-2 centered at 475 nm, were observed at -1.4 V and -1.8 V, respectively. Related ECL mechanisms have been proposed. Based on the potential-resolved ECL signals, a label-free differential ECL immunosensor for the determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was established by assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), CdSQDs@MOF-5 and cTnI antibody functionalized silver nanoparticles on the surface of fluorine doped tin oxide electrode subsequently. In the presence of cTnI, cTnI was captured by the sensing interface, leading to an increase in ECL-1 and ECL-2 intensity. cTnI could be determined in the range of 0.01 - 1000 pg/mL with a detection limit of 5.01 fg/mL by using intensity difference between ECL-1 and ECL-2. This work provides a new family member of PRMCECL nanoluminophores. The proposed label-free differential ECL immunosensor provides a new strategy based on potential-resolved ECL signals, which could effectively eliminate the additive error and show better sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of cTnI than single-signal strategy and ratiometric strategy.","Du, Dexin; Shu, Jiangnan; Guo, Mingquan; Haghighatbin, Mohammad Amin; Yang, Di; Bian, Zhiping; Cui, Hua",Anal. chem,592,30

Universally, most sex work has largely reduced, moved online, or undertaken covertly because of lockdown measures and need for social distancing to break the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, the ability of sex workers to protect themselves against COVID-19 depends on their individual and interpersonal behaviors and work environment. In this study, we sought to determine the relationships between COVID-19 knowledge, awareness and prevention practice (KAP) among female commercial sex workers (FCSW) in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria to inform the development of prevention interventions for this vulnerable population. Methods: Data used in this study were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 604 FCSW operating in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to assess their socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 KAP adopted against the novel coronavirus. Latent class analysis was used to systematically classify participants' attributes and behaviors into the most likely distinct clusters or risk groups. Results: The majority of the FCSW were singles (86.8%) of childbearing ages, 21-35 years (86.2%), with almost three quarters (73.2%) of them having sex with 3-4 clients per day during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, almost three quarters of the participants had both good knowledge and awareness about COVID-19 but less than half of them (41.1%) implemented good practice to prevent the spread of the disease. However, a highly significant and positive relationship was recorded between COVID-19 knowledge (r=0.90, p&lt;0.0001) and awareness (r=0.65, p&lt;0.0001), and preventive practice of FCSW, respectively. About 89.1% of the participants were not very familiar with the symptoms of COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001). Only 10.9% of the FCSW indicated that they wear facemask at all times, while 45.2% of them do not wear facemask during sexual intercourse with their clients (p&lt;0.0001). Based on the FCSW attributes and behaviors, we identified three distinct clusters or risk groups (p&lt;0.0001), namely, low-risk takers (Cluster 1), high-risk takers (Cluster 2) and very high-risk takers (Cluster 3) with latent class prevalence rates (gammac) of 41.13% (95% CI: 37.26-45.10), 33.17% (95% CI: 29.53-37.02) and 25.71% (95% CI: 22.38-29.34), respectively. Conclusion: Sex work has high transmission potentials for SARS-CoV-2 because of its operational nature, which does not permit social distancing, and thus, renders certain preventive measures practically ineffective. This is a major challenge in the fight against COVID-19 in this high-risk group and calls for the development of operational guidelines and targeted intervention strategies to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the Niger Delta region.","Avwioro, G.; Egwunyenga, A.; Adjekuko, C.; Mgbere, O.; Odibo, E.; Iyiola, S.; Enitan, S.

Corticosteroids reduce the time on mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and potentially also mortality in similar patient populations. However, corticosteroids have undesirable effects, including longer time to viral clearance. Clinical equipoise on the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 exists. METHODS: The COVID STEROID trial is an international, randomised, stratified, blinded clinical trial. We will allocate 1000 adult patients with COVID-19 receiving &#8805;10 L/min of oxygen or on mechanical ventilation to intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg daily vs placebo (0.9% saline) for 7 days. The primary outcome is days alive without life support (ie mechanical ventilation, circulatory support, and renal replacement therapy) at day 28. Secondary outcomes are serious adverse reactions at day 14; days alive without life support at day 90; days alive and out of hospital at day 90; all-cause mortality at day 28, day 90, and 1 year; and health-related quality of life at 1 year. We will conduct the statistical analyses according to this protocol, including interim analyses for every 250 patients followed for 28 days. The primary outcome will be compared using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test in the intention to treat population and reported as differences in means and medians with 95% confidence intervals. DISCUSSION: The COVID STEROID trial will provide important evidence to guide the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 and severe hypoxia.","Petersen, Marie Warrer; Meyhoff, Tine Sylvest; Helleberg, Marie; Kjaer, Maj-Brit Nørregaard; Granholm, Anders; Hjortsø, Carl Johan Steensen; Jensen, Thomas Steen; Møller, Morten Hylander; Hjortrup, Peter Buhl; Wetterslev, Mik; Vesterlund, Gitte Kingo; Russell, Lene; Jørgensen, Vibeke Lind; Tjelle, Klaus; Benfield, Thomas; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Andreasen, Anne Sofie; Mohr, Thomas; Bestle, Morten H; Poulsen, Lone Musaeus; Hitz, Mette Friberg; Hildebrandt, Thomas; Knudsen, Lene Surland; Møller, Anders; Sølling, Christoffer Grant; Brøchner, Anne Craveiro; Rasmussen, Bodil Steen; Nielsen, Henrik; Christensen, Steffen; Strøm, Thomas; Cronhjort, Maria; Wahlin, Rebecka Rubenson; Jakob, Stephan; Cioccari, Luca; Venkatesh, Balasubramanian; Hammond, Naomi; Jha, Vivekanand; Myatra, Sheila Nainan; Gluud, Christian; Lange, Theis; Perner, Anders",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,592,24

The performance of a respiratory mask depends on the efficiency of the filter layer which is mostly made of polypropylene melt blown non-woven (PP-MB-NW). So far, very limited characterization data are available for the PPE-MB-NW in terms to achieve desired particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) against 0.3 µm size, which are imperative in order to facilitate the right selection of PP-MB-NW fabric for the development of mask. In present study, eight different kinds of PP-MB-NW fabrics (Sample A-H) of varied structural morphology are chosen. The different PP-MB-NW were characterized for its pore size and distribution by mercury porosimeter and BET surface area analyzer was explored first time to understand the importance of blind pore in PFE. The PP-MB-NW samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy so as to know the surface morphology. The filtration efficiency, pressure drop and breathing resistance of various PP-MB-NW fabric samples are investigated in single and double layers combination against the particle size of 0.3, 0.5 and 1 µm. The samples which are having low pore dia, high solid fraction volume, and low air permeability has high filtration efficiency (> 90%) against 0.3 µm particle with high pressure drop (16.3-21.3 mm WC) and breathing resistance (1.42-1.92 mbar) when compared to rest of the samples. This study will pave the way for the judicial selection of right kind of filter layer i.e., PP-MB-NW fabric for the development of mask and it will be greatly helpful in manufacturing of mask in this present pandemic with desired PFE indicating considerable promise for defense against respiratory pandemic.","Pandey, Lokesh K; Singh, Virendra V; Sharma, Pushpendra K; Meher, Damayanti; Biswas, Utpal; Sathe, Manisha; Ganesan, Kumaran; Thakare, Vikas B; Agarwal, Kavita",Sci Rep,592,8

Public health responses have focused on identifying symptomatic individuals to halt spread. However, evidence is accruing that asymptomatic individuals are infectious and contributing to this global pandemic. METHODS: Observational data of 320 index cases and their 1289 positive contacts from the National COVID-19 Database in Bahrain were used to analyze symptoms, infectivity rate and PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) values. RESULTS: No significant difference (p = 1.0) in proportions of symptomatic (n = 160; 50.0%) and asymptomatic index cases (n = 160; 50.0%) were seen; however, SARS-CoV-2 positive contact cases were predominantly asymptomatic (n = 1127, 87.4%). Individuals aged 0-19 years constituted a larger proportion of positive contact cases (20.8%) than index cases (4.7%; p < 0.001). A total of 22% of the positive contacts were infected by symptomatic male index cases aged between 30-39 years. The total numbers of exposed contacts (p = 0.33), infected contacts (p = 0.81) and hence infectivity rate (p = 0.72) were not different between symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases. PCR Ct values were higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic index cases (p < 0.001), and higher in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic positive contacts (p < 0.001). No differences between the infectivity rates of index cases with Ct values <30 and values &#8805;30 were observed (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: These data reveal that the high asymptomatic incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Bahrain and subsequent positive contacts from an index case were more likely to be asymptomatic, showing the high ""silent"" risk of transmission and need for comprehensive screening for each positive infection to help halt the ongoing pandemic.","Almadhi, Marwa Ali; Abdulrahman, Abdulkarim; Sharaf, Sayed Ali; AlSaad, Dana; Stevenson, Nigel J; Atkin, Stephen L; AlQahtani, Manaf M",Int J Infect Dis,592,22

METHODS: This was a study of a pilot pathway performed at Barts Heart Centre for the admission of patients requiring elective coronary and structural procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020). All patients on coronary and structural waiting lists were screened for procedural indications, urgency and adverse features for COVID-19 prognosis and discussed at dedicated multidisciplinary teams. Dedicated admission pathways involving preadmission isolation, additional consent, COVID-19 PCR testing and dedicated clean areas were used. RESULTS: 143 patients (101 coronary and 42 structural) underwent procedures (coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, transcatheter aortic valve intervention and MitralClip) during the study period. The average age was 68.2; 74% were male; and over 93% had one or more moderate COVID-19 risk factors. All patients were COVID-19 PCR negative on admission with (8.1%) COVID-19 antibody positive (swab negative). All procedures were performed successfully with low rates of procedural complications (9.8%). At 2-week follow-up, no patients had symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 infection with significant improvements in quality if life and symptoms. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patients undergoing coronary and structural procedures can be safely admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no patients contracting COVID-19 during their admission. Reassuringly, patients reflective of typical practice, that is, those at moderate or higher risk, were treated successfully. This pilot provides important information applicable to other settings, specialties and areas to reintroduce services safely.","Hamshere, Stephen; Comer, Katrina; Choudhry, Fizzah; Rathod, Krishna; Mills, Gordon; Ferguson, Gordon; Lambourne, Jonathan; Akhtar, Majid; Wragg, Andrew; Ozkor, Mick; Guttmann, Oliver; Mullen, Michael; Baumbach, Andreas; Smith, Elliot; Mathur, Anthony; Jones, Dan",,592,20

This 'population self-reliance in health' is the focus of the 4th Tier in the health system which honours and respects an individual's capacity for self-care and their inherent responsibility to the health system and its values. It encourages the inclusion of this knowledge in the creation of health systems and in the policies that direct them.

We review the antibody response that is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of humans and how it may inform vaccine research. The isolation and properties of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients provide additional information on what vaccines should try to elicit. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to coronaviruses are relevant to the potency and duration of vaccine-induced immunity. We summarize the immunogenicity of leading vaccine candidates tested to date in animals and humans and discuss the outcome and interpretation of virus challenge experiments in animals. By far the most immunogenic vaccine candidates for antibody responses are recombinant proteins, which were not included in the initial wave of Warp Speed immunogens. A substantial concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is adverse events, which we review by considering what was seen in studies of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) vaccines. We conclude by outlining the possible outcomes of the Warp Speed vaccine program, which range from the hoped-for rapid success to a catastrophic adverse influence on vaccine uptake generally.","Moore, John P; Klasse, P J",J. virol,592,16

Although the oncogenic role of Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) was investigated in several lines, the expression and function of DAAM in CRC are still obscure. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression and function of DAAM in CRC. METHODS: DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression in high grade dysplasia (HGD), CRCs and corresponding adjacent tissues were detected with qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic significance of DAAM1/2 were estimated with univariate and multivariate analyses. Moreover, the correlations between clinicopathological factors and DAAM were evaluated with the &#967;2 test. With experiments in vitro, we investigated the function of DAAM2 in CRC cell proliferation and invasion, and investigated the underlying mechanism of how DAAM2 facilitated CRC invasion. RESULTS: DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was substantially up-regulated in CRCs compared with paired adjacent normal tissues and HGDs. The ratio of high DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression accounted for 44.83% and 46.31%, respectively. High DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was a risk factor indicating an unfavorable prognosis of CRC. In multivariate analysis, high DAAM2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of CRC predicting poor prognosis. With experiments in vitro, DAAM2 promoted invasion of CRC cells via activating PAK1 and promoting the expression of MMP7, suggesting an essential role of DAAM2 in CRC invasion. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, indicated an unfavorable prognosis of CRC independently, which suggested that detecting DAAM2 can help define the high-risk patients. DAAM2 activated PAK1 and promoted MMP7 expression and facilitated the invasion of CRC cells, indicating that DAAM2 may be a potential drug target of CRC.","Chen, Aimei; Liu, Zhiqiang; Wu, Quanyan; Li, Hailin",Genes &amp; genomics (Online),592,23

METHODS: We included the first 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taiwan. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were extracted from outbreak investigation reports and medical records. RESULTS: Illness onset of the 100 patients was during January 11 to March 16, 2020. Twenty-nine (29%) had at least one underlying condition and ten (10%) were asymptomatic. Seventy-one were imported, including four clusters. Twenty-nine were locally-acquired, including four clusters.

Many people around the world have vitamin D deficiency and, therefore, this has become a public concern whether vitamin D is an important factor protecting against COVID-19 infection. In this paper, the data about the roles of vitamin D on immunity and recovery from viral infections, especially novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reviewed. METHODS: The electronic databases of Pubmed, Google Scholar, Research Gate, Excerpta Media Database (EMBASE) and Medical and Health Education (Medrix) were searched. RESULTS: Vitamin D is considered an important factor in immune homeostasis. Various effects have been considered for this nutrient on the immune system, particularly because of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) expression in most of the immune cells. Vitamin D can raise cellular immunity, reduce cytokine storm and enhance antioxidants production. It also has modulatory effects on Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and might have protective functions against acute lung injuries, including COVID-19 infection. However, there are some articles against this positive effect. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation is reported to be effective in the enhancement of the immune system and might be effective in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection, especially in those with its deficiency. However, it should be considered that vitamin D deficiency shows the overall health status of the patients and cannot be considered specific for COVID-19 infection.Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery.","Aleebrahim-Dehkordi, Elahe; Deravi, Niloofar; Yaghoobpoor, Shirin; Hooshyar, Dariush; Rafieian-Kopaei, Mahmoud",Curr. pharm. des,592,26

This study evaluated the predictive value of sACE2 in the context of other known biomarkers of inflammation and tissue damage (C-reactive protein [CRP], growth/differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [sFlt-1]) in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 with different clinical outcomes. Methods: For univariate analyses, median differences between biomarker levels were calculated for the following patient groups classified according to clinical outcome: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive (Groups 1 - 4); RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative following previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (Groups 5 and 6); and RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative controls (Group 7). Results: Median levels of CRP, GDF-15, IL-6, and sFlt-1 were significantly higher in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to hospital compared with patients who were discharged (all p<0.001), whereas levels of sACE2 were significantly lower (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of sACE2 provided cut-offs for the prediction of hospital admission of [≤]0.05 ng/mL (positive predictive value: 89.1%) and [≥]0.42 ng/mL (negative predictive value: 84.0%). Conclusion: These findings support further investigation of sACE2, either as a single biomarker or as part of a panel, to predict hospitalisation risk and disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Troyano, Noelia Diaz; Medina, Pablo Gabriel; Weber, Stephen; Klammer, Martin; Barquin-DelPino, Raquel; Castillo-Ribelles, Laura; Esteban, Angels; Hernández-González, Manuel; Ferrer-Costa, Roser; Pumarola, Tomas; Frias, Francisco Rodriguez",,592,14

We use data augmentation schemes to facilitate the conditional likelihood, and render the model conditionally Gaussian to develop an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm. Regularization of the high-dimensional parameter space is achieved via flexible dynamic shrinkage priors. A simple version of the TVP-QR based on an unobserved component (UC) model is applied to dynamically trace the quantiles of the distribution of inflation in the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and the euro area (EA). We conduct an out-of-sample inflation forecasting exercise to assess predictive accuracy of the proposed framework versus several benchmarks using metrics to capture performance in different parts of the distribution. The proposed model is competitive and performs particularly well for higher-order and tail forecasts. We analyze the resulting predictive distributions and find that they are often skewed and feature heavier than normal tails.","Pfarrhofer, Michael",,592,24

ObjectiveTo estimate the uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in HCWs and to expand our knowledge regarding the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. MethodsAn on-line cross-sectional study was conducted in Greece during August 2021. We collected socio-demographic data of HCWs and we measured attitudes towards vaccination and COVID-19, knowledge and trust. We used a convenience sample since we distributed the questionnaire through social media and e-mails. ResultsStudy population included 855 HCWs. The majority of HCWs were vaccinated against the COVID-19 (91.5%). According to multivariate analysis, females, HCWs without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and HCWs with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Also, increased self-perceived knowledge regarding COVID-19 and increased trust in COVID-19 vaccines and government regarding the information about the COVID-19 vaccines were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, HCWs with more concerns about the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccination were more reluctant to take a COVID-19 vaccine. ConclusionsOur study provides a timely assessment of COVID-19 vaccination status among HCWs and identifies specific factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. By understanding these factors, policy makers and scientists will be able to develop novel strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake among HCWs.","Galanis, Petros A; Moisoglou, Ioannis; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,592,16

Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients develop severe illness, and approximately 40% of those with severe illness eventually die, corresponding to more than 2.78 million people. The pathological characteristics of COVID-19 resemble typical sepsis, and severe COVID-19 has been identified as viral sepsis. Progress in sepsis research is important for improving the clinical care of these patients. Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of sepsis have led to the view that an uncontrolled inflammatory response and oxidative stress are core factors. However, in the traditional treatment of sepsis, it is difficult to achieve a balance between the inflammation, pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi), and patient tolerance, resulting in high mortality of patients with sepsis. In recent years, nanomaterials mediating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and the inflammatory response have shown previously unattainable therapeutic effects on sepsis. Despite these advantages, RONS and inflammatory response-based nanomaterials have yet to be extensively adopted as sepsis therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no review has yet discussed the pathogenesis of sepsis and the application of nanomaterials. To help bridge this gap, we discuss the pathogenesis of sepsis related to inflammation and the overproduction RONS, which activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. We also summarize the application of nanomaterials in the treatment of sepsis. As highlighted here, this strategy could synergistically improve the therapeutic efficacy against both RONS and inflammation in sepsis and may prolong survival. Current challenges and future developments for sepsis treatment are also summarized.","Chen, Li; Huang, Qiong; Zhao, Tianjiao; Sui, Lihua; Wang, Shuya; Xiao, Zuoxiu; Nan, Yayun; Ai, Kelong",Redox Biol,592,26

Because CTs come at a high financial cost, lower cost real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 tests are critical due to their ability to identify asymptomatic carriers and properly handle patients during the ongoing pandemic. However, unlike RT-PCR, CT scans can also provide insight into the progression of the virus. The signs of acute COVID-19 infection include unique patterns of ground-glass opacities (GGO) with vascular thickening, enabling radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 with a high specificity.

Social distancing measures that were implemented to control the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus outbreak were investigated for their ability to lessen the incident cases of seasonal influenza. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using data from Canada's national influenza surveillance system to investigate whether social distancing measures to control COVID-19 reduced the incident cases of seasonal influenza. Data taken from three separate time frames facilitated analysis of the 2019-2020 influenza season prior to, during, and following the implementation of COVID-19-related measures and enabled comparisons with the same time periods during three preceding flu seasons. The incidence, which referred to the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of specific influenza strains, was of primary focus. Further analysis determined the number of new laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness outbreaks. RESULTS: Our results indicate a premature end to the 2019-2020 influenza season, with significantly fewer cases and outbreaks being recorded following the enactment of many COVID-19 social distancing policies. The incidence of influenza strains A (H3N2), A (unsubtyped), and B were all significantly lower at the tail end of the 2019-2020 influenza season as compared with preceding seasons (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0019). CONCLUSION: Specific social distancing measures and behaviours may serve as effective tools to limit the spread of influenza transmission moving forward, as they become more familiar.","Pierce, Andrew; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; Marin, Diana; Rueda, Zulma V; Keynan, Yoav",Can J Public Health,592,26

BACKGROUND: The role of DM is to minimize and prevent further spread of the contagion over an extended period of time. This requires addressing large-scale logistics, coordination, and specialized training needs. However, DM-related challenges during the pandemic response and recovery are significantly different than with other kinds of disasters. METHOD: An expert review was conducted to document issues relevant to human factors and ergonomics (HFE) in DM. RESULTS: The response to the COVID-19 crisis has presented complex and unique challenges to DM and public health practitioners. Compared to other disasters and previous pandemics, the COVID-19 outbreak has had an unprecedented scale, magnitude, and propagation rate. The high technical complexity of response and DM coupled with lack of mental model and expertise to respond to such a unique disaster has seriously challenged the response work systems. Recent research has investigated the role of HFE in modeling DM systems' characteristics to improve resilience, accelerating emergency management expertise, developing agile training methods to facilitate dynamically changing response, improving communication and coordination among system elements, mitigating occupational hazards including guidelines for the design of personal protective equipment, and improving procedures to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of response efforts. CONCLUSION: This short review highlights the potential for the field's contribution to proactive and resilient DM for the ongoing and future pandemics.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Moats, Jason; Mehta, Ranjana; Peres, S Camille",Hum Factors,592,20

Midwives' experiences related to postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) management remain unexplored, especially in Limpopo. The purpose of the study was to explore the challenges experienced by midwives in the management of women with PPH. Methods: Qualitative research was conducted to explore the challenges experienced by midwives in the management of women with PPH. Midwives were sampled purposefully. Unstructured interviews were conducted on 18 midwives working at primary health care facilities. Data were analysed after data saturation. Results: After data analysis, one theme emerged ""challenges experienced by midwives managing women with PPH"" and five subthemes, including: ""difficulty experienced resulting in feelings of frustrations and confusion and lack of time and shortage of human resource inhibits guidelines consultation"". Conclusion: The study findings revealed that midwives experienced difficulty when managing women with postpartum haemorrhage. For successful implementation of maternal health care guidelines, midwives should be capacitated through training, supported and supervised in order to execute PPH management with ease.","Ramavhoya, Thifhelimbilu Irene; Maputle, Maria Sonto; Lebese, Rachel Tsakani; Makhado, Lufuno",Afr Health Sci,592,17

Ventilation has been widely recognized as an efficient engineering control measure for airborne transmission. Room ventilation with an increased supply of clean outdoor air could dilute the expiratory airborne aerosols to a lower concentration level. However, sufficient increase is beyond the capacity of most of the existing mechanical ventilation systems that were designed to be energy efficient under non-pandemic conditions. We propose an improved control strategy based on source control, which would be achieved by implementing intermittent breaks in room occupancy, specifically that all occupants should leave the room periodically and the room occupancy time should be reduced as much as possible. Under the assumption of good mixing of clean outdoor supply air with room air, the evolution of the concentration in the room of aerosols exhaled by infected person(s) is predicted. The risk of airborne cross-infection is then evaluated by calculating the time-averaged intake fraction. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated for a case study of a typical classroom. This strategy, together with other control measures such as continuous supply of maximum clean air, distancing, face-to-back layout of workstations and reducing activities that increase aerosol generation (e.g., loudly talking and singing), is applicable in classrooms, offices, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc.","Melikov, A K; Ai, Z T; Markov, D G",Sci Total Environ,592,16

Data regarding the effectiveness of these drugs in treating COVID-19 has been shown in some trials and clinical settings, but further randomised controlled trials are still being carried out. One of the main concerns regarding their widespread use however, are their possible effects on the QT interval and their arrhythmogenic potential. Some of this drugs have been in fact associated to QT prolongation and Torsades de Point, a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia. Aim of this review is to highlight the magnitude of this problem, to quickly refresh clinically impacting cornerstones of QT interval and TdP pathophysiology, to summarize the available evidence regarding the QT and arrhythmia impact of drugs used in different clinical settings in COVID-19 patients, and to help the physician dealing with the knowledge needed in the everyday clinical duties in case of doubts regarding QT-induced arrhythmias in this time of emergency.","Gasperetti, Alessio; Schiavone, Marco; Tondo, Claudio; Mitacchione, Gianfranco; Viecca, Maurizio; Galli, Massimo; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Forleo, Giovanni Battista",Current clinical pharmacology (Online),592,21

Accordingly, hospitals had to implement strategies to profoundly reshape both non-COVID-19 medical care and surgical activities. Knowledge about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery practice is pivotal. The goal of the present study was to describe the changes in cardiac surgery practices during the health emergency at the national level. METHODS: A 26-question web-enabled survey including all adult cardiac surgery units in Italy was conducted to assess how their clinical practice changed during the national lockdown. Data were compared to data from the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: All but 2 centres (94.9%) adopted specific protocols to screen patients and personnel. A significant reduction in the number of dedicated cardiac intensive care unit beds (-35.4%) and operating rooms (-29.2%), along with healthcare personnel reallocation to COVID departments (nurses -15.4%, anaesthesiologists -7.7%), was noted. Overall adult cardiac surgery volumes were dramatically reduced (1734 procedures vs 3447; P < 0.001), with a significant drop in elective procedures [580 (33.4%) vs 2420 (70.2%)]. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey found major changes in cardiac surgery practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience should lead to the development of permanent systems-based plans to face possible future pandemics. These data may effectively help policy decision-making in prioritizing healthcare resource reallocation during the ongoing pandemic and once the healthcare emergency is over.","Rubino, Antonino Salvatore; De Santo, Luca Salvatore; Pisano, Antonio; Mauro, Michele di; Benussi, Stefano; Borghetti, Valentino; Castiglioni, Alessandro; Chiariello, Luigi; Colli, Andrea; De Bellis, Antonio; De Filippo, Carlo Maria; De Paulis, Ruggero; Di Benedetto, Giuseppe; Di Eusanio, Marco; Faggian, Giuseppe; Fiorani, Brenno; Fratto, Pasquale Antonio; Giuffrida, Angelo Giuseppe; Glauber, Mattia; Iannelli, Gabriele; Iesu, Severino; Livi, Ugolino; Martinelli, Gianluca; Massetti, Massimo; Mastroroberto, Pasquale; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Minniti, Giuseppe; Miraldi, Fabio; Montesi, Gianfranco; Musumeci, Francesco; Nicolini, Francesco; Napoleone, Carlo Pace; Panisi, Paolo; Pappalardo, Aniello; Patanè, Francesco; Ragni, Temistocle; Rinaldi, Mauro; Tribastone, Salvatore; Triggiani, Michele; Tritto, Francesco Paolo; Zebele, Carlo; Parolari, Alessandro; Gerosa, Gino; De Feo, Marisa",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,592,6

The nation's transportation infrastructure was built at the expense of Black communities and has contributed to and sustained the underdevelopment of Black America, often making it difficult for Black people to take advantage of society's opportunities.11 The benefits and burdens of our transportation system-highways, roads, bridges, sidewalks, and public transit-have been planned, developed, and sustained to pull resources from Black communities that are subsequently deployed and invested to the benefit of predominantly white communities and their residents.12 We continue to see the effects of underdevelopment. Part II briefly explains and explores Manning Marable's theory of underdevelopment.19 Part III applies Marable's theory to transportation policy in the United States, connecting his theory of underdevelopment to a history of transportation policies that destroyed, isolated, and segregated Black communities, leading to the underdevelopment of those communities and their residents.20 Part IV proposes a way forward.21 Despite the wide-ranging impact that transportation decisions have on civil rights and racial equity concerns, transportation policy has not been widely embraced as a pressing civil rights concern.22 Finally, Part V concludes.23 This Essay argues that moving forward, advocates must harness the power of civil rights laws to dismantle systems and structures of racial inequality and the discrimination at the intersection of race, class, and place.24 To do so, advocates must re-envision these laws as tools for community equity.25 II. Manning Marable's Theory of Underdevelopment A common framework for understanding how racism works in America is to focus on the way white supremacy and structural racism have led to the exclusion of Black people from the economic, social, and political gains experienced by other groups.26 Indeed, America is profoundly segregated along racial lines, with white communities of opportunity on the one hand and many communities of color without access to quality schools, jobs transportation, or health care on the other.","Archer, Deborah N.",Iowa Law Review,592,9

METHODS: A population-based household survey was performed, from July 27, 2020 to August 8, 2020. The estimates considered clustering, stratification and non-response. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas® e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2.

Through these signals we generate pseudo-queries and their respective pseudo-positive (relevant documents) and pseudo-negative (non-relevant documents) examples. The article retrieval process combines a ranking model based on term-maching techniques and a neural one based on pretrained BERT models. BERT models are fine-tuned to the task using the pseudo-qrels generated. We compare different BERT models, both open domain and biomedical domain, and also the generated pseudo-qrels with the open domain MS-Marco dataset for fine-tuning the models.

Nevertheless, much of this attention has been focused on outdoor interactions. Each year, 3.8 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to indoor air. Hence, poor household indoor air quality is a long-standing public health issue with even greater relevance now that many individuals are spending more time at home. At present, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate indoor air, and state-level legislation has resulted in a patchwork of national coverage. Here, we describe common sources of indoor air pollution, the health impacts of indoor pollutants, and populations disparately impacted by COVID-19 and poor indoor air quality. Furthermore, we detail the need for better legislation that promotes the integrity of the indoor air environment, and what individuals can do to personally protect themselves as we await more comprehensive indoor air legislation.","Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Allen, Joseph G; Beamer, Paloma I",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,592,16

Persons with disabilities may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to underlying medical conditions that have been associated with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe self-reported hygiene behaviors among U.S. adults with disabilities to prevent transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were obtained from the March 2020 Porter Novelli ConsumerStyles survey. This study includes 6463 U.S. adults (&#8805;18 years) who participated in the survey (58.2% response rate). Participants were asked about frequent handwashing and surface disinfection. Participants were also asked six questions to assess disability status and disability type. Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated; chi-square tests were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1295 (20.3%) of survey participants reported at least one disability and their hygiene-related behavior. Overall, 91.3% of respondents with disabilities reported frequent handwashing; only 72% reported frequent surface disinfection. Those with hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living disabilities (range: 77.9%-90.6%) were significantly less likely than those without any disability (94.0%) to report frequent handwashing. People with vision (62.2%) and independent living (66.8%) disabilities were less likely to report frequent surface disinfection than those without any disability (74.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Practices such as handwashing and disinfecting surfaces are effective for reducing and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Promotion of hygiene-related practices among people with disabilities is essential.

We aimed to establish predictive models for COVID-19 pneumonia severity in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Retrospective study of 430 patients admitted in Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona) between 03-12-2020 and 04-28-2020 due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Two models to identify the patients who required high-flow-oxygen-support were generated, one using baseline data and another with also follow-up analytical results. Calibration was performed by a 1000-bootstrap replication model. RESULTS: 249 were male, mean age 57.9 years. Overall, 135 (31.4%) required high-flow-oxygen-support. The baseline predictive model showed a ROC of 0.800 based on: SpO2/FiO2 (adjusted Hazard Ratio-aHR = 8), chest x-ray (aHR = 4), prior immunosuppressive therapy (aHR = 4), obesity (aHR = 2), IL-6 (aHR = 2), platelets (aHR = 0.5).

The mortality rate for critically ill patients is up to 60%, and, thus, reducing the disease severity and case mortality is a top priority. Currently, cytokine storms are considered as the major cause of critical illness and death due to COVID-19. After a systematical review of the literature, we propose that cross-reactive antibodies associated with antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may actually be the cause of cytokine storms. It would be more difficult to develop vaccines for highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) if ADE characteristics are taken into consideration. Therefore, it is urgent to find an effective way to prevent the occurrence of severe illness as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 specific drugs or vaccines are still in development. If the activation of memory B cells can be selectively inhibited in high-risk patients at an early stage of COVID-19 to reduce the production of cross-reactive antibodies against the virus, we speculate that ADE can be circumvented and severe symptoms can be prevented. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors satisfy such needs and it is recommended to conduct clinical trials for mTOR inhibitors in preventing the severity of COVID-19.","Zheng, Yunfeng; Li, Renfeng; Liu, Shunai",J. med. virol,592,16

We hypothesized that the polymorphism of mRNA could be applied to identifying individuals in mixture samples composed of two body fluids. In this study, we selected 5 blood-specific mRNA biomarkers of venous blood (SPTB, CD3G, AMICA1, ANK1, GYPA) that encompass 16 SNPs to identify the mixture contributor(s). Five specific gene markers for menstrual blood, semen, skin, saliva and vaginal secretions were amplified and typed as body-fluid positive controls. We established the system of multiplex PCR and single base extension reaction (SBE) followed by capillary electrophoresis. The amplicon size was between 90bp-294bp. The peripheral blood specificity was examined against other human body fluids, including saliva, semen, skin, menstrual blood, and vaginal secretion. The 16 SNPs were peripheral blood specific and could be successfully typed in home-made mixtures which are composed of different body fluids with 1ng peripheral blood mRNA added. This system showed a super sensitivity (1:100) in detecting the trace amount of peripheral blood mixed in other body fluids and a combined discrimination power (CDP) of 0.99929 in Chinese population. It was the first time to establish a method of identifying the blood donors and deconvoluting mixtures through detecting mRNA polymorphism with SNaPshot assay.

We investigated (N = 678) the impact of such misinformation on hypothetical demand (i.e., willingness-to-pay) for an unproven treatment, and propensity to promote (i.e., like or share) misinformation online. This is a novel approach, as previous research has used mainly questionnaire-based measures of reasoning. We also tested two interventions to counteract the misinformation, contrasting a tentative refutation based on materials used by health authorities with an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations. We found prior exposure to misinformation increased misinformation promotion (by 18%). Both tentative and enhanced refutations reduced demand (by 18% and 25%, respectively) as well as misinformation promotion (by 29% and 55%). The fact that enhanced refutations were more effective at curbing promotion of misinformation highlights the need for debunking interventions to follow current best-practice guidelines.","MacFarlane, Douglas; Tay, Li Qian; Hurlstone, Mark J; Ecker, Ullrich K H",,592,7

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. RECOMMENDATIONS: Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.","Nicholls, Stephen J; Nelson, Mark; Astley, Carolyn; Briffa, Tom; Brown, Alex; Clark, Robyn; Colquhoun, David; Gallagher, Robyn; Hare, David L; Inglis, Sally; Jelinek, Michael; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Tirimacco, Rosy; Vale, Margarite; Redfern, Julie",Heart Lung Circ,592,16

Military physicians are uniquely trained to excel in such large-scale emergency situations. Civilian physicians can harness military know-how, but it will require research into military healthcare responses-specifically, we need to learn lessons from military interprofessional healthcare teams (MIHTs). METHODS: This research answers two questions: What are the characteristics of successful MIHTs? Why are those characteristics important to MIHT success in large-scale emergency situations? Using a Grounded Theory approach, 30 interviews were conducted soliciting perspectives from the broadest range of healthcare professionals who had experiences working in and leading MIHTs. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants broadly across: contexts where MIHTs work; military branches; ranks; genders; and healthcare professions. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 30 participants were interviewed (18 male (60%); 21 officers (70%); 9 enlisted (30%)) who held various healthcare occupations (medic/tech/corpsman (9); nurse (7); physician (7); dentist (2); occupational therapist (2); chaplain (1); physician's assistant (1); and psychiatrist (1)). Six characteristics of successful MIHTs that are directly applicable to large-scale emergency situations were identified thatthat clustered into two themes: own your purposes and responsibilities (through mission focus and ethical bearing) and get it done, safely (via situational awareness, adaptability, and leadership with followership). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights, informed by decades of military service and training, to help civilian physicians succeed in large-scale emergency situations. These experiences from the war front can support today's pandemic responses on the home front.","Varpio, Lara; Bader-Larsen, Karlen; Hamwey, Meghan; Durning, Steven; Meyer, Holly; Cruthirds, Danette; Artino, Anthony",PLoS One,592,24

UK Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) national guidelines states that 'masks must be well-fitting and fit for purpose, fully covering the mouth and nose'. AIM: To review the fit of the FRSM supplied to the NHS front line workers against the national IPC guidelines and, through re-audit, assess for improvements in fit with FRSM worn with a plastic strap (intervention A) and FFP3 mask (intervention B). METHOD: A three-part closed-loop audit was carried out comprising controlled observation, observation in the clinical area and questionnaire. Re-audit was carried out following interventions A and B. RESULTS: FRSMs slipped below the nose in 43% and below the mouth of 10% of participants during the controlled observation and below the nose (above or below the mouth) in 30% of staff in the clinical area. No masks slipped below the nose or mouth with intervention A or B. 86% of participants reported touching the FRSM to keep it in the correct position and 66% reported touching the FFP3. CONCLUSION: The current supply of FRSMs are poorly fitting for many users and do not meet the UK IPC guideline standard.

Assessment of yield gaps provides valuable information on potential production enhancement and drivers behind yield gaps. Milk production can be increased by narrowing the predominant large yield gaps in resource-poor smallholder farming system. Hence, this study assessed the milk yield gap and factors affecting the yield gap in Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya, a state located in the north-eastern Himalayan region of India. This research paper provides a scope for exploring the possibilities for improving dairy production in the state as well as contributing to literature through incorporating crucial determinants responsible for milk yield gap. A sample of 81 respondents was drawn purposely from two blocks of the district. The results indicated that the average number of cattle per household was 9.38 in standard animal units. The total yield gap was estimated at 6.20 l (91.06%) per day, composed of 0.80 l (11.76%) per day of yield gap I and 5.40 l (79.30%) per day of yield gap II. This demonstrates that the top performing farms were achieving a production level not dissimilar to that obtained on the research stations, but many were doing far less well. The size of cattle shed, dairy farming experience, concentrate price and human labour were the important determinants of the yield gap. Hence, encouraging the right stocking density of cattle, training on the preparations of home-made concentrates, access to cheap and quality concentrates, incorporating training and experience sharing on proper dairy management practices and use of technology could benefit the dairy farmers of the region.","Kemboi, Evans; Feroze, S M; Singh, Ram; Ahmed, Jabir; Tyngkan, Hehlangki",J Dairy Res,592,16

Objectives: We investigated the psychological needs of hospitalized newborns’ parents during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chongqing, China. Methods: The phenomenological method was used to conduct this qualitative research. In-depth interviews were carried out on 14 parents of hospitalized newborns by the same interview based on a semi-structured interview outlines. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analyzed using Colaizzi’s 7-step analysis method. Results: All the subjects’ children were admitted to a neonatal ward within the first two weeks of initiating the first-level response to COVID-19 in Chongqing, China. The in-depth interviews identified five themes regarding the parents’ primary psychological needs, which included urgent demand for timely up-to-date information about the children’s condition, demand for psychological and emotional support, reducing the inconvenience caused by the epidemic outbreak, claim for protective information after discharge, demand for financial support. Conclusions: Based on the parents’ needs, the medical staff should actively communicate with the parents, effectively provide emotional and financial support, and convenience. Such support could be helpful to relieve the parents’ psychological stress.","Fan, Juan; Zhou, Mei; Wei, Lu; Fu, Lizhen; Zhang, Xianhong; Shi, Yuan",Iran. J. Pediatr.,592,18

The general trust in other people is high in Denmark, and our study shows that trust in the authorities has grown during the pandemic. However, the study shows incipient signs of polarized trust in the population. Religion does not seem to play a role in this development, which instead seems to be associated with material and social insecurity. Research in trust generally indicates that the basis for the strong cohesion that Danish society has shown for decades is precisely trust. If the material and social consequences of the pandemic create fertile ground for change in the level of trust, it can help to create a value setback for the norms that create cohesion in society. © 2021 Aarhus Universitet.

Hence, the need for a rapid and simple tool to support clinical decisions, such as the ROX index (Respiratory rate - OXygenation), defined as the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation and fraction of inspired oxygen, to respiratory rate. The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of the ROX index in predicting hospitalization and mortality in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the ED. The secondary outcomes were to assess the number of readmissions and the variations in the ROX index between the first and the second admission. This was an observational prospective monocentric study, carried out in the ED of Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital in Bologna, Italy. Five hundred and fifty-four consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and the ROX index was calculated. Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. A ROX index value < 25.7 was associated with hospitalization (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.737, 95% CI 0.696-0.779, p < 0.001). The ROX index < 22.3 was statistically related to higher 30-day mortality (AUC = 0.764, 95% CI 0.708-0.820, p < 0.001). Eight patients were discharged and returned to the ED within the subsequent 7 days, their mean ROX index was 30.3 (6.2; range 21.9-39.4) at the first assessment and 24.6 (5.5; 14.5-29.5) at the second assessment, (p = 0.012). The ROX index, together with laboratory, imaging and clinical findings, correlated with the need for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.","Gianstefani, Alice; Farina, Gabriele; Salvatore, Veronica; Alvau, Francesca; Artesiani, Maria Laura; Bonfatti, Sara; Campinoti, Francesca; Caramella, Ilaria; Ciordinik, Michele; Lorusso, Andrea; Nanni, Sara; Nizza, Daniela; Nava, Stefano; Giostra, Fabrizio",Intern. emerg. med,592,16

Here, an unbiased interrogation of the anti-viral memory B cell repertoire of convalescent patients has been performed by generating large, stable hybridoma libraries and screening thousands of monoclonal antibodies to identify specific, high-affinity immunoglobulins (Igs) directed at distinct viral components. As expected, a significant number of antibodies were directed at the Spike (S) protein, a majority of which recognized the full-length protein. These full-length Spike specific antibodies included a group of somatically hypermutated IgMs. Further, all but one of the six COVID-19 convalescent patients produced class-switched antibodies to a soluble form of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Functional properties of anti-Spike antibodies were confirmed in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Importantly, more than half of all of the antibodies generated were directed at non-S viral proteins, including structural nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, as well as auxiliary open reading frame-encoded (ORF) proteins. The antibodies were generally characterized as having variable levels of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in all Ig classes and sub-types, and a diversity of VL and VH gene usage. These findings demonstrated that an unbiased, function-based approach towards interrogating the COVID-19 patient memory B cell response may have distinct advantages relative to genomics-based approaches when identifying highly effective anti-viral antibodies directed at SARS-CoV-2.","DiMuzio, Jillian M; Heimbach, Baron C; Howanski, Raymond J; Dowling, John P; Patel, Nirja B; Henriquez, Noeleya; Nicolescu, Chris; Nath, Mitchell; Polley, Antonio; Bingaman, Jamie L; Smith, Todd; Harman, Benjamin C; Robinson, Matthew K; Morin, Michael J; Nikitin, Pavel A",Vaccine X,592,10

The respondents in this study were 127 high school students from the West Java and Banten provinces. A Google Form questionnaire was used to collect the data. The results showed that the most widely used online class applications were WhatsApp Group feature, Google Classroom, and Zoom. Students also used printed textbooks, e-books, and student worksheets as learning media. Students did laboratory practice at home using easily found tools and materials. However, a small portion of the respondents ( 11 %) used materials purchased from a chemical store, and another small portion of the respondents ( 14 %) used virtual laboratories. They reported the results of their practice by making a laboratory practice report as well as through video activities and Microsoft PowerPoint for presentation. Students learn from home with varying durations. Most students experienced obstacles during the learning process so that they prefer learning face-to-face in class as usual. Therefore, the teacher must prepare a variety of strategies for distance learning so that the students can learn chemistry from home with fun. Some strategies that can be applied are providing audio-visual learning media or computer/android-based games for chemistry, using the online class application that accommodates interactions similar to face-to-face learning, providing laboratory practice using tools and materials that can be easily found around the house, providing virtual lab application, and providing more opportunities for students to ask questions about chemistry topics that they do not understand.","Sari, Indah; Sinaga, Parlindungan; Hernani, Hernani; Solfarina, Solfarina",Tadris: Jurnal Keguruan Dan Ilmu Tarbiyah,592,32

Method: a research study with a qualitative approach, conducted with 17 participants from different cities of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Data collection took place in the months of April and May 2020, through semi-structured interviews conducted via an open access virtual communication platform. The data were thematically analyzed, based on the Complexity Paradigm. Results: the absence and mismatch of scientific and systematic information at the beginning of the pandemic, the fragile institutional support, and the concern of contamination of the children generated stress and anguish in the mother-nurses. The support previously offered by schools and family members was hindered by the pandemic, leading to a greater demand for parental care. Creative strategies to provide distraction, as well as religiousness and spirituality were valued to face the chaos experienced. Conclusion: nurses, while being valued as important frontline professionals in the fight against the pandemic, are invisible in their personal-affective dimension and in that of being a mother. The study indicates the need for structural institutional policies so that mother-nurses are placed in a position of equality and safety for the full exercise of the profession and a healthy intra-family relationship, especially in contexts of adversity such as that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carlos, Diene Monique; Wernet, Monika; Okido, Aline Cristiane Cavicchioli; Oliveira, Wanderlei Abadio de; Silveira, Aline Oliveira; Costa, Luiza Cesar Riani",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,592,16

We examined the effect of lockdown easing on trauma presentation and management from one Major Trauma Centre (MTC). METHODS: Data was retrospectively analysed from Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) on patients presenting to our MTC with trauma. The first 47 days of lockdown (23rd March-9th May 2020, period 1) were compared with the next 47 (10th May-26th June 2020, period 2) and last (27th June-13th August 2020, period 3). Data collected included demographics, mechanism and severity of injury, management and length of stay. RESULTS: 1249 patients were included; 62.2% were male with a mean age of 57.73. Footfall declined in April 2020 compared with 2019 (56 vs. 143) but rebounded by May (123 vs. 120 patients). Road traffic collisions increased over periods one-three (18.8% vs. 23% vs. 30.1%, p = 0.038); deliberate self-harm (DSH) increased in period two compared with one and three (6.3% vs. 3.4% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.03), respectively. When compared with 2019, the 2020 patient age was lower, with less trauma relating to alcohol (7.3% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.009), but more from DSH (3.6% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.10). In 2020 less patients were assessed by a consultant and trauma team, with a shorter stay in hospital and critical care. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to document trauma trends through a lockdown and thereafter. After lockdown easing, trauma footfall rapidly rebounded to 2019 levels. This should be acknowledged in resource allocation decisions if future lockdowns are necessitated.","Waseem, Saima; Romann, Ramdeep; Lenihan, Jonathan; Rawal, Jaikirty; Carrothers, Andrew; Hull, Peter; Chou, Daud",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,592,25

Over the last 3 months, the pandemic has challenged the diagnosis and treatment of all cancer, including rectal cancer. Constraints in resources call for a change in the treatment strategy without compromising efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Delivery of shorter treatment schedules for radiotherapy offers advantages like short overall treatment time, improved throughput on the machine, improved compliance and reduced risk of transmission of COVID 19. Other strategies include delaying surgery, reducing the intensity of chemotherapy and adoption of organ preservation approach.

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the demand for accurate, easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective antigen tests for clinical application. We propose a de novo antigen test for diagnosing COVID-19 using the combination of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thio-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. Our test takes advantage of the spike proteins specific to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The limit of detection of our test was 2.3 × 10-18 moles/assay. If the virus has ~25 spike proteins on its surface, our method should detect on the order of 10-20 moles of virus/assay, corresponding to ~104 copies of the virus RNA/assay. The detection sensitivity approaches that of PCR-based assays because the average virus RNA load used for PCR-based assays is ~105 copies per oro- or naso-pharyngeal swab specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasensitive antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that can be performed with an easy-to-use microplate reader. Sufficient sensitivity can be achieved within 10 min of thio-NAD cycling. Our antigen test allows for rapid, cost-effective, specific, ultrasensitive, and simultaneous multiple measurements of SARS-CoV-2, and has broad application for the diagnosis for COVID-19.","Kyosei, Yuta; Namba, Mayuri; Yamura, Sou; Takeuchi, Rikiya; Aoki, Noriko; Nakaishi, Kazunari; Watabe, Satoshi; Ito, Etsuro",,592,16

We fit negative binomial models to assess COVID-19 incidence in association with PM2.5 and policies. Stratified analyses by facemask policy and stay home policy were also performed. Each 1-µg/m3 increase in annual average concentration of PM2.5 exposure was associated with 7.56% (95% CI: 3.76%, 11.49%) increase in COVID-19 risk. Facemask mandates and stay home policies were inversely associated with COVID-19 with adjusted RRs of 0.8466 (95% CI: 0.7598, 0.9432) and 0.9193 (95% CI: 0.8021, 1.0537), respectively.

Health literacy is regarded as a potential tool to reduce health inequalities and improve migrant's access to and quality of health care. Yet, little is known about the health literacy needs among these groups and how to address them. This paper outlines the protocol for a migrant community-based co-design project that seeks to optimize health literacy, health promotion, and social cohesion in support of prevention of NCDs among migrants in Lisbon using the OPtismizing HEalth LIteracy and Access (Ophelia) process. This participatory implementation research project starts with a mixed-methods needs assessment covering health literacy strengths, weaknesses and needs of migrants, and local data about determinants of health behaviors, service engagement, and organizational responsiveness. Diverse migrant groups will be engaged and surveyed using the Health Literacy Questionnaire and questions on sociodemographic and economic characteristics, health status, use of health services, and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with migrants will also be conducted. Based on data collected, vignettes will be developed representing typical persons with diverse health literacy profiles. Migrants and stakeholders will participate in ideas generation workshops for depth co-creation discussions in simulated real-world situations based on the vignettes, to design health literacy-based multisectoral interventions. Selected interventions will be piloted through quality improvement cycles to ensure ongoing local refinements and ownership development. Through a genuine engagement, the project will evaluate the uptake, effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions. This protocol takes a grounded approach to produce evidence on real health literacy needs from the perspective of key stakeholders, especially migrants, and embodies strong potential for effective knowledge translation into innovative, locally relevant, culturally and context congruent solutions for prevention of NCDs among migrants. Given the diverse communities engaged, this protocol will likely be adaptable to other migrant groups in a wide range of contexts, particularly in European countries. The scale-up of interventions to similar contexts and populations will provide much needed evidence on how health literacy interventions can be developed and applied to reduce health inequality and improve health in diverse communities.","Dias, Sónia; Gama, Ana; Maia, Ana Catarina; Marques, Maria J; Campos Fernandes, Adalberto; Goes, Ana Rita; Loureiro, Isabel; Osborne, Richard H",Front Public Health,592,33

In this study, we used acrolein as a model toxicant and defined the concentration-response relationships of the key adverse responses in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and human mucoepidermoid pulmonary carcinoma (NCI-H292) cells. Direct trace analysis of intracellular free acrolein is extremely challenging, if not impossible. Therefore, we developed a new method for indirectly estimating the intracellular uptake of acrolein. A 10-min treatment was employed to capture the rapid occurrence of the key alkylation reactions of acrolein. Responses, including protein carbonylation, GSH depletion, and GSH-acrolein (GSH-ACR) adduct formation, were all linearly correlated with acrolein uptake in both cell types. Compared to the NCI-H292 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells, NHBE cells were more sensitive to acrolein exposure. Furthermore, results from the time-course studies demonstrated that depletion and conjugation of GSH were the primary adverse events and directly associated with the cytotoxicity induced by acrolein. In summary, these data suggest that cell susceptibility to acrolein exposure is closely associated with acrolein uptake and formation of GSH-ACR adducts. The dosimetric analysis presented in this study may provide useful information for computational modeling and risk assessment of acrolein using different test systems.","Xiong, Rui; Wu, Qiangen; Bryant, Matthew; Rosenfeldt, Hans; Healy, Sheila; Cao, Xuefei",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,592,20

Although some studies had been reported for the understanding of genetic bases for cotton yield-related traits, the detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the traits is still very limited. To uncover the whole-genome QTL controlling three yield-related traits in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), phenotypic traits were investigated under four planting environments and 9244 single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage disequilibrium block (SNPLDB) markers were developed in an association panel consisting of 315 accessions. RESULTS: A total of 53, 70 and 68 significant SNPLDB loci associated with boll number (BN), boll weight (BW) and lint percentage (LP), were respectively detected through a restricted two-stage multi-locus multi-allele genome-wide association study (RTM-GWAS) procedure in multiple environments. The haplotype/allele effects of the significant SNPLDB loci were estimated and the QTL-allele matrices were organized for offering the abbreviated genetic composition of the population. Among the significant SNPLDB loci, six of them were simultaneously identified in two or more single planting environments and were thought of as the stable SNPLDB loci. Additionally, a total of 115 genes were annotated in the nearby regions of the six stable SNPLDB loci, and 16 common potential candidate genes controlling target traits of them were predicted by two RNA-seq data. One of 16 genes (GH_D06G2161) was mainly expressed in the early ovule-development stages, and the stable SNPLDB locus (LDB_19_62926589) was mapped in its promoter region. CONCLUSION: This study identified the QTL alleles and candidate genes that could provide important insights into the genetic basis of yield-related traits in upland cotton and might facilitate breeding cotton varieties with high yield.","Su, Junji; Wang, Caixiang; Ma, Qi; Zhang, Ai; Shi, Chunhui; Liu, Juanjuan; Zhang, Xianliang; Yang, Delong; Ma, Xiongfeng",BMC Plant Biol,592,4

The two results are not significantly different. TTIs with gelatin solution and gold precursor solution concentration of 150.00 and 2.05 mg/mL, respectively, can show the quality of muffins. TTIs changed from light yellow to pink and finally appeared deep purple. The deep purple represented spoilage and inedibility of muffins. Comparing Ea of food and that of TTIs can preliminarily evaluate their matching degree, improving the experiment efficiency. Hence, it is reasonable to use the traditional matching method in most cases, and use the new method only when Ea of food cannot be obtained. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The deterioration rate of food is usually calculated by developing kinetic models of characteristic quality parameters. When the reaction rate is unavailable or inaccurate, the activation energy of food cannot be obtained. In this case, it is impossible to match TTIs with food based on the traditional method. This research develops a new matching method and helps TTIs and food to be matched without considering activation energy. It will promote the application of TTIs in more products.","Zhang, Lixuan; Sun, Ruonan; Yu, Hufei; Yu, Hailong; Xu, Gaolei; Deng, Liming; Qian, Jing",J. food sci,592,0

The main goal of this research is to identify the difficulties related to the professional activity and personal life of obstetrics and gynecology doctors. Material and Methods: In total, 94 physicians from a single university center answered to an online questionnaire. Socio-demographic, health, family, and job-related data were collected. Data were processed using SPSS (v.25). Results: 7.4% of the doctors were confirmed infected with SARS-Cov-2 during the first 6 months of the pandemic, and 48.94% treated infected patients. Due to the large number of patients, 10.64% of the doctors have had no days-off during the last 6 months, and 22.34% of them have had new medical problems that led them to see a specialist. Seventeen to nineteen percent mentioned an increasing number of working hours and shifts per month due to the pandemic period, more than 10% used pills to cope with work-stress, and 25% of them had sleep disorders along with appetite loss. Extra-protection rules and negative consequences of wearing special equipment were identified: thermal discomfort that caused decreasing resistance and concentration during the surgery (52%), reduced mobility and accuracy of surgical or medical gestures (40%), and intraoperative visibility (47%). Doctors who were working with confirmed pregnant women preferred caesarean section. Conclusions: Working under the stress of an infection with SARS-Cov-2 is causing a lot of pressure and determines changes in personal, familial, social, and professional life. Understanding the challenges that ob-gyn doctors are facing will help institutions to better provide support.","Iorga, Magdalena; Soponaru, Camelia; Socolov, Razvan-Vladimir; Carauleanu, Alexandru; Socolov, Demetra-Gabriela",Medicina (Kaunas),592,16

Indonesia began to apply the system of work from home (WfH) to minimize the spread risk of COVID-19 in March 2020. This research is aimed at finding out the coverage of WfH, mapping changes of workplace, identifying the use of ICT to support WfH, and analyzing the concept of workplace and work systems in future cities. The method used in this research is qualitative and quantitative. A questionnaire (Google Form) was sent to different WhatsApp groups whose members are experts in urban and regional planning, geography, the environment, smart cities, and IT, with total of 176 respondents. The focus group discussion conducted online focused on the use of ICT to support WfH during the COVID-19 pandemic. The result of this research shows that even before the pandemic, both the government and private sectors had a plan to apply WfH. Because of the pandemic, it became the catalyst for the implementation of WfH. The implementation of WfH has changed workplace orientation. The use of ICT was a primary need in implementing WfH during the pandemic. However, the WfH system implemented in the government sector has not been integrated, and neither has the one in private sectors. WfH is seen to have been effective enough, but it still needs lots of support from many sectors. In the future, WfH can still be maintained, along with working from the office (WfO). The WfH concept is highly recommended for big cities because it can support reduced population mobilization, resulting in reduced congestion and movement costs, and improved efficiency of working time by reducing travel time. On the other hand, it can help in the matter of limited of space that office buildings provide.","Rachmawati, Rini Choirunnisa Ulfah Pambagyo Zat Ayuningsih Syarafina Yosi Atikah Ghiffari Rizki Adriadi",Sustainability,592,26

This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cases of maxillofacial trauma and its etiologic variation by comparing it with the previous year archived data. Materials and Methods: Patients with maxillofacial fracture visiting during the lockdown period (Phase) were compared to the patient's record during the same time period in the year 2019 (Control). They were subcategorised based on the etiology of trauma, i.e., road traffic accident (RTA), self-fall, physical assault and animal attacks. Age and gender variations were also assessed. Degree of significance was calculated using t test and p value obtained. Result: Mean age of trauma patients during lockdown and control period was 32.66 and 27.93 years, respectively. Number of cases of overall trauma had significantly decreased. Cases of RTA and self-fall were 22 and 4 in lockdown compared to 135 and 16 during control phase. Cases of physical assault increased by 50%, i.e., from 9 to 6 on comparison of both the phases. Animal attack maxillofacial injuries were 2 in each group. Conclusion: RTA and subsequent drop in numbers of maxillofacial trauma can be shown as the benefit of lockdown nonetheless on the other side increase in number of physical assaults also shows how isolation and restrictions have psychological negative impact on society.","Prakash, Om; Prajapati, V K; Shahi, Ajoy Kumar; Khaitan, Tanya",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,592,25

Moran statistics and regression models were applied. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the predictors of death. The incidence rate was 1788.7/100 000 inhabitants; mortality rate was 48.0/100 000 and CFR was 2.7%. The highest incidence rates were observed in municipalities with better human development (overall MHDI (I = 0.1668; p = 0.002), education MHDI (I = 0.1649; p = 0.002) and income MHDI (I = 0.1880; p = 0.005)) and higher social vulnerability (overall SVI (I = 0.0599; p = 0.033)). CFR was associated with higher social vulnerability (SVI human capital (I = 0.0858; p = 0.004) and SVI urban infrastructure (I = 0.0985; p = 0.040)). Of the analysed cases, 55.4% were female; 2/3 were Black or Brown and the median age was 41 years. Among deaths, most were male (919; 57.4%) and elderly (1171; 73.1%). The predictors of death were male sex, advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. In Alagoas, Brazil, the disease has undergone a process of interiorisation and caused more deaths in poorer municipalities.

Staff attendance included pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy assistants representing all pharmacy services including aseptics, ward-based services, dispensary/distribution and procurement. Responses were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 138 pharmacy staff attended the departmental focus groups. This study identified which pharmacy-related changes implemented in the first wave will be beneficial to take forward into a second wave. These included extending the hours of the pharmacy service to critical care, retaining the competence of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians redeployed to critical care during wave 1, development of standard operating procedures for changes in practice, delivering/posting of dispensed outpatient medication to patients' place of residence, maintenance of ward-based pharmacy services, use of the healthcare app PANDO to aid team communication, utilisation of remote-controlled drug ordering, deployment of a COVID-19 ward stocklist, procurement of ready-made bags/prefilled syringes of critical care medications, aligning the central intravenous additive service with critical care demand to reduce waste and establishment of a pharmacy response in line with the hospital's implementation plan.

Since the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 has caused many infections among healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. Aims of this study were: a. to compare the distribution among the HCWs and the general population of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Western Sicily and Italy; b. to describe the characteristics of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the western Sicilian healthcare context during the first wave of the epidemic diffusion in Italy. Incidence and mean age of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in Western Sicily and in the whole Italian country.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present prospective single-centre study included consecutive symptomatic patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-proven COVID-19 who were not in the intensive care unit. All patients were assessed using HRCT and ultrasound of the lungs by distinct operators blinded to each other's findings. The number of areas (0-12) with B-lines and/or consolidations was evaluated using ultrasound and compared to the percentage and classification (absent or limited, <10%; moderate, 10-25%; extensive, 25-50%; severe, 50-75%; critical, >75%) of lung involvement on chest HRCT. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 21 patients with COVID-19 (median [range] age 65 [37-90] years, 76% male) and excellent correlation was found between the ultrasound score for B-lines and the classification (p<0.01) and percentage of lung involvement on chest HRCT (r=0.935, p<0.001). In addition, the ultrasound score correlated positively with supplemental oxygen therapy (r=0.45, p=0.041) and negatively with minimal oxygen saturation at ambient air (r=-0.652, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that among COVID-19 patients, lung ultrasound and HRCT findings agree in quantifying lung involvement and oxygen parameters. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lung ultrasound could be a relevant alternative to chest HRCT.","Ottaviani, S; Franc, M; Ebstein, E; Demaria, L; Lheure, C; Debray, M P; Khalil, A; Crestani, B; Borie, R; Dieudé, P",Clin Radiol,592,18

Inherently MHCGs are well suited for optoelectronic devices because they can be fabricated in all possible material systems. Here we demonstrate above 90% optical power reflectance, strong polarization discrimination. Based on experimental analysis aided by numerical simulations, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the spectral characteristics of MHCGs reflectance for more than 200 nm via modification of the duty cycle of the MHCG stripes.

By mid-March 2021, the COVID-19 almost hit all countries worldwide, with about 122 and 2.7 million confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. As a strong measure to stop the infection spread and deaths, many countries have enforced quarantine and lockdown of many activities. The shutdown of these activities has resulted in large economic losses. However, it has been widely reported that these measures have resulted in improved air quality, more specifically in highly polluted areas characterized by massive population and industrial activities. The reduced levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and particulate matter emissions have been reported and confirmed worldwide in association with lockdown periods. On the other hand, ozone levels in ambient air have been found to increase, mainly in response to the reduced nitrogen emissions. In addition, improved water quality in natural water resources has been reported as well. Wastewater facilities have reported a higher level of organic load with persistent chemicals due to the increased use of sanitizers, disinfectants, and antibiotics. The solid waste generated due to the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work presents and summarizes the observed environmental effects of COVID-19 as reported in the literature for different countries worldwide.

We found that contrary to the US consumer food price index, the overall price level at Amazon Fresh did not increase during the pandemic, but even slightly decreased for several product groups. Amazon seems to follow its low-price strategy also in the grocery sector, even in times of high demand. However, during the lockdown phase, there were more price increases for certain highly demanded product groups such as frozen and prepared foods. Moreover, fewer prices were communicated as promotional prices. Because this change did not influence the general price level, we conclude that such promotional prices are used more as a marketing tool than as a price-setting instrument.","Hillen, Judith",,592,16

Since the asymptomatic subjects people are not detected, they can spread the disease much longer, and this increases the COVID-19 $R_0$ up to around 9. We show that European epidemic outbreaks in various European countries correspond to the simulations with commonly used parameters based on clinical characteristics of the disease COVID-19, but $R_0$ is around three times bigger if the asymptomatic cohort is taken into account.

Biological control is a prime strategy to reduce the harmful effects of pesticides on environment especially plants and arthropods. Collection of lacewings (Field Populations) was made during 2014 and repeated in 2016 from five different districts composed mainly by row and vegetable crops under conventional cropping system. For these populations, resistance level to four insecticides representing different mode of action was measured using topical treatment of 1st-instar larvae with prepared dilutions of commercial formulation. The highest resistance levels were found for chlorfenapyr (100.86- to 423.78-fold) and indoxacarb (131.28- to 255.05-fold) in populations from all districts, while buprofezin and nitenpyram resistance was low to high and moderate to high, respectively. The levels of resistance to nitenpyram increased from 2014 to 2016 for populations of 3 out of 4 surveyed areas, while the susceptibility to buprofezin remained unchanged. Decrease in resistance levels for chlorfenapyr and indoxacarb in 2 years was marginal. These results suggest that field populations of C. carnea maintained resistance to buprofezin, chlorfenapyr, indoxacarb, and nitenpyram.

This system contains two regulatory pathways: a pathological pro-inflammatory pathway containing the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (AngII)/Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) axis and a protective anti-inflammatory pathway involving the Angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2)/ACE2/Ang1-7/MasReceptor axis. Numerous studies reported the positive effects of pathologic tRAS pathway inhibition and protective tRAS pathway stimulation on the treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease and the progression of neuropathic pain. Cell senescence and aging are known to be related to RAS pathways. Further, this system directly interacts with SARS-CoV 2 and seems to be an important target of interest in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review focuses on the involvement of tRAS in the progression of the mentioned diseases from an interdisciplinary clinical perspective and highlights therapeutic strategies that might be of major clinical importance in the future.","Saravi, Babak; Li, Zhen; Lang, Corinna N; Schmid, Bonaventura; Lang, Frauke K; Grad, Sibylle; Alini, Mauro; Richards, Robert Geoffrey; Schmal, Hagen; Südkamp, Norbert; Lang, Gernot M",,592,23

However, pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 after recovery from the acute disease are unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation were included and followed 6 weeks after discharge. Body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity (DLco), blood gas analysis (ABG), 6-min walk test (6MWT), echocardiography, and laboratory tests were performed. Quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: 33 patients with severe disease were included. Patients were discharged without prophylactic anticoagulation. At follow-up there were no thromboembolic complications in any patient. 11 patients (33%) had dyspnea, 11 (33%) had cough, and 15 (45%) suffered from symptoms of fatigue. Pulmonary function tests including ABG did not reveal any limitations (TLC: median=94% of predicted {IQR:85-105}; VC: 93% {78-101}; FEV1: 95% {72-103}; FEV1/FVC 79% {76-85}; PaO2: 72 mmHg {67-79}; PaCO2: 38 mmHg {35-38}), except for slightly reduced DLco (77% {69-95}). There were no echocardiographic impairments. 6MWT distance was reduced in most patients without oxygen desaturation. According to standardized questionnaires, patients suffered from reduced QoL, mainly due to decreased mobility (SGRQ activity score: 54 {19-78}). There were no indicators for depression or anxiety (PHQ-9: 7 {4-11}, GAD-7: 4 {1-9}, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, who did not require mechanical ventilation, are unlikely to develop pulmonary long-term impairments, thromboembolic complications or cardiac impairments after discharge but frequently suffer from symptoms of fatigue.","Daher, Ayham; Balfanz, Paul; Cornelissen, Christian; Müller, Annegret; Bergs, Ingmar; Marx, Nikolaus; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Hartmann, Bojan; Dreher, Michael; Müller, Tobias",Respir Med,592,6

It is urgent to help healthcare workers prevent and recover quickly from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We enrolled 140 medical workers with COVID-19 in Wuhan. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment and clinical outcome data were collected, and predictors of the duration of viral shedding were explored through multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The medical staff with COVID-19 presented mild clinical symptoms and showed a low frequency of abnormal laboratory indicators. All the medical staff were cured and discharged, of whom 96 (68.6%) were female, 39 (27.9%) had underlying diseases, the median age was 36.0 years, and 104 (74.3%) were infected whilst working in hospital. The median duration of viral shedding was 25.0 days (IQR:20.0-30.0). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed reducing viral shedding duration was associated with receiving recombinant human interferon alpha (rIFN-&#945;) treatment, whilst the prolonged duration of viral shedding correlated with the use of glucocorticoid treatment, the durations from the first symptom to hospital admission and the improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) evidence. Moreover, infected healthcare workers with lymphocytes less than 1.1 × 109 /L on admission had prolonged viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Medical staff with timely medical interventions shows milder clinical features. Glucocorticoid treatment and lymphocytes less than 1.1 × 109/L are associated with prolonged viral shedding. Early admission and rIFN-&#945; treatment help shorten the duration of viral shedding.","Liu, W; Liu, Y; Xu, Z; Jiang, T; Kang, Y; Zhu, G; Chen, Z",J. intern. med,592,24

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether dermoscopic features of psoriatic plaques differ with anatomic location or any clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical evaluation and videodermoscopy of psoriatic plaques located on the face, chest, abdomen, forearms, lower legs, back, and scalp were performed in 50 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. RESULTS: A total of 306 plaques were evaluated. Videodermoscopy with a 20-fold magnification revealed red dots and globules in 306/306 (100%) plaques, arranged in diffuse (170/306, 56%), patchy (117/306, 38%), or polygonal (19/306, 6%) pattern. A 70 fold magnification of these vessels revealed the presence of bushy vessels (213/306, 70%) and twisted loops (107/306, 35%), with the latter occurring more commonly on the scalp and face (P < .001). In lesions lasting less or equal 5 weeks on forearms and scalp, patchy distribution of the scale predominated, whereas in older lesions-diffuse type (forearm P = .005, scalp P = .017).

As the pandemic continues, a growing body of evidence suggests that infected patients may develop significant coagulopathy with resultant thromboembolic complications including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. However, this data is limited and comes from recent small case series and observational studies on stroke types, mechanisms, and outcomes.1-14 Furthermore, evidence on the role of therapeutic anticoagulation in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with elevated inflammatory markers, such as D-dimer, is also limited. We report the case of a middle-aged patient who presented with a large vessel ischemic stroke likely resulting from an underlying inflammatory response in the setting of known novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Histopathologic analysis of the patient's ischemic brain tissue revealed hypoxic neurons, significant edema from the underlying ischemic insult, fibrin thrombi in small vessels, and fibroid necrosis of the vascular wall without any signs of vasculature inflammation. Brain biopsy was negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RT-PCR assay). Along with a growing body of literature, our case suggests that cerebrovascular thromboembolic events in COVID-19 infection may be related to acquired hypercoagulability and coagulation cascade activation due to the release of inflammatory markers and cytokines, rather than virus-induced vasculitis. Further studies to investigate the mechanism of cerebrovascular thromboembolic events and their prevention is warranted.","Patel, Smit D; Kollar, Ryan; Troy, Patrick; Song, Xianyuan; Khaled, Mohammad; Parra, Augusto; Pervez, Mubashir",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,592,26

We present a fast and simple assay principle for antigen detection and demonstrate its functionality by detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP) via time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2, the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious units (IU) and 875 pg of SP or 625 IU. Testing reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive (n = 48, with cycle threshold [CT ] values from 11 to 30) or -negative (n = 96) nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that the assay yielded positive results for all samples with CT values of <25 and for a single RT-PCR-negative sample. Virus isolation from the RT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs showed a strong association between the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed 97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation and 77.1% (37/48) sensitivity and 99.0% (95/96) specificity in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and the assay is relatively simple to set up as an ""in-house"" test. Here, SARS-CoV-2 served as the model pathogen, but the assay principle is applicable to other viral infections, and the test format could easily be adapted to high-throughput testing.IMPORTANCE PCR is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of many acute infections. While PCR and its variants are highly sensitive and specific, the time from sampling to results is measured in hours at best. Antigen tests directly detect parts of the infectious agent, which may enable faster diagnosis but often at lower sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a technique for rapid antigen detection and demonstrate the test format's potential using SARS-CoV-2 as the model pathogen. The 10-min test, performed in a buffer that readily inactivates SARS-CoV-2, from nasopharyngeal samples identified 97.4% (37/38) of the samples from which we could isolate the virus. This suggests that the test performs well in identifying patients potentially shedding the virus. Although SARS-CoV-2 served as the model pathogen to demonstrate proof of concept, the test principle itself would be applicable to a wide variety of infectious and perhaps also noninfectious diseases.","Rusanen, Juuso; Kareinen, Lauri; Szirovicza, Leonora; Ugurlu, Hasan; Levanov, Lev; Jääskeläinen, Anu; Ahava, Maarit; Kurkela, Satu; Saksela, Kalle; Hedman, Klaus; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",mBio (Online),592,1

Minority populations, however, continue to be a high-risk population to contract the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While socioeconomic inequality may help to explain why minority ethnic populations are contracting the SARS-CoV-2 in larger proportions, the reason for elevated mortality rates in African Americans is still unknown. African Americans are less likely than whites to utilize high-quality hospitals, ambulatory care services, and regular primary care providers; this is most likely a result of barriers to accessing high quality treatment, as African Americans have substantially higher uninsured rates. However, previous reports have shown that regardless of insurance status, African Americans are more likely to be directed toward lower quality treatment plans compared to their white counterparts, and that physicians carry implicit biases that negatively impact treatment regimens for these minority populations. While income, education, and access to healthcare should be revised in due time, in the short term physicians should do everything possible to learn about implicit biases that may exist in healthcare, as the first step to minimize implicit biases is to recognize that they exist.","Chaturvedi, Rahul; Gabriel, Rodney A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,592,10

We systematically reviewed mortality in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and the potential role of systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic databases and country-specific healthcare databases were searched to identify relevant studies/reports. The quality assessment of individual studies was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Country-specific proportion of individuals with COVID-19 who developed ARDS and reported death were combined in a random-effect meta-analysis to give a pooled mortality estimate of ARDS. RESULTS: The overall pooled mortality estimate among 10,815 ARDS cases in COVID-19 patients was 39% (95% CI: 23-56%). The pooled mortality estimate for China was 69% (95% CI: 67-72%). In Europe, the highest mortality estimate among COVID-19 patients with ARDS was reported in Poland (73%; 95% CI: 58-86%) while Germany had the lowest mortality estimate (13%; 95% CI: 2-29%) among COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The median crude mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with reported corticosteroid use was 28.0% (lower quartile: 13.9%; upper quartile: 53.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality in COVID-19 associated ARDS necessitates a prompt and aggressive treatment strategy which includes corticosteroids. Most of the studies included no information on the dosing regimen of corticosteroid therapy, however, low-dose corticosteroid therapy or pulse corticosteroid therapy appears to have a beneficial role in the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Hasan, Syed Shahzad; Capstick, Toby; Ahmed, Raees; Kow, Chia Siang; Mazhar, Faizan; Merchant, Hamid A; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi",Expert Rev Respir Med,592,16

This urban health crisis unfolds in five parallel registers of conflictualities: (i) where religious communities carve out a domain for self-governance of the pandemic with their own ‘knowledge and truths’, (ii) where embodied religious practices challenge or undermine state biopower and transform governmentalities, (iii) where the spatial dimension of conflict evolves into the crisis of technologies of governance, (iv) where religious identities are stigmatized and the minority groups are excluded and (v) where communalism organizes around international relations. It is argued that religious groups in South Asia influenced the urban political (eco)pathology with their disruptive potential which transformed biosecurity regimes and enhanced health risks on the one hand and on the other, they embraced and internalized discords of disease within their antagonistic communal and sectarian memories and histories and weaponized the pandemic to produce more cracks in the social fabric.

Nevertheless, despite significant progress made in this field, there is still a group of hearing impairments that stay undiagnosed timely.

The number and location of such changes can be estimated in a principled way by existing detection methods, providing that the background level is stable and known. However, practical data often contains nuisance changes in background level, which interfere with standard estimation techniques. Furthermore, such changes often differ from the target segments only in duration, and appear as false alarms in the detection results. To solve these issues, we propose a two-level detector that models and separates nuisance and signal changes. As part of this method, we developed a new, efficient approach to simultaneously estimate unknown, but fixed, background level and detect epidemic changes. The analytic and computational properties of the proposed methods are established, including consistency and convergence. We demonstrate via simulations that our two-level detector provides accurate estimation of changepoints under a nuisance process, while other state-of-the-art detectors fail. Using real-world genomic and demographic datasets, we demonstrate that our method can identify and localise target events while separating out seasonal variations and experimental artefacts.","Juodakis, Julius; Marsland, Stephen",,592,20

It manifests in some cases as increasing inflammation to even the onset of a cytokine storm and irreversible progression of acute respiratory syndrome, which is associated with the risk of death in patients. Thus, proactive anti-inflammatory therapy remains an open serious question in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, who still have signs of inflammation on days 7-9 of the disease: elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)&gt;60 mg/dL and at least two of the four clinical signs: fever &gt;37.5°C; persistent cough; dyspnea (RR &gt;20 brpm) and/or reduced oxygen blood saturation &lt;94% when breathing atmospheric air. We designed the randomized trial: COLchicine versus Ruxolitinib and Secukinumab in Open-label Prospective Randomized Trial in Patients with COVID-19 (COLORIT). We present here data comparing patients who received colchicine with those who did not receive specific anti-inflammatory therapy. Results of the comparison of colchicine, ruxolitinib, and secukinumab will be presented later.Objective Compare efficacy and safety of colchicine compared to the management of patients with COVID-19 without specific anti-inflammatory therapy.Material and Methods Initially, 20 people were expected to be randomized in the control group. However, enrollment to the control group was discontinued subsequently after the inclusion of 5 patients due to the risk of severe deterioration in the absence of anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, 17 patients, who had not received anti-inflammatory therapy when treated in the MSU Medical Research and Educational Center before the study, were also included in the control group. The effects were assessed on day 12 after the inclusion or at discharge if it occurred earlier than on day 12. The primary endpoint was the changes in the SHOCS-COVID score, which includes the assessment of the patient's clinical condition, CT score of the lung tissue damage, the severity of systemic inflammation (CRP changes), and the risk of thrombotic complications (D-dimer) [1].Results The median SHOCS score decreased from 8 to 2 (p = 0.017), i.e., from moderate to mild degree, in the colchicine group. The change in the SHOCS-COVID score was minimal and statistically insignificant in the control group. In patients with COVID-19 treated with colchicine, the CRP levels decreased rapidly and normalized (from 99.4 to 4.2 mg/dL, p&lt;0.001). In the control group, the CRP levels decreased moderately and statistically insignificantly and achieved 22.8 mg/dL by the end of the follow-up period, which was still more than four times higher than normal. The most informative criterion for inflammation lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) increased in the colchicine group by 393 versus 54 in the control group (p = 0.003). After treatment, it was 60.8 in the control group, which was less than 100 considered safe in terms of systemic inflammation progression. The difference from 427 in the colchicine group was highly significant (p = 0.003).The marked and rapid decrease in the inflammation factors was accompanied in the colchicine group by the reduced need for oxygen support from 14 (66.7%) to 2 (9.5%). In the control group, the number of patients without anti-inflammatory therapy requiring oxygen support remained unchanged at 50%. There was a trend to shorter hospital stays in the group of specific anti-inflammatory therapy up to 13 days compared to 17.5 days in the control group (p = 0.079). Moreover, two patients died in the control group, and there were no fatal cases in the colchicine group. In the colchicine group, one patient had deep vein thrombosis with D-dimer elevated to 5.99 µg/mL, which resolved before discharge.Conclusions Colchicine 1 mg for 1-3 days followed by 0.5 mg/day for 14 days is effective as a proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. The management of such patients without proactive anti-inflammatory therapy is likely to be unreasonable and may worsen the course of COVID-19. However, the findings should be treated with caution, given the small size of the trial.","Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Plisyk, A G; Pavlikova, E P; Akopyan, Z A; Matskeplishvili, S T; Malakhov, P S; Krasnova, T N; Seredenina, E M; Potapenko, A V; Agapov, M A; Asratyan, D A; Dyachuk, L I; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, Ð Ð; Sinitsyn, V E; Pakhomov, P V; Zhdanova, E A; Mareev, Yu V; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, Ð Ð",Kardiologiia,592,1

RESULTS: Older adults reported higher depression and greater loneliness following the onset of the pandemic. Loneliness positively predicted depression. Perceived relationship strength, but not social engagement, moderated this relationship such that loneliness only predicted depression for individuals who became closer to their networks during the pandemic. For those who felt less close, depression was higher irrespective of loneliness.

Booster vaccinations have recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) for certain populations but are restricted to homologous mRNA vaccines. We evaluated homologous and heterologous booster vaccination in persons who had received an EUA Covid-19 vaccine regimen. Methods: In this phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial conducted at ten U.S. sites, adults who received one of three EUA Covid-19 vaccines at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and had no reported history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines (Moderna mRNA-1273 100-mcg, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 virus particles, or Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 30-mcg; nine combinations). The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on study days 15 and 29. Results: 458 individuals were enrolled: 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.CoV2.S, and 154 received BNT162b2 booster vaccines. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. Injection site pain, malaise, headache, and myalgia occurred in more than half the participants. Booster vaccines increased the neutralizing activity against a D614G pseudovirus (4.2-76-fold) and binding antibody titers (4.6-56-fold) for all combinations; homologous boost increased neutralizing antibody titers 4.2-20-fold whereas heterologous boost increased titers 6.2-76-fold.

We argue that COVID-19 trial participants should usually be offered reimbursement for research-related expenses, and compensation for their time and effort, as for other types of research under usual circumstances. Given increased risk of undue influence against pandemic background conditions, incentive payment should be avoided unless essential to recruitment and retention in important trials whose social value outweighs this risk.

METHOD: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science was performed from inception to July 15, 2020 using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. The review included case reports and series discussing radiologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in abdominal imaging studies. Studies published from inception to March 31, 2020, were independently screened and reviewed by one author, and another author reviewed studies published after March 31 to July 15, 2020. Study screening and full-text review for publications before March 31, 2020, was performed by one author, and another author for publications after March 31 to July 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included in qualitative synthesis. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms is roughly 18% and includes loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Sixteen percent of COVID-19 cases may only present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Many patients presenting this way demonstrate evidence of COVID-19 incidentally through abdominal CT imaging at the lung bases. Studies published to date have also reported abdominal imaging findings including small and large bowel wall thickening, fluid-filled colon, pneumatosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum, intussusception, and ascites. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal manifestations and imaging manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are increasingly reported and warrant specific attention during abdominal imaging.","Lui, Kevin; Wilson, Mitchell P; Low, Gavin",Abdom. radiology (Internet),592,16

We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. Methods We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. Results A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage. Furthermore, compared with medical experts, few ALS patients reported that the chance for ALS patients to obtain work was higher due to the increasing availability of remote work. Conclusions This survey indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with increased distress about access to care and work, inducing contradictory responses and potential hopelessness among ALS patients.","Yanagihashi, Masaru; Sugisawa, Tatsuki; Fuchimoto, Masaaki; Saotome, Yuuichi; Onozawa, Keiko; Matsumoto, Yukinori; Bokuda, Kota; Ebina, Junya; Shibukawa, Mari; Hirayama, Takehisa; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Washizawa, Naohiro; Ebihara, Satoru; Kano, Osamu",Intern Med,592,1

The aim of this pilot study was to determine IAQ in elementary schools different in their inter-nal and external characteristics, in settings of COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: IAQ parameters: fine particulate matter (PM2,5) mass concentration, CO2 concentration, tempera-ture and relative humidity were measured in parallel in four elementary schools/classrooms during October (non-heating season) and four months (including holiday in January) of heating season. IAQ parameters were measured in settings of anti-epidemic restrictions (≤13 students in classroom, frequent ventilation). RESULTS: During October, except in one school, PM2,5 concentrations were below the upper recommended value (25 μg/m³), but started rising in all schools in the heating season. The highest concentrations of PM2,5 were registered in two schools with closed or shortly opened windows. CO2 concentrations were mostly in the recommended range (up to 1000ppm) except in the school with constantly closed windows and in three schools in February when concentrations were higher. Except in one, the same school, and in January, both temperature and relative humidity were out of the recommended range (24,0-27,0°C in non-heating;20,0-24,0°C in heating season;and 45-55%), with temperature mainly above and relative humidity mainly below it in three schools. The largest deviation in temperature and relative humidity were registered in urban schools. Registered differ-ences may be explained by different internal and external characteristics. CONCLUSION: Despite anti-epidemic restrictions, most of the measured IAQ parameters were out of the recom-mended values in heating season. In addition, further deterioration of IAQ could be expected if all students had been presented in the classroom. Finally, to assure a healthy school environment in heating season, further optimisation of both indoor and outdoor conditions is needed in both pandemic and non-pandemic settings.","Kulo, A.; Klarić, S.; Ćetković, A.; Blekić, A.; Kusturica, J.; Spahić, N.; Šljivo, A.; Šečić, D.",Psychiatr Danub,592,16

Although huge efforts are being made to produce effective therapies to combat this disease, it continues to be one of the greatest challenges in medicine. There is no doubt that herpesviruses are one of the most important viruses that infect humans and animals, and infections induced by these pathogens have developed into a great threat to public health. According to the currently available evidence, the correlation between herpesviruses and coronaviruses is limited to the induced complications following the infections. For instance, the inflammation that is induced at the sites of infection could tie these viruses to each other in a relationship. Another example, bovine herpesvirus 1, which is an important pathogen of cattle, can cause a severe respiratory infection; the same way in which SARS-CoV-2 affects humans. Considering the current circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, this editorial paper, which belongs to the Special Issue ""Recent Advances in Herpesviruses Research: What's in the Pipeline?"" aims to draw attention to some natural anti-herpesvirus alkaloid compounds, which have recently been proven to have excellent inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, this special focus is an attempt to hunt down various treatment options to combat COVID-19 based on repurposing drugs that are known to have multiple antiviral properties, including against herpesvirus.","Hassan, Sherif T S",Viruses,592,20

Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague, which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its ""decor"", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora's box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously. If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician's body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","Houssier, Florian; Christaki, Angélique; Vlachopoulou, Xanthie",Ann. med.-psychol,592,26

It has been assumed that the strength and the endurance of trunk flexor and extensor muscles are CLPB key factors, but it is not known whether these attributes are related to pain intensity. It was aimed to determine whether the strength and endurance of trunk flexor and extensor muscles differ in MPO with no pain (CON; n = 24), moderate (MOD; n = 42), and severe (SEV; n = 37) nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: The peak torque and endurance test of trunk flexor (PTF.BM-1) and extensor (PTE.BM-1) muscles were compared. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify pain intensity predictors in all groups (PAIN) and according to pain intensity (MOD and SEV). Results: The PTF.BM-1 was negatively related to pain and was a significant predictor, irrespective of pain intensity (PAIN). Conclusion: When pain intensity was considered the PTF.BM-1 and PTE.BM-1 explained the pain in the MOD, while the PTE.BM-1 and service time explained pain intensity in the SEV. Endurance of the flexor and extensor muscles was not related to pain intensity. These results indicated that training protocols must emphasize specific strengthening routines.","Tavares, Janny M A; Rodacki, André L F; Hoflinger, Francielle; Dos Santos Cabral, Alexandre; Paulo, Anderson C; Rodacki, Cintia L N",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),592,16

Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of Covid-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of ‘black swan’ type shocks.","Arndt, Channing; Davies, Rob; Gabriel, Sherwin; Harris, Laurence; Makrelov, Konstantin; Robinson, Sherman; Levy, Stephanie; Simbanegavi, Witness; van Seventer, Dirk; Anderson, Lillian",Global Food Secur.,592,22

A total of 49 children (mean age 11.5 ± 5.12 years) confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in the study, including 11 (22.4%) domestic cases and 38 (77.6%) imported cases. Nine (81.8%) local cases and 12 (31.6%) imported cases had a definitive epidemiological exposure. Twenty-eight (57.1%) were symptomatic and 21 (42.9%) were asymptomatic. Neither asymptomatic nor symptomatic cases progressed to severe diseases. The mean duration of viral shedding for SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract was 14.1 ± 6.4 days in asymptomatic cases and 14.8 ± 8.4 days in symptomatic cases (P > 0.05). Forty-five (91.8%) cases had viral RNA detected in stool. The mean duration of viral shedding in stool was 28.1 ± 13.3 days in asymptomatic cases and 30.8 ± 18.6 days in symptomatic participants (P > 0.05). Children < 7 years shed viral RNA in stool for a longer duration than school-aged children (P < 0.05). Forty-three (87.8%) cases had seropositivity for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within 1-3 weeks after confirmation with infection. In conclusion, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection may be common in children in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic wave. Asymptomatic cases shed viral RNA in a similar pattern as symptomatic cases do. It is of particular concern that asymptomatic individuals are potentially seed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and pose a challenge to disease control.","Cai, Jiehao; Wang, Xiangshi; Zhao, Jun; Ge, Yanling; Xu, Jin; Tian, He; Chang, Hailing; Xia, Aimei; Wang, Jiali; Zhang, Jinqiang; Wei, Zhongqiu; Li, Jingjing; Wang, Chuning; Wang, Jianshe; Zhu, Qirong; Zhai, Xiaowen; Zeng, Mei",Virol. sin.

However, the relationship between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether cancer patients with COVID-19 may be at an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. METHODS: We will perform comprehensive searches in PubMed, EMBASE.com, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify studies providing prevalence of cancer between patients with severe and non-severe illness or between non-survivors and survivors. We will use the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale to assess the quality of included studies. We will conduct pairwise meta-analyses to compute the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval using the Mantel Haenszel method with the random-effects model. The statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I statistic. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses, and meta-regression analyses will be performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis will systematically evaluate the association between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. This study will provide evidence to help determine whether cancer patients should be provided with special precautions and advised to use stronger personal protection.

Especially for online certification and accreditation, the training organizations need to verify that the online students who completed the learning process and received the academic credits are those who registered for the courses. Furthermore, they need to ensure that these students complete all the activities of online training without cheating or inappropriate behaviours. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated (abruptly in certain cases) the migration and implementation of online education strategies and consequently the need for safe mechanisms to authenticate and proctor online students. Nowadays, there are several technologies with different grades of automation. In this paper, we deeply describe a specific solution based on the authentication of different biometric technologies and an automatic proctoring system (system workflow as well as AI algorithms), which incorporates features to solve the main concerns in the market: highly scalable, automatic, affordable, with few hardware and software requirements for the user, reliable and passive for the student. Finally, the technological performance test of the large scale system, the usability-privacy perception survey of the user and their results are discussed in this work.

The purpose of the present study was to quantify its impact on surgical volume, hospitalizations, clinic appointments, and accident and emergency attendances to guide staffing and resource deployment for the sustenance of emergency services. METHODS: Data were retrieved from all 43 Hong Kong public hospitals and 122 outpatient clinics from a population of 7.5 million residents. The ""COVID-19 cohort"" of patients who received treatment from January 25 to March 27, 2020, was compared with the ""control cohort"" of patients who received treatment during the same time of year over the past 4 years. Primary outcomes consisted of changes in patient diagnoses, number of operations performed, and hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary outcomes included differences in patient age and comorbidity, the nature of operations performed, types of anesthesia for orthopaedic procedures, difference in anesthetic times, wait times, and personal protective equipment (PPE) reserves. RESULTS: A total of 928,278 patient-episodes (32,613 operations, 97,648 hospital admissions, 302,717 accident and emergency attendances, and 495,300 outpatient clinic attendances) were analyzed. Orthopaedic operations were reduced by 44.2%, from a mean (and standard deviation) of 795 ± 115.1 to 443.6 ± 25.8 per week (p < 0.001), with the ratio of emergency to elective operations increasing from 1.27:1 to 3.78:1. Operations for the treatment of upper and lower-limb fractures decreased by 23% (from 98.5 ± 14 to 75.9 ± 15.2 per week; p < 0.001) and 20% (from 210.6 ± 29.5 to 168.4 ± 16.9 per week; p < 0.001), respectively, whereas elective joint replacement and ligamentous reconstruction procedures decreased by 74% to 84% (p < 0.001). Operations for orthopaedic infections such as necrotizing fasciitis and septic arthritis remained similar (p > 0.05). The number of hospitalizations decreased by 41.2% (from 2,365 ± 243 to 1,391 ± 53 per week; p < 0.001), whereas clinical outpatient visits decreased by 29.4% (from 11,693 ± 2,240 to 8,261 ± 1,104 per week; p < 0.001). Patients did not endure longer wait times for emergency operations and accident and emergency consultations (p > 0.05). PPE consumption did not exceed procurement, with net increases in PPE reserves. CONCLUSIONS: Demand for orthopaedic care remains, despite weekly reductions of 351 orthopaedic operations, 974 hospital admissions, and 3,432 clinic attendances. Orthopaedic surgeons and health-care professionals should factor this into consideration during staffing and resource deployment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III.

We find that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa endonuclease YbeY is required for rRNA processing and the bacterial virulence in a murine acute pneumonia model. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that knocking out the ybeY gene results in downregulation of oxidative stress response genes, including the catalase genes katA and katB Consistently, the ybeY mutant is more susceptible to H2O2 and neutrophil-mediated killing. Overexpression of katA restores the bacterial tolerance to H2O2 and neutrophil killing as well as virulence. We further find that the downregulation of the oxidative stress response genes is due to defective expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We demonstrate an autoregulatory mechanism of RpoS and find that ybeY mutation increases the level of a small RNA, ReaL, which directly represses the translation of rpoS through the 5' UTR of its mRNA and subsequently reduces the expression of the oxidative stress response genes. In vitro assays demonstrate direct degradation of ReaL by YbeY. Deletion of reaL or overexpression of rpoS in the ybeY mutant restores the bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress and the virulence. We also demonstrate that YbeZ binds to YbeY and is involved in the 16S rRNA processing and regulation of reaL and rpoS as well as the bacterial virulence. Overall, our results reveal pleiotropic roles of YbeY and the YbeY-mediated regulation of rpoS through ReaL.IMPORTANCE The increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance imposes a severe threat to human health. For the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies, it is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by bacteria to grow in the human body. Posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. RNases and small RNAs are key players in this regulation. In this study, we demonstrate critical roles of the RNase YbeY in the virulence of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa We further identify the small RNA ReaL as the direct target of YbeY and elucidate the YbeY-regulated pathway on the expression of bacterial virulence factors. Our results shed light on the complex regulatory network of P. aeruginosa and indicate that inference with the YbeY-mediated regulatory pathway might be a valid strategy for the development of a novel treatment strategy.","Xia, Yushan; Weng, Yuding; Xu, Congjuan; Wang, Dan; Pan, Xiaolei; Tian, Zhenyang; Xia, Bin; Li, Haozhou; Chen, Ronghao; Liu, Chang; Jin, Yongxin; Bai, Fang; Cheng, Zhihui; Kuipers, Oscar P; Wu, Weihui",mBio (Online),592,16

METHODS: The hospital registry data were examined of patients aged >65 years who were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 and who underwent PC treatment in the interventional radiology unit. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients were diagnosed with ACC and COVID-19, then underwent PC. The patients comprised 14 (78%) males and 4 (22%) females with an average age of 73.4 years (range, 67-81 years). In 17 (94%) patients, symptoms associated with acute cholecystitis decreased within 48-72 h of the PC treatment and a clinical improvement was determined. The success rate of PC was 100% and no complications. In 3 (16.6%) patients followed up with intubation in intensive care after the procedure, mortality developed due to COVID-19-associated pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 15 (83.4%) patients were discharged with an elective cholecystectomy plan. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection can be fatal especially in patients over 65 years of age due to additional comorbidities. PC treatment, which can be performed under local anesthesia as a minimally invasive procedure, is an alternative treatment option in this patient group. PC can also act as a bridge in transition to elective surgery in this process management.","Çakir, Çaglayan; Kabuli, Hamit Ahmet",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,592,6

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The outcomes of interest of this literature review were mental health, suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and violence. Exposures of interest were TOOC, TIPA or a partial or indirect measure of either. In total, 14 studies were included. An abbreviated review methodology was used because of time constraints. FINDINGS: There was consistent evidence of an association between lower TOOC and TIPA and worse mental health and higher suicide risk. Limited evidence suggests a link between TOOC and DSH. No evidence was identified regarding the relationship between TOOC/TIPA and violence. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions regarding causality. Significant heterogeneity of mental health outcomes limits the comparability of studies. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of TOOC and TIPA on adverse mental outcomes for prisoners when designing prison regimes, including during urgent adaptation of such regimes in response to Covid-19.

Com as novas portarias do Ministério da Educação e Saúde, houve uma abertura para que todos os cursos utilizassem de metodologias remotas para continuidade do ano letivo, surgindo novos desafios e paradigmas com essa proposta metodológica: prover para o usuário, a sensação de imersão, de estar dentro do ambiente, a partir da navegação e interação nesse meio virtual, ao mesmo tempo que o educador, respeitando os princípios educacionais e a abordagem pedagógica que acredita, não transformar esse momento em uma simples educação à distância. Objetivo: Descrever o estado da arte sobre o ensino de enfermagem e os desafios do uso de tecnologias remotas em época de pandemia do Corona vírus. Método: Trata-se de estudo reflexivo consubstanciado por fontes secundárias da literatura pertinente à temática, considerando artigos de periódicos nacionais e internacionais e produções recentes sobre educação, formação em saúde, tecnologias remotas, o COVId-19 e saúde pública. Resultados:Evidencia-se que vivenciar os efeitos da pandemia de corona vírus (COVID-19) no setor educacional na formação em saúde, em especial no campo da enfermagem, vai além de uma reorganização estrutural dos cursos, pois implica em mudança atitudinal dos gestores, docentes e discentes para que reformulem as práticas de ensino (por vezes com ferramentas tradicionais), em práticas inovadoras preservando um ensino que propicie ao estudante a criticidade, reflexão, diálogo, vínculo e interação; elementos que fazem parte de uma formação que visa a transformação, o empoderamento e não apenas a transmissão do conhecimento. Nesse contexto, a pandemia do COVID-19 provocou mudanças de paradigmas talvez ainda não superados pelas instituições na área da saúde, pois ao se perceberem dentro de uma realidade em que gerou mudanças nos aspectos políticos, econômicos, culturais e sociais em nível mundial, estas tiveram que se reinventar e inserir no seu processo de trabalho as novas formas de ensinar; tiveram que discutir sobre as diferentes abordagens educacionais e diante das necessidades do readequar os métodos de ensino em saúde, inseriram as tecnologias remotas como ferramentas essenciais para atender a real necessidade da continuidade das aulas no formato não presencial. Para muitos um desafio, pois permeia atualmente uma reflexão sobre o cuidado do ensino à distância no campo da enfermagem e demais cursos da área da saúde. Entretanto, à medida que se abriu para discussões sobre novas formas de ensinar mediadas pela inovação, pode-se dizer que esse será o maior impacto da pandemia para o ensino: a contribuição das novas tecnologias de informação e comunicação no processo ensino aprendizagem para formação em saúde, assim como a reflexão sobre a educação à distância e seus conceitos, diferenciando-a dos conceitos de metodologia remota e o uso das tecnologias. Conclusão: No ensino da enfermagem, a discussão relacionada ao uso de tecnologias remotas em sala de aula sempre foi um ponto de debate. Entretanto, com a necessidade da inclusão dessas ferramentas para a continuidade de aulas no formato não presencial decorrente da estratégia do isolamento social motivada pela pandemia do COVID-19, pode oportunizar a se ter um novo olhar sobre o assunto e que talvez com esse momento vivido se haja oportunidade de ampliar o debate sobre uso dessas metodologias remotas no ensino em saúde, buscando uma reflexão sobre a interação destas com os demais métodos de ensino já implementados.(AU)","Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro",Rev. bras. crescimento desenvolv. hum,592,13

RESULTS: We conducted a cohort study of 159 CAP patients to assess the diagnostic performance of a clinical metagenomics assay and its impact on clinical management and patient outcomes. When compared to other techniques, clinical metagenomics detected more pathogens in more CAP cases, and identified a substantial number of polymicrobial infections. Moreover, metagenomics results led to changes in or confirmation of clinical management in 35 of 59 cases; these 35 cases also had significantly improved patient outcomes.

It started in December 2019 and has, so far, led to more than 149, 470,968 cases, 3,152,121 deaths, and 127,133,013 survivors recovered by 28 April 2021. COVID-19 has a high morbidity, and mortality of 2%, on average, whereas most people are treated after a period of time. Some people who recover from COVID-19 are left with 20 to 30% decreased lung function. In this context, exercise focused on skeletal muscle with minimal lung involvement could potentially play an important role. Regular exercise protects against diseases associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. This long-term effect of exercise may be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory response elicited by an acute bout of exercise, which is partly mediated by muscle-derived myokines. The isometric training system seems to have this feature, because this system is involved with the skeletal muscle as the target tissue. However, no studies have examined the effect of exercise on the treatment and recovery of COVID-19, and, more importantly, ""muscle-lung cross-talk"" as a mechanism for COVID-19 treatment. It is suggested that this theoretical construct be examined by researchers.","Nobari, Hadi; Fashi, Mohamad; Eskandari, Arezoo; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge; Suzuki, Katsuhiko",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),592,24

MethodsWe conducted a randomized controlled trial on volunteer healthcare workers of medical centers that were at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 in Shahroud, Iran. Two hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups to receive DMSO/ethanol or routine care, respectively. The subjects were followed for 4 weeks to determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection in each group based on the RT-qPCR test. Finally, absolute risk difference and relative risk were calculated to evaluate the effect of DMSO in prevent COVID-19. ResultsThe results showed that the incidence of COVID-19 in the control group and intervention group were 0.07 and 0.008, respectively. The relative risk (RR) was 0.12 (0.9-0.02) according to the incidence rate in the two groups. Conclusioncombined application of DMSO and ethanol in healthcare providers can considerably prevent COVID-19.","Hosseinzadeh, Ali; Tavakkolian, Abbas; Kia, Vahid; Ebrahimi, Hossein; Sheibani, Hossein; Binesh, Ehsan; Jafari, Reza; Mirrezaie, Seyed Mohammad; Jafarisani, Moslem; Emamian, Mohammad Hassan",,592,1

However, virtually nothing is known about vitiligo in the context of COVID-19. Therefore, we analyzed treatment delays and its impact on vitiligo, aiming to provide suggestions on vitiligo management within this special period. We performed a retrospective cohort study on 322 patients who visited our clinics at least 2 times from January to December 2020, and their medical records and photographs were reviewed. Patients were divided into normal (n = 155) and late group (n = 167) based on whether experienced treatment delays. As for the active cases, the late group showed higher progression rate than normal group (35 of 86 [40.7%] vs. 10 of 81 [12.3%]; p = 0.002). Moreover, we observed higher recurrence rate in delay group than those of normal group (26 of 81[32.1%] vs. 9 of 74 [12.2%]; p = 0.018) among stable cases. Further univariate and multivariate analysis determined treatment delays as the most important independent risk factor for disease progression and recurrence, and maintenance therapy (>2 years) as a protective factor against recurrence. This study, for the first time, revealed the independent adverse impact of treatment delays on the progression and recurrence of vitiligo and indicated the significance of continuous treatment for halting progression and long-term maintenance therapy for preventing recurrence for vitiligo, which should be highly valued in the management of vitiligo during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Xinya; Zhang, Chengfeng; Jiang, Min; Xiang, Leihong Flora",Dermatol Ther,592,10

Whether ambient air pollutants increase the risk of common acute respiratory infections among adults is uncertain, yet this may help understand whether pollutants influence spread of pandemic respiratory infections like COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between ambient air pollutant exposures and respiratory infections in adults. METHODS: During five study examinations over 12 years, 6536 participants in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) reported upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, pneumonia or febrile illness in the preceding 2 weeks. Using a validated spatiotemporal model, we estimated residential concentrations of ambient PM2.5, NOx and NO2 for the 2-6 weeks (short-term) and year (long-term) prior to each examination. RESULTS: In this population aged 44-84 years at baseline, 10%-32% of participants reported a recent respiratory infection, depending on month of examination and study region. PM2.5, NOx and NO2 concentrations over the prior 2-6 weeks were associated with increased reporting of recent respiratory infection, with risk ratios (95% CIs) of 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09), 1.15 (1.10 to 1.20) and 1.21 (1.10 to 1.33), respectively, per increase from 25th to 75th percentile in residential pollutant concentration. CONCLUSION: Higher short-term exposure to PM2.5 and traffic-related pollutants are associated with increased risk of symptomatic acute respiratory infections among adults. These findings may provide an insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19.","Kirwa, Kipruto; Eckert, Carly M; Vedal, Sverre; Hajat, Anjum; Kaufman, Joel D",,592,24

Considering the current lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has never been so important to find different ways to allow residents to improve their knowledge. We asked all plastic and esthetic surgery residents in our country to fill out a questionnaire to investigate changes in their didactical activity and analyze problems about their professional growth in the last few months. From the results of such questionnaires, we found that most of the residents feel the decrease in surgical activities during this time is a detrimental factor for their training and that even if all the schools have changed their didactical activities no school has introduced the use of virtual simulators to compensate for the decrease in surgical practice. Actually, the majority of residents use webinars to keep updated, stating that such technologies are useful but not sufficient to analyze plastic surgery topics in depth during COVID-19 lockdown. Virtual interactive tools are well known in different clinical and surgical specialties, and they are considered as a valid support, but it seems that in plastic surgery they are not so used. According to the most recent studies about residents' didactical program, we have investigated the potential of Anatomage Table in combination with Touch Surgery application as physical and mental aids to bypass the decreased number and kind of surgical interventions performed in this particular time. Anatomage is an academic user-friendly touch screen table; it is used by both medical students and residents to learn human anatomy and to master surgical anatomy. Touch Surgery is an application available on smartphones and tablets that gives the possibility to watch real and virtually designed surgical videos, accompanied by explanatory comments on the surgical phases; they are interactive and give the possibility to check what you have learned through tests administered after virtual classes. In our opinion, these tools represent reliable solutions to improve plastic residents' training, mostly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria's well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 103 SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.","Popa, Alexandra; Genger, Jakob-Wendelin; Nicholson, Michael D; Penz, Thomas; Schmid, Daniela; Aberle, Stephan W; Agerer, Benedikt; Lercher, Alexander; Endler, Lukas; Colaço, Henrique; Smyth, Mark; Schuster, Michael; Grau, Miguel L; Martínez-Jiménez, Francisco; Pich, Oriol; Borena, Wegene; Pawelka, Erich; Keszei, Zsofia; Senekowitsch, Martin; Laine, Jan; Aberle, Judith H; Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Karolyi, Mario; Zoufaly, Alexander; Maritschnik, Sabine; Borkovec, Martin; Hufnagl, Peter; Nairz, Manfred; Weiss, Günter; Wolfinger, Michael T; von Laer, Dorothee; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Lopez-Bigas, Nuria; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth; Allerberger, Franz; Michor, Franziska; Bock, Christoph; Bergthaler, Andreas",Sci. transl. med,592,20

In this paper, we estimated the improvements achieved in air quality during the lockdown period (March 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020) by analyzing PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3 data from nine different air quality monitoring stations distributed across four different zones of the industrialized Gujarat state of western Indian. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-Air Quality Index (AQI) illustrated better air qualities during the lockdown with higher improvements in the zones 2 (Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar) and 3 (Jamnagar and Rajkot), and moderate improvements in the zones 1 (Surat, Ankleshwar and Vadodra) and 4 (Bhuj and Palanpur). The concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were reduced by 38-78%, 32-80% and 30-84%, respectively. Functioning of the power plants possibly led to less reduction in CO (3-55%) and the declined emission of NO helped to improve O3 (16-48%) contents. We observed an overall improvement of 58% in AQI for the first four months of 2020 compared to the same interval of previous year. This positive outcome resulted from the lockdown restrictions might help to modify the existing environmental policies of the region.","Selvam, S; Muthukumar, P; Venkatramanan, S; Roy, P D; Manikanda Bharath, K; Jesuraja, K",Sci Total Environ,592,20

In this paper, we explore strategies that such institutions can adopt to conduct safe reopening and resume operations during the pandemic. The research is motivated by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's (UIUC's) SHIELD program, which is a set of policies and strategies, including rapid saliva-based COVID-19 screening, for ensuring safety of students, faculty and staff to conduct in-person operations, at least partially. Specifically, we study how rapid bulk testing, contact tracing and preventative measures such as mask wearing, sanitization, and enforcement of social distancing can allow institutions to manage the epidemic spread. This work combines the power of analytical epidemic modeling, data analysis and agent-based simulations to derive policy insights. We develop an analytical model that takes into account the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, the effect of isolation via testing (both in bulk and through contact tracing) and the rate of contacts among people within and outside the institution. Next, we use data from the UIUC SHIELD program and 85 other universities to estimate parameters that describe the analytical model. Using the estimated parameters, we finally conduct agent-based simulations with various model parameters to evaluate testing and reopening strategies. The parameter estimates from UIUC and other universities show similar trends. For example, infection rates at various institutions grow rapidly in certain months and this growth correlates positively with infection rates in counties where the universities are located. Infection rates are also shown to be negatively correlated with testing rates at the institutions. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that the key to designing an effective reopening strategy is a combination of rapid bulk testing and effective preventative measures such as mask wearing and social distancing. Multiple other factors help to reduce infection load, such as efficient contact tracing, reduced delay between testing and result revelation, tests with less false negatives and targeted testing of high-risk class among others. This paper contributes to the nascent literature on combating the COVID-19 pandemic and is especially relevant for educational institutions and similarly large organizations. We contribute by providing an analytical model that can be used to estimate key parameters from data, which in turn can be used to simulate the effect of different strategies for reopening. We quantify the relative effect of different strategies such as bulk testing, contact tracing, reduced infectivity and contact rates in the context of educational institutions. Specifically, we show that for the estimated average base infectivity of 0.025 ([Formula: see text]), a daily number of tests to population ratio T/N of 0.2, i.e., once a week testing for all individuals, is a good indicative threshold. However, this test to population ratio is sensitive to external infectivities, internal and external mobilities, delay in getting results after testing, and measures related to mask wearing and sanitization, which affect the base infection rate.","Mukherjee, Ujjal K; Bose, Subhonmesh; Ivanov, Anton; Souyris, Sebastian; Seshadri, Sridhar; Sridhar, Padmavati; Watkins, Ronald; Xu, Yuqian",Sci Rep,592,2

The aim of this study is to examine the opinion that specific demographic groups have about COVID-19 vaccination, in order to detect potential fears and reasons for negative attitudes towards vaccination, and to gain knowledge on how to prepare strategies to eliminate possible misinformation that could affect vaccine hesitancy. The data collection approach was based on online questionnaire surveys, divided into three groups of questions that followed the main postulates of the health belief theory-a theory that helps understanding a behaviour of the public in some concrete surrounding in receiving preventive measures. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the influence of individual factors on refusing the vaccine, and to provide information on the perception of participants on the danger of COVID-19 infection, and on potential barriers that could retard the vaccine utility. There was an equal proportion of participants (total number 276) who planned on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (37%), and of those who did not (36.3%). The rest (26.7%) of participants were still indecisive. Our results indicated that attitudes on whether to receive the vaccine, on how serious consequences might be if getting the infection, as well as a suspicious towards the vaccine efficacy and the fear of the vaccine potential side effects, may depend on participants' age (<40 vs. >40 years) and on whether they are healthcare workers or not. The barriers that make participants' unsure about of receiving the vaccine, such as a distrust in the vaccine efficacy and safety, may vary in different socio-demographic groups and depending on which is the point of time in the course of the pandemic development, as well as on the vaccine availability and experience in using certain vaccine formulas.

Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state‐led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producers—an already more vulnerable population—income fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.","Ceballos, Francisco; Kannan, Samyuktha; Kramer, Berber",Agric Econ,592,1

Thus, pharmaceutical distributors are regularly assessed by qualified experts. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a suspension of normal activities, remote assessments via videoconferencing may represent a temporary alternative to on-site audits. We exploratorily evaluated the feasibility of remote assessments of pharmaceutical distributors, located in a low- or middle-income country hard-to reach during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted pilot remote assessments of four conveniently selected distributors. The expert was remotely connected via videoconference, and supported by an in-country assessment facilitator (ICAF), who had received ad hoc training and was present at the assessed facility. First, the remote expert assessed the quality assurance (QA) activities and rated their compliance with the standards of the World Health Organization Good Storage & Distribution Practices (GSDP), as per routine practice. Second, s/he assessed the completeness, clarity and accuracy of data collected remotely, first per distributor, and then in aggregated form. RESULTS: Data completeness was assessed by the expert as excellent, while clarity and accuracy were good. Overall data quality (a combination of completeness, clarity and accuracy) was good, with no major differences across QA activities, nor across distributors. Contextual limitations included poor internet connection, language barriers, and distributors’ lack of familiarity with QA terminology. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are exploratory and cannot be extrapolated to other contexts, nor to other types of audits. Nonetheless, this pilot experience suggests that a well-planned remote assessment of pharmaceutical distributors, conducted with the support of a well-trained onsite ICAF, can provide data of acceptable quality, allowing to assess GSDP-compliance and to make temporary decisions about licensing or purchasing. Purchasers and policy makers should read the results of remote assessments in light of their intrinsic limitations. At the moment, onsite assessments remain the gold standards, but this could change in the longer term, with improved information technology and in light of the need to avoid unnecessary travels.

KSHV achieves this by tethering its epigenome to the host chromosome by latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which binds in the terminal repeat (TR) region of the viral genome. Sequence analysis of the TR, a GC-rich DNA element, identified several potential Quadruplex G-Rich Sequences (QGRS). Since quadruplexes have the tendency to obstruct DNA replication, we used G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds to examine their effect on latent DNA replication and the persistence of viral episomes. Our results showed that these G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds led to the activation of dormant origins of DNA replication, with preferential bi-directional pausing of replications forks moving out of the TR region, implicating the role of the G-rich TR in the perturbation of episomal DNA replication. Over time, treatment with PhenDC3 showed a loss of viral episomes in the infected cells. Overall, these data show that G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds retard the progression of replication forks leading to a reduction in DNA replication and episomal maintenance. These results suggest a potential role for G-quadruplex stabilizers in the treatment of KSHV-associated diseases.","Madireddy, Advaitha; Purushothaman, Pravinkumar; Loosbroock, Christopher P.; Robertson, Erle S.; Schildkraut, Carl L.; Verma, Subhash C.",Nucleic Acids Res,592,16

We present the United Nations (UN) Inter-agency groups’ efforts to support countries to report on SDG health indicators, project progress towards 2030 targets and build country accountability for action. Objective: We highlight common principles and practices of each Inter-agency group and the progress made towards SDG 3 targets using seven health indicators as examples. The indicators used provide examples of best practice for modelling estimates and projections using standard methods, transparent data collection and country consultations. Methods: Practices common to the UN agencies include multi-UN agency participation, expert groups to advise on estimation methods, transparent publication of methods and data inputs, use of UN-derived population estimates, country consultations, and a common reporting platform to present results. Our seven examples illustrate how estimates, using mostly Bayesian models, make use of country data to track progress towards SDG targets for 2030. Results: Progress has been made over the past decade. However, none of the seven indicators are on track to achieve their respective SDG targets by 2030. Accelerated efforts are needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to reduce the burden of maternal, child, communicable and noncommunicable disease mortality, and to provide access to modern methods of family planning to all women. Conclusion: Our analysis shows the benefit of UN interagency monitoring which prioritizes transparent country data sources, UN population estimates and life tables, and rigorous but replicable modelling methods. Countries are supported to build capacity for data collection, analysis and reporting. Through these monitoring efforts we support countries to tackle even the most intransient health issues, including the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is reversing the hard-earned gains of all countries.","Strong, Kathleen; Noor, Abdislan; Aponte, John; Banerjee, Anshu; Cibulskis, Richard; Diaz, Theresa; Ghys, Peter; Glaziou, Philippe; Hereward, Mark; Hug, Lucia; Kantorova, Vladimira; Mahy, Mary; Moller, Ann-Beth; Requejo, Jennifer; Riley, Leanne; Say, Lale; You, Danzhen",Global health action,592,13

The objective of this narrative review was to summarize the psychological outcome of the “Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic” on healthcare workers in kingdom of Saudi Arabia to assess their mental health outcome that can aid in development of guidelines and psychological interventions that can improve healthcare workers' quality of life, work and decision-making capability toward patient treatment during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive research was done to overview current available literature on psychological and mental health issues observed among healthcare workers “HCW” in Saudi Arabia. The search included all articles published since the beginning of the pandemic from January 2020 till February 2021 relevant to the subject of the review. In this review, a total of 10 primary research articles were included following a cross-sectional survey method to analyze the impact of various psychological variables. RESULTS: Anxiety symptoms were reported by between 33.3% and 68.5% of HCWs. Between 27.9% and 55.2% of HCWs reported depressive symptoms. HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances and distress with a range comprised between 27.9% and 68.5%. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic has certainly led to multifaceted and vigorous psychological and mental impact on healthcare providers, it is now both an opportunity and challenge to design further studies that can lead to development of guidelines in Saudi Arabia and worldwide to improve mental health infrastructure that strengthen patient oriented treatment of care plan during this pandemic.","Bahamdan, Ahmed S",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,592,1

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between prior metabolic surgery and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System in the United States. METHODS: Among 4365 patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 8, 2020 and July 22, 2020 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System, 33 patients were identified who had a prior history of metabolic surgery. The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n = 330) with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m(2) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The average BMI of the surgical group was 49.1 ± 8.8 kg/m(2) before metabolic surgery and was down to 37.2 ± 7.1 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared with the control group’s BMI of 46.7 ± 6.4 kg/m(2). In the univariate analysis, 6 (18.2%) patients in the metabolic surgery group and 139 (42.1%) patients in the control group were admitted to the hospital (P = .013). In the multivariate analysis, a prior history of metabolic surgery was associated with a lower hospital admission rate compared with control patients with obesity (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11−0.88; P = .028). While none of the 4 exploratory outcomes occurred in the metabolic surgery group, 43 (13.0%) patients in the control group required ICU admission (P = .021), 22 (6.7%) required mechanical ventilation, 5 (1.5%) required dialysis, and 8 (2.4%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Prior metabolic surgery with subsequent weight loss and improvement of metabolic abnormalities was associated with lower rates of hospital and ICU admission in patients with obesity who became infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. Considering different starting times of infection, mathematical models are proposed to represent SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in infected patients. Based on the target cell limited model, the within-host reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the broad values of human influenza infection. The best model to fit the data was including immune cell response, which suggests a slow immune response peaking between 5 to 10 days post-onset of symptoms. The model with the eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, all models predict that SARS-CoV-2 may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and viral load could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.

Results from recent studies have shown that inhibition of programmed death-ligand 1 receptor (PD-L1) in TNBC patients is associated with better prognosis. Currently, data on PD-L1 expression and its prognostic value in Indonesian TNBC patients are still relatively unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PD-L1 in Indonesian TNBC patients as preliminary proof to support PD-L1 inhibitor as a possible treatment option near in the future. METHODS: We retrospectively included stage I-III TNBC patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 in Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Clinical variables were collected from medical record. Paraffin blocks of biopsy specimen were retrieved to examine mRNA level of PD-L1. RESULTS: We included 48 subjects with mean age of 51.09 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 24.58. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 58.3%. Overexpression of PD-L1 mRNA in TNBC patients is associated with worse prognosis (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant associations between PD-L1 mRNA expression and any of the clinicopathologic variables examined. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, PD-L1 mRNA overexpression is associated with worse survival in Indonesian TNBC patients, independent of other established risk factors.

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17–69 years giving blood April 6 to May 3 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The first 20,640 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (CI: 0.8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 89 per 100,000 (CI: 72-211) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely several fold lower than the current estimate.

The map constitutes a comprehensive open access evidence-based database, so far collating 380+ emergency measures, in 120+ countries. This paper particularly shows and discusses how the response has been developing until early 2021, highlighting various emerging longer-term concerns and strategies across Global North and South. The global COVID-19 response merits close attention in our view, as it reveals both the universal importance of household energy services access and important underlying existing narratives and policy-making questionsabout securing energy services access as a vital basic need, and even a ‘basic right’. In fact, the paper additionally evaluates whether and how COVID-19 responses seem to fall in step with a nascent global trend of (legal) recognition of ‘rights to energy’ in international, regional and national policy, including for example in the EU, India, Philippines, and Colombia.We conclude that while the COVID-19 response clearly reflects broad recognition of the vital importance of affordable, continuous energy services access for basic human well-being and capabilities during the pandemic, a right to energy perspective could additionally lay bare or give shape to important concerns about some households’ too minimal (insufficient) forms of modern energy access, questions of equity, and the role of the state and other actors. In terms of equity the article particularly raises issues with the manner in which support was made available only to some consumers (e.g. on-grid, off-grid, regulated, or non-regulated, post-paid or pre-paid), or only for specific fuels, and not others. In addition, the lack of attention to clean (renewable) (off-grid) energy services in COVID-19 responses is striking, and worrying, both in terms of immediate response, and green recovery from COVID-19. We argue that a right to (clean) energy perspective would help to reflect on, and inform, both shorter-term and longer-term responses to energy poverty and COVID-19, and should aid the realization of sufficiently equitable, robust, modern energy systems in line with universal UN Global Sustainable Development Goal 7.

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. SUMMARY: Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.","Singh, Ankit; Kaur, Gurminder; Singh, Sanchita; Singh, Neetu; Saxena, Gauri; Verma, Praveen C.",Curr Mol Biol Rep,592,16

However, whether it is an independent factor on the severity and mortality of COVID-19 has not been studied. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, 736 patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included from 12 January 2020 to 25 March 2020. All patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not they were hypertensive. After propensity score matching (PSM) to remove the interference of mismatches in the baseline data, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)/ACE inhibitors application were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 220 (29.9%) patients were hypertensive, and 516 (70.1%) patients were not hypertensive. PSM eliminated demographic and comorbidity differences between the two groups. Of all participants, 32 patients died (4.3% mortality), including 17 out of 220 in the hypertension group (7.7%) and 15 out of 516 in the non-hypertension group (2.9%). The incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) stay in the hypertension group (12.8%) was higher than in the non-hypertension group (5.3%) (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension was an independent risk factor for death, not other comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that mortality was higher in the hypertension group than in the non-hypertension group before and after PSM (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in ICU therapy, mortality and hospitalisation time between hypertensive patients with or without ARBs/ACE inhibitors (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Hypertension was an independent risk factor for the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. ARBs/ACE inhibitors should not be discontinued in hypertensive patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Jiankun; Liu, Yuntao; Qin, Jinying; Ruan, Chunyan; Zeng, Xianghui; Xu, Aiting; Yang, Rongyuan; Li, Jiqiang; Cai, Huayang; Zhang, Zhongde",Postgrad Med J,592,14

Hence, the current research aims to investigate the psychological and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on rural communities in the Sichuan Province of China. METHODS: A total of 499 participants (village representatives of Sichuan Province) were approached to partake in a cross-sectional online survey and share their experience regarding the ongoing pandemic. The descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the pandemic has significantly affected local people psychologically, leading to socioeconomic vulnerability. Notably, we find that local households are worried about their income losses regardless of their socioeconomic status (40%–43%), level of income (37%–43%) and industry involvement (38%–43%). However, as income increases, the level of stress decreases. The results further show that government transfer payment is a significant factor in reducing stress due to its reliable and uninterrupted income flow. Contrary to our proposition, the pandemic stress was less observed, which might be because of people’s trust in government and effective antiepidemic countermeasures to contain the disease. CONCLUSION: This study finds that COVID-19 has a significant impact on local people’s health, psychology and income. This study is one of the first to provide empirical evidence regarding the early health and socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 at the household level in rural communities, which are very important to devise policies to ease the outbreak and prevent further losses at the local community level.","Shafi, Mohsin; Liu, Junrong; Jian, Deng; Rahman, Imran Ur; Chen, Xunwei",BMJ Open,592,10

Poorly constructed guidelines that are incomprehensive and/or ambiguous may compromise HCWs’ safety. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection control strategies in HCWs based on the guidelines published early in the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND OUTCOMES: A three-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was performed. The tool was validated by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific, and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. RESULTS: Overall consensus (≥75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The Delphi panel recommended an ideal infection control guideline should encompass six domains: general characteristics (domain-1), engineering recommendations (domain-2), personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3), and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection control. The appraisal tool performed well across the six domains and the inter-rater agreement was excellent for the 40 guidelines. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower-income countries. CONCLUSION: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use. Engineering recommendations aspects of infection control, administrative measures that promote optimal PPE use, and HCW wellbeing were generally lacking in assessed guidelines. This tool may enable health systems to adopt high-quality HCW infection control guidelines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and may also provide a framework for future guideline development.","Subramaniam, Ashwin; Reddy, Mallikarjuna; Kadam, Umesh; Zubarev, Alexander; Lim, Zheng; Anstey, Chris; Bihari, Shailesh; Haji, Jumana; Luo, Jinghang; Mitra, Saikat; Ramanathan, Kollengode; Rajamani, Arvind; Rubulotta, Francesca; Svensk, Erik; Shekar, Kiran",Aust Crit Care,592,19

Nevertheless, the prevalence of depression among college students in China during lockdown, following the COVID-19 pandemic, and their coping strategies have not been quantitatively assessed. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression among college students in China during the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and assess their coping strategies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the prevalence of depression among college students in China and their coping strategies. Results: The results indicated that, during lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence rates of college students in China suffering from mild, moderate, and severe depression were 25% (95% CI = 17–33%), 7% (95% CI = 2–14%), and 2% (95% CI = 1–5%), respectively. Besides, the proportion of college students who use WeChat and Weibo to acquire COVID-19 knowledge was 39% (95% CI = 13–68%), whereas the proportion of college students using mental health application services (APPs) to deal with depression was 59% (95% CI = 41–73%). Conclusions: The prevalence of depression among college students in China was high during the lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, considering the adverse outcomes of depression, it is imperative to screen college students in China for depression during the CIVID-19 pandemic and provide them with necessary psychological interventions to control and prevent depression. Social media platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo, and mental health APPs could provide an opportunity for psychological health information dissemination for college students.

Their contribution is especially important in the resource-scarce settings of developing nations such as Vietnam. Yet, the intention of medical students, in particular, nursing students, to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities has not been well-understood. This study aimed to examine factors associated with the intentionto participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities among Vietnamese nursing students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 597 students in December 2020 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Information regarding the socioeconomic characteristics of participants, their source of COVID-19 related knowledge, and their perception and attitude toward participating in COVID-19 frontline activities [based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)] was collected. A hierarchical regression model was employed to examine the association between intentions of students and associated factors. Results: A positive intention to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities was found (mean score of 25.3 over 35; SD = 4.4; min = 5; max = 35). Attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) was found to be significantly associated with the intention of students. These variables explained the 37% variation in the intention of students in the model. Among three factors, subjective norm showed the strongest correlation with intention of students (β = 0.358; p < 0.001). Obtaining information from official sources and community was also found to be positively correlated with intention to participate. Conclusion: Most of the respondents reported a positive intention to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities. The findings suggested that the TPB was a good instrument to predict the intention to perform behavior among Vietnamese students. Enhancing the positive attitude of students, encouraging family and community supports, and providing adequately essential resources will contribute to optimizing the participation of students to confront COVID-19.","Tran, Quynh Anh; Nguyen, Huong Thi Thanh; Bui, Tung Van; Tran, Nguyet Thi; Nguyen, Nguyet Thi; Nguyen, Tham Thi; Nguyen, Hien Thu; Nguyen, Son Hoang",Front Public Health,592,1

Objective: To assess SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-specific humoral and cellular responses in patients treated with ocrelizumab compared with healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center study performed at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, included patients with MS treated with ocrelizumab, healthy controls, and untreated patients with MS. Vaccination occurred between December 2020 and April 2021. Participants donated blood 2 to 4 and 2 to 8 weeks after the second vaccine dose for antibody and T-cell assessments, respectively. Exposures: All participants received 2 doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) and completed the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of patients treated with ocrelizumab with SARS-CoV-2-specific serology and/or T-cell responses following vaccination. All participants underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing; 29 patients treated with ocrelizumab and 15 healthy controls had evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses. Results: Of 112 participants, 49 (43.8%) had MS and were treated with ocrelizumab (33 [67.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [13.3] years), 23 (20.5%) had MS and were not treated with disease-modifying therapies (18 [78.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 49 [13.4] years), and 40 (35.7%) were healthy controls (25 [62.5%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.3 [16] years). Twenty-six of 29 patients (89.7%) treated with ocrelizumab and 15 of 15 healthy controls (100%) had SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells following vaccination at similar levels (mean [SD], 15.4 [7.6] and 14.3 [6.3] spot-forming cells, respectively). Mean antibody titers and positive serology rate were lower in the group of patients treated with ocrelizumab (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 26.2 [49.2] and 376.5 [907.6] AU/mL; 10 of 40 [25%] and 20 of 49 [40.8%] for S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain, respectively) compared with healthy controls (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 283 [100] and 12â¯712 [9114] AU/mL; 100% S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain) and untreated patients (mean [SD] antibody titers and positive serology rate, 288.3 [113.8] and 10â¯877 [9476] AU/mL; 100% S1/S2 and receptor-binding domain), with positive association to time from ocrelizumab infusion (S1/S2: r = 0.7, P < .001; receptor-binding domain: r = 0.4, P = .04). Conclusion and Relevance: In this study, patients with MS who were treated with ocrelizumab generated comparable SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses with healthy controls and had lower antibody response following vaccination. Given the potential role of T cells in protection from severe disease, this is reassuring and will help physicians develop consensus guidelines regarding MS treatment in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brill, Livnat; Rechtman, Ariel; Zveik, Omri; Haham, Nitzan; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Wolf, Dana G; Levin, Netta; Raposo, Catarina; Vaknin-Dembinsky, Adi",JAMA neurol.

We aim to examine the differential importation risks with departure origins and post-arrival controls. METHODS: We developed a Bayesian framework to model disease progress of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of travel measures and inferred the origin-specific disease prevalence among inbound travellers, using data on passengers arriving in Hong Kong and laboratory-confirmed imported cases. We estimated the origin-specific risks of releasing infectious travellers under different control strategies and traveller volumes. We also estimated the risk of having released infectious travellers when a resurgence occurs in departure locations with no imported cases during a certain period. FINDINGS: Under the then strict controls of 14-day quarantine and testing on day 12, the Philippines imposed the greatest importation risk among the studied countries/regions (95.8% of releasing at least one infectious traveller, 95% credible interval (CrI), 94.8-96.6%). This was higher than that from low prevalence countries/regions (e.g., 23.4%, 95% CrI, 21.6-25.3% for Taiwan) if controls relaxed (i.e., 7-day quarantine and test on day 5). Increased traveller volumes and resurgence in departure locations with low prevalence under relaxed controls did not impose a greater importation risk than high prevalence locations under stricter controls. INTERPRETATION: Moderate relaxation of control measures for travellers arriving from low prevalence locations did not impose higher risks of community outbreaks than strict controls on travellers from high prevalence locations.

Among these, there is a long history of infectious diseases that have spread from non-human primates (NHP) to humans. For millennia, indigenous groups that depend on wildlife for their survival were exposed to the risk of NHP pathogens' transmission through animal hunting and wild meat consumption. Usually, exposure is of no consequence or is limited to mild infections. In rare situations, it can be more severe or even become a real public health concern. Since the emergence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), nobody can ignore that an emerging infectious diseases (EID) might spread from NHP into the human population. In large parts of Central Africa and Asia, wildlife remains the primary source of meat and income for millions of people living in rural areas. However, in the past few decades the risk of exposure to an NHP pathogen has taken on a new dimension. Unprecedented breaking down of natural barriers between NHP and humans has increased exposure to health risks for a much larger population, including people living in urban areas. There are several reasons for this: (i) due to road development and massive destruction of ecosystems for agricultural needs, wildlife and humans come into contact more frequently; (ii) due to ecological awareness, many long distance travelers are in search of wildlife discovery, with a particular fascination for African great apes; (iii) due to the attraction for ancient temples and mystical practices, others travelers visit Asian places colonized by NHP. In each case, there is a risk of pathogen transmission through a bite or another route of infection. Beside the individual risk of contracting a pathogen, there is also the possibility of starting a new pandemic. This article reviews the known cases of NHP pathogens' transmission to humans whether they are hunters, travelers, ecotourists, veterinarians, or scientists working on NHP. Although pathogen transmission is supposed to be a rare outcome, Rabies virus, Herpes B virus, Monkeypox virus, Ebola virus, or Yellow fever virus infections are of greater concern and require quick countermeasures from public health professionals.","Devaux, Christian A.; Mediannikov, Oleg; Medkour, Hacene; Raoult, Didier",Front Public Health,592,24

We collected data from January 23 to March 25 from Heilongjiang province and trained an ordinary differential equation model to fit the epidemic data. We extended the simulation using this trained model to characterize the effect of an imported ‘escaper’. We showed that an imported ‘escaper’ was responsible for the newly confirmed COVID-19 infections from Apr 9 to Apr 19 in Heilongjiang province. Stochastic simulations further showed that significantly increased local contacts among imported ‘escaper’, its epidemiologically associated cases and susceptible populations greatly contributed to the local outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, we further found that the reported number of asymptomatic patients was markedly lower than model predictions implying a large asymptomatic pool which was not identified. We further forecasted the effect of implementing strong interventions immediately to impede COVID-19 outbreak for Heilongjiang province. Implementation of stronger interventions to lower mutual contacts could accelerate the complete recovery from coronavirus infections in Heilongjiang province. Collectively, our model has characterized the epidemic of COVID-19 in Heilongjiang province and implied that strongly controlled measured should be taken for infected and asymptomatic patients to minimize total infections.","Sun, Tingzhe; Wang, Yan",Chaos Solitons Fractals,592,8

In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits.

However, currently available data on COVID-19 in pts with hematologic disease are limited. Methods: CHRONOS19 registry is an observational prospective cohort study with the primary objective to evaluate the treatment outcomes in adult pts (age 18 or older) with hematologic disease and COVID-19. Secondary objectives are to describe severity and complications of COVID-19 and course of hematologic disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected pts, and to explore importance of various factors for disease severity and mortality. Pts with laboratory-confirmed or suspected (based on clinical symptoms and/or CT) COVID-19 were eligible for enrollment. Data were collected on a web platform and managed in a de-identified manner. Physicians from 8 hematology clinical centers and hospitals from all over Russia (Moscow, Ulan-Ude, Saransk, Vladimir, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kazan) participate in this study. Pts are followed for 30 days (ds) after COVID-19 diagnosis and up to 6 months (mos) for hematologic disease outcomes and overall survival assessment. The results of the first follow-up are presented in this interim analysis. Results: As of July 30, 2020, 184 pts were enrolled (females/males [n(%)]: 80(44%)/104 (56%); median [range] age: 55 [18-83] years. Disease type (malignant/non-malignant [n(%)]): 164(89%)/20(11%), including AML 36(20%), ALL 16(9%), MDS 5(2%), APL 5(2%), MM 38(21%), HL 4(2%), NHL 38(21%), MPN 9(5%), CLL 13(7%), others 20(11%). Concomitant diseases were in 95(52%) pts: cardiovascular 56(59%), pulmonary 6(6%), hepatic 6(6%) or renal 5(5%), diabetes 17(18%), obesity 4(4%), other 16(17%). 176 patients were evaluable for the primary outcome assessment with a median follow-up of 41(1-125) ds. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 23% (41 pts died). Death due to COVID-19 complications occurred in 34 (83%) pts, 7(17%) pts died due to progression of hematologic disease. Fifty (28%) pts experienced COVID-19 complications, the most common were pneumonia in 125 (71%) pts, respiratory failure in 82(47%) pts, ARDS in 11(6%) pts, cytokine release syndrome in 15(9%) pts, multiple organ failure in 10(6%) pts, sepsis in 6(3%) pts, and pulmonary bleeding in 1(0,6%). Specific anti-COVID-19 treatment was given to 117 pts(67%) pts: most common first-line treatment was hydroxichloroquine+azithromycin in 84(72%) pts, azithromycin monotherapy in 27(23%) pts, other drugs in 6(5%) pts; second-line treatment comprised lopinavir+ritonavir in 38 pts, tocilizumab in 29 pts, umifenovir in 5 pts, baricitinib in 5 pts, canakinumab in 1pt, sarilumab in 1 pt. The rate of ICU admissions was 27%(47 pts), among them only 11(23%) pts survived, 36(20%) pts required mechanical ventilation, only 2(5.5%) pts survived. Eighty-eight(50%) pts received anticoagulants. With regard to the blood disease, treatment delays occurred in 101(57%) pts with a median 4 weeks, 6(3%) pts required change of treatment. At the first follow-up (30 ds) the rate of relapse / progression of hematologic disease was 16 of 151 evaluable pts (10.6%). Thirty-day overall survival was 75%. At the data cutoff, median overall survival was not reached. Antibody detection was performed in 70 pts: 53(76%) pts had IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among factors possibly associated with poor survival were: stage of COVID-19 1(n=41) - 91,8%/ 2(n=75) - 90%/ 3(n=36) - 56,5%/ 4(n=22) - 13,6% (p<0,0001), concomitant diseases (n=93/81): 59,5% vs. 87% (p=0,0001), transfusion dependence (n=65/104): 58,1% vs. 81,8% (p=0,0007), prior steroid therapy (n=73/90): 64,6% vs. 82% (p=0,019), older age (<60 (n=108)/≥60 (n=68) years): 80% vs. 60% (p=0,048). Sex, disease type, myelotoxic agranulocytosis, and prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were not associated with worse outcomes. Data on the longer follow-up (90 and 180 ds) will be presented. Conclusions: Patients with hematologic disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection have high 30-day all-cause mortality predominantly due to COVID-19 complications. Stage of COVID-19, concomitant diseases, transfusion dependence, prior steroid therapy, and older age were associated with poor outcomes.

The test detects in patient’s urine six proteins from Leishmania infantum (chagasi) and Leishmania donovani, the etiological agents of VL. The gold standard test for VL is microscopic observation of the parasites in aspirates from spleen, liver, or bone marrow (and lymph node for dogs). Culture of the parasites or detection of their DNA in these aspirates are also commonly used. Serological tests are available but they cannot distinguish patients with active VL from either healthy subjects exposed to the parasites or from subjects who had a successful VL treatment. An antigen detection test based on the agglutination of anti-leishmania carbohydrates antibody coated latex beads has been described. However, the results obtained with this carbohydrate-based test have been conflicting. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered six L. infantum/L. donovani proteins excreted in the urine of VL patients and used them as markers for the development of a robust mAb-based antigen (protein) detection test. The test is assembled in a multiplexed format to simultaneously detect all six markers. Its initial clinical validation showed a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% for VL diagnosis.","Campos-Neto, Antonio; Abeijon, Claudia",Microorganisms,592,18

It has created havoc globally and India is no exception. Globally, it is emphasized that preventive measures play an important role in controlling the rapid spread of COVID-19. In India, 68% of population is rural and this population is going to play a crucial role in the containment of the pandemic. Realizing the key position of rural population in COVID control, this study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of rural population about the disease. METHOD AND MATERIAL: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on patients and their relatives from 1(st) April, 2020 to 31(st) May, 2020. A total of 372 participants hailing from rural areas were enrolled. RESULTS: Most common source of information for the participants was through television (54.8%) and radio (49.2%). Only 77% claimed that they were using face mask and 72% claimed to be following social distancing. A large (60%) proportion of the participants did not know that COVID-19 could spread from asymptomatic patients. Education of participants was a key determinant for use of social distancing and face mask as a preventive tool. With increasing age, the practice of social distancing and the use of face mask were decreasing in our study. CONCLUSION: Television/Radio channels form an important source of information and need to be used more effectively to educate the people about the disease and create awareness about effective preventive measures. People need to be educated about the role of asymptomatic carriers in spreading the disease.","Gupta, Preeti; Gupta, Anshi; Dixit, Sumeet; Kumar, Hemant",J Family Med Prim Care,592,3

CS can be a live-saving procedure when medically indicated, but it comes with higher risks for women and newborns when done without medical indication. Crucially, inequalities in who receives CS exist, both within and across countries. Understanding factors driving increasing rates and inequalities of CS is imperative to optimise the use of this life-saving intervention. This study aimed to investigate trends of CS use and inequalities across sociodemographic characteristics in Indonesia over a 30-year period. METHODS: Seven waves of the Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey were used to estimate trends and inequalities in CS from 1987 to 2017. Relative and absolute inequalities across a range of sociodemographic characteristics were estimated and trends in inequalities were assessed through changes in rate ratio and rate difference. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based births in Indonesia has increased in the past 30 years, coinciding with an increase in CS rate (CSR) (1991 CSR: 1.6% (95% CI 1.3 to 1.9); 2017 CSR: 17.6% (95% CI 16.7 to 18.5)). Higher rates of CS are observed mostly in Western Indonesia, while lower CSRs are observed in Eastern Indonesia. Inequalities of CSRs in Indonesia are observed across type of health facility (public/private), regions, places of residence, wealth quintiles and maternal education, with the highest CSRs in more affluent and educated groups. Widening absolute inequalities of CS are observed across all sociodemographic characteristics, except facility type, where CSR gaps between public and private facilities have closed on both relative and absolute scales. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of increasing trends in CSRs and widening absolute inequalities in CSRs across different sociodemographic groups of women in Indonesia. The context of increasing CSRs across society, however, may have resulted in more stable relative inequalities. Improving understanding of the drivers of these trends in Indonesia and, particularly, of women’s and providers’ perspectives and preferences for childbirth, should be prioritised to optimise the use of CS.","Zahroh, Rana Islamiah; Disney, George; Betrán, Ana Pilar; Bohren, Meghan A.",BMJ Glob Health,592,12

SARS-CoV-2 enters human host lung cells via its spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a process critical dependent on host protease-mediated fusion event. Thus, effective targeted therapies blocking the first step of viral fusion and cellular entry remains a critical unmet medical need to overcome disease pathology. Here we engineered and describe an antibody-based novel and targeted plug-and-play strategy, which directly competes with the proteolytic activation function of SAR-CoV-2 spike protein. The described strategy involves the engineering of furin substrate residues in IgG1 Fc-extended flexible region of spike targeting antibody. Our results with spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeting CR3022 antibody support blockade of the viral function using proof of concept ACE2 overexpressing cells.

Follow up serology was performed on a subset of the cohort as well as close contacts of individuals. 1,312 individuals were enrolled in the study. Contact with a wide range of wildlife species was reported in both occupational and occasional contexts. The overall proportion of individuals seropositive to any of the tested wildlife pathogens was approximately 4.0%. However, persons employed as butchers demonstrated a seropositivity of 9.0% to at least one pathogen of interest. By contrast, individuals working as hunters had lower rates of seropositivity. Among the study population, a number of other behaviors showed correlation with seropositivity, including contact with particular wildlife species such as field rats. These results demonstrate the need to further explore zoonotic risks of particular activities regarding wildlife contact, and to better understand risks of persons working as butchers with wildlife species.","Monagin, Corina; Paccha, Blanca; Liang, Ning; Trufan, Sally; Zhou, Huiqiong; Wu, De; Schneider, Bradley S.; Chmura, Aleksei; Epstein, Jonathan; Daszak, Peter; Ke, Changwen; Rabinowitz, Peter M.",PLoS One,592,16

To ensure physical distancing in light of COVID-19, the federal government loosened regulations to allow for additional flexibility. As OTP providers in the Bronx, NY, caring for more than 3600 patients in the epicenter of both the overdose and COVID-19 pandemics, we describe how our clinical practice changed with COVID-19. We halted toxicology testing, and to promote physical distancing and prevent interruptions in access to treatment for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), we drastically increased unsupervised take-home doses of MOUD. Within two weeks, we reduced the proportion of patients with 5–6 OTP visits per week from 47.2% to 9.4%. To guide treatment decision-making, we shifted focus from toxicology tests to other patient-centered measures, such as engagement in care and patient goals. In the initial three months, our patients experienced six nonfatal overdoses, no fatal overdoses, and 20 deaths attributable to COVID-19. This experience provides an opportunity to re-imagine care in OTPs going forward. We advocate that OTPs rely less on toxicology testing and more on the other patient-centered measures to guide decisions about distribution of take-home doses of MOUD. To minimize financial risk to OTPs and facilitate their transition to a more flexible model of care, we advocate for the reassessment of OTP reimbursement models.","Joseph, Giliane; Torres-Lockhart, Kristine; Stein, Melissa R.; Mund, Pamela A.; Nahvi, Shadi",J Subst Abuse Treat,592,6

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.","Chen, Biqing; Liang, Hao; Yuan, Xiaomin; Hu, Yingying; Xu, Miao; Zhao, Yating; Zhang, Binfen; Tian, Fang; Zhu, Xuejun",,592,16

On 16 March 2020, the government announced measures that could be taken by the public to reduce the spread of the virus. On the 18 March 2020 schools across the UK were closed and by 23rd March 2020, the UK entered its first mandatory lockdown. During this time, UK equestrians had to balance meeting their horse’s welfare needs with government advice and guidance. A survey was distributed to equine owners at the end of March 2020 via social media to try to understand their equine-related decision-making at this time. Data from 452 respondents indicated differences between the types of changes made following the government announcements on 16 March and 18 March. Early changes were focused on implementing biosecurity measures at equine establishments and opting to stop riding the horse, while those after 18 March were largely aimed at reducing the risk associated with various equine-related activities. The findings suggest that few equestrians had emergency plans in place should they be unable to care for their horses, donkeys or mules, and also raise questions about risk perception. ABSTRACT: In the UK, March 2020 was a time of great uncertainty as COVID-19 became increasingly widespread. The government responded by making suggestions about how people could reduce the risk of spread on 16 March, moved swiftly into closing schools on the 18 March before announcing a mandatory lockdown on the 23rd March. This was a challenging time for UK equestrians who had to balance maintaining their equine’s routine and daily care alongside the increasing biosecurity measures. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to UK equestrians via social media over two days (28 and 29 March 2020) to better understand the decisions made by UK horse, pony and donkey owners during this time. Data from 452 respondents were generated across all four countries comprising the UK, although there were no significant differences in owner response to the pandemic between locations. The changes respondents made differed between the 16th and the 18th of March 2020, with an early emphasis on improving yard biosecurity and opting to stop riding, as well as reducing the time spent at the yard. After the 18 March, respondents placed more emphasis on risk reduction by changing the activities they did with their horse, including riding, with common examples including avoiding “high risk” activities such as riding on busy roads, jumping, riding young or nervous horses. Few respondents reported having an emergency plan in place should they become ill or otherwise unable to care for their equine. The findings highlight areas that would significantly benefit from in-depth investigation in future research. Equestrian behaviour and mindset around risk-taking and risk perception have already been researched in relation to equestrian activities and sport but have received little attention in the context of wider health challenges. Understanding the uptake of emergency planning and preparation in the UK equestrian community also warrants consideration. Using this information effectively to promote forward planning is likely to be of great benefit in equestrian responses to future health or climate-related crises.","Hockenhull, Jo; Bell, Catherine; White, Jo; Rogers, Suzanne",Animals (Basel),592,1

Case Report: We present two cases of patients with COVID-19 that presented with STEMI on ECG. While both patients underwent cardiac catheterization, a delay in time to intervention in the patient found to have acute coronary artery occlusion may have contributed to a poor outcome.

Dans le traitement du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS) liés à severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), l’évaluation de l’efficacité des anti-VIH était essentiellement motivée par l’absence d’alternatives thérapeutiques devant un virus émergent, dans un contexte épidémique inquiétant.

Nonetheless, the agents that induce these phenomena are most often specific for a given virus or virus family. Drugs developed for HIV treatment were reevaluated for use against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during and after the epidemic in 2003, in view of the absence of any other available treatment. Of the protease and entry inhibitors approved for treating HIV-infected patients, none was effective against SARS-CoV, although in vitro activity against this virus was reported for the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir, in results that have not been confirmed in the most recent studies. The epidemiologic methods used to assess this drug's efficacy are not robust.

These single-stranded RNA molecules are widely expressed across diverse phyla and many of them are stable and evolutionary conserved between species. Growing evidence suggests that many circRNAs function as master regulators of gene expression by influencing both transcription and translation processes. Mechanistically, circRNAs are predicted to act as endogenous microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interact with functional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and associate with elements of the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus. Evidence is mounting that dysregulation of circRNAs is closely related to the occurrence of a range of diseases including cancer and metabolic diseases. Indeed, there are several reports implicating circRNAs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. However, there is very little research addressing the potential role of these RNA transcripts in the occurrence and development of obesity. Emerging data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that circRNAs are novel players in adipogenesis, white adipose browning, obesity, obesity-induced inflammation, and insulin resistance. This study explores the current state of knowledge on circRNAs regulating molecular processes associated with adipogenesis and obesity, highlights some of the challenges encountered while studying circRNAs and suggests some perspectives for future research directions in this exciting field of study.","Zaiou, Mohamed",Cells,592,19

Several vaccine formulations are nowadays available and helping to reach immunity. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest towards the development of novel anti-covid drugs. In this scenario, the main protease (Mpro) represents an appealing target, being the enzyme responsible for the cleavage of polypeptides during the viral genome transcription. With the aim of sharing new insights for the design of novel Mpro inhibitors, our research group developed a machine learning approach using the support vector machine (SVM) classification. Starting from a dataset of two million commercially available compounds, the model was able to classify two hundred novel chemo-types as potentially active against the viral protease. The compounds labelled as actives by SVM were next evaluated through consensus docking studies on two PDB structures and their binding mode was compared to well-known protease inhibitors. The best five compounds selected by consensus docking were then submitted to molecular dynamics to deepen binding interactions stability. Of note, the compounds selected via SVM retrieved all the most important interactions known in the literature.","Mekni, Nedra; Coronnello, Claudia; Langer, Thierry; Rosa, Maria De; Perricone, Ugo",Int J Mol Sci,592,20

Current standard care for DPN is limited and lacking. This study explores the benefits of 4-week, in-home wearable focal muscle vibration (FMV) therapy on pain, balance, mobility, and sensation in people with DPN. Participants were randomized into three groups and received different FMV intensities. FMV was applied using a modified Myovolt(TM) wearable device to the tibialis anterior, distal quadriceps, and gastrocnemius/soleus muscles on both lower limbs for three days a week over four weeks. The outcomes included pain, balance, mobility, sensation, device usage log, feedback survey, and a semi-structured interview. In all, 23 participants completed the study. The results showed significant improvement in average pain (Pre: 4.00 ± 2.29; Post: 3.18 ± 2.26; p = 0.007), pain interference with walking ability (Pre: 4.14 ± 3.20; Post: 3.09 ± 1.976; p = 0.03), and standard and cognitive Timed Up-and-Go scores (Pre: 13.75 ± 5.34; Post: 12.65 ± 5.25; p = 0.04; Pre: 15.12 ± 6.60; Post: 12.71 ± 5.57; p = 0.003, respectively); the overall pain improvement was trending towards significance (Pre: 3.48 ± 2.56; Post: 2.87 ± 1.85; p = 0.051). Balance and sensations improved but not significantly. There was a trend towards significance (p = 0.088), correlation (r = 0.382) between changes in balance and baseline pain. The participants were highly satisfied with wearable FMV and were 100% compliant. FMV therapy was associated with improved pain, mobility, and sensation.

To develop an antigen that is specific, sensitive, and easy to prepare for serological diagnosis, antigenic sites in the SADS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein were screened. We generated and characterized an N-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3E9 from mice immunized with recombinant N protein. Through fine epitope mapping of mAb 3E9 using a panel of eukaryotic-expressed polypeptides with GFP-tags, we identified the motif (343)DAPVFTPAP(351) as the minimal unit of the linear B-cell epitope recognized by mAb 3E9. Protein sequence alignment indicated that (343)DAPVFTPAP(351) was highly conserved in different SADS-CoV strains and SADS-related coronaviruses from bat, with one substitution in this motif in HKU2-related bat coronavirus. Using mAb 3E9, we observed that N protein was expressed in the cytoplasm and was in the nucleolus during SADS-CoV replication. N protein was immunoprecipitated from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Taken together, our results indicated that 3E9 mAb could be a useful tool to investigate the structure and function of N protein during viral replication.","Han, Yuru; Zhang, Jiyu; Shi, Hongyan; Zhou, Ling; Chen, Jianfei; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Jianbo; Zhang, Jialin; Wang, Xiaobo; Ji, Zhaoyang; Jing, Zhaoyang; Cong, Guangyi; Ma, Jingyun; Shi, Da; Li, Feng",Virus Res,592,13

The outbreak has a significant threat to international health and economy. At present, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for the disease, while efforts are underway. Remdesivir, a nucleotide-analogue antiviral drug developed for Ebola, is determined to prevent and stop infections with COVID-19, while results are yet controversial. Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo.

Pallotto et al., Gubitosa et al., and Touafchia et al. all reported the association of Remdesivir with increased risk of bradycardia in small samples of patients treated with RDV for COVID-19. To our knowledge, no large studies looked at this side effect of RDV therapy. We aimed to analyze the association between sinus bradycardia and Remdesivir therapy for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis was done for 1535 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted to four teaching hospitals in an urban area in 2020. The mean age was 66 years (SD of 16.7, range 18-99), with 774 males (50.4%). Patients were divided into cases (treated with RDV) and controls (not treated with RDV). Multivariate logistic regression methods were used to analyze the associations between independent variables and outcomes. Pulse rate variables were recorded as pulse rate at day-0, day-3, day-7, and incidence of bradycardia on three consecutive days during admission. Other variables recorded were age, gender, comorbidities, prior history of cardiac disease/arrhythmias, concomitant medications (including AV nodal blockers, dexamethasone, Albuterol, and Lasix), and ICU admission. Survival analysis was run for 7-day and 30-day mortality, as well as survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: 1415 patients were included in the final analysis, after the exclusion of 120 patients with previous heart blocks. 600 patients (39.1%) were in the Remdesivir group, and 935 patients (60.9%) were in the control group. Between both groups, a total of 454 patients (29.6%) had transient bradycardia on three consecutive days during hospitalization. A multivariate regression analysis was done after adjusting for all confounding variables (age, gender, history of cardiac diseases, AV-nodal blocking drugs, dexamethasone, furosemide, and albuterol therapy). It was seen that there was no statistically significant association between RDV therapy and persistent transient bradycardia (transient bradycardic events on three consecutive days) (Odds Ratio 0.823, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.594-1.134, p=0.236). There was no statistically significant association of RDV therapy with patients having any bradycardia event during hospitalization in a sub-analysis (Odds Ratio 0.888, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.665-1.184, p=0.419). Also, RDV failed to show any statistically significant mortality benefit (OR 1.1, CI 0.75-1.62, p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that although transient sinus bradycardia in patients with COVID-19, can be triggered by severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage to AV-nodal cells, or exaggerated response to medications, there was no statistically significant association of RDV therapy with the risk of developing bradycardia. RDV therapy should not be withheld in patients at risk of developing bradycardia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Remdesivir therapy did not increase the risk of developing bradycardia in our patient population. RDV therapy should not be withheld in patients at risk of developing bradycardia. Larger RCTs are needed to validate these findings.

So far, autonomic dysfunction (AD) has not been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. AIM: Assessment of AD in the early phase of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 116 PCR positive COVID-19 patients. After the exclusion of 41 patients with associate diseases (CADG), partitioned to patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and syncope, the remaining patients were included into a severe group (45 patients with confirmed interstitial pneumonia) and mild group (30 patients). Basic cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART) were performed, followed by beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability (BPV) analysis, along with baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS). Non-linear analysis of HRV was provided by Poincare Plot. Results were compared to 77 sex and age-matched controls. RESULTS: AD (sympathetic, parasympathetic, or both) in our study has been revealed in 51.5% of severe, 78.0% of mild COVID-19 patients, and the difference compared to healthy controls was significant (p = 0.018). Orthostatic hypotension has been established in 33.0% COVID-19 patients compared to 2.6% controls (p = 0.001). Most of the spectral parameters of HRV and BPV confirmed AD, most prominent in the severe COVID-19 group. BRS was significantly lower in all patients (severe, mild, CADG), indicating significant sudden cardiac death risk.

It is critical that vaccines and therapeutics be developed very rapidly. Mice, the ideal animal for assessing such interventions, are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we overcome this difficulty by exogenous delivery of human ACE2 with a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hACE2). Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice developed pneumonia characterized by weight loss, severe pulmonary pathology, and high-titer virus replication in lungs. Type I interferon, T cells and, most importantly, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) are critical for virus clearance and disease resolution in these mice. Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice enabled rapid assessments of a vaccine candidate, of human convalescent plasma, and of two antiviral therapies (poly I:C and remdesivir).

We have carried out detailed in silico Virtual high-throughput screening using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs from the Zinc database, COVID-19 clinical trial compounds from Pubchem database, Natural compounds from Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database and Maybridge database against PL(PRO) and 3CL(PRO) proteases. After thoroughly analyzing the screening results, we found five compounds, Bemcentinib, Pacritinib, Ergotamine, MFCD00832476, and MFCD02180753 inhibit PL(PRO) and six compounds, Bemcentinib, Clofazimine, Abivertinib, Dasabuvir, MFCD00832476, Leuconicine F inhibit the 3CL(PRO). These compounds are stable within the protease proteins’ active sites at 20ns MD simulation. The stability is revealed by hydrogen bond formations, hydrophobic interactions, and salt bridge interactions.

DESIGN: Observational monocentric study. SETTING: A post-ICU follow-up clinic in a tertiary university hospital in Liège, Belgium. PATIENTS: Patients surviving an ICU stay greater than or equal to 7 days for a severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and attending our post-ICU follow-up clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables provided by a cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer were collected at rest, at peak exercise, and during recovery. Fourteen patients (10 males, 59 yr [52–62 yr], all obese with body mass index > 27 kg/m(2)) were included after a hospital stay of 40 days (35–53 d). At rest, respiratory quotient was abnormally high at both 3 and 6 months (0.9 [0.83–0.96] and 0.94 [0.86–0.97], respectively). Oxygen uptake was also abnormally increased at 3 months (8.24 mL/min/kg [5.38–10.54 mL/min/kg]) but significantly decreased at 6 months (p = 0.013). At 3 months, at the maximum workload (67% [55–89%] of predicted workload), oxygen uptake peaked at 81% (64–104%) of predicted maximum oxygen uptake, with oxygen pulse and heart rate reaching respectively 110% (76–140%) and 71% (64–81%) of predicted maximum values. Ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide remains within normal ranges. The 50% decrease in oxygen uptake after maximum effort was delayed, at 130 seconds (115–142 s). Recovery was incomplete with a persistent anaerobic metabolism. At 6 months, no significant improvement was observed, excepting an increase in heart rate reaching 79% (72–95%) (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged reduced exercise capacity was observed up to 6 months in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 survivors. This disability did not result from residual pulmonary or cardiac dysfunction but rather from a metabolic disorder characterized by a sustained hypermetabolism and an impaired oxygen utilization.","Joris, Maurice; Minguet, Pauline; Colson, Camille; Joris, Jean; Fadeur, Marjorie; Minguet, Gregory; Guiot, Julien; Misset, Benoit; Rousseau, Anne-Françoise",Crit Care Explor,592,1

METHODS: Between mid-June to mid-July 2020, educational institutions from 12 countries were invited to participate in an online survey designed to gain student radiographer opinion from a wide geographical spread and countries with varying levels of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 1277 respondents participated, of these 592 had completed clinical placements during January to June 2020. Accommodation and cohabiting risks were identified as challenging, as was isolation from family, travel to clinical placements, and to a lesser extent childcare. Students stated they had been affected by the feeling of isolation and concerns about the virus whilst on placement. Overall 35.4% of all respondents were ‘Not at all worried’ about being a radiographer, however, 64.6% expressed varying levels of concern and individual domestic or health situations significantly impacted responses (p ≤ 0.05). Year 4 students and recent graduates were significantly more likely to be ‘Not worried at all’ compared to Year 2 and 3 students (p ≤ 0.05). The need for improved communication regarding clinical placements scheduling was identified as almost 50% of students on clinical placements between January to June 2020 identified the completion of assessments as challenging. Furthermore, only 66% of respondents with COVID-19 imaging experience stated being confident with personal protective equipment (PPE) use. CONCLUSION: Student radiographers identified key challenges which require consideration to ensure appropriate measures are in place to support their ongoing needs. Importantly PPE training is required before placement regardless of prior COVID-19 imaging experience.

The effect of cholesterol-lowering diets on inflammatory biomarkers is less well known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a dietary combination (portfolio) of cholesterol-lowering foods vs a statin in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker of inflammation linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In all, 34 hyperlipidemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very low-saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin (statin); and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy protein (21.4 g/1000 kcal), viscous fibers (9.8 g/1000 kcal), and almonds (14 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio). Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0, 2, and 4. RESULTS: Using the complete data, no treatment reduced serum CRP. However, when subjects with CRP levels above the 75th percentile for previously reported studies (>3.5 mg/l) were excluded, CRP was reduced similarly on both statin, −16.3±6.7% (n=23, P=0.013) and dietary portfolio, −23.8±6.9% (n=25, P=0.001) but not the control, 15.3±13.6% (n=28, P=0.907). The percentage CRP change from baseline on the portfolio treatment (n=25) was greater than the control (n=28, P=0.004) but similar to statin treatment (n=23, P=0.349). Both statin and portfolio treatments were similar in reducing CRP and numerically more effective than control but only the change in portfolio was significant after the Bonferroni adjustment.

Mpro is activated by autoproteolysis and is the main protease responsible for cutting the viral polyprotein into functional units. Aside from this, it is described that Mpro proteases are also capable of processing host proteins, including those involved in the host innate immune response.

There has been debate on whether to use such systems in reopening elective orthopaedic surgery during the current COVID-19 pandemic environment. METHODS: Thirty-five participants were enrolled in a double-blinded randomised controlled study investigating efficacy of the Stryker Flyte Surgical Helmet (Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) as protection against respiratory droplets. Wearing the SSHS in a fit testing hood, subjects were randomised to nebulised saccharin solution or placebo. Twenty were allocated to the saccharin group with 15 to placebo. Positive sweet taste represented a failure of the test. Taste tests were performed with the helmet fan turned on and off. RESULTS: SSHS did not prevent saccharin taste (p < 0.0001). Within the saccharin cohort, 40% recorded a positive taste with the fan on and 100% with the fan off. There was a statistically significant difference in mean time-to-taste saccharin (p = 0.049) comparing fan on (123.5 s) vs. off (62.6 s). CONCLUSIONS: SSHS do not protect against aerosol particulate and therefore are not efficacious in protection against COVID-19. The fan system employed may even increase risk to the surgeon by drawing in particulates as well as delay recognition of intraoperative cues, such as exhaust from diathermy, that point to respirator mask leak.","Schaller, Gavin; Nayar, Sandeep Krishan; Erotocritou, Marios; Overton, Alexander; Stelzhammer, Thomas; Berber, Onur",Int Orthop,592,5

With mandated social distancing in a controlled laboratory environment, many researchers are searching for alternative options to conduct research, such as online experimentation. However, online experimentation comes at a cost; learning online tools for building and publishing psychophysics experiments can be complicated and time-consuming. This learning cost is unfortunate because researchers typically only need to use a small percentage of these tools’ capabilities, but they still have to deal with these systems’ complexities (e.g., complex graphical user interfaces or difficult programming languages). Furthermore, after the experiment is built, researchers often have to find an online platform compatible with the tool they used to program the experiment. To simplify and streamline the online process of programming and hosting an experiment, I have created SimplePhy. SimplePhy can save researchers’ time and energy by allowing them to create a study in just a few clicks. All researchers have to do is select among a few experiment settings and upload the stimuli. SimplePhy is able to run most psychophysical perception experiments that require mouse clicks and button presses. In addition to collecting online behavioral data, SimplePhy can also collect information regarding the estimated viewing distance between the participant and the monitor, the screen size, and the experimental trial’s timing—features not always offered in other online platforms.

Thus far there are no proven therapeutic options to treat COVID-19. We report a case of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome who was treated with high-dose vitamin C infusion and was the first case to have early recovery from the disease at our institute. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old woman with no recent sick contacts or travel history presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs were normal except for oxygen saturation of 87% and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Chest radiography revealed air space opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 came back positive while the patient was in the airborne-isolation unit. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6. The patient was initially started on oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 6, she developed ARDS and septic shock, for which mechanical ventilation and pressor support were started, along with infusion of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. The patient improved clinically and was able to be taken off mechanical ventilation within 5 days.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among confirmed COVID -19 patients with available CT images between February 8, 2020 and March 7, 2020. The lung was divided into six zones by the level of tracheal carina and the level of inferior pulmonary vein bilaterally on CT. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and overall lung involvement were rated by Likert scale of 0–4 or binary as 0 or 1. Global severity score for each targeted pattern was calculated as total score of six zones. RESULTS: There were 53 patients and 137 CT scans included in the study. There were 18(34%) of the patients classified as moderate cases while 35(66%) patients were severe/critical cases. Severe/critical patients had higher CT scores in several types of abnormalities than moderate patients from the second week to the fourth week post symptom onset. Overall lung involvement score in the second week demonstrated predictive value for severity with a sensitivity of 81.0% and specificity of 69.2%.

Classified as a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, ISAV is characterized by the presence of two surface glycoproteins termed hemagglutinin esterase (HE) and fusion protein (F), both of them directly involved in the initial interaction of the virus with the target cell. HE mediates receptor binding and destruction, while F promotes the fusion process of the viral and cell membranes. The carboxy-terminal end of F (F(2)) possesses canonical structural characteristics of a type I fusion protein, while no functional properties have been proposed for the amino-terminal (F(1)) region. In this report, based on in silico modeling, we propose a tertiary structure for the F(1) region, which resembles a sialic acid binding domain. Furthermore, using recombinant forms of both HE and F proteins and an in vitro model system, we demonstrate the interaction of F with a cell receptor, the hydrolysis of this receptor by the HE esterase, and a crucial role for F(1) in the fusion mechanism. Our interpretation is that binding of F to its cell receptor is fundamental for membrane fusion and that the esterase in HE modulates this interaction.","Ojeda, Nicolás; Cárdenas, Constanza; Marshall, Sergio",Pathogens,592,1

In the current study, the neuroprotective effects of MC and its underlying mechanisms were investigated in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22); moreover, in silico analysis was performed with the phytochemicals MC to decipher their potential function as neuroprotectants. MC was demonstrated to possess neuroprotective effect by reducing reactive oxygen species’ (ROS’) production and down-regulating cyclin D1, p53, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein expressions, resulting in the inhibition of cell apoptosis and the normalization of cell cycle progression. Additionally, 28 phytochemicals of MC and their competence on inhibiting cytochrome P450 (CYP: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1) functions were resolved. In silico analysis of vitamin E and stigmasterol revealed that their binding to either CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 was more efficient than the binding of each positive control (alizarin or purpurin).

It is well known that the electricity consumption is a direct reflection of human activity. During the lockdown of Wuhan, most of human activities were forbidden. The reduction in human activity would inevitably lead to a reduction in electricity consumption. At the same time, anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants would also be reduced with the reduction of human activity. In this study, the correlation between electricity consumption and air pollutants during lockdown was discussed in detail. The result showed that the drop in pollutants concentrations in January should be attributed to the washout effect of rainfall rather than the lockdown. The decrease of electricity consumption in the secondary industry might play a significant role on the decrease of PM [Formula: see text] and NO(2) concentrations in Wuhan in February 2020. The decrease in NO(2) concentration in March should be attributed to the reduction of pollutants emissions from the tertiary industry, which means that more attention should be paid to the control of NO(2) emission in the tertiary industry. Due to reduced emissions from local sources, the role of long-range transport sources might be more significant during the lockdown of Wuhan. By PSCF analysis, southeast of Wuhan could be the major potential emission sources of PM [Formula: see text] , especially in the northern part of Jiangxi province. It was suggested that stricter regulation of pollutants emissions should be implemented in this area.","Xu, Xianmang; Zhang, Wen; Yin, Yanchao; Dong, Yuezhen; Yang, Deliang; Lv, Jialiang; Yuan, Wenpeng",Environ Technol Innov,592,16

This article is intended to fill a current research gap in this context by examining how aware and prepared affected workers are for the challenges predicted by research. This information is crucial since expectation and preparation of the workforce will significantly influence society’s adaptability to the future. As a result of the article various significant relationships among workers’ characteristics and their attitude towards automation could be identified. The interviewed workers’ level of fear appears to have very little influence on preparation for automation-driven changes in the future while perceived opportunity significantly impacts this degree of preparation. Characteristics that additionally most influence the degree of preparatory steps taken by respondents are their level of education as well as work complexity and position. These findings should be used to identify potential ways for relevant stakeholders to adequately prepare for and meet the challenges of the impending increase of automation in the workplace.","Rodriguez-Bustelo, Carolina; Batista-Foguet, Joan Manuel; Serlavós, Ricard",Front Psychol,592,26

Tandem microscopic review (also known as “double-scoping”) of pathology slides is a traditional cornerstone of pathology education. However, this requires the use of a double- or multi-headed optical light microscope which is unfortunately not amenable to physical distancing. The loss of double-scoping has forced educational innovation in order to continue teaching microscopy. Digital pathology options such as whole slide imaging could be considered; however, financial constraints felt by many departments often render this option cost-prohibitive. Alternatively, a shift toward teaching via dynamic virtual microscopy offers a readily available, physically distanced, and cost-conscious alternative for pathology education. Required elements include a standard light microscope, a mounted digital camera, computers, and videoconferencing software to share a slide image with the learner(s). Through survey data, we show immediate benefits include maintaining the essence of the traditional light microscope teaching experience, and additional gains were discovered such as the ability for educators and learners to annotate images in real time, among others. Existing technology may not be initially optimized for a dynamic virtual experience, resulting in lag time with image movement, problems focusing, image quality issues, and a narrower field of view; however, these technological barriers can be overcome through hardware and software optimization. Herein, we share the experience of establishing a dynamic virtual microscopy educational system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing readily available technology in the pathology department of a major academic medical center.","Christian, Robert J.; VanSandt, Mandy",Acad Pathol,592,8

The development of quantitative approaches to advance comprehension of the current outbreak is urgently needed to tackle this severe disease. In this work, several mathematical models are proposed to represent COVID-19 dynamics in infected patients. Considering different starting times of infection, parameters sets that represent infectivity of COVID-19 are computed and compared with other viral infections that can also cause pandemics. Based on the target cell model, COVID-19 infecting time between susceptible cells (mean of 30 days approximately) is much slower than those reported for Ebola (about 3 times slower) and influenza (60 times slower). The within-host reproductive number for COVID-19 is consistent to the values of influenza infection (1.7-5.35). The best model to fit the data was including immune responses, which suggest a slow cell response peaking between 5 to 10 days post onset of symptoms. The model with eclipse phase, time in a latent phase before becoming productively infected cells, was not supported. Interestingly, both, the target cell model and the model with immune responses, predict that virus may replicate very slowly in the first days after infection, and it could be below detection levels during the first 4 days post infection. A quantitative comprehension of COVID-19 dynamics and the estimation of standard parameters of viral infections is the key contribution of this pioneering work.","Hernandez Vargas, Esteban Abelardo; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.",,592,0

The diagnosis of EDSV has been done by molecular tools since its complete genome sequence was identified. In order to enhance the capabilities of the real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) assay, we aimed to apply the method for direct detection of the EDSV without viral DNA extraction. In order to detect the presence of the EDSV DNA, three pairs of primers were designed, from the conserved region of fiber gene of the EDSV. RESULTS: For our assay, test and control samples were directly used in the reaction mixture in 10-fold serial dilution. The target DNA was amplified at 65 °C, which yield positive results in a relatively short period of 40–45 min. The method reported in this study is highly sensitive as compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and showed no sign of cross-reactivity or false positive results. The RealAmp accomplished specific identification of EDSV among a variety of poultry disease viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The direct RealAmp can be used to detect the presence of EDSV. As our result showed, the RealAmp method could be suitable for the direct detection of other DNA viruses.","Zheney, Makay; Kaziyev, Zhambul; Kassenova, Gulmira; Zhao, Lingna; Liu, Wei; Liang, Lin; Li, Gang",BMC Vet Res,592,20

The objective of our study is to understand the current status of hospitals preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks in Beijing and to provide basic information for infectious disease prevention and control in hospitals. METHODS: One hundred fifty-two secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Beijing were surveyed by a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic information and their emergency plans, laboratory diagnosis capacity, medical treatment procedures for infectious diseases, stockpiles of drugs and personal protective equipment, and staff training were collected. RESULTS: Responses were received from 134 (88.2%) of the 152 hospitals surveyed. Overall, hospitals reported that the number of physicians and nurses in infectious disease accounted for only 1.8% of the total physicians and 2.5% of the total nurses, and surgery beds accounted for 8.5% of all the fixed beds. Approximately 93.3% of the hospitals surveyed reported that they had an emergency plan, and none of those reported that their laboratories were able to isolate and identify all 8 kinds of common pathogens of infectious diseases: 22.4% of the hospitals had medical treatment procedures for all these infectious diseases, 23.1% had stored specific drugs for treatment, 2.2% had all personal protective equipment, and 30.6% reported that their health care staff had been trained in hospital emergency preparedness for infectious diseases. In general, emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in tertiary care hospitals was better than that in secondary care hospitals; the preparedness at general hospitals was better than that at specialized hospitals; and that at teaching hospitals was better than that at nonteaching hospitals. CONCLUSION: Emergency preparedness for infectious disease at hospitals in Beijing was in an early stage of development during this survey. Comprehensive measures should be developed and implemented to enhance their capacity for infectious disease emergency.","Hui, Zhang; Jian-Shi, Huang; Xiong, He; Peng, Lv; Da-Long, Qiu",Am J Infect Control,592,14

There is emerging evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has number of other presenting features which might not be related to the severity of the respiratory disease. We have previously described a case of hypoactive delirium as the first manifestation of COVID-19 without profound lung disease. Here we present five cases of elderly patients, without a prior history of dementia and had no overt COVID-19-related pneumonia, who presented with the acute onset of delirium as the primary manifestation of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study performed a health informatics search to produce a list of patients who were admitted with acute confusion and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus between March 1 and June 30, 2020. The electronic medical admission notes were screened for all patients with confusion who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with a history of dementia and a high risk of delirium were excluded, such as severe COVID-19-related pneumonia or any other infection, malignancy, drugs, or severe illness of any kind. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic our hospital experienced just over 3,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and 45 of them had documented confusion upon admission. Secondary causes for their acute confusion were excluded. Five patients were identified as having delirium as the initial presentation of COVID-19-related illness without significant COVID-19-related pneumonitis. None of them had overt chest symptoms or a previous history of confusion, and the 3 patients who underwent head CT scans had normal findings. CONCLUSIONS: This case series illustrates the importance of recognizing acute confusion as the first manifestation of COVID-19 in susceptible individuals.","Butt, Isabel; Ochoa-Ferraro, Antonio; Dawson, Charlotte; Madathil, Shyam; Gautam, Nandan; Sawlani, Vijay; Geberhiwot, Tarekegn",J Clin Neurol,592,0

The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n = 5520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with the public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing, for balance, a format which conveys a contrasting (higher) perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10 000); using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative ‘persona’ who might face that highest level of risk; and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other ‘personas’ illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These ‘personas’ should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful. We note that observed effect sizes generally were small.

The current study investigated whether this change in treatment format was maintained after one year of the COVID-19 pandemic. From 16 February until 2 April 2021, a total of 238 Austrian psychotherapists completed an online survey. They were asked about the number of patients currently treated in-person, via telephone and via the internet. Psychotherapists rated three different aspects of psychotherapy (ability to actively listen to patients, ability to understand what is going on in the patients and ability to support patients emotionally) for three different formats (in-person with facemasks, telephone and internet) separately. The results show that, after one year of the pandemic, the majority (78.4%) of patients were treated in-person (compared to 21.7% during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic; p < 0.001). This change in the treatment format was accompanied by a strong increase in the total number of patients treated by 77.2% on average (p < 0.001). Psychotherapists reported no differences between in-person psychotherapy with facemasks and psychotherapy via the internet with regard to the three investigated aspects of psychotherapy, while the surveyed aspects were rated less favorably for psychotherapy conducted via telephonic communication (p < 0.05).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The temporal and spatial profile of the COVID-19 spread is highly dynamic and is progressively changing at a rapid pace. This article is an attempt to mitigate the pandemic threat by sharing the review outcome from an extensive literature survey on recent articles on COVID-19 and its impact.

In the first series of compounds, PQ and various CADs were connected by amide bonds and in the second series by acylsemicarbazide functional groups built from the PQ amino group, CONHNH spacer and the carbonyl group originating from the CADs. PQ-CAD amides 3a–k were prepared by a simple one-step condensation reaction of PQ with a series of CAD chlorides (method A) or benzotriazolides 2 (method B). The synthesis of acylsemicarbazides 7a–k included activation of PQ with benzotriazole, preparation of PQ-semicarbazide 6 and its condensation with CAD chlorides 4. All synthesized PQ-CAD conjugates were evaluated for their anticancer, antiviral and antioxidative activities. Almost all compounds from series 3 were selective towards the MCF-7 cell line and active at micromolar concentrations. The o-fluoro derivative 3h showed high activity against HeLa, MCF-7 and in particular against the SW 620 cell line, while acylsemicarbazide 7f with a benzodioxole ring and 7c, 7g and especially 7j with methoxy-, chloro- or trifluoromethyl-substituents in the para position showed high selectivity and high inhibitory activity against MCF-7 cell line at micromolar (7c, 7f, 7g) and nanomolar (7j) levels. Acylsemicarbazide derivatives with trifluoromethyl group(s) 7i, 7j and 7k showed specific activity against human coronavirus (229E) at concentrations which did not alter the normal cell morphology.

This article addresses the IPC measures taken, such as enhancing isolation precautions, implementing screening protocols, disinfecting and reusing N95 respirators, by the center throughout the pandemic as well as the challenges that arouse with a new and emerging infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: The infection control measures implemented at our comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed our center to continue to provide world class cancer care with minimal COVID-19 infection transmission among patients and team members.","Carraway, Stephanie; Martin, Stacy; Greene, John N.",Cancer Control,592,22

A trained person can administer it, including women through self-injection. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness and safety of self-injection versus provider-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for improving continuation of contraceptive use. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials on November 1, 2020 in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Open Grey, clinical trials registries, and reference lists of relevant studies. We did not impose any search restrictions. We included randomized trials comparing self- versus provider-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Two authors independently screened trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We used risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 3 randomized trials (9 reports; 1264 participants). The risk of bias in the included studies was low except for performance bias and detection bias of participant-reported outcomes in unmasked trials. Self-administration, compared to provider-administration, increased continuation of contraceptive use (risk ratio 1.35; 95% confidence intervals 1.10–1.66); moderate-certainty evidence). Self-injection appears to be making more of an impact on continuation for younger women compared to women 25 years and older and on women living in low and middle income compared to high income countries. There was no subgroup difference by the type of care provider (community health worker vs. clinic-based provider). CONCLUSIONS: Self-injection of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate probably improves continuation of contraceptive use. The effects on other outcomes remain uncertain because of the very low certainty of evidence.

The model is also generalized to arbitrary time-dependent infection rates and solved explicitly when the control parameter depends on the accumulated infections at time t. Numerical results are presented by way of comparison. Autonomous and non-autonomous generalizations of SIR for interacting regions are also considered, including non-separability for two or more interacting regions. A reduction of simple SIR models to one variable leads us to a generalized logistic model, Richards model, which we use to fit Mexico’s COVID-19 data up to day number 134. Forecasting scenarios resulting from various fittings are discussed. A critique to the applicability of these models to current pandemic outbreaks in terms of robustness is provided. Finally, we obtain the bifurcation diagram for a discretized version of Richards model, displaying period doubling bifurcation to chaos.","Sadurní, E.; Luna-Acosta, G.",Nonlinear Dyn,592,24

Currently, there is no treatment for it, but the world is in a race that yielded, in a relatively short time than usual, several approved, promising vaccines in the middle of a storm of debates because of the speed of their production and approval. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the willingness of Middle Eastern Arab publics to receive COVID-19 vaccines and investigated the factors behind any reluctance to receive them. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed through social media applications in four Arab countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Iraq). Participants’ demographics, medical history, their experience with COVID-19, and their willingness to receive the available vaccines were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2,925 completed forms were included. Only 25% of the participants were willing to receive a vaccine while 33% were hesitant. Iraqis were the most willing to receive it while Jordanians were the least (35% and 17% of each country, respectively). Interestingly, 60% of the acceptors were ready to pay for the vaccine if not covered by governments. It was also found that American vaccines were preffered by 50% of the acceptors. However, 30% of acceptors were unsure of which vaccine is the best and 11% stated that any vaccine is good. Social media were the major source of information about COVID-19 and its vaccines. Finally, predictors of acceptance of the vaccines included living in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, being unmarried, having monthly income > $1,000, holding a medical degree, having high fear from COVID-19, feeling of being at risk of getting infected with COVID-19, and previous reception of influenza vaccine, whereas predictors of refusal included female sex and previous infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Middle Eastern Arabs are less likely to accept receiving the COVID-19 vaccines compared with non-Arabs. Health authorities in these countries are advised to intensify their awareness-raising activities about the vaccines while ensuring fair distribution of them.","Abu-Farha, Rana; Mukattash, Tareq; Itani, Rania; Karout, Samar; Khojah, Hani M.J.; Abed Al-Mahmood, Asia; Alzoubi, Karem H.",Saudi Pharm J,592,1

Although several PCR-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. There are limited reports of saliva as the sample source and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing RT-LAMP with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay to test saliva using a 2-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10-minute RT step is performed with only B3 and BIP primers before the final reaction. We show that while the 1-step RT-LAMP demonstrate satisfactory results, the optimized 2-step approach allows for single molecule sensitivity per reaction and performs significantly better than the 1-step RT-LAMP and conventional 2-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT Step. Importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from VTM and saliva clinical samples.","Ganguli, A.; Mostafa, A.; Berger, J.; Stewart de Ramirez, S.

Since hospitalization can have detrimental effects on older individuals, preference has been given to younger patients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of hospitalization for elderly affected by COVID-19. We hypothesized that their mortality decreases when there is greater access to hospitals. METHODS: This study examined 1902 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to three large hospitals in Milan, Italy. Overall mortality data for Milan from the same period was retrieved. Based on emergency department (ED) data, both peak and off-peak phases were identified. The percentage of elderly patients admitted to EDs during these two phases were compared by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the individuals younger than, versus older than, 80 years. RESULTS: The median age of the patients hospitalized during the peak phase was lower than the median age during the off-peak phase (64 vs. 75 years, respectively; p <0.001). However, while the SMR for the younger patients was lower during the off-peak phase (1.98, 95% CI: 1.72–2.29 versus 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25–1.58, respectively), the SMR was similar between both phases for the elderly patients (2.28, 95% CI: 2.07–2.52 versus 2.48, 95% CI: 2.32–2.65, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Greater access to hospitals during an off-peak phase did not affect the mortality rate of COVID-19-positive elderly patients in Milan. This finding, if confirmed in other settings, should influence future decisions regarding resource management of health care organizations.","Costantino, Giorgio; Solbiati, Monica; Elli, Silvia; Paganuzzi, Marco; Massabò, Didi; Montano, Nicola; Mancarella, Marta; Cortellaro, Francesca; Cataudella, Emanuela; Bellone, Andrea; Capsoni, Nicolò; Bertolini, Guido; Nattino, Giovanni; Casazza, Giovanni",PLoS One,592,29

This led to the identification of a sequence of 1,300 bases which contained a single open reading frame of 690 bases yielding a protein having properties of the matrix protein (M). It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of +8 at neutral pH. Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity.

In this study adherence to ART regimens among patients with HIV-1 (PWH) across the US during a recent time period was examined and study findings were stratified by US region and state. METHODS: A retrospective observational study using the Symphony Health Solution Integrated Dataverse database was conducted. Patients ≥ 18 years of age who had a diagnosis of HIV-1 (without an HIV-2 diagnosis) and who were treated with ART between July 2017 and September 2018 (first pharmacy record: index date) were selected from the data source. Both patients who had not been previously treated with ART and those who were treatment experienced were included. Patients were required to have ≥ 1 medical/pharmacy record ≥ 12 months after their index date (follow-up period). Patient characteristics were examined during a 12-month pre-index period. During the follow-up, medication adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC), was examined for all patients and stratified by US region and state. RESULTS: Among 206,474 adult PWH treated with ART, mean age was 47.9 years, 73.4% were male, and 30.0% were Caucasian. The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hyperlipidemia (25.1%), depressive disorders (14.8%), and type 2 diabetes (12.1%). During the follow-up period, mean (standard deviation) PDC was 74.1% (25.9%) among PWH across the US [Midwest: 74.4% (25.5%); Northeast: 74.3% (26.1%); South: 73.2% (26.3%); West: 76.4% (24.8%)]. Across all US regions, > 60% of PWH had adherence < 90% and > 40% had adherence < 80%; the West had the highest adherent population. CONCLUSIONS: Among PWH treated with ART across the US, a majority had suboptimal adherence. Implementation of strategies to improve ART adherence, including clinical consideration of ARTs with high genetic barriers to resistance, is needed in the US.

Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacy–numeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable. The closing section summarizes conclusions and research directions regarding the intersection of the three core domains. Overall, the paper points to emerging research needs and educational challenges that are relevant to scholars, practitioners, and policy makers interested in developing the numeracy of adults as well as in the mathematics education of younger learners.","Gal, Iddo; Grotlüschen, Anke; Tout, Dave; Kaiser, Gabriele",ZDM,592,30

Pathogenic and potentially pandemic betacoronaviruses arose in humans in 2002 (SARS-CoV, disappeared in July 2003), 2012 (MERS-CoV, still circulating in Middle East areas), and 2019 (SARS-CoV-2, causing the current global pandemic). As universally recognized, bats host ancestors of the above-mentioned zoonotic viruses. However, hedgehogs have been recently identified in Europe and Asia as possible reservoirs of MERS-CoV-like strains classified as Erinaceus coronavirus (EriCoV). To elucidate the evolution and genetics of EriCoVs, NGS (next generation sequencing) and Sanger sequencing were used to examine fecal samples collected in Northern Italy in 2018/2019 from 12 hedgehogs previously found EriCoV-positive by RT-PCR. By sequence analysis, eight complete EriCoV genomes, obtained by NGS, showed a high phylogenetic correlation with EriCoV strains previously reported in Eurasia. Interestingly, eight viral strains presented an additional ORF encoding for the CD200 ortholog located between the genes encoding for the Spike and the ORF3a proteins. The CD200 ortholog sequences were closely similar to the host CD200 protein but varying among EriCoVs. The result, confirmed by Sanger sequencing, demonstrates for the first time that CoVs can acquire host genes potentially involved in the immune-modulatory cascade and possibly enabling the virus to escape the host defence.","De Sabato, Luca; Di Bartolo, Ilaria; De Marco, Maria Alessandra; Moreno, Ana; Lelli, Davide; Cotti, Claudia; Delogu, Mauro; Vaccari, Gabriele",Viruses,592,1

The recycling of respirators is possible in case of critical shortage, but it raises the question of the effectiveness of decontamination as well as the performance of the reused respirators. METHOD: Disposable respirators were subjected to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) treatment at single or successive doses of 60 mJ/cm(2) after a short drying cycle (30 min, 70°C). The germicidal efficacy of this treatment was tested by spiking respirators with two staphylococcal bacteriophages (vB_HSa_2002 and P66 phages). The respirator performance was investigated by the following parameters: particle penetration (NaCl aerosol, 10–300 nm), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry and mechanical tensile tests. RESULTS: No viable phage particles were recovered from any of the respirators after decontamination (log reduction in virus titre >3), and no reduction in chemical or physical properties (SEM, particle penetrations <5%–6%) were observed. Increasing the UVGI dose 10-fold led to chemical alterations of the respirator filtration media (FTIR) but did not affect the physical properties (particle penetration), which was unaltered even at 3000 mJ/cm(2) (50 cycles). When respirators had been used by healthcare workers and undergone decontamination, they had particle penetration significantly greater than never donned respirators. CONCLUSION: This decontamination procedure is an attractive method for respirators in case of shortages during a SARS pandemic. A successful implementation requires a careful design and particle penetration performance control tests over the successive reuse cycles.","Vernez, David; Save, Jonathan; Oppliger, Anne; Concha-Lozano, Nicolas; Hopf, Nancy B; Niculita-Hirzel, Hélène; Resch, Grégory; Michaud, Véronique; Dorange-Pattoret, Laurie; Charrière, Nicole; Batsungnoen, Kiattisak; Suarez, Guillaume",BMJ Glob Health,592,24

Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzymes, and it may be difficult to distinguish the effect of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activities from actual hepatic damage. The hepatotoxicity of phenobarbital and the impact of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activity were investigated prospectively in 12 normal dogs. Phenobarbital was administered for 29 weeks at 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (range, 4.8— 6.6 mg/kg) PO q12h, resulting in therapeutic serum phenobarbital concentrations (20–40 μg/mL). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), γ‐glutamyltransferase (GGT), fasted bile acids (fBA), total bilirubin, and albumin were determined before and during treatment. Lateral abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasounds, and histopathologic examinations of liver tissue obtained by ultrasound‐guided biopsy were performed before and during treatment. Radiographs revealed a moderate increase in liver size in most dogs. Ultrasonographic examination revealed no change in liver echogenicity or architecture. No evidence of morphologic liver damage was observed histopathologically. ALP and ALT increased significantly (P < .05), GGT increased transiently, and albumin decreased transiently during the study. There were no significant changes in AST, bilirubin, and fBA. These results suggest that increases in serum ALP, ALT, and GGT may reflect enzyme induction rather than hepatic injury during phenobarbital treatment in dogs. Serum AST, fBA, and bilirubin, and ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver are not affected by the enzyme‐inducing effect of phenobarbital and can therefore be helpful to assess liver disease in dogs treated with the drug.","Müller, Peter B.; Taboada, Joseph; Hosgood, Giselle; Partington, Beth P.; VanSteenhouse, Jan L.; Taylor, H.

METHODS: Retrospective, multicentre, national cohort study conducted between February 24 and June 14, 2020, in 24 Italian Intensive Care Units (ICU) on adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Clinical data were collected on the day of ICU admission. Information regarding the use of prone position was collected daily. Follow-up for patient outcomes was performed on July 15, 2020. The respiratory effects of the first prone position were studied in a subset of 78 patients. Patients were classified as Oxygen Responders if the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased ≥ 20 mmHg during prone position and as Carbon Dioxide Responders if the ventilatory ratio was reduced during prone position. RESULTS: Of 1057 included patients, mild, moderate and severe ARDS was present in 15, 50 and 35% of patients, respectively, and had a resulting mortality of 25, 33 and 41%. Prone position was applied in 61% of the patients. Patients placed prone had a more severe disease and died significantly more (45% vs. 33%, p < 0.001). Overall, prone position induced a significant increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, while no change in respiratory system compliance or ventilatory ratio was observed. Seventy-eight % of the subset of 78 patients were Oxygen Responders. Non-Responders had a more severe respiratory failure and died more often in the ICU (65% vs. 38%, p = 0.047). Forty-seven % of patients were defined as Carbon Dioxide Responders. These patients were older and had more comorbidities; however, no difference in terms of ICU mortality was observed (51% vs. 37%, p = 0.189 for Carbon Dioxide Responders and Non-Responders, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, prone position has been widely adopted to treat mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure.

This paper considers effects on testing and positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 of re-opening Norwegian schools after a six-week closure to reduce contagion. We estimate the effect of school re-opening for teachers, parents and students using an event study/difference-in-differences design with comparison groups with minimal exposure to in-person schooling. We find no evidence that incidence increased following re-opening for either students, parents, or teachers pooled across grade levels. We find some suggestive evidence that infection rates among upper secondary school teachers increased; however, quantitatively, the effects are small and transitory. At low levels of contagion, schools can safely be re-opened when other social distancing policies remain in place.","Godoy, A. A.; Hart, R. K.; Groetting, M. W.",,592,26

Transparent and accessible reporting of COVID-19 data is critical for public health efforts. Each state and union territory (UT) of India has its own mechanism for reporting COVID-19 data, and the quality of their reporting has not been systematically evaluated. We present a comprehensive assessment of the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the Indian state and union territory governments. This assessment informs the public health efforts in India and serves as a guideline for pandemic data reporting by other governments. Methods. We designed a semi-quantitative framework to assess the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the states and union territories of India. This framework captures four key aspects of public health data reporting - availability, accessibility, granularity, and privacy. We then used this framework to calculate a COVID-19 Data Reporting Score (CDRS, ranging from 0 to 1) for 29 states based on the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state during the two-week period from 19 May to 1 June, 2020. States that reported less than 10 total confirmed cases as of May 18 were excluded from the study. Findings. Our results indicate a strong disparity in the quality of COVID-19 data reporting done by the state governments in India. CDRS varies from 0.61 (good) in Karnataka to 0.0 (poor) in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a median value of 0.26. Only ten states provide a visual representation of the trend in COVID-19 data. Ten states do not report any data stratified by age, gender, comorbidities or districts. In addition, we identify that Punjab and Chandigarh compromised the privacy of individuals under quarantine by releasing their personally identifiable information on the official websites. Across the states, the CDRS is positively associated with the state's sustainable development index for good health and well-being (Pearson correlation: r=0.630, p=0.0003). Interpretation. The disparity in CDRS across states highlights three important findings at the national, state, and individual level. At the national level, it shows the lack of a unified framework for reporting COVID-19 data in India, and highlights the need for a central agency to monitor or audit the quality of data reporting done by the states. Without a unified framework, it is difficult to aggregate the data from different states, gain insights from them, and coordinate an effective nationwide response to the pandemic. Moreover, it reflects the inadequacy in coordination or sharing of resources among the states in India. Coordination among states is particularly important as more people start moving across states in the coming months. The disparate reporting score also reflects inequality in individual access to public health information and privacy protection based on the state of residence. Funding.

The E6F6 epitope-based protein CR-T3-SEQ13 (HBsAg aa 113-135) vaccination therapy in cynomolgus monkeys induced long-term polyclonal antibodies-mediated clearance of HBsAg in the HBV transgenic (HBV-Tg) mice. METHODS: We isolated monoclonal antibodies from CR-T3-SEQ13 vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys, compared their therapeutic effects with E6F6, identified their epitopes on HBsAg, determined the pharmacokinetics and studied their physical property. RESULTS: A panel of anti-HBsAg mAbs was generated through memory B cell stimulatory culture. Two lead monkey-human chimeric antibodies, C1-23 and C3-23, effectively suppressed HBsAg and HBV DNA in HBV-Tg mice. The humanized antibodies and humanized-mouse reverse chimeric antibodies of two antibodies exhibited comparable HBsAg clearance and viral suppression efficacy as those versions of E6F6 in HBV-Tg mice. Humanized antibody hu1-23 exhibited more efficacy HBsAg-suppressing effects than huE6F6-1 and hu3-23 in HBV-Tg mice at dose levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg. Evaluation of the binding sites indicates that the epitope recognized by hu1-23 is located in HBsAg aa 118-125 and 121-125 for hu3-23. Physical property study revealed that hu1-23 and hu3-23 are stable enough for further development as a drug candidate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the CR-T3-SEQ13 protein is a promising HBV therapeutic vaccine candidate, and hu1-23 and hu3-23 are therapeutic candidates for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b. Moreover, the generation of antibodies from the epitope-based vaccinated subjects may be an alternative approach for novel antibody drug discovery.","Chen, Yuanzhi; Xiang, Xinchu; Qi, Ruoyao; Wang, Yiwen; Huang, Yang; You, Min; Xian, Yangfei; Wu, Yangtao; Fu, Rao; Kang, Ciming; Tang, Jixian; Yu, Hai; Zhang, Tianying; Yuan, Quan; Luo, Wenxin; Xia, Ningshao",Antib Ther,592,16

However, accumulating evidence reveals that ARSs are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes apart from translation. Strikingly, certain ARSs are closely related to different types of immune responses. In this review, we address the infection and immune responses induced by pathogen ARSs, as well as the potential anti-infective compounds that target pathogen ARSs. Meanwhile, we describe the functional mechanisms of ARSs in the development of immune cells. In addition, we focus on the roles of ARSs in certain immune diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and tumor immunity. Although our knowledge of ARSs in the immunological context is still in its infancy, research in this field may provide new ideas for the treatment of immune-related diseases.","Nie, Anzheng; Sun, Bao; Fu, Zhihui; Yu, Dongsheng",Cell Death Dis,592,10

The influence of proteins and particle PEGylation on miRNA adsorption were also explored. We found that low particle concentrations and physiological temperature both led to increased miRNA adsorption. Adsorption of miRNA was also higher when proteins were present in the same solution; reducing or preventing protein adsorption by PEGylating the MSNs hindered adsorption. Finally, the amount of miRNA adsorbed from human serum by MSN-NH(2) was compared to a commercial miRNA purification kit (TaqMan(®), Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). MSN-NH(2) adsorbed six times as much miRNA as the commercial kit, demonstrating higher sensitivity to subtle up- and downregulation of circulating miRNA in the blood of patients.","Vidaurre-Agut, Carla; Rivero-Buceta, Eva María; Landry, Christopher C.; Botella, Pablo",Nanomaterials (Basel),592,5

In the initial phase of population-based vaccination in the United States (U.S.) and United Kingdom (U.K.), vaccine hesitancy and limited access may result in disparities in uptake. METHODS: We performed a cohort study among U.S. and U.K. participants in the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study (March 24, 2020-February 16, 2021). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (unsure/not willing) and receipt. RESULTS: In the U.S. (n=87,388), compared to White non-Hispanic participants, the multivariable ORs of vaccine hesitancy were 3.15 (95% CI: 2.86 to 3.47) for Black participants, 1.42 (1.28 to 1.58) for Hispanic participants, 1.34 (1.18 to 1.52) for Asian participants, and 2.02 (1.70 to 2.39) for participants reporting more than one race/other. In the U.K. (n=1,254,294), racial and ethnic minorities had similarly elevated hesitancy: compared to White participants, their corresponding ORs were 2.84 (95% CI: 2.69 to 2.99) for Black participants, 1.66 (1.57 to 1.76) for South Asian participants, 1.84 (1.70 to 1.98) for Middle East/East Asian participants, and 1.48 (1.39 to 1.57) for participants reporting more than one race/other. Among U.S. participants, the OR of vaccine receipt was 0.71 (0.64 to 0.79) for Black participants, a disparity that persisted among individuals who specifically endorsed a willingness to obtain a vaccine. In contrast, disparities in uptake were not observed in the U.K. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was greater among racial and ethnic minorities, and Black participants living in the U.S. were less likely to receive a vaccine than White participants. Lower uptake among Black participants in the U.S. during the initial vaccine rollout is attributable to both hesitancy and disparities in access.","Nguyen, Long H.; Joshi, Amit D.; Drew, David A.; Merino, Jordi; Ma, Wenjie; Lo, Chun-Han; Kwon, Sohee; Wang, Kai; Graham, Mark S.; Polidori, Lorenzo; Menni, Cristina; Sudre, Carole H.; Anyane-Yeboa, Adjoa; Astley, Christina M.; Warner, Erica T.; Hu, Christina Y.; Selvachandran, Somesh; Davies, Richard; Nash, Denis; Franks, Paul W.; Wolf, Jonathan; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire J.; Spector, Tim D.; Chan, Andrew T.",medRxiv,592,20

The versatility of NMR — from detection of ligand binding over a wide range of affinities and a wide range of drug targets with its wealth of molecular information, to metabolomic profiling, both ex vivo and in vivo — has paved the way for broadly distributed applications in academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Proteomics and initial target selection both benefit from NMR: screenings by NMR identify lead compounds capable of inhibiting protein–protein interactions, still one of the most difficult development tasks in drug discovery. NMR hardware improvements have given access to the microgram domain of phytochemistry, which should lead to the discovery of novel bioactive natural compounds. Steering medicinal chemists through the lead optimisation process by providing detailed information about protein–ligand interactions has led to impressive success in the development of novel drugs. The study of biofluid composition — metabonomics — provides information about pharmacokinetics and helps toxicological safety assessment in animal model systems.

The generalized additive models (GAMs), wavelet coherence, and random forest (RF) model were employed to explore the relationship between air quality indicators and COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka city. Results show that overall, 26, 20.4, 17.5, 9.7 and 8.8% declined in PM 2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO concentrations, respectively, in Dhaka City during the partial and full lockdown compared to the period before the lockdown. The implementation of lockdown policy for containing COVID-19 transmission played a crucial role in reducing air pollution. The findings of wavelet coherence and partial wavelet coherence demonstrate no standalone coherence, but interestingly, multiple wavelet coherence indicated a strong short-term coherence among air pollutants and meteorological factors with the COVID-19 outbreak. Outcomes of GAMs indicated that an increase of 1-unit in long-term exposure to O3 and CO (lag1) was associated with a 2.9% (95% CI: -0.3%, -5.6%), and 53.9% (95% CI: 0.2%, -107.9%)] decreased risk of COVID-19 infection rate during the full-lockdown period.

Stationarity and moment structure for Box–Cox transformed threshold GARCH(1,1) processes. Statistics & Probability Letters 68, 209–220.] and includes the standard GARCH model and many other models as special cases. We first establish the asymptotic normality for quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLE) of the parameters under the condition that the error distribution has finite fourth moment. For the case of heavy-tailed errors, we propose a least absolute deviations estimation (LADE) for PTTGARCH [Formula: see text] model, and prove that the LADE is asymptotically normally distributed under very weak moment conditions. This paves the way for a statistical inference based on asymptotic normality for heavy-tailed PTTGARCH [Formula: see text] models. As a consequence, we can construct the Wald test for GARCH structure and discuss the order selection problem in heavy-tailed cases. Numerical results show that LADE is more accurate than QMLE for heavy-tailed errors. Furthermore, the theory is applied to the daily returns of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index, which suggests that asymmetry and nonlinearity could be present in the financial time series and the PTTGARCH model is capable of capturing these characteristics. As for the probabilistic structure of PTTGARCH [Formula: see text] model, we give in the appendix a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a strictly stationary solution of the model, the existence of the moments and the tail behavior of the strictly stationary solution.","Pan, Jiazhu; Wang, Hui; Tong, Howell",J Econom,592,16

Difference analyses of medical records were performed between severe and non-severe groups, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. In addition, we developed a decision tree model to predict death outcome in severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 2169 COVID-19 patients, the median age was 61 years and male patients accounted for 48%. A total of 646 patients were diagnosed as severe illness, and 75 patients died. An older median age and a higher proportion of male patients were found in severe group or non-survivors compared to their counterparts. Significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory examinations were found between severe and non-severe groups, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. A decision tree, including three biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein and lactic dehydrogenase, was developed to predict death outcome in severe patients.

Nonetheless, the specific inhibition of such pathway has shown mixed outcomes. This could be due to variations in the dose of tocilizumab used, the stage in which the drug is administered or the severity of disease presentation. Thus, we performed a retrospective multicentric study in 140 patients with moderate to critical COVID-19, 79 of which received tocilizumab in variable standard doses (< 400 mg, 400–800 mg or > 800 mg), either at the viral (1–7 days post-symptom onset), early inflammatory (8–15) or late inflammatory (16 or more) stages, and compared it with standard treated patients. Mortality, reduced respiratory support requirements and pathology markers were measured. Tocilizumab significantly reduced the respiratory support requirements (OR 2.71, CI 1.37–4.85 at 95%) and inflammatory markers (OR 4.82, CI 1.4–15.8) of all patients, but mortality was only reduced (4.1% vs 25.7%, p = 0.03) when the drug was administered at the early inflammatory stage and in doses ranging 400–800 mg in severely-ill patients. Despite the apparent inability of Tocilizumab to prevent the progression of COVID-19 into a critical presentation, severely-ill patients may be benefited by its use in the early inflammatory stage and moderate doses.","Durán-Méndez, Alejandro; Aguilar-Arroyo, Alma Delia; Vivanco-Gómez, Emiliano; Nieto-Ortega, Eduardo; Pérez-Ortega, Daniela; Jiménez-Pérez, Cristian; Hernández-Skewes, Karla Y.; Montiel-Bravo, Guillermo; Roque-Reyes, Oscar J.; Romero-Lechuga, Fernanda; Medina-Santos, Diana; Oriana-Román, Perla; Flores-Hernández, Jorge Rafael; Méndez-Coca, Juan Daniel; Montaño-Olmos, Daniela; Farfán-Lazos, Karla Cecilia; Tobón-Cubillos, Miranda; Viveros-Hernández, América; Sevilla-Castillo, Fernando; Hernández-Romero, Ángel Raúl; Ortega-Rodríguez, Shannat; Jardínez-Vera, Aldo Christiaan; Solís-González, María Antonieta; de la Medina, Antonio Ramos; Pérez-Maldonado, Laura Martínez; Lagunes-Lara, Elizabeth; Cova-Bonilla, Miguel; Peón, Alberto N.",Sci Rep,592,5

The purpose of this study was to broadly summarize the impact COVID-19 on radiology trainees and their training programs via data collected during the early pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : An online survey was distributed to radiology chief residents in residencies throughout North America with responses collected between March 20th, 2020 and May 15th, 2020, which coincided with the development of initial COVID-19 peaks in North America. A subset of COVID-19 pandemic questions included resident wellness, imaging opinions, residency infrastructure change, and opinions regarding the Core Exam delay. RESULTS: : 140 chief residents from 86 institutions responded to COVID-19-related questions. Nearly all responding programs (99%; 85/86) reported institutional positive cases of COVID-19. Most residents (94%; 132/140) thought laboratory testing provided more value than imaging. 57% of respondents (80/140) would use COVID-19-related terminology when encountering chest CT findings supportive of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients. There was little reported change in the number of residents on call (no change reported in >80% of programs). 59% of residents (83/140) reported increased stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of programs (93%) had fewer residents on service (80/86 responding programs). CONCLUSIONS: : COVID-19 dramatically affected radiology residencies during the early pandemic period. As we enter future phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, careful thought should also be given to rebuilding the radiology resident experience.","Hoegger, Mark J.; Shetty, Anup S.; Denner, Darcy R.; Gould, Jennifer E.; Wahl, Richard L.; Raptis, Constantine A.; Ballard, David H.",Curr Probl Diagn Radiol,592,16

Turkey coronavirus was partially purified from infected intestine of turkey embryo by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and RNA was extracted. The N protein gene was amplified from the extracted RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The recombinant expression construct (pTri-N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57 kd was determined by Western blotting analysis. By chromatography on nickel-agarose column, the expressed N protein was purified to near homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein recovery could be 2.5 mg from 100 ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein was recognized by antibody to TCoV in Western blotting assay. The capability of the recombinant N protein to differentiate positive serum of turkey infected with TCoV from normal turkey serum was evident in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These results indicated that the expressed N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for development of antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.","Loa, C.C.; Lin, T.L.; Wu, C.C.; Bryan, T.A.; Hooper, T.; Schrader, D.",J Virol Methods,592,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all intensive care units (ICUs) recognised for postgraduate training to determine administration, infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and training. RESULTS: There were 151 hospitals recognised for training, providing 2166 ICU beds and 1473 ventilators. Regional distribution of ICU beds per 100,000 population ranged from 1.0 in Sindh to none in Gilgit Baltistan (median 0.7). A senior clinician trained in critical care was available in 19 (12.1%) of units. One to one nurse to bed ratio during the day was available in 84 (53.5%) of units, dropping to 75 (47.8%) at night. Availability of 1:1 nursing also varied between provinces, ranging from 56.5% in Punjab compared to 0% in Azad Jamu Kashmir. Similarly there was disparity in availability of ventilators between provinces. All ICUs had basic infrastructure (electricity, running water, piped oxygen) and basic equipment (electronic monitoring and infusion pumps). CONCLUSION: Pakistan, a lower middle-income country, has an established network of critical care facilities with access to basic equipment, but inequalities in its distribution.

The Healthy Brain and Child Development Study will examine brain and behavioral development from birth through the first decade of life. Due to large scope and anticipated complexity of this initiative, an 18-month planning phase was implemented across 28 sites across the nation. A core element of the Phase I initiative involved the development of Stakeholder Advisory Committees to inform the next phase of the initiative. Methods: Phase I stakeholder meetings were conducted at Oregon Health and Science University, New York University Langone Medical Center, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Vermont to better understand perspectives and inform upcoming research. Despite differences in the structure of the stakeholder meetings by site, the overarching goals for the meetings included establishing relationships, gathering input, and learning about research engagement. Documents from each meeting were reviewed for location, duration, attendees, common research themes, and pertinent suggestions for improving research approaches. Results: All stakeholders had high levels of interest in research for pregnant people with substance use disorders and agreed on research priorities including collaboration, connection, communication, and support. Different stakeholders offered unique perspectives on various aspects of study design and themes that emerged through meetings. Discussion: Overall, there was excitement about the research, especially the opportunity to include the voices of people with lived experience; collaboration between providers, peer support specialists, patients, and others; and excitement around contributing to research that could elucidate new and pertinent findings in the realm of addiction medicine and child development. Sites also found that there is mistrust between people with substance use disorder and the medical system, and this could be addressed by including people with lived experience on the research team, forming connections, communicating clearly, training the research team in implicit bias, and practicing trauma-informed care. In conclusion, these stakeholder meetings provided valuable information for structuring upcoming studies; however, researchers would have benefitted from more time and more opportunities for in-person connection.","DiPietro, Jennifer L.; Mackiewicz Seghete, Kristen L.; Krans, Elizabeth E.; Snider, Kasey Edwards; Bower, Reina; Parker, Kea; Gullickson, Janie; Potter, Alexandra S.; Garavan, Hugh; Vatalaro, Tessa C.; Thomason, Moriah E.; Sullivan, Elinor L.; Graham, Alice M.",Front Psychol,592,22

In this qualitative study, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on attitudes toward smoking and motivation to quit. Participants (N = 30) were enrolled in a larger ongoing randomized controlled smoking cessation trial conducted in the lung cancer screening setting. From March to May 2020, we assessed quantitative and qualitative responses to participants’ overall concern about COVID-19, changes in amount smoked, and motivation to reduce/quit smoking. Responses to the quantitative questions indicated that 64.3% of participants were extremely concerned with COVID-19, 20.7% reported reductions in amount smoked, and 37.9% reported increased motivation to quit. The qualitative responses, which were transcribed and coded using Consensual Qualitative Research guidelines, expanded upon these findings by providing the content of participants’ concerns, which included perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, the added stressors caused by COVID-19, and a variable impact on the amount smoked and motivation to quit. Although half of participants expressed extreme concern regarding COVID-19, fewer indicated increased motivation or reduced smoking. Qualitative themes suggested that the initial two months of the pandemic prompted some smokers to reduce or quit, but it exacerbated smoking triggers for others. Understanding how the pandemic continues to affect this vulnerable group will aid in adapting methods to support their efforts to stop smoking and remain abstinent.","Cordon, Marisa; Eyestone, Ellie; Hutchison, Sarah; Dunlap, Daisy; Smith, Laney; Williams, Randi M.; Kim, Emily; Kao, Jen-Yuan; Hurtado-de-Mendoza, Alejandra; Stanton, Cassandra; Davis, Kimberly; Frey, Jennifer; McKee, Brady; Parikh, Vicky; Taylor, Kathryn L.",Prev Med Rep,592,1

This kind of panic spreads and develops through online social networks, and further spreads to the offline environment, which triggers panic buying behavior and has a serious impact on social stability. In order to quantitatively study this behavior, a two-layer propagation model of panic buying behavior under the sudden epidemic is constructed. The model first analyzes the formation process of individual panic from a micro perspective, and then combines the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model to simulate the spread of group behavior. Then, through simulation experiments, the main factors affecting the spread of panic buying behavior are discussed. The experimental results show that: (1) the dissipating speed of individual panics is related to the number of interactions and there is a threshold. When the number of individuals involved in interacting is equal to this threshold, the panic of the group dissipates the fastest, while the dissipation speed is slower when it is far from the threshold; (2) The reasonable external information release time will affect the occurrence of the second panic buying, meaning providing information about the availability of supplies when an escalation of epidemic is announced will help prevent a second panic buying. In addition, when the first panic buying is about to end, if the scale of the second panic buying is to be suppressed, it is better to release positive information after the end of the first panic buying, rather than ahead of the end; and (3) Higher conformity among people escalates panic, resulting in panic buying. Finally, two cases are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.","Fu, Peihua; Jing, Bailu; Chen, Tinggui; Xu, Chonghuan; Yang, Jianjun; Cong, Guodong",Front Public Health,592,29

Although CMDs are highly prevalent among university students, few studies have examined the relationship between childhood maltreatment and 12 month CMDs in a low- to middle-income countries. This paper describes the prevalence of maltreatment and the relationship between type, number and patterns of maltreatment exposure and 12 month CMDs among first-year university students in South Africa. METHODS: Maltreatment and CMD data were collected via well-validated self-report scales (corresponding with DSM-IV diagnoses) in a web-based survey of first-year students from two large urban universities (n = 1290) in South Africa. Various multivariate modelling approaches (additive, restrictive interactive and latent class) were used to examine the relationship between maltreatment and CMDs. RESULTS: Overall, 48.4% of participants reported childhood maltreatment, the most common type being emotional abuse (26.7%). Regardless of the modelling approach used, emotional abuse was the only type of maltreatment independently associated with 12-month diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) or drug use disorder (DUD) even after adjusting for types and number of types of maltreatment. Similarly, students in the latent class reflecting histories of emotional abuse (either alone or combined with physical abuse) were more likely to meet criteria for 12-month MDD, GAD or DUD. CONCLUSION: Findings confirm the high prevalence of childhood maltreatment among South African students. As this exposure elevates risk for MDD, GAD and DUD, interventions aimed at preventing and treating CMDs among first-year students should address experiences of childhood maltreatment.

Several previous studies have reported elevations of inflammatory markers in Covid-19 positive patients and suggested a possible correlation to disease severity. Methods We identified 69 patients from Baton Rouge General (BRG) Hospital who were admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and laboratory confirmed positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 13 and April 5, 2020. Demographic and laboratory data were obtained through a review of medical records. Statistical analysis was performed on several inflammatory markers in association with clinical disease severity. Results We identified 69 patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 65±14 years, 68% were male and 32% were female. A total of 13 patients (19%) were considered to have mild disease, 25 (36%) had moderate disease, and 31 (45%) were considered to have severe disease. A total of nine patients died (13%), 25 (36%) have been discharged from the hospital, 20 (29%) remain in the ICU, and 15 (22%) remain admitted to the hospital at the time of writing. Lymphopenia was common among hospitalized patients (39%) and was found to be statistically more pronounced in patients with severe disease (p<0.05). Inflammatory marker elevations were also seen in several patients, with statistically significant elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p <0.05). We found no statistically significant associations between ferritin, D-dimer, troponin I, body mass index (BMI), or creatine kinase (CK) with disease severity. Conclusions During the first three weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the most common reason for admission amongst Covid-19 positive patients was acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Previously, several studies have suggested a correlation between elevated inflammatory markers and disease severity.

Abstract INTRODUCTION: The republic of the Congo faced its first COVID-19 case on 14 March 2020, and some weeks later initiated individual and country protective measures that are still applied in July, 2020. Along the course of time, the progression of clinical cases appears to be lower than expected based on RT-PCR testing which was quite limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within the population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville willing to know their infectious status with regard to COVID-19. METHODS: We collected oropharyngeal swab and blood samples from 754 healthy volunteers for screening between April and July, 2020. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and Immunoglo bulin G and M were detected using using two different rapid diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Out of 754 samples, 56 were found to have active SARS-COV2 infection (7.4%). This means 92.5% (n = 698/754) were RT-PCR negative out of which 117 had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their serum. Among these RT-PCR negative subjects, the seroprevalence raised from 1.7% for IgG + and 2.5% for IgM + in April to 14.2% of IgG and 17.6% of IgM in July. No difference was found according to the district of residence (P = 0.108). With regard to gender, 5% of women against 0% of men had either IgG and IgM in April. During the first three months, seroprevalence was significantly higher in women within IgG (P < 0.0001) and IgM (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo.","Batchi-Bouyou, Armel Landry; Lobaloba, Line; Ndounga, Matthieu; Vouvoungui, Jeannhey Christevy; Mfoutou, Chastel Mapanguy; Boumpoutou, Kamal Rauchelvy; Ntoumi, Francine",Int J Infect Dis,592,26

METHODS: A total of 95 paired DBS and serum samples were collected from 74 participants (aged 1–63 years) as part of a household cohort study in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 proteins between serum and eluates from DBS specimens were compared using an FDA-approved ELISA method. RESULTS: Among the 74 participants, 42% (31/74) were children and the rest were adults. A total of 16 children and 13 adults were SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain reaction. The IgG seropositivity rate was similar between serum and DBS specimens (18.9% (18/95) versus 16.8% (16/95)), respectively. Similar RBD and S1-specific IgG levels were detected between serum and DBS specimens. Serum IgG levels strongly correlated with DBS IgG levels (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001) for both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Furthermore, antibodies remained stable in DBS specimens for >3 months. CONCLUSIONS: DBS specimens can be reliably used as an alternative to serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement. The use of DBS specimens would facilitate serosurveillance efforts particularly in hard-to-reach populations and inform public health responses including COVID-19 vaccination strategies.","Toh, Zheng Quan; Higgins, Rachel A; Anderson, Jeremy; Mazarakis, Nadia; Do, Lien Anh Ha; Rautenbacher, Karin; Ramos, Pedro; Dohle, Kate; Tosif, Shidan; Crawford, Nigel; Mulholland, Kim; Licciardi, Paul V",J Public Health (Oxf),592,20

Targeting sedentary behavior is a simple strategy that may help counter physical and mental health concerns associated with COVID-19-related social restrictions. Of course, traditional strategies such as achieving optimal exercise and physical activity levels are also important and should be recommended. However, even under normal circumstances, the difficulty in promoting lasting exercise habits at multiple levels (e.g. individual, environment, policy) are well documented, and chances of maintaining or improving these factors is now even lower. Thus, relative to other lifestyle behaviors – sedentary behavior may be more amenable to change. Moreover, reducing sedentary behavior may be less susceptible to influence from factors associated with health disparities such as age, race, and socio-economic status compared to exercise or physical activity.

The Center for Disease Control's decision to present the racial/ethnic distribution of COVID-19 deaths at the state level alongside the weighted racial/ethnic distribution of the counties within each state reporting those death -- in effect, a geographic adjustment -- makes it seem that Whites have the highest death rates. Age adjustment procedures used by others, including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, lead to the opposite conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place-adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80% higher for Blacks and over 50% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level. State-specific estimates show wide variation in mortality disparities. Comparison with nonepidemic mortality reveals potential roles for preexisting health disparities and differential rates of infection and care.","Goldstein, J.

This virus is associated with a high mortality rate, but there is as of yet no effective vaccine or antibody available for human immunity/treatment. Drug design relies on understanding the 3D structures of viral proteins; however, arriving at such understanding is difficult for intrinsically disordered proteins, whose disorder-dependent functions are key to the virus’s biology. Disorder is suggested to provide viral proteins with highly flexible structures and diverse functions that are utilized when invading host organisms and adjusting to new habitats. To date, the functional roles of intrinsically disordered proteins in the mechanisms of MERS-CoV pathogenesis, transmission, and treatment remain unclear. In this study, we performed structural analysis to evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the MERS-CoV proteome and in individual proteins derived from the MERS-CoV genome. Moreover, we detected disordered protein binding regions, namely, molecular recognition features and short linear motifs. Studying disordered proteins/regions in MERS-CoV could contribute to unlocking the complex riddles of viral infection, exploitation strategies, and drug development approaches in the near future by making it possible to target these important (yet challenging) unstructured regions.","Alshehri, Manal A.; Manee, Manee M.; Alqahtani, Fahad H.; Al-Shomrani, Badr M.; Uversky, Vladimir N.",Viruses,592,24

However, the effectiveness of this approach depends on the adherence of a large segment of the population. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the acceptability of a COVID-19 contact tracing mobile app among the French population and to investigate the barriers to its use. METHODS: The Health Literacy Survey 2019 questioned 1003 people in France during the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of quota sampling. The survey collected sociodemographic characteristics and health literacy data, as well as information on participants’ communication with caregivers, trust in institutions, and COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors. The acceptability of a mobile app for contact tracing was measured by a single question, the responses to which were grouped into three modalities: app-supporting, app-willing, and app-reluctant. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the acceptability of a mobile app during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Only 19.2% (193/1003) of all participants were app-supporting, whereas half of them (504/1003, 50.3%) were reluctant. The factors associated with willingness or support toward the contact tracing app included lower financial deprivation (app-willing: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.8, 95% CI 0.69-0.93; app-supporting: aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58-0.84) and higher perceived usefulness of using a mobile app to send completed health questionnaires to doctors (app-willing: aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.70-3.26; app-supporting: aOR 3.1, 95% CI 2.04-4.82). Furthermore, the likelihood of supporting the mobile app increased with age over 60 years (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.13-3.22), trust in political representatives (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.72-4.23), feeling concerned about the pandemic situation (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.47-3.32), and knowledge about the transmission of COVID-19 (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.39-2.96). CONCLUSIONS: The most socioeconomically precarious people, who are at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are also the most reluctant to using a contact tracing mobile app. Therefore, optimal adherence can only be effective with a targeted discourse on public health benefits to adopt such an app, which should be combined with a reduction in inequalities by acting on structural determinants.","Touzani, Rajae; Schultz, Emilien; Holmes, Seth M; Vandentorren, Stéphanie; Arwidson, Pierre; Guillemin, Francis; Rey, Dominique; Rouquette, Alexandra; Bouhnik, Anne-Déborah; Mancini, Julien",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,592,20

Positive selection was not detected and mutation rates ranged from 10(−4) to 10(−6) substitutions/site/year for Mass and Conn IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used to control the disease. In contrast, for CAL type viruses, for which no vaccine exists, positive selection was detected and mutation rates were 10 fold higher ranging from 10(−2) to 10(−3) substitutions/site/year. Lower levels of genetic diversity among the Mass and Conn viruses as well as sequence similarities with vaccine virus genomes suggest that the origin of the Mass and all but one of the Conn viruses was likely vaccine virus that had been circulating in the field for an unknown but apparently short period of time. The genetic data also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome suggesting that viruses within the same serotype can have a high degree of genetic variability outside of the spike gene. These data are important because inaccurate measures of genetic diversity and mutation rates could lead to underestimates of the ability of IBV to change and potentially emerge to cause disease.","McKinley, Enid T.; Jackwood, Mark W.; Hilt, Deborah A.; Kissinger, Jessica C.; Robertson, Jon S.; Lemke, Cornelia; Paterson, Andrew H.",Virus Res,592,20

While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopamine neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the OB and olfactory epithelium (OE) is important for olfaction. However, the reports on neurogenesis in the human OB have been a subject of debate, while considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory receptor-expressing neurons in OE respectively.","Rethinavel, Harini Sri; Ravichandran, Sowbarnika; Radhakrishnan, Risna Kanjirassery; Kandasamy, Mahesh",J Chem Neuroanat,592,1

However, the cis-acting elements on the positive-strand [(+)-strand] sgmRNA required for (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis have not yet been systematically identified. In this study, we employed real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to analyze the cis-acting elements on bovine coronavirus (BCoV) sgmRNA 7 required for the synthesis of its (−)-strand counterpart by deletion mutagenesis. The major findings are as follows. (1) Deletion of the 5'-terminal leader sequence on sgmRNA 7 decreased the synthesis of the (−)-strand sgmRNA complement. (2) Deletions of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) bulged stem-loop showed no effect on (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis; however, deletion of the 3' UTR pseudoknot decreased the yield of (−)-strand sgmRNA. (3) Nucleotides positioned from −15 to −34 of the sgmRNA 7 3'-terminal region are required for efficient (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis. (4) Nucleotide species at the 3'-most position (−1) of sgmRNA 7 is correlated to the efficiency of (−)-strand sgmRNA synthesis.

This study aimed to assess whether cluster infection prevention is possible by evaluating the association between viral transmission and meteorological factors. METHODS: This study included 1263 people who were successively diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hokkaido, Japan between January 24, 2020 and June 30, 2020. After obtaining the values from the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the average scores of air temperature and humidity were calculated and compared with COVID-19 reproduction numbers, and the association between COVID-19 incidence or reproduction number and meteorological factors was assessed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 reproduction number in Hokkaido had three peaks that came several days before the surge in COVID-19 cases. The peaks are indicative of cluster infections. There was a strong negative correlation between the kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the reproduction number. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Analysis of the reproduction number is important for predicting or suppressing COVID-19 infection clusters. The authors found a strong association between meteorological factors, such as kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the incidence of COVID-19 infection.

RECENT FINDINGS Several large studies and national registries have shown that the risk of vertical transmission from SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers to newborns is rare and does not appear to be related to postnatal care policies such as mother-newborn separation and breastfeeding. Newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in utero are at higher risk for preterm delivery for reasons still under investigation. When newborns do acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, their disease course is usually mild. Long-term follow-up data are lacking, but preliminary reports indicate that, similarly to prior natural disasters, being born during the pandemic may be associated with developmental risk. SUMMARY Although risk of vertical or perinatal transmission is low across a range of postnatal care practices, early indicators suggest developmental risk to the generation born during the pandemic. Long-term follow-up data are critically needed to determine the developmental impact of in utero and early life exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kyle, Margaret H; Dumitriu, Dani",Current opinion in pediatrics,592,32

Severely deranged vital signs such as hypoxia, hypotension and low conscious level can identify critical illness. These vital signs are simple to check and treatments that aim to correct derangements are established, basic and low-cost. The aim of the study was to estimate the unmet need of such essential treatments for severely deranged vital signs in all adults admitted to hospitals in Malawi. METHODS: We conducted a point prevalence cross-sectional study of adult hospitalized patients in Malawi. All in-patients aged ≥18 on single days Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) and Chiradzulu District Hospital (CDH) were screened. Patients with hypoxia (oxygen saturation <90%), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90mmHg) and reduced conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale <9) were included in the study. The a-priori defined essential treatments were oxygen therapy for hypoxia, intravenous fluid for hypotension and an action to protect the airway for reduced consciousness (placing the patient in the lateral position, insertion of an oro-pharyngeal airway or endo-tracheal tube or manual airway protection). RESULTS: Of the 1135 hospital in-patients screened, 45 (4.0%) had hypoxia, 103 (9.1%) had hypotension, and 17 (1.5%) had a reduced conscious level. Of those with hypoxia, 40 were not receiving oxygen (88.9%). Of those with hypotension, 94 were not receiving intravenous fluids (91.3%). Of those with a reduced conscious level, nine were not receiving an action to protect the airway (53.0%).

With the emergence of COVID-19, together with its widely varying degrees of severity, its rapid progression in some cases, and the potential for lengthy post-COVID-19 morbidity, there is a new role in applying well-established qCT-based metrics. Based on the utility of qCT tools in other lung diseases, previously validated supervised classical machine learning methods, and emerging unsupervised machine learning and deep-learning approaches, we are now able to provide desperately needed insight into the acute and the chronic phases of this inflammatory lung disease. The potential areas in which qCT imaging can be beneficial include improved accuracy of diagnosis, identification of clinically distinct phenotypes, improvement of disease prognosis, stratification of care, and early objective evaluation of intervention response. There is also a potential role for qCT in evaluating an increasing population of post-COVID-19 lung parenchymal changes such as fibrosis. In this work, we discuss the basis of various lung qCT methods, using case-examples to highlight their potential application as a tool for the exploration and characterization of COVID-19, and offer scanning protocols to serve as templates for imaging the lung such that these established qCT analyses have the best chance at yielding the much needed new insights.","Nagpal, Prashant; Guo, Junfeng; Shin, Kyung Min; Lim, Jae-Kwang; Kim, Ki Beom; Comellas, Alejandro P; Kaczka, David W; Peterson, Samuel; Lee, Chang Hyun; Hoffman, Eric A",BJR Open,592,12

Diseases in individuals which offer some commercial value are often well documented and subsequently well studied in comparison to those wild groups offering little commercial gain. This is particularly the case with those associated with mariculture or the commercial fisheries. Specifically, these include many Holothuroidea, and numerous crustacea and mollusca species. Pathogens/parasites consisting of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes from all groups have been associated with diseases from such organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Viral pathogens in particular, appear to be an increasingly important group and research into this group will likely highlight a larger number of diseases and pathogens being described in the near future. Interestingly, although there are countless examples of the spread of disease usually associated with transportation of specific infected hosts for development of aquaculture practices, this process appears to be continuing with no real sign of effective management and mitigation strategies being implicated. Notably, even in well developed countries such as the UK and the US, even though live animal trade may be well managed, the transport of frozen food appears to be less well so and as evidence suggests, even these to have the potential to transmit pathogens when used as a food source for example.","Sweet, Michael J.; Bateman, Kelly S.",J Sea Res,592,1

It has the capability to end in post-infection complications and critical outcomes due to significant pro-inflammatory conditions. The role of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with immune disorders, such as sarcoidosis, and the specific interaction between these two diseases remains unclear. Here we present a case of a 65-year-old female with sarcoidosis who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old African American female with a PMH of Sarcoidosis, Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) on Riociguat, Macitentan, and Warfarin presented with cough, SOB, and fever for 1-week duration. Upon arrival to the ED, vital signs were significant for tachypnea and hypoxemia. COVID-19 PCR was positive. Initial chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with multilobar chronic airspace disease. She was treated with Remdesivir and dexamethasone. During the hospital course, warfarin was held due to supratherapeutic INR. However, before discharge her respiratory parameters decompensated and she required HFNC to maintain her saturation. CT pulmonary angiogram revealed PE in the right distal segmental branch with significant bilateral patchy infiltrates more severe in the distribution of lower lobe suggestive of multilobar pneumonia with bilateral GGOs with crazy paving. Beta galactomannan came back positive and Voriconazole was started empirically with significant improvement in respiratory symptoms. Later fungal culture from sputum confirmed aspergillosis. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune system which results in a release of inflammatory cytokines and leads to cytokine storms. But it remains unknown how the interaction differs in patients with an altered immune system, especially in cases of impairment of the T-cell immunity and granuloma formation, such as sarcoidosis. Some authors suggested that constitutional defects of the regulation of macroautophagy in sarcoidosis could lead to a more severe outcome from the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. literature review showed that alveolar damage, dysfunctional mucociliary clearance, and altered immune system further facilitates fungal invasion. We, therefore, hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 in a patient with underlying sarcoidosis may lead to increased risk for pulmonary aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: The role of infection from the novel coronavirus in patients having sarcoidosis is still largely unknown however clinicians should be aware that it has the risk of serious complications and clinical deterioration including further destruction of lung architecture, hypervascular response, hypercoagulability, and superinfection like CAPA.

Ce pays a été frappé par de nombreuses épidémies qui ont engendré une grande létalité des personnes. Le Maroc a connu certaines catastrophes naturelles et épidémies (la peste, le choléra, la famine…) qui ont eu des conséquences extrêmement sévères. Actuellement, la COVID-19 constitue un défi international pour la santé publique. Au Maroc, cette pandémie est devenue un problème de santé majeur. Dans ce cadre, plusieurs actions préventives et curatives ont été mises en place pour faire face à cette pandémie. La réalisation de ces actions nécessite l’utilisation d’un SIG adéquat pour un meilleur suivi de l’évolution de cette pandémie. Pour une analyse spatiale de cette pandémie et vu l’importance de l’information épidémiologique dans la lutte contre la pandémie, le SIG se considère comme outil puissant d’aide à la décision. Le présent travail vise à identifier les zones à risque et leur hiérarchisation en fonction du degré de risque potentiel dès le début de la propagation de la COVID-19 au Maroc du 2 mars 2020 jusqu’au 31 décembre 2020 et à améliorer le système de surveillance épidémiologique à l’aide du SIG. Méthodes Pour réaliser cette étude, nous nous sommes basés sur l’exploitation et l’analyse des données déclarées par le Ministère de la santé Marocain et sur la carte géographique et administrative du Royaume du Maroc. Une analyse spatiale de la COVID-19 a été réalisée à travers ArcGIS 10.8 qui est un logiciel de traitement de l’information géographique. Les données sanitaires concernant les 12 régions du territoire marocain se présentaient dans le nombre des cas de la COVID-19 comme une variable quantitative discrète et dans le temps comme une variable temporelle continue. Résultats D’après les cartes réalisées à l’aide du SIG, il s’avère que la concentration des cas de la COVID-19 dans la région de Casablanca-Settat est la plus forte. Le classement des régions selon les cas enregistrés de la COVID-19 est comme suit : Casablanca-Settat>Rabat-Salé-Kénitra>Tanger-Tétouan-Al Hoceima>Marrakech-Safi>Souss-Massa>L’Oriental>Fès-Meknès>Beni Mellal-Khénifra>Drâa-Tafilalet>Laâyoune-Sakia El Hamra>Guelmim-Oued Noun>Dakhla-Oued Eddahab. L’élévation des cas dans les grandes villes est due à plusieurs facteurs, notamment les facteurs démographiques. Ce qui indique qu’il faudrait tenir compte de l’apport de la démographie en santé environnementale. Les facteurs démographiques permettent de comprendre la santé environnementale à partir des données empiriques. La géographie améliore les décisions et la responsabilité en matière de santé. L’intégration du contexte géographique de la propagation de la COVID-19 aide les décideurs à comprendre l’influence du lieu sur la stratégie et les objectifs de la lutte contre cette pandémie. Conclusion L’utilisation du SIG en épidémiologie et plus particulièrement dans l’analyse spatiale de la COVID-19 a permis de bien visualiser la géographie de cette pandémie ; ce qui va contribuer à mieux gérer la situation épidémiologique au Maroc. Or, il faut évaluer l’impact des actions préventives mises en place par le Ministère de la santé sur toutes les dimensions à travers le SIG.","Haisoufi, D.; Kasouati, J.; El Kafssaoui, S.; Eddaoudi, F.; Bouaiti, E.; Abouqal, R.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,592,29

The simulation considers individuals as agents moving randomly across the habitat according to predefined urban patterns. Agents carry a simple tracing device that identifies signals emitted by other agents, recording the position and time of the encounter. The information of every device is propagated daily to an epidemic observatory based on an online graph database. Infections are simulated as stochastic processes depending on the proximity among individuals. Different epidemic control strategies are tested with and without the information of the tracing device under several scenarios. We observe that the success of the strategies strongly depends on the duration of the period of infectiousness before the presence of symptoms and the fraction of asymptomatic agents. If these values are high, strategies based on the presence of symptoms or on testing campaigns can hardly contain the epidemic. Strategies using massive confinement of the agents are able to control the epidemic at the cost of sending a large fraction of the population into quarantine. In cases with moderate and low values for these parameters, the tracing devices can provide a slightly better performance but only if a large fraction of the agents carry the device. Otherwise, the impact of these devices is found to be negligible in comparison with other strategies not using them. Finally, we provide a methodology allowing to use the information of the graph database to estimate basic parameters of the disease such as the infection probability.","Martinez Ruiz del Arbol, P.; Lloret Iglesias, L.",,592,20

The effects of the pandemic have not just been medical, but also societal and economical. The responses of government and the public have varied in different countries. Measures have ranged from improving hygiene, information dissemination, and social distancing to more radical measures such as social isolation, quarantine and lockdown. The disease and human responses have had consequences on the way we live, work, eat and rest. Life and livelihoods have been affected. This article highlights how the response to the pandemic has affected various aspects of healthcare and ethical dilemmas this has raised. As the pandemic progresses, awareness and evaluation of the unintended consequences of the pandemic and responses on our health and healthcare systems are needed. Discussing these points and being aware of the ethical issues may help countries and policy makers plan suitable strategies to mitigate these collateral effects, especially as the pandemic continues. It is hoped that this article will support healthcare workers, especially those in primary and secondary healthcare, as they overcome various challenges to treat patients with existing and prior diseases, and encourage them to advocate for robust and sustainable healthcare systems for public health. This would then help effectively combat future epidemics. Most importantly, it can mitigate the adverse collateral effects on healthcare that the public are experiencing and the treatment dilemmas that family and primary care physicians are facing.","Chandy, Sujith J.; Ranjalkar, Jaya; Chandy, Sheeba S.",J Family Med Prim Care,592,16

Importantly, infection itself leads to changes in social behavior as a component of “sickness behavior.” Furthermore, as in the case of COVID-19, males and females often differ in their immunological response to infection, and, therefore, in their susceptibility to negative outcomes. In this review, we discuss the many ways in which infection changes social behavior—sometimes to the benefit of the host, and in some instances for the sake of the pathogen—in species ranging from eusocial insects to humans. We also explore the neuroimmune mechanisms by which these changes in social behavior occur. Finally, we touch upon the ways in which the social environment (group living, social isolation, etc.) shapes the immune system and its ability to respond to challenge. Throughout we emphasize how males and females differ in their response to immune activation, both behaviorally and physiologically.","Smith, Caroline J.; Bilbo, Staci D.",Front Psychiatry,592,1

These findings were obtained in surveys using self-report questionnaires with pre-specified response options that may not capture the broad range of experiences of individuals affected by cancer, including people with cancer and informal caregivers, in this unprecedented situation. Online forums produce a large amount of valuable first-hand user-generated content that can be used to better understand their day-to-day lives. This study, based on the analysis of narratives in cancer online forums, aims to describe and categorize the experiences of people affected by cancer during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An inductive, descriptive, thematic approach was applied to publicly available cancer forums from Germany, the USA, the UK, and Ireland posted between mid-March and mid-April 2020. RESULTS: An analysis of the content of 230 main posts revealed three major themes: (1) concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, the risks and fears of getting infected, logistic issues, and economic impact; (2) adaptation challenges faced at the individual and societal level; and (3) the need for advice including information about COVID-19 and the (self-)management of cancer symptoms and treatment. CONCLUSION: Our qualitative description of the experiences of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak can help to improve communication, education, and the development of supportive care strategies.

No form of life on Earth can survive without iron, although some species can live without oxygen. Iron presents a double‐edged sword. Excess iron is a risk for carcinogenesis, while its deficiency causes anemia, leading to oxygen shortage. Every cell is eventually destined to death, either through apoptosis or necrosis. Regulated necrosis is recognized in distinct forms. Ferroptosis is defined as catalytic Fe(II)‐dependent regulated necrosis accompanied by lipid peroxidation. The main observation was necrosis of fibrosarcoma cells through inhibition of cystine/glutamate antiporter with erastin, which reduced intracellular cysteine and, thus, glutathione levels. Our current understanding of ferroptosis is relative abundance of iron (catalytic Fe[II]) in comparison with sulfur (sulfhydryls). Thus, either excess iron or sulfur deficiency causes ferroptosis. Cell proliferation inevitably requires iron for DNA synthesis and energy production. Carcinogenesis is a process toward iron addiction with ferroptosis resistance. Conversely, ferroptosis is associated with aging and neurodegeneration. Ferroptosis of immune cells during infection is advantageous for infectious agents, whereas ferroptosis resistance incubates carcinogenic soil as excess iron. Cancer cells are rich in catalytic Fe(II). Directing established cancer cells to ferroptosis is a novel strategy for discovering cancer therapies. Appropriate iron regulation could be a tactic to reduce and delay carcinogenesis.","Toyokuni, Shinya; Yanatori, Izumi; Kong, Yingyi; Zheng, Hao; Motooka, Yashiro; Jiang, Li",Cancer Sci,592,16

While many reports suggest a potential role for BCG immunization in ameliorating SARS-CoV-2 infection, these findings remain controversial. With country-level COVID-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, and BCG program data from World Atlas of BCG Policies and Practices and WHO/UNICE, we estimated a dynamic model to investigate the effect of BCG vaccination across time during the pandemic. Our results reconcile these varying reports regarding protection by BCG against COVID-19 in a variety of clinical scenarios and model specifications. We observe a notable protective effect of the BCG vaccine during the early stage of the pandemic. However, we do not see any strong evidence for protection during the later stages. We also see that a higher proportion of vaccinated young population may confer some level of communal protection against the virus in the early pandemic period, even when the proportion of vaccination in the older population is low. Our results highlight that while BCG may offer some protection against COVID-19, we should be cautious in interpreting the estimated effectiveness as it may vary over time and depend on the age structure of the vaccinated population.","Fu, Wei; Ho, Pei-Chuan; Liu, Chia-Lun; Tzeng, Kai-Teh; Nayeem, Nawar; Moore, Jonni S.; Wang, Li-San; Chou, Shin-Yi",Sci Rep,592,33

Here by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that in severe (or critical) cases, there is remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier re-establishment, respectively. In order to understand the function of KRT5+ progenitors in vivo, we transplanted a single KRT5+ cell-derived cell population into damaged mouse lung. Time-course single-cell transcriptomic analysis showed that the transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engrafted into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration. Similar barrier cells were also identified in some COVID-19 patients with massive leukocyte infiltration.

BACKGROUND: Restricted gatherings and containment measures during the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic have a major impact on daily clinical practice. Interaction between peers is crucial in science, clinical practice, and education. In addition, there is also a growing importance of proctoring in interventional cardiology for structural heart disease. Virtual support may facilitate the wide implementation of remote proctoring. METHODS: A collaboration between a smartglass provider (Rods & Cones) and self‐expandable transcatheter aortic heart valve system (Medtronic) was initiated and tested extensively prior to TAVR procedures. Two cases were randomly selected for remote support. The light‐weight smartglass consisted of a full HD central camera, a 720p ×5 optical zoom camera, built‐in LED light, speaker and earphone jack, and an external visor to project data in a nonobstructive manner in the operators' view. RESULTS: Preprocedural detailed discussion of the cases between the proctor and the operator occurred via teleconferencing. Successful procedural virtual support was determined by the presence of a session coordinator, high quality of the central camera, high‐speed and stable wireless internet connection. Limitations were the relative discomfort of the earpieces, discordance between the central and zoom camera and the absence of visual fixation during head motions. CONCLUSION: In a highly complex and demanding context such as TAVR, remote proctoring by means of virtual support is feasible and efficacious.","Arslan, Fatih; Gerckens, Ulrich",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,592,20

Acid-activated penetration, occurring 20–40 min after internalization, required maturation of early to late endosomes. The pH threshold for viral membrane fusion was 5.4, and entry was sensitive to temperatures below 25°C. Together, our results indicate that Uukuniemi virus penetrates host cells by acid-activated membrane fusion from late endosomal compartments. This study also highlights the importance of the degradative branch of the endocytic pathway in facilitating entry of late-penetrating viruses.","Lozach, Pierre-Yves; Mancini, Roberta; Bitto, David; Meier, Roger; Oestereich, Lisa; Överby, Anna K.; Pettersson, Ralf F.; Helenius, Ari",Cell Host Microbe,592,1

Realizing the potential risk of that, this study took the “Occupy Central” spreading on Weibo as a case, and applied topic clustering and sentiment analysis to examine the sequential characteristics of secondary crisis communication on social media in topics and emotions. Results show that the topics Weibo users discussed shifted from a political event to tourism boycott, with emotions turning increasingly negative. The turning point of such a transfer was aroused group conflicts and negative emotions elicited between people from mainland China and Hong Kong. The results indicate the necessity of emphasizing secondary crisis communication during a crisis due to the dynamic and sequential change of topics and public's emotions, which may result in new crises impacting the tourism destination where the initial crisis occurs.","Luo, Qiuju; Zhai, Xueting",Tour Manag,592,1

The Western Regional Alliance for Pediatric Emergency Management held an integrated, interdisciplinary national tabletop exercise to familiarize mental health and non-mental health professionals with Psychological Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (PsySTART), an evidence-based triage and incident management system used to evaluate new mental health risk impacts following exposure to traumatic events, such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Participants Participants were exposed to 3 practice cases that reflected a combination of “all hazards” scenarios and were asked to triage each case using PsySTART. Participants were asked to interpret results at both an individual site and aggregate county and/or state level. RESULTS: The exercise had a total of 115 participants with a total of 156 discrete triage encounters. A user-defined operating picture was created with graphs of aggregate mental health risk data, generating cross-regional, real-time situational awareness. After the exercise, a vast majority of the participants reported confidence in their ability to use PsySTART in their practices. CONCLUSIONS: Participants are now better equipped with tools to perform mental health triage for early intervention during COVID-19 and other disasters and understand risk on a population level.","Gupta, Saloni; Schreiber, Merritt; McGuire, Tona; Newton, Christopher",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,592,22

Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. METHODS: We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted. RESULTS: Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998. CONCLUSIONS: Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage from more global restrictions.","Guan, Grace; Dery, Yotam; Yechezkel, Matan; Ben-Gal, Irad; Yamin, Dan; Brandeau, Margaret L.",PLoS One,592,1

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.

Clinical guidelines recommend multicomponent lifestyle programmes to promote modest, clinically significant body mass (BM) loss. Primary care providers (PCPs) often lack time to counsel and refer patients to intensive programmes (≥6 sessions over 3 months). Using peer coaches to deliver obesity counselling in primary care may increase patient motivation, promote behavioural change and address the specific needs of veterans. We describe the rationale and design of a cluster-randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of the Peer-Assisted Lifestyle (PAL) intervention compared with enhanced usual care (EUC) to improve BM loss, clinical and behavioural outcomes (aim 1); identify BM-loss predictors (aim 2); and increase PCP counselling (aim 3). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are recruiting 461 veterans aged 18–69 years with obesity or overweight with an obesity-associated condition under the care of a PCP at the Brooklyn campus of the Veterans Affairs NY Harbor Healthcare System. To deliver counselling, PAL uses in-person and telephone-based peer support, a tablet-delivered goal-setting tool and PCP training. Patients in the EUC arm receive non-tailored healthy living handouts. In-person data collection occurs at baseline, month 6 and month 12 for patients in both arms. Repeated measures modelling based on mixed models will compare mean BM loss (primary outcome) between study arms.

To help individuals concerned about their sleep, we developed a smartphone-based app called KANOPEE that allows users to interact with a virtual agent dedicated to autonomous screening and delivering digital behavioral interventions. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the feasibility of this app, in terms of inclusion rate, follow-up rate, perceived trust and acceptance of the virtual agent, and effects of the intervention program, in the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. METHODS: The virtual agent is an artificial intelligence program using decision tree architecture and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. A total of 2069 users aged 18 years and above downloaded the free app during the study period (April 22 to May 5, 2020). These users first completed a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) conducted by the virtual agent. If the users were positive for insomnia complaints (ISI score >14), they were eligible to join the 2-stage intervention program: (1) complete an electronic sleep diary for 1 week and (2) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. We collected and analyzed the following measures: sociodemographic information, ISI scores and sleep/wake schedules, and acceptance and trust of the agent. RESULTS: Approximately 76% (1574/2069) of the app users completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by 27.4% (431/1574) of the users who answered the acceptance and trust questionnaires on its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened users who reported sleep complaints (ISI score >14), 166 (21.5%) followed Step 1 of the intervention, and only 47 of those (28.3%) followed Step 2. Users who completed Step 1 found that their insomnia complaints (baseline mean ISI score 18.56, mean ISI score after Step 1 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep quality improved significantly after 1 week. Users who completed Step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measures (baseline mean ISI score 18.87, mean ISI score after Step 2 14.68; P<.001). Users that were most severely affected (ISI score >21) did not respond to either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the KANOPEE app is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for individuals reporting moderately severe insomnia.","Philip, Pierre; Dupuy, Lucile; Morin, Charles M; de Sevin, Etienne; Bioulac, Stéphanie; Taillard, Jacques; Serre, Fuschia; Auriacombe, Marc; Micoulaud-Franchi, Jean-Arthur",J Med Internet Res,592,20

Evidence indicates the critical role of the vascular endothelium in its pathophysiology but, like potential changes in functional vasodilation, the vascular effect of SARS-CoV-2 at a given distance from the acute infection is largely unknown. We assessed brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in 27 COVID-19 patients needing conventional or intensive care unit hospitalization, three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and in nine age- and sex- matched control subjects. Interestingly, the FMD was lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to controls (8.2 (7.2–8.9) vs. 10.3 (9.1–11.7)); p = 0.002, and half of the hospitalized COVID-19 survivors presented with a reduced FMD < 8% at three months of COVID-19 onset. Impaired FMD was not associated with severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, reflected by ICU hospitalization, total hospitalization duration, or severity of lung damage. In conclusion, reduced FMD is often observed even three months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but such alteration predominantly appears to not be related to COVID-19 severity. Longer and larger follow-up studies will help to clarify the potential prognosis value of FMD among COVID-19 patients, as well as to further determine the mechanisms involved.","Riou, Marianne; Oulehri, Walid; Momas, Cedric; Rouyer, Olivier; Lebourg, Fabienne; Meyer, Alain; Enache, Irina; Pistea, Cristina; Charloux, Anne; Marcot, Christophe; de Blay, Frederic; Collange, Olivier; Mertes, Michel; Andrès, Emmanuel; Talha, Samy; Geny, Bernard",J Clin Med,592,28

Neutralizing antibodies can efficiently inhibit infection by cell-free virus but mostly fail to prevent cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we show that the ‘molecular tweezer’ CLR01, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, is not only highly active against infection with cell-free virus but most remarkably inhibits antibody-resistant direct cell-to-cell spread of HCMV. The inhibition of cell-to-cell spread by CLR01 was not limited to HCMV but was also shown for the alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1, -2). CLR01 is a rapid acting small molecule that inhibits HCMV entry at the attachment and penetration steps. Electron microscopy of extracellular virus particles indicated damage of the viral envelope by CLR01, which likely impairs the infectivity of virus particles. The rapid inactivation of viral particles by CLR01, the viral envelope as the main target, and the inhibition of virus entry at different stages are presumably the key to inhibition of cell-free virus infection and cell-to-cell spread by CLR01. Importance: While cell-free spread enables the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and other herpesviruses to transmit between hosts, direct cell-to-cell spread is thought to be more relevant for in vivo dissemination within infected tissues. Cell-to-cell spread is resistant to neutralizing antibodies, thus contributing to the maintenance of virus infection and virus dissemination in the presence of an intact immune system. Therefore, it would be therapeutically interesting to target this mode of spread in order to treat severe HCMV infections and to prevent dissemination of virus within the infected host. The molecular tweezer CLR01 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a number of enveloped viruses and efficiently blocks antibody-resistant cell-to-cell spread of HCMV, thus representing a novel class of small molecules with promising antiviral activity.","Brenner, Sina; Braun, Berenike; Read, Clarissa; Weil, Tatjana; Walther, Paul; Schrader, Thomas; Münch, Jan; von Einem, Jens",Viruses,592,16

In Belgium, the authorities implemented a nation-wide stay-at-home order for several months. Evidence of the mental health effect of such measures is scarce. A recent review by Brooks et al. has compiled a defined list of stressors affecting people’s mental health under quarantine during previous epidemic settings. This study aims to test the association between these stressors and the mental health of students attending higher education during the stay-at-home order in Belgium. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 18,301 students from 13 higher education institutions (HEI) participated in an online survey between 26 April and 11 May 2020. We assessed the association between potential stressors and depressive symptoms severity scores and structural equation modeling was used to assess how stressors may mediate the association between duration of exposure and depressive symptoms severity. RESULTS: The stressors proposed by Brooks et al. were found to be associated with depressive symptoms severity. The stressors ‘perceived academic stress’, ‘institutional dissatisfaction’ and ‘fear of being infected’ were associated with substantially higher depressive symptoms severity scores. The association between duration of exposure and depressive symptoms severity was mediated by ‘academic stress’. Being in a steady relationship and living together with others were both associated with a lower depressive symptoms severity. CONCLUSION: Findings underline the need for a student-centered approach and mental health prevention. Authorities and HEIs should consider whether and if so, how a stay-at-home order should be implemented.

Only three RVA strains have been reported in bats in Kenya (straw-colored fruit bat) and in China (lesser horseshoe and a stoliczka’s trident bat), being highly divergent from each other. To further elucidate the potential of bat RVAs to cause gastroenteritis in humans we started by investigating the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using metagenomics. Five samples contained significant numbers of RVA Illumina reads, sufficient to obtain their (near) complete genomes. A single RVA strain showed a close phylogenetic relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain in six gene segments, including VP7 (G25), whereas the other gene segments represented novel genotypes as ratified by the RCWG. The 4 other RVA strains were highly divergent from known strains (but very similar among each other) possessing all novel genotypes. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed a significant variability representing multiple novel G and P genotypes, indicating the frequent occurrence of reassortment events. Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that several of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel VP6 based screening primers matching both human and bat RVAs were developed and used to screen samples from 25 infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population. Although RVA infections were identified in 36% of the infants, Sanger sequencing did not indicate evidence of interspecies transmissions. This study identified multiple novel bat RVA strains, but further epidemiological studies in humans will have to assess if these viruses have the potential to cause gastroenteritis in humans.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Zeller, Mark; Conceição-Neto, Nádia; Maes, Piet; Deboutte, Ward; Beller, Leen; Heylen, Elisabeth; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Ranst, Marc Van; Matthijnssens, Jelle",bioRxiv,592,22

Methods Using the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 Research Registry (CCCRR), we performed a propensity score matching for treatment with INCS prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection (April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021). Of the 82,096 individuals who tested positive, 72,147 met inclusion criteria. Our endpoints included need for hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or in-hospital mortality. Results Of the 12,608 (17.5%) who were hospitalized, 2,935 (4.1%) required ICU admission and 1,880 (2.6%) died during hospitalization. A significant proportion (n=10,187; 14.1%) were utilizing INCS prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to non-users, INCS users demonstrated lower risk for hospitalization (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.78 [0.72; 0.85]), ICU admission (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.77 [0.65; 0.92]) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.61; 0.94]). These findings were replicated in sensitivity analyses where patients on inhaled corticosteroids, and those with allergic rhinitis were excluded. The beneficial effect of INCS was significant after adjustment for baseline blood eosinophil count (measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing) in a subset of 30,289 individuals. Conclusion INCS therapy is associated with a lower risk for COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. Future randomized control trials are needed to determine if INCS reduces the risk for severe outcomes related to COVID-19.","Strauss, Ronald; Jawhari, Nesreen; Attaway, Amy H.; Hu, Bo; Jehi, Lara; Milinovich, Alex; Ortega, Victor E.; Zein, Joe G.",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,592,10

The aim is to share our experiences and outcomes during the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the strategies recommended and strategies we have implemented. METHODS: Our experience comes from our work at a referral hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Changes to clinical practice have largely been guided by the current evidence and four main principles: (1) patient and health-care worker protection, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) conservation of health-care resources, (4) uninterrupted formation for residents. Based on these principles, changes in the service organization, elective clinical visits, emergency visits, surgical procedures, and inpatient and outpatient care were made. RESULTS: Using the guidance of experts, we were able to help the hospital address the demands of the Covid-19 outbreak. We reduced to a third of our orthopaedics and trauma hospital beds, provided coverage for general emergency services, and five ICUs, all continuing to provide care for our patients, in the form of 102 trauma surgeries, 6413 phone interviews and 520 emergency clinic visits. Also in the third week, we were able to restart morning meetings via telematics, and teaching sessions for our residents. On the other hand, eight of the healthcare personnel on our service (10.8%) became infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: As priorities and resources increasingly shift towards the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain the high standard and quality of care necessary for trauma and orthopaedics patients while the pandemic persists. We must be prepared to organize our healthcare workers in such a way that the needs of both inpatients and outpatients are met. It is still possible to operate on those patients who need it. Unfortunately, some healthcare workers will become infected. It is essential that we protect those most susceptible to severer consequences of Covid-19.

All studies reviewed one or more social determinant of health listed by WHO, or factors affecting the decision-making process whether to accept influenza vaccine or not. RESULTS: Overall, 44 studies were included, 41 determinants were extracted and summarized into six categories. Older age and constitutional factors including multiple chronic diseases as well as preventive lifestyle and frequent routine healthcare utilization positively affected vaccination uptake (VU). Living and working conditions are also researched determinants of influenza vaccine uptake. A small number of studies explored the role of social inclusion and system-based interventions. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This scope review provides a comprehensive overview on factors affecting seasonal influenza vaccination uptake among older citizens. The review also clearly shows gaps for evidence on system-based level or political strategies to improve vaccination uptake.

Here, we instead use satellite observations together with bottom-up information to track the daily dynamics of CO(2) emissions during the pandemic. Unlike activity data, our observation-based analysis deploys independent measurement of pollutant concentrations in the atmosphere to correct misrepresentation in the bottom-up data and can provide more detailed insights into spatially explicit changes. Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO(2) to deduce 10-day moving averages of NO(x) and CO(2) emissions over China, differentiating emissions by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China’s CO(2) emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels before the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of January 2020 owing to the fast economic recovery in provinces where industrial activity is concentrated.","Zheng, Bo; Geng, Guannan; Ciais, Philippe; Davis, Steven J.; Martin, Randall V.; Meng, Jun; Wu, Nana; Chevallier, Frederic; Broquet, Gregoire; Boersma, Folkert; van der A, Ronald; Lin, Jintai; Guan, Dabo; Lei, Yu; He, Kebin; Zhang, Qiang",Sci Adv,592,1

Metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota is paramount for the characterization of human health and wellbeing. Despite the intensive research, there is a huge gap and inconsistency between different studies due to the non-standardised and biased pipeline. Methodical and systemic understanding of every stage in the process is necessary to overcome all bottlenecks and grey zones of gut microbiota studies, where all details and interactions between processes are important. RESULTS: Here we show that an inexpensive, but reliable iSeq 100 platform is an excellent tool to perform the analysis of the human gut microbiota by amplicon sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. Two commercial DNA extraction kits and different starting materials performed similarly regarding the taxonomic distribution of identified bacteria. DNA/RNA Shield reagent proved to be a reliable solution for stool samples collection, preservation, and storage, as the storage of faecal material in DNA/RNA Shield for three weeks at different temperatures and thawing cycles had a low impact on the bacterial distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, a thoroughly elaborated pipeline with close attention to details ensures high reproducibility with significant biological but not technical variations.

Among those persons with serious COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and often fatal presentation. Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that manifest severe disease are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 induced ARDS and evaluate therapeutic strategies. Here we report ARDS in two aged African green monkeys (AGMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrated pathological lesions and disease similar to severe COVID-19 in humans. We also report a comparatively mild COVID-19 phenotype characterized by minor clinical, radiographic and histopathologic changes in the two surviving, aged AGMs and four rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found dramatic increases in circulating cytokines in three of four infected, aged AGMs but not in infected RMs. All of the AGMs showed increased levels of plasma IL-6 compared to baseline, a predictive marker and presumptive therapeutic target in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our results show that both RM and AGM are capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that aged AGMs may be useful for modeling severe disease manifestations including ARDS.","Blair, Robert V.; Vaccari, Monica; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A.; Roy, Chad J.; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Fahlberg, Marissa; Monjure, Chris J.; Beddingfield, Brandon; Plante, Kenneth S.; Plante, Jessica A.; Weaver, Scott C.; Qin, Xuebin; Midkiff, Cecily C.; Lehmicke, Gabrielle; Golden, Nadia; Threeton, Breanna; Penney, Toni; Allers, Carolina; Barnes, Mary B.; Pattison, Melissa; Datta, Prasun K.; Maness, Nicholas J.; Birnbaum, Angela; Fischer, Tracy; Bohm, Rudolf P.; Rappaport, Jay",Am J Pathol,592,24

By means of a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore how the heterogeneity of the infection rate affects the epidemic dynamics, and find that large fluctuations of the infection rate have a profound impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold.

The increase in face mask consumption has brought focus to their environmental impact. To keep up with the increased demand for face masks, different variations of reusable face masks such as the embedded filtration layer (EFL) reusable face mask have emerged in the market. This study quantifies the environmental impact of the EFL reusable face mask and the single-use surgical face mask. METHODS: The life cycle assessment (LCA) study of the entire value chain from cradle-to-grave is applied to each face mask. Both face masks are evaluated over 1 functional unit (FU) of 31 12-h days for a single person. The ReCiPe method with the Hierachist perspective was applied. A total of nine impact categories as well as the generated waste of each face mask are evaluated. RESULTS: The results show that for 1 functional unit, the use of single-use surgical face mask and EFL reusable face mask will contribute 0.580 kg CO(2)-eq and 0.338 kg CO(2)-eq to climate change and generate 0.004 kg and 0.0004 kg of waste respectively. CONCLUSION: Comparing both face masks, the EFL reusable face mask will have a lower emission of at least 30% in terms of the generated waste and the impact categories considered, except for water depletion, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and human toxicity.","Lee, Amos Wei Lun; Neo, Edward Ren Kai; Khoo, Zi-Yu; Yeo, Zhiquan; Tan, Yee Shee; Chng, Shuyun; Yan, Wenjin; Lok, Boon Keng; Low, Jonathan Sze Choong",Resour Conserv Recycl,592,28

It can cause sepsis and septic shock leading to high morbidity, mortality, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this case-control study is to identify the risk factors associated with the nBSI development in COVID-19 hospitalised patients and its incidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A retrospective case-control study will be performed. Cases will include nBSI episodes of adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Barcelona, Spain, from April to December 2020 with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Patients transferred from other hospitals will be excluded. Controls will include hospitalisation episodes of COVID-19 patients without nBSI. We will recruit a minimum of 74 nBSI episodes (cases) and 74 controls (according to sample size calculation). We will collect data on sociodemographics, clinical status at admission, hospital admission, in-hospital mortality, and exposure data (use of antivirals, glucocorticoids or immunomodulatory agents, length of hospitalisation, and use of medical devices such as intravenous catheters). A bivariate and a subsequent multivariate regression analysis will be performed to assess the independent effect of the associated risk factors after adjusting for confounders. The nBSI incidence rate will be estimated according to the number of nBSI episodes in admitted COVID-19 patients among the total person-month of follow-up.

Michigan has been one of the top states affected by COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We describe the emergency center curbside testing procedure implemented at Beaumont Hospital, a large hospital in Royal Oak, MI, and aim to evaluate its safety and efficiency. METHODS: Anticipating a surge in patients requiring testing, Beaumont Health implemented curbside testing, operated by a multidisciplinary team of health care workers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, residents, nurses, technicians, and registration staff. We report on the following outcomes over a period of 26 days (March 12, 2020, to April 6, 2020): time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records, overall screening time, and emergency center return evaluations. RESULTS: In total, 2782 patients received curbside services. A nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 1176 patients (41%), out of whom 348 (29.6%) tested positive. The median time for the entire process (from registration to discharge) was 28 minutes (IQR 17-44). The median time to final medical decision was 15 minutes (IQR 8-27). The median time from medical decision to discharge was 9 minutes (IQR 5-16). Only 257 patients (9.2%) returned to the emergency center for an evaluation within 7 or more days, of whom 64 were admitted to the hospital, 11 remained admitted, and 4 expired.

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 °C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 °C (3.7 min), 80 °C (2.4 min), and 90 °C (2.3 min) compared with 60 °C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 °C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.","Trudeau, Michaela P.; Verma, Harsha; Urriola, Pedro E.; Sampedro, Fernando; Shurson, Gerald C.; Goyal, Sagar M.",Porcine Health Manag,592,24

In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management. This work aimed at studying different MSW management strategies, specific challenges, and possible solutions for better understanding for those involved in waste management, in addition to providing a possible management strategy during and post-COVID-19 pandemic.

Purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients in predicting clinical course and outcome. METHODS: We analyzed lung ultrasound score (LUS) of all COVID-19 patients admitted from March 2020 to December 2020 to the Internal Intensive Care Unit, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) of Munich. LU was performed according to a standardized protocol at ICU admission and in case of clinical deterioration with the need for intubation. A normal lung scores 0 points, the worst LUS has 24 points. Patients were stratified in a low (0–12 points) and a high (13–24 points) lung ultrasound score group. RESULTS: The study included 42 patients, 69% of them male. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (81%) and obesity (57%). The values of pH (7.42 ± 0.09 vs 7.35 ± 0.1; p = 0.047) and p(a)O(2) (107 [80–130] vs 80 [66–93] mmHg; p = 0.034) were significantly reduced in patients of the high LUS group. Furthermore, the duration of ventilation (12.5 [8.3–25] vs 36.5 [9.8–70] days; p = 0.029) was significantly prolonged in this group. Patchy subpleural thickening (n = 38; 90.5%) and subpleural consolidations (n = 23; 54.8%) were present in most patients. Pleural effusion was rare (n = 4; 9.5%). The median total LUS was 11.9 ± 3.9 points. In case of clinical deterioration with the need for intubation, LUS worsened significantly compared to baseline LU. Twelve patients died during the ICU stay (29%). There was no difference in survival in both LUS groups (75% vs 66.7%, p = 0.559). CONCLUSIONS: LU can be a useful monitoring tool to predict clinical course but not outcome of COVID-19 ICU patients and can early recognize possible deteriorations.

We sought to understand the association of preinfection daily oral anticoagulation use and the short-term mortality of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Large health system with high coronavirus disease 2019 prevalence. PATIENTS: Patients 60 years or older admitted to the hospital with positive coronavirus disease 2019 polymerase chain reaction test. INTERVENTIONS: We compared both those on warfarin and those on a direct oral anticoagulant prior to admission and throughout disease course with those who were never exposed to an oral anticoagulant. RESULTS: Our primary outcome was inhospital mortality at 21 days from the first coronavirus disease 2019 test ordered. Patients in the direct oral anticoagulant group (n = 104) were found to have significantly lower 21-day all-cause in hospital mortality than patients in the control group (n = 894) both prior to adjustment (14.4% vs 23.8%; odds ratio, 0.57 [0.29–0.92]; p = 0.03) and after controlling for age, gender, and comorbidities (odds ratio, 0.44 [0.20–0.90]; p = 0.033). Patients on warfarin (n = 28) were found to have an elevated unadjusted mortality rate of 32% versus 23.8% in the control group (odds ratio, 1.51 [0.64–3.31]; p = 0.31). After adjustment, a reduction in mortality was observed but not found to be statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.29 [0.02–1.62]; p = 0.24). There was no statistical difference noted in the number of bleeding events in each group. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study evaluating oral anticoagulant use among patients with coronavirus disease 2019, we found that patients who are on daily oral anticoagulation at the time of infection and throughout their disease course had significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality at 21 days. Validation of these findings should be performed on population-based levels. While research regarding anticoagulation algorithms is ongoing, we believe these results support future randomized control trials to understand the efficacy and risk of the use of early oral anticoagulation.","Harrison, Raquel F.; Forte, Kenneth; Buscher, Michael G.; Chess, Adam; Patel, Amitkumar; Moylan, Tatiana; Mize, Charles Haviland; Werdmann, Michael; Ferrigno, Rockman",Crit Care Explor,592,16

We investigated whether oral administration of maternal vaginal microbiota to infants born by CS could restore their gut microbiome development in a pilot single-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618000339257). METHODS: Pregnant women scheduled for a CS underwent comprehensive antenatal pathogen screening. At birth, healthy neonates were randomised to receive a 3 ml solution of either maternal vaginal microbes (CS-seeded, n = 12) or sterile water (CS-placebo, n = 13). Vaginally-born neonates were used as the reference control (VB, n = 22). Clinical assessments occurred within the first 2 h of birth, and at 1 month and 3 months of age. Infant stool samples and maternal vaginal extracts from CS women underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition at 1 month of age. Secondary outcomes included maternal strain engraftment, functional potential of the gut microbiome, anthropometry, body composition, and adverse events. FINDINGS: Despite the presence of viable microbial cells within transplant solutions, there were no observed differences in gut microbiome composition or functional potential between CS-seeded and CS-placebo infants at 1 month or 3 months of age. Both CS groups displayed the characteristic signature of low Bacteroides abundance, which contributed to a number of biosynthesis pathways being underrepresented when compared with VB microbiomes. Maternal vaginal strain engraftment was rare. Vaginal seeding had no observed effects on anthropometry or body composition. There were no serious adverse events associated with treatment. INTERPRETATION: Our pilot findings question the value of vaginal seeding given that oral administration of maternal vaginal microbiota did not alter early gut microbiome development in CS-born infants. The limited colonisation of maternal vaginal strains suggest that other maternal sources, such as the perianal area, may play a larger role in seeding the neonatal gut microbiome.

For this purpose, we investigated molecular interactions between the target spike protein, receptor-binding domain of the virus, and the common functional monomers used in molecular imprinting by a plethora of computational analyses; sequence analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results demonstrated that AMPS and IA monomers gave promising results on the SARS-CoV-2 specific TEIYQAGST sequence for further analysis. Therefore, we propose an epitope approach-based synthesis route for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by using AMPS and IA as functional monomers and the peptide fragment of the TEIYQAGST sequence as a template molecule.","Cubuk, Hasan; Ozbil, Mehmet; Cakir Hatir, Pinar",Comput Theor Chem,592,22

Widespread public use of these items has imposed pressure on municipalities to properly collect and dispose of potentially infectious PPE. There has been a lack of structured monitoring efforts to quantify the emerging trend of improperly disposed of PPE debris. In this study, we present a baseline monitoring survey to describe the spatial distribution of PPE debris during the COVID-19 pandemic from the metropolitan city of Toronto, Canada. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify PPE debris types among surveyed areas and; (2) identify PPE debris densities and accumulation of surveyed areas. A total of 1306 PPE debris items were documented, with the majority being disposable gloves (44%), followed by face masks (31%), and disinfecting wipes (25%). Of the face masks, 97% were designed for single use while only 3% were reusable. Of the surveyed locations, the highest daily average densities of PPE debris were recorded in the large and medium-sized grocery store parking lots and the hospital district (0.00475 items/m(2), 0.00160 items/m(2), and 0.00133 items/m(2) respectively). The two surveyed residential areas had the following highest PPE densities (0.00029 items/m(2) and 0.00027 items/m(2)), while the recreational trail had the lowest densities (0.00020 items/m(2)). Assuming a business-as-usual accumulation, an estimated 14,298 PPE items will be leaked as debris in just the surveyed areas annually. To facilitate proper disposal of PPE debris by the public we recommend development of municipal efforts to improve PPE collection methods that are informed by the described PPE waste pathways.","Ammendolia, Justine; Saturno, Jacquelyn; Brooks, Amy L.; Jacobs, Shoshanah; Jambeck, Jenna R.",Environ Pollut,592,1

As a result many private schools with an ongoing term shifted to remote teaching. This phenomenological case study explored some issues which were faced by parents and learners of primary level students during synchronous teaching. Observation was carried out for a period of 13 days on 2 primary school students of a private international school of Malaysia. Observation was followed by interviews with the same participants, where their views and reflections regarding synchronous teaching were recorded. This data was further supplemented with brief interviews with parents, whose children were also in the primary level of the same school. Nvivo 12 was used for analysis. Following Saldana's coding (2016), elemental coding methods were used, employing structural, descriptive, and in vivo coding. 62 nodes emerged during the first cycle coding process which were placed under 10 categories in the final analysis process. Results showed that parents' continuous supervision and guidance was needed in addition to the teacher's mentoring and direction when teaching online. Furthermore, data showed that one of the problems in remote teaching is lack of developing social skills of the learners as they cannot interact with their classmates in 'real-time'. Synchronous teaching increases learners' screen time which was not liked by parents. Interviews revealed that students also preferred in-class, face-to-face learning over synchronous learning. Though importance of remote teaching in this hour of crisis cannot be denied, this study concludes that implementing 100% online teaching for primary students is still at its rudimentary phase of effectiveness. This research holds high significance in opening up new perspective for educators and policy makers on how to effectively plan for online teaching in future.","Jan, Anbareen",Social sciences & humanities open,592,21

We develop the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants, like B.1.1.7, the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, supporting the public health relevance of this lineage.","West, Anthony P.; Wertheim, Joel O.; Wang, Jade C.; Vasylyeva, Tetyana I.; Havens, Jennifer L.; Chowdhury, Moinuddin A.; Gonzalez, Edimarlyn; Fang, Courtney E.; Di Lonardo, Steve S.; Hughes, Scott; Rakeman, Jennifer L.; Lee, Henry H.; Barnes, Christopher O.; Gnanapragasam, Priyanthi N.

However, imaging findings in ferrets with lymphoma have primarily been described in single case reports. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe imaging findings in a group of ferrets with confirmed lymphoma. Medical records were searched between 2002 and 2012. A total of 14 ferrets were included. Radiographs (n = 12), ultrasound (n = 14), computed tomography (CT; n = 1), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n = 1) images were available for review. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 5.2 years (range 3.25–7.6 years). Clinical signs were predominantly nonspecific (8/14). The time between the first imaging study and lymphoma diagnosis was 1 day or less in most ferrets (12). Imaging lesions were predominantly detected in the abdomen, and most frequently included intra‐abdominal lymphadenopathy (12/14), splenomegaly (8/14), and peritoneal effusion (11/14). Lymphadenopathy and mass lesions were typically hypoechoic on ultrasound. Mild peritoneal effusion was the only detected abnormality in two ferrets. Mild pleural effusion was the most common thoracic abnormality (3/12). Expansile lytic lesions were present in the vertebrae of two ferrets with T3‐L3 myelopathy and the femur in a ferret with lameness. Hyperattenuating, enhancing masses with secondary spinal cord compression were associated with vertebral lysis in CT images of one ferret. The MRI study in one ferret with myelopathy was inconclusive. Findings indicated that imaging characteristics of lymphoma in ferrets are similar to those previously reported in dogs, cats, and humans.","Suran, Jantra Ngosuwan; Wyre, Nicole Rene",Vet Radiol Ultrasound,592,1

After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.","Basso, Maria Alexandra; Marques, Cátia; Santos, Marcos; Duarte, Ana; Pissarra, Hugo; Carreira, L Miguel; Gomes, Lídia; Valério-Bolas, Ana; Tavares, Luís; Santos-Gomes, Gabriela; Pereira da Fonseca, Isabel",JFMS Open Rep,592,28

This study surveyed 3275 Chinese parents’ beliefs and attitudes around young children’s online learning during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most parents (92.7%) in the study reported that their children had online learning experiences during the pandemic, and many (84.6%) spent less than a half-hour each time. The parents generally had negative beliefs about the values and benefits of online learning and preferred traditional learning in early childhood settings. They tended to resist and even reject online learning for three key reasons: the shortcomings of online learning, young children’s inadequate self-regulation, and their lack of time and professional knowledge in supporting children’s online learning. Also, the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made them suffering, thus more resistant to online learning at home. The results suggested that the implementation of online learning during the pandemic has been problematic and challenging for families.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of WUPyV and KIPyV-associated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) hospitalization in HIV-infected and -uninfected children; and probe the role of pneumococcal co-infection. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from a cohort of 39,836 children randomized to receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or placebo when hospitalized for LRTIs, and were screened by PCR for WUPyV, KIPyV and other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: In placebo-recipients the prevalence of WUPyV was 6.3% (18/285) in HIV-infected and 13.9% (66/476) in HIV-uninfected children (p = 0.002). In WUPyV-positive LRTIs HIV-infected children had lower oxygen saturation at admission and a higher case fatality rate (11.1% vs. 0%; p = 0.04).

SARS caused the first epidemic alert at the beginning of this century, followed by MERS. COVID-19 appeared to be highly contagious, with human-to-human transmission by aerosol droplets, and reached nearly all countries around the world. A plethora of studies were performed, with reports being published within a short period of time by scientists and medical physicians. It has been difficult to find the relevant data to create an overview of the situation according to studies from accumulated findings and reports. In the present study we aimed to perform a comprehensive study in the context of the case fatality ratios (CFRs) of three major human Coronavirus outbreaks which occurred during the first twenty years of 21st century. METHODS: In this study, we performed meta-analyses on SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreak events from publicly available records. Study analyses were performed with the help of highly reputable scientific databases such as PubMed, WOS and Scopus to evaluate and present current knowledge on zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks, starting from 2000 to the end of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 250,194 research studies and records were identified with specific keywords and synonyms for the three viruses in order to cover all publications. In the end, 41 records were selected and included after applying several exclusion and inclusion criteria on identified datasets. SARS was found to have a nearly 11% case fatality ratio (CFR), which means the estimated number of deaths as a proportion of confirmed positive cases; Taiwan was the country most affected by the SARS outbreak based on the CFR analysis. MERS had CFRs of 35.8 and 26 in Saudi Arabia during the 2012 and 2015 outbreaks, respectively. COVID-19 resulted in a 2.2 CFR globally, and the USA reported the highest mortality ratio in the world in the end of first year of COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Some members of the Coronaviridae family can cause highly contagious and devastating infections among humans. Within the last two decades, the whole world has witnessed several deadly emerging infectious diseases, which are most commonly zoonotic in nature. We conclude that pre-existing immunity during the early stages of a pandemic might be important, but case control and management strategies should be improved to decrease CFRs. Finally, we have addressed several concerns in relation to outbreak events in this study.","Berber, Engin; Sumbria, Deepak; Çanakoğlu, Nurettin",J Infect Public Health,592,1

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken. The consent and questionnaire were hosted on SmartSurveyUK. The survey was advertised widely by Cystic Fibrosis Ireland to the CF community via CF website, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and through WhatsApp groups during September/October 2020. Results: 118 PWCF responded and 56 (47.5%) indicated a deferral of hospital visits for CF care. The period of delay ranged from 1 to 6 months, with 57.4% to three months and 42.6% to over 6 months. Key reasons for deferral amongst those who deferred (n = 56) were fear of infection from coronavirus (69.8%) and hospital unit closed (11.5%). Amongst PWCF who deferred, deferrals impacted rehabilitation therapies (n = 25%), medical care at hospital (n = 65.6%), surgery (n = 6.3%), and appointment with GP (n = 34.4%). More respondents aged 35 and over had to cancel/postpone diagnostic tests compared to those <35 years (64% vs 36%: NS). Non-significantly greater proportions of females postponed therapy and tests.

Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged ≥18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. RESULTS: Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020.

Due to the current global emergency and the length of time required to develop specific antiviral agent(s) and a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the world health organization (WHO) adopted the strategy of repurposing existing medications to treat COVID-19. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were previously approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) for anemia treatment and studies have also demonstrated its antiviral activity in vitro. Therefore, we performed a docking study to explore the interaction of IONPs (Fe(2)O(3) and Fe(3)O(4)) with the spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is required for virus attachment to the host cell receptors. A similar docking analysis was also performed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins E1 and E2. These studies revealed that both Fe(2)O(3) and Fe(3)O(4) interacted efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD and to HCV glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Fe(3)O(4) formed a more stable complex with S1-RBD whereas Fe(2)O(3) favored HCV E1 and E2. These interactions of IONPs are expected to be associated with viral proteins conformational changes and hence, viral inactivation. Therefore, we recommend FDA-approved-IONPs to proceed for COVID-19 treatment clinical trials.","Abo-zeid, Yasmin; Ismail, Nasser.S.; McLean, Gary.R.; Hamdy, Nadia.M.",Eur J Pharm Sci,592,4

This study showed a high prevalence of rotavirus in both groups with no significant difference between the two. No significant differences regarding G, P and G/P rotavirus genotype distribution between the two groups were observed, with G6, P[5] and G6P[5] genotypes being by far the most prevalent. Moreover, sequence analyses of the VP7 and VP4 partial coding genes of the G6P[5] strains from this study did not allow us to distinguish them according to their origin. This study also showed that other pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea, such as genogroup III noroviruses and neboviruses, were not more frequently associated with calf diarrhoea in vaccinated herds.

In the group of children aged 11–13 years, this parameter was 22.64 mL·kg(−1)·min(−1).

We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2% were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30% of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years.","Xiao, Ai Tang; Tong, Yi Xin; Gao, Chun; Zhu, Li; Zhang, Yu Jie; Zhang, Sheng",J Clin Virol,592,18

This report summarizes deliberations of the workshop, as well as follow-up discussion in the wake of the current pandemic. Three topics were addressed: A) the need to optimize human chemosensory testing and assessment, B) the plasticity of chemosensory systems, and C) the interplay of chemosensory signals, cognitive signals, dietary intake, and metabolism. Several ways to advance sensory nutrition research emerged from the workshop: 1) refining methods to measure chemosensation in large cohort studies and validating measures that reflect perception of complex chemosensations relevant to dietary choice; 2) characterizing interindividual differences in chemosensory function and how they affect ingestive behaviors, health, and disease risk; 3) defining circuit-level organization and function that link and interact with gustatory, olfactory, homeostatic, visceral, and cognitive systems; and 4) discovering new ligands for chemosensory receptors (e.g., those produced by the microbiome) and cataloging cell types expressing these receptors. Several of these priorities were made more urgent by the current pandemic because infection with sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing coronavirus disease of 2019 has direct short- and perhaps long-term effects on flavor perception. There is increasing evidence of functional interactions between the chemosensory and nutritional sciences. Better characterization of this interface is expected to yield insights to promote health, mitigate disease risk, and guide nutrition policy.","Reed, Danielle R; Alhadeff, Amber L; Beauchamp, Gary K; Chaudhari, Nirupa; Duffy, Valerie B; Dus, Monica; Fontanini, Alfredo; Glendinning, John I; Green, Barry G; Joseph, Paule V; Kyriazis, George A; Lyte, Mark; Maruvada, Padma; McGann, John P; McLaughlin, John T; Moran, Timothy H; Murphy, Claire; Noble, Emily E; Pepino, M Yanina; Pluznick, Jennifer L; Rother, Kristina I; Saez, Enrique; Spector, Alan C; Sternini, Catia; Mattes, Richard D",Am J Clin Nutr,592,11

Here, we use a simple, cheap and rapid whole blood stimulation assay - an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) - to study T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients and in unexposed healthy contacts from Quito, Ecuador. Methods Interferon-gamma (INF-γ) production was measured in the heparinized blood of convalescent and unexposed subjects after stimulation for 24 hours with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) protein or the Nucleocapsid (NP) protein, respectively. The presence of IgG- RBD protein antibodies in both study groups was determined with an “in-house” ELISA. Results As measured with INF-γ production, 80% of the convalescent COVID-19 patients, all IgG-RBD seropositive, had a strong T-cell response. However, unexpectedly, 44% of healthy unexposed healthy controls, all IgG-RBD seronegative, had a strong virus-specific T-cell response with the COVID-19 IGRA, probably because of prior exposure to common cold-causing coronaviruses or other viral or microbial antigens. Conclusion and Discussion The high percentage of unexposed healthy subjects with a pre-existing immunity suggests that a part of the Ecuadorian population is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells. Given that the IGRA technique is simple, and can be easily scaled up for investigations where high numbers of patients are needed, this COVID-19 IGRA may serve to determine if the T-cell only response represents protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based study.","Echeverría, Gustavo; Guevara, Ángel; Coloma, Josefina; Ruiz, Alison Mera; Vasquez, María Mercedes; Tejera, Eduardo; de Waard, Jacobus H.",Int J Infect Dis,592,1

Smart health systems can help with remote symptom monitoring and management, but they must be designed with meaningful end-user input. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the experience of managing cancer pain at home from the perspective of both patients and family caregivers to inform design of the Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Cancer (BESI-C) smart health system. METHODS: This was a descriptive pilot study using a multimethod approach. Dyads of patients with cancer and difficult pain and their primary family caregivers were recruited from an outpatient oncology clinic. The participant interviews consisted of (1) open-ended questions to explore the overall experience of cancer pain at home, (2) ranking of variables on a Likert-type scale (0, no impact; 5, most impact) that may influence cancer pain at home, and (3) feedback regarding BESI-C system prototypes. Qualitative data were analyzed using a descriptive approach to identity patterns and key themes. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS; basic descriptive statistics and independent sample t tests were run. RESULTS: Our sample (n=22; 10 patient-caregiver dyads and 2 patients) uniformly described the experience of managing cancer pain at home as stressful and difficult. Key themes included (1) unpredictability of pain episodes; (2) impact of pain on daily life, especially the negative impact on sleep, activity, and social interactions; and (3) concerns regarding medications. Overall, taking pain medication was rated as the category with the highest impact on a patient’s pain ([Image: see text] =4.79), followed by the categories of wellness ([Image: see text] =3.60; sleep quality and quantity, physical activity, mood and oral intake) and interaction ([Image: see text] =2.69; busyness of home, social or interpersonal interactions, physical closeness or proximity to others, and emotional closeness and connection to others). The category related to environmental factors (temperature, humidity, noise, and light) was rated with the lowest overall impact ([Image: see text] =2.51). Patients and family caregivers expressed receptivity to the concept of BESI-C and reported a preference for using a wearable sensor (smart watch) to capture data related to the abrupt onset of difficult cancer pain. CONCLUSIONS: Smart health systems to support cancer pain management should (1) account for the experience of both the patient and the caregiver, (2) prioritize passive monitoring of physiological and environmental variables to reduce burden, and (3) include functionality that can monitor and track medication intake and efficacy; wellness variables, such as sleep quality and quantity, physical activity, mood, and oral intake; and levels of social interaction and engagement.

Climate hazards, social and economic impacts from climate-related hazards, and sector-specific worker and workplace impacts from climate-related hazards were described as having interacting relationships that influenced worker health and safety impacts. KIs further described how workplace controls could be used to mitigate OHS impacts of climate-related hazards, and how training of the OHS workforce could influence the ability to successfully implement such controls. Our findings suggest that OHS impacts are sector-specific, influenced by social and economic factors, and can be mitigated through workplace controls designed and implemented by a trained OHS workforce. The findings from this work should inform future educational and training programming and additional research and translation activities in the region, while our approach can inform other regions as they develop regionally specific OHS climate change training and programming.","Pedersen, Katherine M.; Busch Isaksen, Tania M.; Baker, Marissa G.; Seixas, Noah; Errett, Nicole A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,592,26

Reliable and accessible sources of web-based health information are critical for cultivating patient-centered care. However, the accessibility and use of web-based health information remains largely unknown for deaf individuals. We used gaze-tracking technology to understand the navigation and use of web-based health information by deaf adults who communicate with sign language and by hearing adults. OBJECTIVE: This paper discusses our protocol for implementing gaze-tracking technology in a study that included both deaf and hearing participants. We report the preliminary results and lessons learned from the implementation of the protocol. METHODS: We conducted gaze-tracking sessions with 450 deaf signers and 450 hearing participants as a part of a larger, multisite mixed methods research study. Then, we conducted qualitative elicitation interviews with a subsample of 21 deaf and 13 hearing participants, who engaged in a search task and reviewed their gaze recordings. To our knowledge, no study has implemented a similar research protocol to better understand the experiences of deaf adults. As such, we also examined research staff notes and observations from team meetings regarding the conduct of gaze-tracking data to delineate lessons learned and best practices for research protocols in this area. RESULTS: Findings from the implementation of this study protocol highlight the use of gaze technology with deaf participants. We developed additional protocol steps to minimize gaze disruption from either lipreading or communicating in sign language. For example, research assistants were often unable to maintain eye contact with participants while signing because of the need to simultaneously point at the computer monitor to provide instructions related to gaze study components, such as the calibration process. In addition to developing ways to effectively provide instructions in American Sign Language, a practice exercise was included in the gaze tracker session to familiarize participants with the computer and technology. The use of the playback feature permitted a deeper dialogue between researchers and participants, which we found vital for understanding the experiences of deaf participants. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our experience using the study protocol through a large research project, incorporating gaze-tracking technology offers beneficial avenues for better understanding how individuals interact with health information. Gaze tracking can determine the type and placement of visual content that attracts attention from the viewers of diverse backgrounds, including deaf individuals. The lessons learned through this study will help future researchers in determining ideal study designs, such as suitable protocols and participant characteristics (eg, deaf signers), while including gaze trackers in their projects. This approach explored how different ways of presenting health information can affect or enable visual learners to engage and use health information effectively.

The present study examined whether text easiness affects non-experts’ evaluation of scientific claims even if they possess prior beliefs about the accuracy of these claims. Undergraduates who strongly believed that climate change is anthropogenic read argumentative texts that were either easy or difficult to understand and that supported a claim either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs.

One potential explanation for the mixed findings is the truncated search hypothesis, which states that not all delayed JOLs lead to a full-blown covert retrieval attempt. In three paired-associate learning experiments, we examined the effect of delayed JOLs on later recall by comparing them to conditions of restudy, overt retrieval, and various other delayed JOL conditions. In Experiment 1, after an initial study phase, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, or made cue-only or cue-target delayed JOLs. In Experiments 2a and 2b, where conditions were manipulated within-subjects, subjects either restudied word pairs, practiced overt retrieval, made cue-only delayed JOLs, made cue-only delayed JOLs followed by a yes/no retrieval question or, in another condition, by an overt retrieval prompt. The final cued recall tests were delayed by two days. In Experiment 1, recall after cue-only delayed JOLs did not reliably differ from recall after overt retrieval or restudy. In Experiments 2a and 2b, delayed JOLs consistently produced poorer recall relative to overt retrieval. Furthermore, reaction times for delayed JOLs were shorter relative to delayed JOLs paired with overt retrieval prompts. We conclude that only some delayed JOLs elicit covert retrieval attempts, a pattern supporting the truncated search hypothesis.

While the relaxation of these control measures has varied geographically, it is widely agreed that contact tracing efforts will play a major role in the successful reopening of businesses and schools. As the volume of positive cases has increased in the United States, it has become clear that there is room for digital health interventions to assist in contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile-friendly app designed to supplement manual COVID-19 contact tracing efforts on a university campus. Here, we present the results of a development and validation study centered around the use of the MyCOVIDKey app on the Vanderbilt University campus during the summer of 2020. METHODS: We performed a 6-week pilot study in the Stevenson Center Science and Engineering Complex on Vanderbilt University’s campus in Nashville, TN. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and staff >18 years who worked in Stevenson Center and had access to a mobile phone were eligible to register for a MyCOVIDKey account. All users were encouraged to complete regular self-assessments of COVID-19 risk and to key in to sites by scanning a location-specific barcode. RESULTS: Between June 17, 2020, and July 29, 2020, 45 unique participants created MyCOVIDKey accounts. These users performed 227 self-assessments and 1410 key-ins. Self-assessments were performed by 89% (n=40) of users, 71% (n=32) of users keyed in, and 48 unique locations (of 71 possible locations) were visited. Overall, 89% (202/227) of assessments were determined to be low risk (ie, asymptomatic with no known exposures), and these assessments yielded a CLEAR status. The remaining self-assessments received a status of NOT CLEAR, indicating either risk of exposure or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (7.5% [n=17] and 3.5% [n=8] of self-assessments indicated moderate and high risk, respectively). These 25 instances came from 8 unique users, and in 19 of these instances, the at-risk user keyed in to a location on campus. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing tools may be useful in assisting organizations to identify persons at risk of COVID-19 through contact tracing, or in locating places that may need to be cleaned or disinfected after being visited by an index case. Incentives to continue the use of such tools can improve uptake, and their continued usage increases utility to both organizational and public health efforts. Parameters of digital tools, including MyCOVIDKey, should ideally be optimized to supplement existing contact tracing efforts. These tools represent a critical addition to manual contact tracing efforts during reopening and sustained regular activity.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; Hardcastle, Austin N; Moore, Carson Paige; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,592,22

Methods We compared clinical and laboratory results from 719 influenza and 973 COVID-19 patients from January to April 2020. We compiled laboratory results from the first 14 days of the hospitalized patients using parameters that are most significantly different between COVID-19 and influenza and hierarchically clustered COVID-19 patients based on these data. The clinical outcomes were compared among different clusters. Results Temporal analyses of laboratory results revealed that compared to influenza, patients with COVID-19 exhibited a continued increase in the white blood cell count, rapid decline of hemoglobin, more rapid increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and D-dimer, and higher level of alanine transaminase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and fibrinogen. Using these results, we sub-classified the COVID-19 patients into 5 clusters through a hierarchical clustering analysis. We then reviewed the medical record of these patients and risk stratified them based on the clinical outcomes. The cluster with the highest risk showed 27.8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. Conclusions There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.","Mei, Y.; Weinberg, S.

The former solution is called “direct dispensing” (DD), while the latter is called “dispensing on commission” (DPC). The strengths and advantages of DD over DPC are many: greater therapeutic appropriateness due to direct control of treatment plans, cost savings from external commissions, and greater clinical sharing of treatment by all healthcare personnel. The main weakness is the organization of a complex warehouse. As the number of chronic patients and advanced therapies increases, direct care requires a new structure and logistics system to manage large administrative, accounting, and information flows.

For emerging adults, who are already at greater risk for psychopathology, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily routines, potentially changing sleep patterns and heightening risk factors for the emergence of affective dysregulation, and consequently mood-related disturbances. This study aimed to determine whether variability in sleep patterns across a 3-month period was associated with next-day positive and negative affect, and affective dynamics, proximal affective predictors of depressive symptoms among young adults during the pandemic. METHODS: College student participants (N=20, 65% female, Mage=19.80, SDage=1.0) wore non-invasive wearable devices (the Oura ring https://ouraring.com/) continuously for a period of 3-months, measuring sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep, and time spent in different stages of sleep (light, deep and rapid eye movement). Participants reported daily PA and NA using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule on a 0-100 scale to report on their affective state. RESULTS: Multilevel models specifying a within-subject process of the relation between sleep and affect revealed that participants with higher sleep onset latency (b= -2.98, p<.01) and sleep duration on the prior day (b= -.35, p=.01) had lower PA the next day. Participants with longer light sleep duration had lower PA (b= -.28, p=.02), whereas participants with longer deep sleep duration had higher PA (b= .36, p=.02) the next day. On days with higher total sleep, participants experienced lower NA compared to their own average (b= -.01, p=.04). Follow-up exploratory bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between light sleep duration instability and higher instability in both PA and NA, whereas higher deep sleep duration was linked with lower instability in both PA and NA (all ps< .05). In the full-length paper these analyses will be probed using linear regressions controlling for relevant covariates (main effects of sleep, sex/age/ethnicity). CONCLUSION: Sleep, an important transdiagnostic health outcome, may contribute to next-day PA and NA. Sleep patterns predict affect dynamics, which may be proximal predictors of mood disturbances. Affect dynamics may be one potential pathway through which sleep has implications for health disparities.

This pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on global healthcare systems, with personal protective equipment (PPE) being the most notable one. Apart from the challenge of procurement of PPE, the major challenge is rationalizing the use of PPE in this war against corona virus disease 19 (COVID19). Using PPE comes with its own set of problems such as extreme exhaustion, rashes, inability to consume food, or use washroom which can result in clouding of judgment and breach of infection barrier.

Methods and Results: Email invitations to participate in an online survey were distributed among physicians to analyse almost simultaneously recorded PPG, single-lead ECG and 12-lead ECG traces from 30 patients (10 in sinus rhythm (SR), 10 in SR with ectopic beats and 10 in AF). The task was to classify the readings as ‘SR', ‘ectopic/missed beats', ‘AF', ‘flutter' or ‘unreadable'. Sixty-five physicians detected or excluded AF based on the raw PPG waveforms with 88.8% sensitivity and 86.3% specificity. Additional presentation of the tachogram plus Poincaré plot significantly increased sensitivity and specificity to 95.5% (P < 0.001) and 92.5% (P < 0.001), respectively. The algorithm information did not further increase the accuracy to detect AF (sensitivity 97.5%, P = 0.556; specificity 95.0%, P = 0.182). Physicians detected AF on single-lead ECG tracings with 91.2% sensitivity and 93.9% specificity. Diagnostic accuracy was also not optimal on full 12-lead ECGs (93.9 and 98.6%, respectively). Notably, there was no significant difference between the performance of PPG waveform plus tachogram and Poincaré, compared to a single-lead ECG to detect or exclude AF (sensitivity P = 0.672; specificity P = 0.536). Conclusion: Physicians can detect AF on a PPG output with equivalent accuracy compared to single-lead ECG, if the PPG waveforms are presented together with a tachogram and Poincaré plot and the quality of the recordings is high.","Gruwez, Henri; Evens, Stijn; Proesmans, Tine; Duncker, David; Linz, Dominik; Heidbuchel, Hein; Manninger, Martin; Vandervoort, Pieter; Haemers, Peter; Pison, Laurent",Front Cardiovasc Med,592,28

The miR-17-92 gene cluster is a highly conserved oncogene cluster encoding six miRNAs: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a and miR-92a. This study explored whether these miRNAs can be used as diagnostic markers for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Serum samples were collected from healthy subjects (n = 23) and NSCLC patients at various stages (n = 74). Serum RNA was extracted by the TRIzol-glycogen method, and cDNA libraries were constructed by reverse transcription. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect the expression levels of the 6 miRNAs. RESULTS: The expression levels of the six miRNAs varied in different stages of NSCLC. Thus, two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, i.e., normal subjects and stage I-III patients and normal subjects and stage IV patients, of each miRNA were established to determine the interval of normal ΔCt values. The two areas under the curve (AUCs) of each miRNA were investigated (miR-17: 0.8097 and 1.000; miR-18a: 0.7388 and 0.9907; miR-19a/19b: 0.8451 and 0.5104; miR-20a: 0.8975 and 1.000; miR-92a: 0.8097 and 0.8342). In addition, a high positive correlation was discovered between miR-17 and miR-20a expression. Combining these two miRNAs can improve the screening effect of NSCLC. CONCLUSION: The miR-17-92 gene cluster can likely serve as a diagnostic marker in NSCLC.","Yang, Chenghao; Jia, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Jinbao; Sun, Qiangling; Ma, Zhongliang",Am J Med Sci,592,16

As any traditional drug discovery program is a time-consuming and costly process requiring more than one decade to be completed, in silico repurposing of existing drugs is the preferred way for rapidly selecting promising clinical candidates. We present a virtual screening campaign to identify covalent and non-covalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) showing potential multitarget activities (i.e., a desirable polypharmacology profile) for the COVID-19 treatment. A dataset including 688 phase III and 1,702 phase IV clinical trial drugs was downloaded from ChEMBL (version 27.1) and docked to the recently released crystal structure of PLpro in complex with a covalently bound peptide inhibitor. The obtained results were analyzed by combining protein–ligand interaction fingerprint similarities, conventional docking scores, and MM-GBSA–binding free energies and allowed the identification of some interesting candidates for further in vitro testing. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to repurpose drugs for a covalent inhibition of PLpro and could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.","Delre, Pietro; Caporuscio, Fabiana; Saviano, Michele; Mangiatordi, Giuseppe Felice",Front Chem,592,16

Viral vectors tend to have high gene transfer capability but may be hampered by complications related to their intrinsic immunogenicity. Non-viral methods of gene delivery, including polymeric, lipid-based, and inorganic nanoparticles as well as physical delivery techniques, have also been widely investigated. By using either ex vivo engineering of immune cells that are subsequently adoptively transferred or in vivo transfection of cells for in situ genetic programming, researchers have developed different approaches to precisely modulate immune responses. In addition to expressing a gene of interest through intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA and mRNA, researchers are also delivering oligonucleotides to knock down gene expression and immunostimulatory nucleic acids to tune immune activity.

FMD vaccine is the traditional way to protect against the disease, which can greatly reduce its occurrence. However, the use of FMD vaccines to protect early infection is limited. Therefore, the alternative strategy of applying antiviral agents is required to control the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations. As previously reported, LiCl has obviously inhibition effects on a variety of viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), and pseudorabies herpesvirus and EV‐A71 virus. In this study, our findings were the first to demonstrate that LiCl inhibition of the FMDV replication. In this study, BHK‐21 cell was dose‐dependent with LiCl at various stages of FMDV. Virus titration assay was calculated by the 50% tissue culture infected dose (TCID(50)) with the Reed and Muench method. The cytotoxicity assay of LiCl was performed by the CCK8 kit. The expression level of viral mRNA was measured by RT‐qPCR. The results revealed LiCl can inhibit FMDV replication, but it cannot affect FMDV attachment stage and entry stage in the course of FMDV life cycle. Further studies confirmed that the LiCl affect the replication stage of FMDV, especially the early stages of FMDV replication. So LiCl has potential as an effective anti‐FMDV drug. Therefore, LiCl may be an effective drug for the control of FMDV. Based on that, the mechanism of the antiviral effect of LiCl on FMDV infection is need to in‐depth research in vivo.","Zhao, Fu‐Rong; Xie, Yin‐Li; Liu, Ze‐Zhong; Shao, Jun‐Jun; Li, Shi‐Fang; Zhang, Yong‐Guang; Chang, Hui‐Yun",J Med Virol,592,16

We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels < 100 ng/mL. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. Extremely elevated ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. Based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20—100 ng/mL with % transferrin levels from 20–50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng/mL associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts.","DePalma, Ralph G; Hayes, Virginia W; O'Leary, Timothy J",Metallomics,592,26

Peer support is valued in recovery-oriented models of mental health and is becoming increasingly implemented at the organizational level. Text messaging is a relatively low-cost, high-impact, and easily scalable program that uses existing technology, is devoid of geographic barriers, and is easily accessible to end users. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative peer support system plus a supportive text messaging program on the recovery of discharged patients from acute psychiatric care. METHODS: This prospective, rater blinded, controlled observational study included 181 patients who were discharged from acute psychiatric care. Patients were randomized to one of four conditions: treatment as usual (follow-up care), daily supportive text messages only, peer support only, or peer support plus daily supportive text messages. A standardized self-report measure of recovery (Recovery Assessment Scale [RAS]) was completed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Descriptive analysis, one-way analysis of variance, and repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance were used to examine the changes in the RAS among the study groups and over the follow-up time points. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients completed the assessments at each time point. For the overall sample, higher scores were found for the peer support plus text message condition compared with the text message only and treatment as usual condition on several scales (ie, willingness to ask for help and personal confidence and hope) and total score on the RAS, after 6 months of intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Peer support plus supportive text messaging seems to result in improved recovery compared with other interventions. It may be advisable to incorporate the two interventions as part of routine practice for patients with psychiatric disorders upon hospital discharge.","Shalaby, Reham; Hrabok, Marianne; Spurvey, Pamela; Abou El-Magd, Rabab M; Knox, Michelle; Rude, Rebecca; Vuong, Wesley; Surood, Shireen; Urichuk, Liana; Snaterse, Mark; Greenshaw, Andrew J; Li, Xin-Min; Agyapong, Vincent Israel Opoku",JMIR Form Res,592,24

These enzymes covalently modify glutamic, aspartic and lysine amino acid side chains of acceptor proteins by the sequential addition of ADP-ribose (ADPr) units. The poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) polymers formed alter the physico-chemical characteristics of the substrate with functional consequences on its biological activities. Recently, non-covalent binding to pADPr has emerged as a key mechanism to modulate and coordinate several intracellular pathways including the DNA damage response, protein stability and cell death. In this review, we describe the basis of non-covalent binding to pADPr that has led to the emerging concept of pADPr-responsive signaling pathways. This review emphasizes the structural elements and the modular strategies developed by pADPr-binding proteins to exert a fine-tuned control of a variety of pathways. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions are highly regulated processes, both spatially and temporally, for which at least four specialized pADPr-binding modules accommodate different pADPr structures and reprogram protein functions.

Methods Public registries were used to assess significant differences in 2016 representation for US vs RO Black academic full-time faculty, residents, and applicants. Historical changes from 1970-2016 were reported descriptively. Linear regression was used to assess significant changes for Black residents and faculty from 1995-2016. Results In 2016, Blacks represented 3.2% vs 1.5% (P<0.001), 5.6% vs 3.2% (P=0.005), and 6.5% vs 5.4% (P=0.352), of US vs RO faculty, residents, and applicants, respectively. While RO residents nearly doubled from 374 (1974) to 720 (2016), Black residents peaked at 31 in 1984 (5.9%; 31/522) and fell to 23 (3.2%; 23/720) in 2016 across 91 accredited programs; Black US GME trainees nearly doubled over the same time period: 3,506 (1984) to 6,905 (2016). Between 1995-2016, Black US resident representation significantly increased 0.03%/yr, but decreased significantly in RO -0.20%/yr before 2006 and did not change significantly thereafter. Over the same time period, Black US faculty representation significantly increased 0.02%/yr, while Black RO faculty significantly increased 0.07%/yr before 2006, then decreased significantly -0.16%/yr thereafter. The number of Black RO faculty peaked at 37 in 2006 (3.1%; 37/1203) and was 27 (1.5%; 27/1769) in 2016, despite the nearly 1.5-fold increase in the number of both RO faculty and Black US faculty overall (4,169 in 2006 and 6,047 in 2016) during that time period. Conclusions Black physicians remain disproportionately underrepresented in RO despite an increasing available pipeline in the US physician workforce. Deliberate efforts to understand barriers to specialty training and inclusion, along with evidence-based targeted interventions to overcome them, are needed to ensure diversification of the RO physician workforce.","Deville, Curtiland; Cruickshank, Ian; Chapman, Christina H.; Hwang, Wei-Ting; Wyse, Rhea; Ahmed, Awad A.; Winkfield, Karen; Thomas, Charles R.; Gibbs, Iris C.",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,592,2

The aim of this study was to identify specific patients’ characteristics that may modulate COVID-19 hospitalization risk. Research design and methods: A pooled analysis was performed on high-quality epidemiological studies to quantify the prevalence (%) of comorbidities and clinical signs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Pooled data were used to calculate the relative risk (RR) of specific comorbidities by matching the frequency of comorbidities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with those of general population. Results: The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases. The RR of COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in patients with asthma (0.86, 0.77–0.97) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (0.46, 0.40–0.52). The most frequent clinical signs were fever and cough. Conclusion: The clinical signs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are similar to those of other infective diseases. Patients with asthma or COPD were at lower hospitalization risk. This paradoxical evidence could be related with the protective effect of inhaled corticosteroids that are administered worldwide to most asthmatic and COPD patients.","Rogliani, Paola; Lauro, Davide; Di Daniele, Nicola; Chetta, Alfredo; Calzetta, Luigino",Expert review of respiratory medicine,592,16

Improvements in detection technologies in instrumentation and chemistries to label these probes have made it possible to use up to six spectrally distinguishable probes per reaction well. With the remarkable advances made in the characterization of human genome diversity, it has been possible to describe empirical patterns of SNPs and haplotype variation in the genome of diverse human populations. These patterns have revealed that the human genome is structured in blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). Because SNPs tend to be in LD with each other, common haplotypes share common SNPs and thus the majority of the diversity in a region can be characterized by typing a very small number of SNPs; so-called tag SNPs. Herein lies the advantage of the multiplexing ability of molecular beacons, since it becomes possible to use as few as 30 probes to interrogate several haplotypes in a high-throughput approach. Thus, through the combined use of tag SNPs and molecular beacons it becomes possible to type individuals for clinically relevant haplotypes in a high-throughput manner at a cost that is orders of magnitude less than that for high throughput sequencing methods.","Barreiro, Luis B.; Henriques, Ricardo; Mhlanga, Musa M.",Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms,592,26

DESIGN: Rapid review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase and Google, as well as the websites of relevant national health departments, were searched from 1 January 2020 to 24 April 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Documents included must be issued by a national health authority, must be specific to COVID-19 care, directed at healthcare workers or managers, and must refer to the role of primary care in the COVID-19 response. RESULTS: We identified 17 documents from 14 countries. An adapted framework on primary care challenges and responses to pandemic influenza framed our analysis. Guidelines generally reported on COVID-19 service delivery and mostly made specific recommendations for ensuring continued delivery of essential primary care services through telehealth or other virtual care modalities. Few offered guidance to support surveillance as a public health function. All offered guidance on implementing outbreak control measures, largely through flexible and coordinated organisational models with partners from various sectors. There was a lack of guidance to support supply chain management and practice resilience in primary care, and lack of personal protective equipment represents a serious threat to the provision of quality care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Current national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 provide guidance on infection control and minimising the risk of spread in primary care practices, while supporting the use of new technology and coordinated partnerships. However, to ensure primary care practice resilience and quality of care are upheld, guidelines must offer recommendations on supply chain management and operational continuity, supported by adequate resources.","Haldane, Victoria; Zhang, Zhitong; Abbas, Raja Faisal; Dodd, Warren; Lau, Lincoln L; Kidd, Michael R; Rouleau, Katherine; Zou, Guanyang; Chao, Zhuo; Upshur, Ross E G; Walley, John; Wei, Xiaolin",BMJ Open,592,5

Given the increasing burden of breast cancer in Uganda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and driven by the limited availability of immunohistochemistry (IHC), we launched a clinical trial aimed at evaluating locally available diagnostics to detect the presence of hormone receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Preliminary data from 32 women in the diagnostic component of the study reveal high sensitivity and specificity for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and high specificity for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 when comparing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with the gold standard (IHC). Innovative diagnostic and treatment strategies are required to address the burden of breast cancer that is increasing throughout SSA. Given the costs, infrastructure, and trained personnel associated with IHC, alternative testing options (including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction as tested in our study) may provide an expedited and cost-effective method to determine receptor testing in breast cancer.

Methods A total of 302 discharged COVID-19 patients were included. Discharged patients were followed up for 14 days to 6 months. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, Borg rating of perceived exertion, and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores on day 14 and at 6 months after discharge were compared between the re-detectable positive (RP) and non-RP (NRP) groups. Prognoses of respiratory and physical functions were compared between patients who recovered from moderate and severe COVID-19. Results Of the patients, 7.6% were RP. The proportion of patients who used antiviral drugs was significantly lower in the RP group than in the NRP group. There were no differences in the mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores within the RP group and the NRP group. The mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores were worse for severe-type cases than for moderate-type cases at both follow-ups. Conclusion COVID-19 patients who did not take antiviral drugs were more likely to be RP after discharge. However, respiratory and physical function recovery were not related to re-positivity during rehabilitation but to disease severity during hospitalization.","Wu, Qian; Hou, Xinwei; Li, Hongwei; Guo, Jing; Li, Yajie; Yang, Fangfei; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Yi; Li, Li",Int J Infect Dis,592,24

The standard method for diagnosis is via nucleic acid amplification testing, usually with a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Hospitalized infected individuals may require ventilation and may have higher mortality rates. We aim to evaluate the clinical impact of nasopharyngeal viral load on these outcomes. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 17 March 2020 to 1 June 2020 at a tertiary care hospital. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from an RT-PCR assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We compared the clinical characteristics of survivors vs. non-survivors and assessed whether the viral load was independently associated with in-hospital 30-day mortality. Results We evaluated 197 patients. Thirty-day mortality was verified in 71 (36%) subjects. In the adjusted effects model, only the E-gene Ct value [odd ratio (OR) .873; confidence interval (CI) 95% .769-.992; p .037], age, the number of days of symptoms before admission, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the oxygen saturation (SatO(2))-to-fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio remained significantly associated with 30-day mortality. There was no identified association between the viral loads and disease severity, the need for ventilation, or length of stay. Discussion Our results are, in part, concordant with previous papers. One possible limitation to our study is the fact that possibly included disproportionately more patients with poorer outcomes since hospitalization was required. Therefore, further research is required. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 viral load on admission may be an independent predictor of 30-day mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Providing this information to clinicians could potentially be used to guide risk stratification.","Machado, António; Salvador, Pedro; Oliveira, Pedro; Teixeira, Tiago; Figueiredo, Cristóvão; Nunes, Sofia; Silva, Luís; Silva, Leonor; Costa, Tiago; Malheiro, Luís",Cureus,592,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 15 children between the age group of 6–12 years and their parents who were randomly chosen from a special care autistic school in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. A mobile application was custom designed and programmed with videos on oral hygiene. A close-ended questionnaire comprising 14 questions for the cooperative autistic children and 21 questions for their parents was designed to assess their knowledge in relation to oral health and hygiene. After four weeks, a questionnaire-based knowledge assessment was conducted. The mean knowledge score was then calculated for children and their parents and compared using paired sample t-test. RESULTS: Poor knowledge regarding oral hygiene practices was revealed among the study participants. The estimated mean score among the children was 4.73 before the intervention, which significantly increased to 9.0. The estimated mean score for the parents was 9.3 before intervention and 14.6 after four weeks' period (P < 0.0001).

In the meantime, however, metagenomic sequencing efforts are revealing enteric viruses as the most abundant dimension of the intestinal gut ecosystem, and the first gut virome-wide association studies showed that inflammatory bowel disease as well as type 1 diabetes could be linked to the presence or absence of particular viral inhabitants in the intestine. In line with the genetic component of these human diseases, mouse model studies demonstrated how beneficial functions of a resident virus can switch to detrimental inflammatory effects in a genetically predisposed host. Such viral-induced intestinal immune disturbances are also recapitulated by several gastrointestinal infectious viruses such as rotavirus and human norovirus. This wide range of viral effects on intestinal immunity emphasizes the need for understanding the innate immune responses to gastrointestinal viruses. Numerous nucleic acid sensors such as DexD/H helicases and AIM2 serve as cytosolic viral guardians to induce antiviral interferon and/or pro-inflammatory inflammasome responses. In both cases, pioneering examples are emerging in which RNA helicases cooperate with particular Nod-like receptors to trigger these cellular responses to enteric viruses. Here we summarize the reported beneficial versus detrimental effects of enteric viruses in the intestinal immune system, and we zoom in on the mechanisms through which sensing of nucleic acids from these enteric viruses trigger interferon and inflammasome responses.","Dubois, Hanne; van Loo, Geert; Wullaert, Andy",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,592,12

BACKGROUND: Nurse practitioners are advanced practice nurses possessing expert knowledge and leadership skills that can be optimized to narrow disparities and ensure access to high‐quality health care globally. Nurses worldwide have been challenged to meet global public health needs in the context of COVID‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2 virus), and there are early indications that nurse practitioners are being called upon to the full extent of their capabilities in the current pandemic. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: PubMed; Google Scholar; the International Council of Nurses; World Health Organization; United Nations; and the experiences of the authors. DISCUSSION: Several international reports, nursing and health organizations have called for continued investment in and development of nursing to improve mechanisms that promote cost‐effective and universally accessible care. Expanding nurse practitioner scopes of practice across nations will leverage their clinical capacities, policy and advocacy skills, and talents to lead at all levels. CONCLUSION: Ongoing empirical data and policy change is needed to enable the full scope and strategic utilization of nurse practitioners across healthcare systems and contexts. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, AND NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Widespread education regarding nurse practitioner capacities for interdisciplinary partners, policymakers and the public is needed. Policies that safely expand their roles are critical.

In clinical practice of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the complication of CMV enterocolitis, which is caused by CMV reactivation under disruption of intestinal barrier function, inflammation, or strong immunosuppressive therapy, is well known to affect the prognosis of disease. However, the relationship between other HHVs and IBD remains unclear. In the transplantation field, reactivation of other viruses, such as HHV-6, could cause colitis under immunosuppressed condition. Recent research revealed that combined infection of some HHVs could be a risk factor for colectomy in patients with ulcerative colitis. This suggests that it would be important to clarify HHV behavior in the treatment for patients with IBD, especially in those under immunosuppressive therapies. Looking at the relationship with recently emerged novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), there are reports describe that SARS-CoV-2 might induce reactivation of HSV-1, EBV, VZV (herpes zoster), and HHV-6/7.

METHODS: We have modeled the mortality and the intensive care unit (ICU) requirement for the care of patients with cancer infected with COVID-19 in Latin America. A dynamic multistate Markov model was constructed. Transition probabilities were estimated on the basis of published reports for cumulative probability of complications. Basic reproductive number (R0) values were modeled with R using the EpiEstim package. Estimations of days of ICU requirement and absolute mortality were calculated by imputing number of cumulative cases in the Markov model. RESULTS: Estimated median time of ICU requirement was 12.7 days, median time to mortality was 16.3 days after infection, and median time to severe event was 8.1 days. Peak ICU occupancy for patients with cancer was calculated at 16 days after infection. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed an interval for mortality between 18.5% and 30.4%. With the actual incidence tendency, Latin America would be expected to lose approximately 111,725 patients with cancer to SARS-CoV-2 (range, 87,116-143,154 patients) by the 60th day since the start of the outbreak. Losses calculated vary between < 1% to 17.6% of all patients with cancer in the region. CONCLUSION: Cancer-related cases and deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 will put a great strain on health care systems in Latin America.

Immunization strategies to prevent vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs) can effectively minimize this infection burden. However, data on age-appropriate immunization and VPIs in children after liver transplant in Asia are limited. AIM: To evaluate the immunization status, VPIs and non-VPIs requiring hospitalization in children who have undergone a liver transplant. METHODS: The medical records of children who had a liver transplant between 2004 and 2018 at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) were retrospectively reviewed. Immunization status was evaluated via their vaccination books. Hospitalization for infections that occurred up to 5 years after liver transplantation were evaluated, and divided into VPIs and non-VPIs. Hospitalizations for cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus were excluded. Severity of infection, length of hospital stay, ventilator support, intensive care unit requirement, and mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-seven children with a mean age of 3.29 ± 4.17 years were included in the study, of whom 41 (53.2%) were female. The mean follow-up duration was 3.68 ± 1.45 years. Fortyeight children (62.3%) had vaccination records. There was a significant difference in the proportion of children with incomplete vaccination according to Thailand’s Expanded Program on Immunization (52.0%) and accelerated vaccine from Infectious Diseases Society of America (89.5%) (P < 0.001). Post-liver transplant, 47.9% of the children did not catch up with age-appropriate immunizations. There were 237 infections requiring hospitalization during the 5 years of follow-up. There were no significant differences in hospitalization for VPIs or non-VPIs in children with complete and incomplete immunizations. The risk of serious infection was high in the first year after receiving a liver transplant, and two children died. Respiratory and gastrointestinal systems were common sites of infection. The most common pathogens that caused VPIs were rotavirus, influenza virus, and varicella-zoster virus. CONCLUSION: Incomplete immunization was common pre- and post-transplant, and nearly all children required hospitalization for non-VPIs or VPIs within 5 years post-transplant. Infection severity was high in the first year post-transplant.","Sintusek, Palittiya; Poovorawan, Yong",World J Hepatol,592,16

The increased nicotine level induces a prothrombotic status and abnormal blood coagulation in smokers. Since several anticoagulants increase bleeding risk, alternative therapies need to be identified to protect against thrombosis without affecting hemostasis. Astragalin is a flavonoid present in persimmon leaves and green tea seeds and exhibits diverse activities of antioxidant and anti-inflammation. The current study investigated that astragalin attenuated smoking-induced pulmonary thrombosis and alveolar inflammation. In addition, it was explored that molecular links between thrombosis and inflammation entailed protease-activated receptor (PAR) activation and oxidative stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling. BALB/c mice were orally administrated with 10–20 mg/kg astragalin and exposed to cigarette smoke for 8 weeks. For the in vitro study, 10 U/mL thrombin was added to alveolar epithelial A549 cells in the presence of 1–20 µM astragalin. The cigarette smoking-induced the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in lung tissues, which was attenuated by the administration of ≥10 mg/kg astragalin. The oral supplementation of ≥10 mg/kg astragalin to cigarette smoke-challenged mice attenuated the protein induction of urokinase plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1and tissue factor, and instead enhanced the induction of tissue plasminogen activator in lung tissues. The astragalin treatment alleviated cigarette smoke-induced lung emphysema and pulmonary thrombosis. Astragalin caused lymphocytosis and neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid due to cigarette smoke but curtailed infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in airways. Furthermore, this compound retarded thrombin-induced activation of PAR proteins and expression of inflammatory mediators in alveolar cells. Treating astragalin interrupted PAR proteins-activated reactive oxygen species production and MAPK signaling leading to alveolar inflammation. Accordingly, astragalin may interrupt the smoking-induced oxidative stress–MAPK signaling–inflammation axis via disconnection between alveolar PAR activation and pulmonary thromboembolism.","Kim, Yun-Ho; Kang, Min-Kyung; Lee, Eun-Jung; Kim, Dong Yeon; Oh, Hyeongjoo; Kim, Soo-Il; Oh, Su Yeon; Na, Woojin; Shim, Jae-Hoon; Kang, Il-Jun; Kang, Young-Hee",Int J Mol Sci,592,16

In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62–2.34] compared with people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalized cohorts (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12–2.27) and studies of PLWH across all settings (hazard ratio 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69–2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4(+) T-cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: Emerging evidence suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4(+) T-cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is warranted.","Mellor, Maya M.; Bast, Anne C.; Jones, Nicholas R.; Roberts, Nia W.; Ordóñez-Mena, José M.; Reith, Alastair J.M.; Butler, Christopher C.; Matthews, Philippa C.; Dorward, Jienchi",AIDS,592,20

Although behavioral immune system activation may be functional by helping people avoid such situations, experiencing these automatic reactions during sexual interactions may undermine people’s evaluations of those interactions because sex requires close physical contact. We examined whether two sources of behavioral immune system activation (daily concern over contracting COVID-19 and individual differences in infection concern) undermined satisfaction with sex among 318 partnered adults in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported individual differences in perceived infectability and then, every night for two weeks, reported their (a) daily concern about contracting COVID-19, (b) daily stress, (c) whether they had sex with their partner, and (d) their satisfaction with sex when it occurred. People’s perceived infectability moderated the association between their daily concern about contracting COVID-19 and the extent to which they enjoyed sex when it occurred, such that people higher, but not lower, in perceived infectability enjoyed sex less on days that they were more worried about contracting COVID-19 than usual. This effect was not moderated by biological sex and remained significant when controlling for biological sex, age, relationship length, and frequency of sex. Results highlight the importance of the behavioral immune system to sexual functioning and suggest a novel avenue through which the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted relationships.

Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are known as serious events, which can reach a mortality rate of 50%, where viral infections may play a role. We describe the case of a 64-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of IPF under antifibrotic treatment for 1 year;the patient tested positive for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction test of the nasopharyngeal swab, and his chest computed tomography results were compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia described in the literature as well as the findings compatible with interstitial lung disease. The patient was successfully treated in the pulmonology ward according to official guidelines about COVID-19 along with antifibrotic treatment and required only a short course of oxygen therapy. We experienced no drug interactions, serious side effects, or complications during treatment. The patient was discharged after 1 week, and he is still in a good condition after 3 weeks. COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient with IPF who survived under antifibrotic treatment without serious deterioration is a new experience.

Sequential extraction experiments showed that, after SCW treatment, heavy metals in exchangeable and carbonate forms in the ashes could be transferred into other relatively stable forms, e.g., Ba and Cr into residual fraction, Cu and Pb into organic matter fraction. SCWH treatment could stabilize heavy metals in Fe–Mn oxides and residual fractions. However, the behavior of As was quite different from heavy metals, which could be leached out from residue fraction after SCW and SWCH treatments. The leached As tended to absorb onto Fe–Mn oxides and organic matters under near neutral environment, but it could react with Ca(2+) at lower pH, increasing the mobility of this element. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW and SCWH treatments so as to effectively stabilize hazardous elements in the ash. Consequently, it is believed that SCWH treatment is an effective alternative for hazardous elements detoxification in MW fly ash.","Bo, Da; Zhang, Fu-Shen; Zhao, Lijuan",J Hazard Mater,592,30

The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterized, and many research teams all over the world are working on either ther- apeutic or vaccination issues. Massive testing is one of the main recommendations. In addition to laboratory tests, imagery- based tools are being widely investigated. Artificial intelligence is therefore contributing to the efforts made to face this pandemic phase. Regarding patients in hospitals, it is important to monitor the evolution of lung pathologies due to the virus. A prognosis is therefore of great interest for doctors to adapt their care strategy. In this paper, we propose a method for Covid-19 prognosis based on deep learning architectures. The proposed method is based on the combination of a convolutional and recurrent neural networks to classify multi-temporal chest X-ray images and predict the evolution of the observed lung pathology.

METHODS: After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health–Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS: As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County.

In most children CMPA resolves by age 5 or 6; however, if not treated correctly can provoke nutritional deficiency resulting in poor growth. Management consists of excluding cow’s milk from the diet, with hypoallergenic formulas (or non-dairy alternatives) being introduced to meet nutritional requirements. Objectives: To compare the cost-effectiveness of hypoallergenic formulas in reducing allergic manifestations and promoting immune tolerance in infants with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated symptoms of CMPA. Methods: A trial-based decision analytic cohort model was developed to simulate the occurrence of urticaria, eczema, asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or being symptom-free in infants with CMPA in the United Kingdom. Amino acid-based formula (AAF), extensively hydrolysed casein formula containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus Gorbach Goldin (EHCF+LGG), extensively hydrolysed whey formula (EHWF), and soy formula (SF) were compared using the National Health Service (NHS) perspective, 3-year time horizon and 3.5% discount rate for cost and health consequences. Hypoallergenic formulas comparative efficacy was sourced from a prospective cohort study. Resources required to manage allergic symptoms were sourced from published literature, validated by a UK clinician, and applied to UK cost resources. Results were reported as cost per additional child free from allergic manifestations at 3 years and cost per additional immune tolerant child at 3 years. Results: In the base case, infants receiving EHCF+LGG were associated with lower NHS resource use and improved CMPA tolerance. Over the 3-year treatment period, savings of £119, £476, and £1094 were achieved with EHCF+LGG compared to SF, EHWF and AAF, respectively. Infant formula accounted for the largest proportion of resource consumption averaging 44% for all comparators, with a minimum of 31% for SF and a maximum of 53% for AAF over 3 years. General practitioners’ visits constituted the second highest cost component, approximately 17% of total costs across comparators. The results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Compared to AAF, SF, and EHWF hypoallergenic formulas, EHCF+LGG was the most cost-effective, associated with lower total costs and contributing to a higher proportion of children being symptom-free and developing immune tolerance 3-years after diagnosis.","Martins, Rui; Connolly, Mark P.; Minshall, Eleanor",Journal of health economics and outcomes research,592,1

We aim to describe electrolyte disturbance and explore risk factors for COVID-19 infection in patients visiting the ED. We carried out a case–control study in three hospitals in France, including adult ED inpatients (≥ 18 years old). A total of 594 ED case patients in whom infection with COVID-19 was confirmed, were matched to 594 non-COVID-19 ED patients (controls) from the same period, according to sex and age. Hyponatremia was defined by a sodium of less than 135 mmol/L (reference range 135–145 mmol/L), hypokalemia by a potassium of less than 3.5 mmol/L (reference range 3.5–5.0 mmol/L), and hypochloremia by a chloride of less than 95 mmol/L (reference range 98–108 mmol/L). Among both case patients and controls, the median (IQR) age was 65 years (IQR 51–76), and 44% were women. Hyponatremia was more common among case patients than among controls, as was hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Based on the results of the multivariate logistic regression, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia were associated with COVID-19 among case patients overall, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.89 [95% CI 1.24–2.89] for hyponatremia and 1.76 [95% CI 1.20–2.60] for hypokalemia.

HCV infection strongly induces host responses, such as the activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and the innate immune response. Upon HCV infection, the host induces the interferon (IFN)-mediated frontline defense to limit virus replication. Conversely, HCV employs diverse strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance. Type I IFN elicits its antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these ISGs participate in IFN-mediated anti-HCV actions remain largely unknown. In this review, we first outline the signaling pathways known to be involved in the production of type I IFN and ISGs and the tactics that HCV uses to subvert innate immunity. Then, we summarize the effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs known to modulate IFN function in HCV replication. We also highlight the potential functions of emerging ISGs, which were identified from genome-wide siRNA screens, in HCV replication. Finally, we discuss the functions of several cellular determinants critical for regulating host immunity in HCV replication. This review will provide a basis for understanding the complexity and functionality of the pleiotropic IFN system in HCV infection. Elucidation of the specificity and the mode of action of these emerging ISGs will also help to identify novel cellular targets against which effective HCV therapeutics can be developed.","Wong, Mun-Teng; Chen, Steve S-L",Cell Mol Immunol,592,12

However, few studies have specifically focused on very old inpatients with COVID-19. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of very old inpatients with COVID-19 and identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality at admission. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective, observational study in patients ≥ 80 years hospitalized with COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19) Registry (March 1–May 29, 2020). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. A uni- and multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of mortality at admission. RESULTS: A total of 2772 consecutive patients (49.4% men, median age 86.3 years) were analyzed. Rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, dementia, and Barthel Index < 60 were 30.8%, 25.6%, 30.5%, and 21.0%, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate was 46.9% (n: 1301) and increased with age (80–84 years: 41.6%; 85–90 years: 47.3%; 90–94 years: 52.7%; ≥95 years: 54.2%). After analysis, male sex and moderate-to-severe dependence were independently associated with in-hospital mortality; comorbidities were not predictive. At admission, independent risk factors for death were: oxygen saturation < 90%; temperature ≥ 37.8°C; quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score ≥ 2; and unilateral–bilateral infiltrates on chest x-rays. Some analytical findings were independent risk factors for death, including estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2); lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 500 U/L; C-reactive protein ≥ 80 mg/L; neutrophils ≥ 7.5 × 10(3)/μL; lymphocytes < 0.8 × 10(3)/μL; and monocytes < 0.5 × 10(3)/μL.

The role of viral infections in the etiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) was prospectively evaluated from 2008 to 2012 at a university-level intensive care unit. Methods. Clinical data and microbiological tests were assessed: blood cultures, urine pneumococcal and legionella antigens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies from paired serums, and respiratory virus detection by multiplex, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs and lower tracheal specimens via intubation tube. Results. Of 49 mechanically ventilated SCAP patients (21 men and 28 women; median age, 54 years), the etiology was identified in 45 cases (92%). There were 21 pure bacterial infections (43%), 5 probably pure viral infections (10%), and 19 mixed bacterial–viral infections (39%), resulting in viral etiology in 24 patients (49%). Of 26 viruses, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens and 5 (19%) from nasopharyngeal swabs. Rhinovirus (15 cases, 58%) and adenovirus (4 cases, 15%) were the most common viral findings. The bacterial–viral etiology group had the highest peak C-reactive protein levels (median, 356 [25th–75th percentiles, 294–416], P = .05), whereas patients with probably viral etiology had the lowest peak procalcitonin levels (1.7 [25th–75th percentiles, 1.6–1.7]). The clinical characteristics of pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral etiologies were comparable. Hospital stay was longest among the bacterial group (17 vs 14 days; P = .02). Conclusions. Viral findings were demonstrated in almost half of the SCAP patients. Clinical characteristics were similar between the pure bacterial and mixed bacterial–viral infections groups.

The second wave of COVID-19 in India has proven to be more devastating and aggressive than the first wave of the pandemic, which led to recognizing India as one of the world's topmost worst-hit nations considering >4000 fatalities reported in a single day in May 2021. Such “resurgence and acceleration” of COVID-19 transmission has been fuelled by the MahaKumbh festival and political mass gathering (elections rallies) events, where the COVID-19 protocols have been ignored by millions of pilgrims/followers. The present review discusses only the consequences of this year's MahaKumbh festivals, the largest religious mass gathering on earth, which was held during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, and its impact on both the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among participants and their families and its influence on the quality of the river Ganga. This article tries to give readers outside of India an overview of how much impact of any such single large gathering of any relgion in any part of the world can drive coronavirus infections and effectively commence the second/third wave outbreak with this case study. Furthermore, the religious large scale celebration are widely accepted through out the world that have played a significant role in the spread of the pandemic into remote villages and towns all over the subcontinent/world, thus affecting many areas with insufficient healthcare facilities that have been relatively spared. This review also highlights the potential risk of transmission from infected humans into the aquatic environment of the river Ganga. Besides the obvious relevance of SARS-CoV-2, a large variety of other water-related disease vectors (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) stemming from visitors to the religious congregation were introduced into the upstream regions of the Ganga river. Their sheer number is assumed to have had a severe influence on its delicate ecosystem, including endangered mammals such as the river Dolphins. The detailed epidemiological and clinical study on transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to understand the pathogenesis of RNA virus infection and prevent the massive spreading of such infectious respiratory diseases. An interdisciplinary approach, rooted in evidence-based efficient learning, contextual strategies, and a streamlined unified approach should be adopted to help in the development of a proactive prevention model during future MahaKumbh festival (and similar religious gatherings) instead of just “picking up the pieces” in a conventional post-event model.","Patel, Arbind Kumar; Mukherjee, Santanu; Leifels, Mats; Gautam, Rohit; Kaushik, Himanshu; Sharma, Saloni; Kumar, Om",Int J Hyg Environ Health,592,17

The natural flavonoid quercetin 1 has been recently reported to be a potent M(pro) inhibitor in vitro, and we explored the effect produced by the introduction of organoselenium functionalities in this scaffold. In particular, we report here a new synthetic method to prepare previously inaccessible C-8 seleno-quercetin derivatives. By screening a small library of flavonols and flavone derivatives, we observed that some compounds inhibit the protease activity in vitro. For the first time, we demonstrate that quercetin (1) and 8-(p-tolylselenyl)quercetin (2d) block SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells at non-toxic concentrations, with an IC(50) of 192 μM and 8 μM, respectively. Based on docking experiments driven by experimental evidence, we propose a non-covalent mechanism for M(pro) inhibition in which a hydrogen bond between the selenium atom and Gln189 residue in the catalytic pocket could explain the higher M(pro) activity of 2d and, as a result, its better antiviral profile.","Mangiavacchi, Francesca; Botwina, Pawel; Menichetti, Elena; Bagnoli, Luana; Rosati, Ornelio; Marini, Francesca; Fonseca, Sérgio F.; Abenante, Laura; Alves, Diego; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Kula-Pacurar, Anna; Ortega-Alarcon, David; Jimenez-Alesanco, Ana; Ceballos-Laita, Laura; Vega, Sonia; Rizzuti, Bruno; Abian, Olga; Lenardão, Eder J.; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Sancineto, Luca; Santi, Claudio",Int J Mol Sci,592,27

Pre-incubation of concentrated virus stocks with either flavonoid did not inhibit HCMV replication, suggesting that baicalein did not directly inactivate virus particles. Baicalein functionally blocked epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity and HCMV nuclear translocation, while genistein did not. At 24 h post infection HCMV-infected cells treated with genistein continued to express immediate-early proteins and efficiently phosphorylate IE1-72. However, HCMV induction of NF-κB and increases in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins—events that are associated with immediate-early protein functioning – were absent. The data suggested that the primary mechanism of action for baicalein may be to block HCMV infection at entry while the primary mechanism of action for genistein may be to block HCMV immediate-early protein functioning.","Evers, David L.; Chao, Chih-Fang; Wang, Xin; Zhang, Zhigang; Huong, Shu-Mei; Huang, Eng-Shang",Antiviral Res,592,16

Viruses, such as herpesviruses, deploy diverse mechanisms to derail RIG-I-dependent innate immune defense. In this study, we discovered that mouse RIG-I is intrinsically resistant to deamidation and evasion by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Comparative studies involving human and mouse RIG-I indicate that N495 of human RIG-I dictates species-specific deamidation by HSV-1 UL37. Remarkably, deamidation of the other site, N549, hinges on that of N495, and it is catalyzed by cellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT). Specifically, deamidation of N495 enables RIG-I to interact with PPAT, leading to subsequent deamidation of N549. Collaboration between UL37 and PPAT is required for HSV-1 to evade RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune response. This work identifies an immune regulatory role of PPAT in innate host defense and establishes a sequential deamidation event catalyzed by distinct deamidases in immune evasion.","Huang, Huichao; Zhao, Jun; Wang, Ting-Yu; Zhang, Shu; Zhou, Yuzheng; Rao, Youliang; Qin, Chao; Liu, Yongzhen; Chen, Yongheng; Xia, Zanxian; Feng, Pinghui",mBio,592,16

Here, we review the physical concepts behind domain formation in lipid membranes, both of their structural and dynamic origins. This, then leads into a discussion of coarse-grained, phenomenological approaches that describe the wide range of phases associated with lipid lateral heterogeneity. We use these physical concepts to describe the interaction between raft-lipid species, such as long-chain saturated lipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol with non-raft forming lipids, such as those with short acyl chains or unsaturated fatty acids. While debate has persisted on the biological relevance of lipid domains, recent research, described here, continues to identify biological roles for rafts and new experimental approaches have revealed the existence of lipid domains in living systems. Given the recent progress on both the biological and structural aspects of raft formation, the research area of membrane lateral heterogeneity will not only expand, but will continue to produce exciting results.","Kinnun, Jacob J.; Bolmatov, Dima; Lavrentovich, Maxim O.; Katsaras, John",Chem Phys Lipids,592,32

The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a three-nucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model. These results reveal that the HIV-1 frameshift domain is a complex, dynamic structure and underscore the importance of analyzing folding in the context of full-length RNAs.","Low, Justin T.; Garcia-Miranda, Pablo; Mouzakis, Kathryn D.; Gorelick, Robert J.; Butcher, Samuel E.; Weeks, Kevin M.",Biochemistry,592,10

The COVID-19 virus spreads when a person comes into contact with an affected individual. This is mainly through drops of saliva or nasal discharge. Most of the affected people have mild symptoms while some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which damages organs like the lungs and heart. Chest X-rays (CXRs) have been widely used to identify abnormalities that help in detecting the COVID-19 virus. They have also been used as an initial screening procedure for individuals highly suspected of being infected. However, the availability of radiographic CXRs is still scarce. This can limit the performance of deep learning (DL) based approaches for COVID-19 detection. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we developed an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN), to generate CXRs. Each generated X-ray belongs to one of the two classes COVID-19 positive or normal. To ensure the goodness of the synthetic images, we performed some experimentation on the obtained images using the latest Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 in the CXRs. We fine-tuned the models and achieved more than 98% accuracy. After that, we also performed feature selection using the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm, which reduces the number of features while retaining classification accuracy.

Understanding whether there are distinct subphenotypes of severe COVID-19 may offer insight into its pathophysiology. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is an objective and comprehensive measurement that measures dysfunction severity of six organ systems, i.e., cardiovascular, central nervous system, coagulation, liver, renal, and respiration. Our aim was to identify and characterize distinct subphenotypes of COVID-19 critical illness defined by the post-intubation trajectory of SOFA score. Intubated COVID-19 patients at two hospitals in New York city were leveraged as development and validation cohorts. Patients were grouped into mild, intermediate, and severe strata by their baseline post-intubation SOFA. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed within each stratum to detect subphenotypes based on similarities amongst SOFA score trajectories evaluated by Dynamic Time Warping. Distinct worsening and recovering subphenotypes were identified within each stratum, which had distinct 7-day post-intubation SOFA progression trends. Patients in the worsening suphenotypes had a higher mortality than those in the recovering subphenotypes within each stratum (mild stratum, 29.7% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.033; intermediate stratum, 29.3% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.002; severe stratum, 53.7% vs. 22.2%, p < 0.001). Pathophysiologic biomarkers associated with progression were distinct at each stratum, including findings suggestive of inflammation in low baseline severity of illness versus hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in higher baseline severity of illness. The findings suggest that there are clear worsening and recovering subphenotypes of COVID-19 respiratory failure after intubation, which are more predictive of outcomes than baseline severity of illness. Distinct progression biomarkers at differential baseline severity of illness suggests a heterogeneous pathobiology in the progression of COVID-19 respiratory failure.","Su, Chang; Xu, Zhenxing; Hoffman, Katherine; Goyal, Parag; Safford, Monika M.; Lee, Jerry; Alvarez-Mulett, Sergio; Gomez-Escobar, Luis; Price, David R.; Harrington, John S.; Torres, Lisa K.; Martinez, Fernando J.; Campion, Thomas R.; Wang, Fei; Schenck, Edward J.",Sci Rep,592,1

The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R(0), were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.","Massad, Eduardo; Burattini, Marcelo N.; Lopez, Luis F.; Coutinho, Francisco A.B.",Med Hypotheses,592,21

At the opposite extreme, high-dimensional models that are both individual-based and stochastic incorporate the distributed nature of ecological interactions. In between, moment approximations have been proposed that represent the effect of correlations on the dynamics of mean quantities. As an alternative closer to the typical temporal models used in ecology, we present here results on “modified mean-field equations” for infectious disease dynamics, in which only mean quantities are followed and the effect of heterogeneous mixing is incorporated implicitly. We specifically investigate the previously proposed empirical parameterization of heterogeneous mixing in which the bilinear incidence rate SI is replaced by a nonlinear term kS p I q , for the case of stochastic SIRS dynamics on different contact networks, from a regular lattice to a random structure via small-world configurations. We show that, for two distinct dynamical cases involving a stable equilibrium and a noisy endemic steady state, the modified mean-field model approximates successfully the steady state dynamics as well as the respective short and long transients of decaying cycles. This result demonstrates that early on in the transients an approximate power-law relationship is established between global (mean) quantities and the covariance structure in the network. The approach fails in the more complex case of persistent cycles observed within the narrow range of small-world configurations.","Roy, Manojit; Pascual, Mercedes",Ecological Complexity,592,24

Results: We found an overall Tdap vaccination adhesion of 43% in 2019 and 47.3% in 2020. Several socio-demographic parameters would determine an increased vaccination adhesion, including parents’ geographical origin, mothers’ age and educational background, as well as the number of previous deliveries, abortions or voluntary termination of pregnancy.

In DEmARC, virus clusters are delimited objectively by devising a universal family-wide threshold on intra-cluster genetic divergence of viruses that is specific for each level of the classification. Here, we apply DEmARC to a set of 56 filoviruses with complete genome sequences and compare the resulting classification to the ICTV taxonomy of the family Filoviridae. We find in total six candidate taxon levels two of which correspond to the species and genus ranks of the family. At these two levels, the six filovirus species and two genera officially recognized by ICTV, as well as a seventh tentative species for Lloviu virus and prototyping a third genus, are reproduced. DEmARC lends the highest possible support for these two as well as the four other levels, implying that the actual number of valid taxon levels remains uncertain and the choice of levels for filovirus species and genera is arbitrary. Based on our experience with other virus families, we conclude that the current sampling of filovirus genomic sequences needs to be considerably expanded in order to resolve these uncertainties in the framework of genetics-based classification.","Lauber, Chris; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",Viruses,592,10

Pembrolizumab sometimes causes immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Dermatomyositis is a rare irAE of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The presentation is usually acute, and symptoms include edema with erythema of the eyelids, erythema of the forehead, and muscle weakness in both thighs. CASE REPORT: Here we report a case of pembrolizumab-induced dermatomyositis in a 71-year-old Japanese woman with cancer of unknown primary origin, who experienced a high fever and had difficulty walking after her sixth course of pembrolizumab. General physical examination revealed edema with a heliotrope rash, V-neck signs, and non-specific erythema of the forehead. Laboratory evaluation revealed that myogenic enzymes were within normal ranges. Autoantibody tests revealed that antinuclear antibodies were negative, and autoantibodies related to myositis and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were also negative. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the thighs revealed signal abnormalities in the left lateral and distal vastus medialis muscle. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, subsequently followed by intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which led to an improvement of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab-induced dermatomyositis is rare. Corticosteroids have been administered in many cases, and this case also suggests the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in treating immune checkpoint inhibitor-related dermatomyositis.

The short-form International physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ, SF) was distributed to the participants through an online survey. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analyses. The present study showed that the level of physical activity decreased significantly during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 in both sexes and age groups (p<0.001). Also, this study found that a total of 78% of the participants did not meet the physical activity guidelines during COVID-19 in Iran.

Here RNA sequencing analysis of a kidney biopsy specimen from a patient with COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy and APOL1 risk alleles (G1/G1) revealed similar levels of APOL1 and ACE2 mRNA transcripts as compared to 12 control kidney samples downloaded from the GTEx Portal. Whole genome sequencing of the COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy kidney sample identified four indel gene variants, three of which are of unknown significance with respect to chronic kidney disease and/or FSGS. Molecular profiling of the kidney demonstrated activation of COVID-19-associated cell injury pathways such as inflammation and coagulation. Evidence for direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells was lacking, which is consistent with the findings of several recent studies. Interestingly, immunostaining of kidney biopsy sections revealed increased expression of phospho-STAT3 in both COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy and HIVAN as compared to control kidney tissue.

The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread concerns about the risk of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) receiving disease modifying ant-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and other immunosuppressants (IS). Methods. A SurveyMonkey based electronic survey was conducted amongst members of the Indian Rheumatology Association to understand the need for changes in prevailing practices. Results. Of the 861 invitees, 221 responded. In the wake of the pandemic, 47.5% would reduce biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) while only 12.2% would reduce the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs. 64.2% were likely to defer change in IS, the reluctance being most with rituximab (58.3%) followed by cyclophosphamide (53.3%), anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents (52.4%) and Janus kinase inhibitors (34.39%). Hydroxychloroquine was the preferred choice (81.9%) for the treatment of COVID-19 followed by protease inhibitors (22.1%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (8.1%). Chloroquine was less preferred (19%). More than two-thirds (70.5%) believed that COVID-19 might trigger macrophage activation syndrome. Social distancing (98.1%) and hand hygiene (74.6%) were recommended by majority. 62.8% would avoid touch for clinical examination whenever feasible. Conclusion. Most rheumatologists perceived the need to change treatment of RDs during the COVID-19 pandemic; reduce immunosuppression and defer the usage of rituximab and bDMARDs.","Gupta, L.; Misra, D.; Agarwal, V.; Balan, S.",,592,22

The newly developed, genetically engineered mRNA vaccines are critical for controlling the epidemic disease. However, major adverse effects, including neuroimmunological disorders, are being attributed to this vaccine. For instance, several cases of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in clinical trials. Here, we report an exceedingly rare case of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), a rare subtype of ATM involving three or more vertebral segments, that occurred shortly after vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine, with a comorbidity of vitamin B12 deficiency.

However, few field studies have been conducted on the effects of different office types and work areas on objective measurements of cognitive performance. The first aim of the present field study was to investigate, before relocation to an activity-based workplace (ABW), differences in performance on a concentration-demanding cognitive task between individuals in shared/open-plan offices compared to cell offices. The second aim was to investigate, after relocation, how performance differs (withinperson) between different work areas within the ABW. This study included employees from five offices (n = 113), of which four relocated into an ABW. An acoustician measured the equivalent sound levels of the work areas. Data were analyzed using linear regression (aim 1) and mixed models (aim 2). Before relocation, employees working in shared/open-plan offices performed significantly worse (14%) than those in cell-offices, which had a 15 LAeq lower noise level. After relocation, employees performed significantly worse in the active zone without noise restrictions, compared to all other work areas. When shifting open-plan area from the active zone to the quiet zone cognitive performance increased significantly by 16.9 %, and switching to individual working rooms increased performance by 21.9 %. The results clearly demonstrate the importance for organizations to provide quiet areas or rooms with few distractions for employees working on tasks that demand concentration in an ABW. A daily drop in performance for each employee may be expensive for the organization in the long run.","Jahncke, Helena; Hallman, David",J Environ Psychol,592,26

The aim of this article is to overview available evidence on the use of widely used antirheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine for additional indications. Hydroxychloroquine has endothelial stabilizing and anti-thrombotic effects. Its use has been explored as an adjunctive therapy in refractory thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome. It may also prevent recurrent pregnancy losses in the absence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Hydroxychloroquine favourably modulates atherogenic lipid and glycaemic profiles. Methotrexate has been tried for modulation of cardiovascular events in non-rheumatic clinical conditions, although a large clinical trial failed to demonstrate a benefit. Colchicine has been shown to successfully reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in a large multicentric trial. Potential antifibrotic effects of colchicine require further exploration. Hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate and colchicine are also being tried at different stages of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic for prophylaxis and treatment. While the use of these agents is being diversified, their adverse effects should be timely diagnosed and prevented. Hydroxychloroquine can cause retinopathy and rarely cardiac and auditory toxicity, retinopathy being dose and time dependent. Methotrexate can cause transaminitis, cytopenias and renal failure, particularly in acute overdoses. Colchicine can rarely cause myopathies, cardiomyopathy, cytopenias and transaminitis. Strong evidence is warranted to keep balance between benefits of repurposing these old antirheumatic drugs and risk of their adverse effects.","Misra, Durga Prasanna; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Zimba, Olena",Rheumatol Int,592,14

The disease has become a public health disaster, which has no effective medication. However, proper management and planning, which includes understanding the transmitting pattern, number of containment zones, vulnerable factors, and level of risk, may break the chain of transmission and reduce the number of cases. Hence, this study has attempted to model the COVID-19 vulnerability using an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, namely fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for West Bengal, India, through geographic information system (GIS). A total of 15 parameters were utilised to model the COVID-19 vulnerability, which was further categorised into three criteria: social vulnerability, epidemiological vulnerability, and physical vulnerability. The final vulnerability mapping has been done using these three criteria through the GIS platform. This study reveals that COVID-19 infection highly threatens about 20% of the total area of West Bengal, 23.42% moderately vulnerable, and 57.03% of the area comes under low vulnerability. The highly vulnerable region includes the Kolkata, South 24 Paraganas, and North 24 Paraganas, which are considered highly populated districts of West Bengal. Therefore government agencies should be more focused and plan accordingly to safeguard the community, especially the region with very high COVID-19 vulnerability, from further spreading the infection.","Malakar, Sukanta",Model Earth Syst Environ,592,16

During initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, symptomatic patients present with impaired type I/III IFN‐mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, IFNs regulate the cellular entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 on epithelial and endothelial cells. As reported recently, critically ill COVID‐19 patients show genetic polymorphisms in one IFN receptor gene (IFNRA2) and in a gene locus near the Janus kinase (JAK) TYK2, which is key for IFN, interleukin (IL)‐12 and IL‐23 signaling, and T helper (Th) 1/Th17 cell‐mediated antiviral immune responses. In the advanced stage of the disease, critically ill COVID‐19 patients develop a cytokine storm where many inflammatory mediators using the JAK/STAT signaling pathway such as IL‐6, IFN‐γ, the granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) or IL‐2, and chemokines result in an influx of macrophages and neutrophils damaging the lung tissue. The knowledge on the cytokine and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in severe COVID‐19 disease explains the promising first results with JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, which not only dampen the inflammation but in the case of baricitinib also affect virus replication and endocytosis in target cells. Here, we summarize the current immunological associations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with cytokine signaling, the JAK/STAT pathway, and the current clinical stage of JAK inhibitors for improving severe COVID‐19 disease.","Solimani, Farzan; Meier, Katharina; Ghoreschi, Kamran",Eur J Immunol,592,17

The objetic of this study was to determine risk factors related to infection and mortality from Covid-19 in KT. METHOD: We included 53 KT who had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection between march 21st and november 24th, from a total of 2030 KT. Outcomes related to patient survival were analyzed. RESULTS: 39 (73%) patients were men, with a mean age of 56±15 years old. Median time after KT where the infection took place was 104 months (IQR: 55-160). One patient was infected 40 days after transplant. 90% were on Tacrolimus therapy and 79% on MMF. 81% of patients were hypertensive, 36% diabetic and 19% had ischemic heart disease. 65% were on ARAII treatment. Clinical presentation consisted on pneumonia (64%), fever (55%), cough (70%), dyspnoea (45%), lymphopenia (66%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (36%). 21% required intubation and admission in ICU. 8 patients were asymptomatic. 18% received Hydroxychloroquine therapy plus Azithromycin, 11% Tocilizumab, 11% Ritonavir-Lopinavir, 59% steroids, 7.7% Remdesivir and 13.5% convalescent plasma. Immunosuppression was reduced in all symptomatic patients. 10 patients (19%) died. Table 1 compares the characteristics of these patients with those who survived. CONCLUSION: We concluded that mortality in KT is very high, more than reported in general population. Risk factors are patient age, time after KT, baseline renal function, the presence of pneumonia, as well as higher CRP levels at the time of diagnosis. More experience is needed to optimize our protocols and therapy for Covid-19 in KT.","Lopez, Veronica; Casas-González, Cristina; Vázquez, Teresa; Cabello, Mercedes; Poveda, Inmaculada; Hernández, Domingo",Nephrol Dial Transplant,592,5

We observed a total of 124 (25.6%) parasite-positive specimens that contained one or more parasites, including Giardia duodenalis (12.8%), Cryptosporidium spp. (4.9%), Cystoisospora spp. (4.3%), trichomonads (4.3%), Toxocara canis (3.5%), Trichuris vulpis (0.6%), and Dipylidium caninum (0.2%). Among the 55 dog breeds, infection rates were significantly higher in border collies and bulldogs, but lower in poodles (p < 0.05). Risk factor analysis suggested that age was negatively correlated with the infection rate (p < 0.00001), while vaccination and deworming in the past 12 months could significantly reduce the parasite infections (p < 0.01). Among the 62 Giardia-positive specimens, 21 were successfully assigned into assemblages using glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and/or beta-giardin (bg) genes, including assemblage D (n = 15), C (n = 5), and F (n = 1). Among the 24 Cryptosporidium-positive specimens by SSU rRNA PCR, 20 PCR amplicons could be sequenced and identified as Cryptosporidium canis (n = 20). Collectively, this study indicates that parasites are a significant group of pathogens in companion dogs in Beijing, and companion dogs may potentially transmit certain zoonotic parasites to humans, particularly those with weak or weakened immunity.","Yu, Zhongjia; Ruan, Yang; Zhou, Mengjie; Chen, Siyuan; Zhang, Yinxin; Wang, Liya; Zhu, Guan; Yu, Yonglan",Parasitol Res,592,16

Disruption to the normal running of diagnostic and assessment procedures, such as endoscopy, has resulted in the potential for secondary harm to patients including delayed diagnosis and delay in treatment. Difficult management decisions have been made in order to minimise COVID-19 risk for this patient group while avoiding harm. Initiating and continuing immunosuppressive and biological therapies in the absence of normal surveillance and diagnostic procedures have posed many challenges. Despite this, changes to working practices, including virtual clinic appointments, home faecal calprotectin testing kits and continued intensive support from clinical nurse specialists and other members of the multidisciplinary team, have resulted in patients still receiving a high standard of care, with those who require face-to-face intervention being highlighted. These changes have the potential to revolutionise the way in which patients receive routine care in the future, with the inclusion of telemedicine increasingly attractive for stable patients.

The review identified several problems that can contribute to incentive misalignment by compromising the triple aims (cost, quality, and access) in this epidemic. Some of these issues include the inefficacy of conventional payment mechanisms in providing incentives for providers, practice guidelines in pain management that are not easily implementable across different medical specialties, barriers in adopting multi-modal pain management strategies, low capacity of providers/treatments to address opioid/substance use disorders, the complexity of addressing the co-occurrence of chronic pain and opioid use disorders, and patients’ non-adherence to opioid substitution treatments.

During Stay-at-Home, nightly time in bed devoted to sleep (TIB, a proxy for sleep duration with regard to public health recommendations [5]) increased by ∼30 min during weekdays and by ∼24 mins on weekends and regularity of sleep timing improved by ∼12 min. Sleep timing became later by ∼50 min during weekdays and ∼25 min on weekends, and thus the difference between weekend and weekday sleep timing decreased - hence reducing the amount of social jetlag [6,7]. Further, we find individual differences in the change of TIB devoted to sleep such that students with shorter TIB at baseline before the first COVID-19 cases emerged locally had larger increases in weekday and weekend TIB during Stay-at-Home. The percentage of participants that reported 7 h or more sleep per night, the minimum recommended sleep duration for adults to maintain health [5] - including immune health - increased from 84% to 92% for weekdays during Stay-at-Home versus baseline. Understanding the factors underlying such changes in sleep health behaviors could help inform public health recommendations with the goal of improving sleep health during and following the Stay-at-Home orders of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wright, Kenneth P.; Linton, Sabrina K.; Withrow, Dana; Casiraghi, Leandro; Lanza, Shannon M.; Iglesia, Horacio de la; Vetter, Celine; Depner, Christopher M.",Curr Biol,592,24

In order to explore mutations and deletions in the spike (S) protein — the most‐discussed protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 — we comprehensively analyzed 35,750 complete S protein‐coding sequences through a custom Python‐based pipeline. This GISAID‐collected dataset of until 24 June 2020 covered six continents and five major climate zones. We identified 27,801 (77.77% sequences) mutated strains compared to reference Wuhan‐Hu‐1 wherein 84.40% of these strains mutated by only a single amino acid (aa). An outlier strain (EPI_ISL_463893) from Bosnia and Herzegovina possessed six aa substitutions. We also identified 11 residues with high aa mutation frequency, and each contains four types of aa variations. The infamous D614G variant has spread worldwide with ever‐rising dominance and across regions with different climatic conditions alongside L5F and D936Y mutants, which have been documented throughout all regions and climate zones, respectively. We also found 988 unique aa substitutions spanned across 660 residues, which differed significantly among different continents (p = .003) and climatic zones (p = .021) as inferred with the Kruskal–Wallis test. Besides, 17 in‐frame deletions at four sites adjacent to receptor‐binding‐domain were determined that may have a possible impact on attenuation. This study provides a fast and accurate pipeline for identifying mutations and deletions from the large dataset for coding and also non‐coding sequences as evidenced by the representative analysis on existing S protein data. By using separate multi‐sequence alignment, removing ambiguous sequences and in‐frame stop codons, and utilizing pairwise alignment, this method can derive both synonymous and non‐synonymous mutations (strain_ID reference aa:mutation position:strain aa). We suggest that the pipeline will aid in the evolutionary surveillance of any SARS‐CoV‐2 encoded proteins and will prove to be crucial in tracking the ever‐increasing variation of many other divergent RNA viruses in the future.

This article reviews the experimental evidence and current clinical application of IL-6/IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling inhibition for the prevention and treatment of allograft injury. RECENT FINDINGS: There exists a robust body of evidence linking IL-6 to allograft injury mediated by acute inflammation, adaptive cellular/humoral responses, innate immunity, and fibrosis. IL-6 promotes the acute phase reaction, induces B cell maturation/antibody formation, directs cytotoxic T-cell differentiation, and inhibits regulatory T-cell development. Importantly, blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R signaling pathway has been shown to mitigate its harmful effects in experimental studies, particularly in models of kidney and heart transplant rejection. Currently, available agents for IL-6 signaling inhibition include monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 or IL-6R and janus kinase inhibitors. Recent clinical trials have investigated the use of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6R mAb, for desensitization and treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in kidney transplant recipients, with promising initial results. Further studies are underway investigating the use of alternative agents including clazakizumab, an anti-IL-6 mAb, and application of IL-6 signaling blockade to clinical cardiac transplantation. SUMMARY: IL-6/IL-6R signaling inhibition provides a novel therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of allograft injury. To date, evidence from clinical trials supports the use of IL-6 blockade for desensitization and treatment of AMR in kidney transplant recipients. Ongoing and future clinical trials will further elucidate the role of IL-6 signaling inhibition in other types of solid organ transplantation.","Miller, Cynthia L.; Madsen, Joren C.",Curr Transplant Rep,592,20

More than two-thirds of circulating A (H3N2) viruses are antigenically and genetically different (drifted) from the A (H3N2) vaccine component of 2014 - 2015 northern and southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines. The purpose of this paper is to report a case of seasonal influenza A non-H1N1 infection that occurred in June 2015 in an adult cystic fibrosis patient with severe lung disease previously vaccinated with the anti-flu trivalent vaccine. The patient evolved to respiratory and renal failure (without rhabdomyolysis) and was placed under mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The clinical outcome was positive after 39 days of hospital stay. In addition, the patient was clinically stable after 18 months of follow-up. With the recent advances in critical care medicine and in cystic fibrosis treatment, survival with advanced pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis presents new questions and potential problems, which are still being formulated.","Penteado, Louise Piva; Osório, Cecília Susin; Balbinotto, Antônio; Dalcin, Paulo de Tarso Roth",Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,592,30

RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 h in advance? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, Fio(2), and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. RESULTS: We obtained data from more than 30,000 ICU patients (including more than 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-h prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC, 0.895 vs 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (P < .001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range of 0.918 to 0.943. INTERPRETATION: A transparent deep learning algorithm improves on traditional clinical criteria to predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients, including in those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians to optimize timing of tracheal intubation, to allocate resources and staff better, and to improve patient care.","Shashikumar, Supreeth P.; Wardi, Gabriel; Paul, Paulina; Carlile, Morgan; Brenner, Laura N.; Hibbert, Kathryn A.; North, Crystal M.; Mukerji, Shibani S.; Robbins, Gregory K.; Shao, Yu-Ping; Westover, M.
