San Jose Animal Care and Services implemented a new strategy designed to control overall feral cat reproduction by altering and returning feral cats entering the shelter system, rather than euthanizing the cats. The purpose of this case study was to determine how the program affected the shelter cat intakes over time. In just over four years, 10,080 individual healthy adult feral cats, out of 11,423 impounded at the shelter during this time frame, were altered and returned to their site of capture. Included in the 11,423 cats were 862 cats impounded from one to four additional times for a total of 958 (9.5%) recaptures of the previously altered 10,080 cats. The remaining 385 healthy feral cats were euthanized at the shelter from March 2010 to June 2014. Four years into the program, researchers observed cat and kitten impounds decreased 29.1%; euthanasia decreased from over 70% of intakes in 2009, to 23% in 2014. Euthanasia in the shelter for Upper Respiratory Disease decreased 99%; dead cat pick up off the streets declined 20%. Dog impounds did not similarly decline over the four years. No other laws or program changes were implemented since the beginning of the program.","Johnson, Karen L.; Cicirelli, Jon",PeerJ,312,1

However, as a developing country with the largest population, this rapid economic growth primarily based on excessive consumption and waste of resources. Thus, China has been facing particularly severe ecological and environmental problems in speeding up industrialization and urbanization. The impact of the health risk factors is complex and difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, it is critical to investigate potential threats in the context of the human-animal-environment interface to protect human and animal health. The “One Health” concept recognizes that human health is connected to animal and environmental health. This review primarily discusses specific health problems in China, particularly zoonoses, and explains the origin and development of the One Health approach, as well as the importance of a holistic approach in China.","Wu, Jianyong; Liu, Lanlan; Wang, Guoling; Lu, Jiahai",Infect Ecol Epidemiol,312,5
4344,4344,4344,Dissecting the Contemporary Clerkship: Theory‐based Educational Trial of Videos Versus Lectures in Medical Student Education,18.028978,3.0044496,2019-07-16,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing use of the flipped classroom (FC) technique in undergraduate medical education, the benefit in learning outcomes over lectures is inconsistent. Best practices in preclass video design principles are rarely used, and it is unclear if videos can replace lectures in contemporary medical education. METHODS: We conducted a prospective quasi‐experimental controlled educational study comparing theory‐based videos to traditional lectures in a medical student curriculum. Medical students enrolled in an emergency medicine clerkship were randomly assigned to either a lecture group (LG) or a video group (VG). The slide content was identical, and the videos aligned with cognitive load theory‐based multimedia design principles. Students underwent baseline (pretest), week 1 (posttest), and end‐of‐rotation (retention) written knowledge tests and an observed structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessment. We compared scores between both groups and surveyed student attitudes and satisfaction with respect to the two learning methods. RESULTS: There were 104 students who participated in OSCE assessments (49 LG, 55 VG) and 101 students who participated in knowledge tests (48 LG, 53 VG). The difference in OSCE scores was statistically significant 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 0.23 to 2.35, t(102) = 2.43, p = 0.017), but the actual score difference was small from an educational standpoint (12.61 for LG, 11.32 for VG). All three knowledge test scores for both groups were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Videos based on cognitive load theory produced similar results and could replace traditional lectures for medical students. Educators contemplating a FC approach should devote their valuable classroom time to active learning methods.","Yiu, Stella H. M.; Spacek, Alena M.; Pageau, Paul G.; Woo, Michael Y.

Otherwise, V was not found in virions, was not strongly associated with viral nucleocapsids like P, and anti-V had no effect on viral RNA synthesis in vitro under conditions where anti-P was highly inhibitory.

Learning to swim and wearing life jackets decrease drowning risk. We evaluated aquatic facilities’ policies regarding use of life jackets, clothing, and diapers through a lens of social justice, equity, and inclusion to ensure they met the needs of the diverse high-risk groups they serve and changing aquatic activities and programs. Public recreational pools, beach and waterpark facilities in the US and international organizations were surveyed regarding their policies on life jacket use, clothing, and diapers between 2015 and 2016. A total of 562 facilities responded, mostly pools. Almost all facilities allowed wearing life jackets in the shallow end but less so in the deep end, and wearing of T-shirts, shorts, and clothes for modesty reasons. Policies varied most on wearing non-swim clothes. Almost universal requirement of diapers applied to infants only. Respondents’ reported themes included cost, access, safety, hygiene and equipment maintenance. Reviewed policies generally reflected facilities’ responsiveness to diverse populations’ specific needs. However, policy variations around wearing clothing and swim diapers could be costly, confusing, and impede participation in aquatic activities by vulnerable populations, specifically young children and racial and ethnic minorities. Standardization of these policies could assist aquatic facilities and their users. A best-practices-based policy is outlined.","Beale-Tawfeeq, Angela; Quan, Linda; Bennett, Elizabeth; Fielding, Roy R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,312,27

18169,18169,18169,Postgraduate ethics training programs: a systematic scoping review,18.493862,2.652775,2021-06-09,"ABSTRACT: Smokeless tobacco products (STP) contain diverse microbial communities that contribute to the formation of harmful chemical byproducts. This is concerning since 300 million individuals around the globe are users of smokeless tobacco. Significant evidence has shown that microbial metabolic activities mediate the formation of carcinogens during manufacturing. In recent years, studies have revealed a series of additional health impacts that include lesions and inflammation of the oral mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract, as well as alterations of the endogenous microbiota. These findings are due to recent developments in molecular technologies that allowed researchers to better examine the microbial component of these products. This new information illustrates the scale of the STP microbiota and its diversity in the finished product that is sold for consumption. Additionally, the application of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics has provided the tools to look at phylogenies across bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic groups, their functional capacities, and viability. Here we present key examples of tobacco microbiology research that utilizes newer approaches and strategies to define the microbial component of smokeless tobacco products. We also highlight challenges in these approaches, the knowledge gaps being filled, and those gaps that warrant further study. A better understanding of the microbiology of STP brings vast public health benefits. It will provide important information for the product consumer, impact manufacturing practices, and provide support for the development of attainable and more meaningful regulatory goals. KEY POINTS: Newer technologies allowed quicker and more comprehensive identification of microbes in tobacco samples, encapsulating microorganisms difficult or impossible to culture. Current research in smokeless tobacco microbiology is filling knowledge gaps previously unfilled due to the lack of suitable approaches. The microbial ecology of smokeless tobacco presents a clearer picture of diversity and variability not considered before.

The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of two biosurfactants (BS), produced by Lactobacillus crispatus BC1 and Lactobacillus gasseri BC9, on the skin permeation profile of hydrocortisone (HC, model drug). HC aqueous solubility and in vitro diffusion studies through porcine skin were performed in the presence of BC1-BS and BC9-BS at concentrations below and above critical micellar concentrations (CMC). Moreover, skin hydration tests and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis were performed to further investigate BS interaction with the outermost layer of the skin. Both BS increased HC solubility, especially at concentrations above their CMC. At concentrations below the CMC, drug permeation through the skin was improved, as the result of a dual effect: a) the formation of a superficial lipophilic environment, as confirmed by the reduction in skin hydration and b) the interaction between BS and the stratum corneum (SC), as demonstrated by the DSC curves. From the obtained data, it appears that BC1-BS and BC9-BS could represent new promising green excipients for drug permeation enhancement through the skin.","Abruzzo, Angela; Parolin, Carola; Corazza, Elisa; Giordani, Barbara; di Cagno, Massimiliano Pio; Cerchiara, Teresa; Bigucci, Federica; Vitali, Beatrice; Luppi, Barbara",Pharmaceutics,312,1

Our hypothesis was that diaphragm dysfunction is not particularly associated with weaning-induced pulmonary oedema. METHODS: It was a single-centre and physiological study conducted in patients who had failed a first spontaneous breathing trial and who underwent a second trial. The diaphragm function was evaluated by measuring the tracheal pressure generated in response to a bilateral magnetic phrenic nerves stimulations. Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema was diagnosed in case of failure of the spontaneous breathing trial if patients exhibited signs of plasma concentration or echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure elevation. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included and 31/53 (58%) failed the spontaneous breathing trial, including 24/31 (77%) patients with weaning-induced pulmonary oedema. Diaphragm dysfunction was present in 33/53 (62%) patients. Diaphragm dysfunction or weaning-induced pulmonary oedema were present in 26/31 (84%) of the patients who failed the spontaneous breathing trial. Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema occurred in 20/33 (61%) patients with a diaphragm dysfunction and in 4/20 (20%) patients without (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema was three times more frequent in case of diaphragm dysfunction. Even in case of diaphragm dysfunction, physicians might be encouraged to investigate the presence of weaning-induced pulmonary oedema during weaning failure.","Dres, Martin; Rozenberg, Emmanuel; Morawiec, Elise; Mayaux, Julien; Delemazure, Julie; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Ann Intensive Care,312,1

This study presents the recognition of the new physiological races of P. triticina, their distribution, and their resistance genes in wheat cultivars, which are critical for directing and improving wheat breeding programs for resistance to leaf rust. Winds often transport the pathogen’s initial inoculum from one country to another. Our findings trigger an alert to the whole world about developing races capable of supplanting leaf rust resistance. ABSTRACT: Characterization of the genetic structure and the physiological races of Puccinia triticina is a growing necessity to apply host genetic resistance against wheat leaf rust as a successful control strategy. Herein, we collected and identified about 130 isolates of P. triticina from 16 Egyptian commercial wheat cultivars grown at different locations, over two seasons (2019/2020 and 2020/2021). The 130 isolates of P. triticina were segregated into 17 different physiological races. TTTST and TTTKS were the most common virulent races, whereas TTTST and MTTGT were the most frequent races. The races were classified into three groups, based on their distinct DNA band sizes (150 bp, 200 bp, and 300 bp) after RAPD analysis. The new wheat cultivars (Sakha-94, Sakha-95, and Shandweel-1) infected with the most virulent race (TTTST), Gemmeiza-12, and Misr-3 were resistant to all physiological races. The resistance of these cultivars was mostly due to the presence of Lr19- and Lr28-resistant genes. Our results serve as a warning about emerging aggressive races capable of supplanting resistance to leaf rust, and help in the understanding of the pathotype–cultivar–location association and its role in the susceptibility/resistance of new wheat cultivars to P. triticina.","Omara, Reda Ibrahim; Nehela, Yasser; Mabrouk, Ola Ibrahim; Elsharkawy, Mohsen Mohamed",Biology (Basel),312,1

It has been an opportunity to reexamine the meteorological event and assess the potential of CNR-ISAC models, after more than 20 years of development, to accurately simulate the heavy precipitation at different lead times. The predictability of this extreme event has been studied on a wide range of space and time scales, from subseasonal to convection resolving, using a variety of model setups and initial conditions. The subseasonal experiment produces a precipitation anomaly that, even if underestimated, indicates some predictability beyond the second forecast week. At shorter ranges, results indicate that there is a consistent improvement in the precipitation forecast going from low-resolution hydrostatic to high-resolution nonhydrostatic models. It is only at very high resolution (500 m) that the convective activity extending to the north of the divide line of the Ligurian Apennines, which was responsible for the flood of the Tanaro River, is predicted with an intensity comparable with rain gauge observations.

Most parasitic diseases caused by protozoans are neglected, particularly those associated with poverty and tropical countries, but the paucity of drug treatments and vaccines combined with increasing problems of drug resistance are becoming major concerns for their control and eradication. In this climate, the discovery/repurposing of new drugs and increasing effort in vaccine development should be supplemented with an exploration of new alternative/synergic treatment strategies. Viruses, either native or engineered, have been employed successfully as highly effective and selective therapeutic approaches to treat cancer (oncolytic viruses) and antibiotic-resistant bacterial diseases (phage therapy). Increasing evidence is accumulating that many protozoan, but also helminth, parasites harbour a range of different classes of viruses that are mostly absent from humans. Although some of these viruses appear to have no effect on their parasite hosts, others either have a clear direct negative impact on the parasite or may, in fact, contribute to the virulence of parasites for humans. This review will focus mainly on the viruses identified in protozoan parasites that are of medical importance. Inspired and informed by the experience gained from the application of oncolytic virus- and phage-therapy, rationally-driven strategies to employ these viruses successfully against parasitic diseases will be presented and discussed in the light of the current knowledge of the virus biology and the complex interplay between the viruses, the parasite hosts and the human host.

The contributions to our understanding of the respiratory abnormalities along the course of increasing COPD severity and the diagnostic use of this method were also evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five individuals with no history of smoking or pulmonary diseases (control group) and 141 individuals with diagnoses of COPD were studied, being classified into 45 mild, 42 moderate, 36 severe and 18 very severe cases. RESULTS: This study has shown initially that the course of increasing COPD severity was adequately described by the model parameters. This resulted in significant and consistent correlations among these parameters and spirometric indexes. Additionally, this evaluation enhanced our understanding of the respiratory abnormalities in different COPD stages. The diagnostic accuracy analyses provided evidence that hysteresivity, obtained from FrOr modeling, allowed a highly accurate identification in patients with mild changes [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)= 0.902]. Similar analyses in groups of moderate and severe patients showed that peripheral resistance, derived from InOr modeling, provided the most accurate parameter (AUC=0.898 and 0.998, respectively), while in very severe patients, traditional, InOr and FrOr parameters were able to reach high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). CONCLUSION: InOr and FrOr modeling improved our knowledge of the respiratory abnormalities along the course of increasing COPD severity. In addition, the present study provides evidence that these models may contribute in the diagnosis of COPD. Respiratory oscillometry exams require only tidal breathing and are easy to perform. Taken together, these practical considerations and the results of the present study suggest that respiratory oscillometry associated with InOr and FrOr models may help to improve lung function tests in COPD.","Ribeiro, Caroline Oliveira; Lopes, Agnaldo José; de Melo, Pedro Lopes",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,312,16

However, there is a lack of studies examining the prevalence of and factors associated with compassionate and respectful care practice in low-resource countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the practice of compassionate and respectful care and its associated factors among the health workforce (HWF). METHODS: This mixed-methods study was conducted through quantitative and qualitative data collection from April to May 2019 in North Shewa Zone health care facilities (NSHFs). For quantitative analysis, participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Participants for qualitative analysis were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Data entries were made by EpiData version 3.2 and exported to SPSS version 23 software for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the associated factors. Thematic analysis was carried out for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 392 HWF responded to a self-administered survey, and 72 participants participated in focus group discussions (FGDs). Four categories of themes emerged: definition/knowledge, barriers, benefit, and leadership will. The prevalence of compassionate and respectful care practices was 38.8% and 46.2%, respectively. Female gender, health officer role, having a monthly salary equal to or greater than 5000 Ethiopian birr, and a positive attitude were significantly associated with compassionate care practice. The age category of 30–39, positive attitude, and ensuring a safe and clean care environment were significantly associated with respectful care practice. CONCLUSION: Compassionate and respectful care among HWF requires an actual demonstration of humanity and kindness to promote person-centered practice for their clients. Therefore, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health should emphasize CRC continuity by including it in the health care curriculum, improving the health care ethics skill gap, designing appropriate policy to reduce workload, and promoting patient rights.","Jemal, Kemal; Hailu, Dejene; Mekonnen, Mathewos; Tesfa, Bikila; Bekele, Kumera; Kinati, Tadele",Z Gesundh Wiss,312,26

This development is somewhat driven by global demand for energy security, climate change mitigation and sustainability-related needs. However, within Nigeria’s context, over-dependence on fossil fuels marked with epileptic power crisis has continuously characterized her economic development. Though recognized as a leading West African energy producing country, Nigeria has failed to maximize and translate its abundant energy resources, including renewables into a detectable, securable transformative energy production and supply. This chapter argues explicitly that a transition to renewables is of critical importance for a secured and sustainable energy future in the country. The chapter, adopting an analytical method, examines renewable energy prospect for energy security in Nigeria, and how challenges to its exploitation can be overcome through inclusive and effective market policy strategies.","Nwedu, Cosmos Nike",Energy Transitions and the Future of the African Energy Sector,312,1

Under normative pressure, large firms with farsightedness take up the environmental practices as industry leaders. In a little mature emerging economy, such as India, where triple bottom line awareness is growing, the government facilitates the firms to operate in an environment-friendly ecosystem. We investigate how do environmental compliance and environmental practices influence the overall firm performance? The performance was measured in terms of financial, customer, internal business process, and learning and growth performance. A survey instrument was designed using well-established scales and administered to the middle to top-level corporate management executives to gather 240 data from the Indian firms. A rigorous statistical validity, diagnostics, and SEM were used to test the hypotheses. The environmental practices showed a full mediation effect on the effect of environmental compliance on performance. The examination of mediation relationships in an environmental context is limited in the reported literature. This paper is among the initial works that deal with complicated mediation relationships drawn from institutional theory propositions.

METHODS: SNAP-Ed staff in Louisiana distributed an electronic survey to potential participants and community partners which asked participants to report their attitudes about behaviors used to slow the spread of COVID-19 and preferences for the delivery of virtual nutrition education. Pearson chi squared tests were used to assess differences in responses across categories of race, age, and SNAP-Ed eligibility. Unadjusted odds ratios were then calculated using logistic regression to evaluate the effects of race, age, and SNAP-Ed eligibility on each dependent variable of interest. Finally, adjusted odds ratios were calculated using a model which included age, eligibility for SNAP-Ed, and race. RESULTS: Of 458 participants, the majority were white (62%), female (91%), aged 18–50 (65%), and eligible for SNAP-Ed (57%). Most agreed with the importance of handwashing (99%), maintaining physical distance (95%), and wearing face masks (79%). African Americans had significantly higher odds of agreeing that it was important to wear a mask compared to white participants, and this did not change in the adjusted model which included SNAP-Ed eligibility and age category (Adjusted OR 15.90 [6.25, 40.4]) African Americans were also more concerned about the risk posed by in-person programming and more likely to report that they would prefer live virtual lessons, online quizzes, and workbooks than white participants. CONCLUSIONS: It may be appropriate for nutrition education conducted with this population to occur in person, because most potential participants agree with COVID-19 precautions. However, educators working with majority white populations should exercise caution given that the participants who felt it was not important to wear masks were overwhelmingly white. Attitudes expressed by African American participants indicate that nutrition education for African Americans may better reach participants if it is done virtually rather than in-person.

TET2 gene is one of the commonly found mutated genes in BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, the prevalence of TET2 gene mutations in the disease remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of TET2 gene mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms. The findings may be helpful for future research, diagnoses and the identification of better therapeutic strategies to manage the diseases. ABSTRACT: Multiple recurrent somatic mutations have recently been identified in association with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This meta-analysis aims to assess the pooled prevalence of TET2 gene mutations among patients with MPN. Six databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Embase) were searched for relevant studies from inception till September 2020, without language restrictions. The eligibility criteria included BCR-ABL-negative MPN adults with TET2 gene mutations. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses explored results among different continents and countries, WHO diagnostic criteria, screening methods and types of MF. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020212223). Thirty-five studies were included (n = 5121, 47.1% female). Overall, the pooled prevalence of TET2 gene mutations in MPN patients was 15.5% (95% CI: 12.1–19.0%, I(2) = 94%). Regional differences explained a substantial amount of heterogeneity. The prevalence of TET2 gene mutations among the three subtypes PV, ET and MF were 16.8%, 9.8% and 15.7%, respectively. The quality of the included studies was determined to be moderate–high among 83% of the included studies. Among patients with BCR-ABL-negative MPN, the overall prevalence of TET2 gene mutations was 15.5%.","Chia, Yuh Cai; Islam, Md Asiful; Hider, Phil; Woon, Peng Yeong; Johan, Muhammad Farid; Hassan, Rosline; Ramli, Marini",Cancers (Basel),312,20

However, standard poverty measures only consider the monetary aspect of poverty, neglecting the multidimensional nature of the phenomenon. The last decades have offered solid empirical evidence to guide political efforts to tackle both multidimensional wellbeing and poverty. In these times of rising inequalities, these efforts seem particularly valuable for identifying the most vulnerable groups. While Italy has made significant progress in defining multidimensional wellbeing, less attention has been given to multidimensional poverty. Hence, the goal of this paper is to offer a means for measuring multidimensional poverty (MPI) in Italy based on the Alkire-Foster method by using a widely recognized national framework for wellbeing (BES equitable and sustainable wellbeing) as the normative basis for the construction of the index. The contribution of the paper is twofold: (1) on the theoretical side, it seeks to increase the usability of national and international frameworks for wellbeing by proposing a national assessment scheme as a normative base for defining the dimensions of poverty; (2) on the empirical side, it provides evidence on the frequency and composition of multidimensional poverty in Italian regions. The results show that multidimensional poverty in Italy has increased over time, with the percentage of individuals considered as multidimensionally poor rising from 9.5 percent in 2005 to 17.5 percent in 2015. Moreover, a dimensional breakdown across regions and logistic regression shows that being older, female, from the South and married or widowed increases the probability of facing multidimensional poverty.","De Rosa, Dalila",Ital Econ J,312,24

Despite this decline affecting the industry at large and the incomes of fishers, some fishers have carried on, or even freshly started or returned to the business. Why have these fishers done so despite the challenges they encounter in the fishing industry? In this article, we investigate why some fishers still choose to fish in the wake of all the EU regulations designed to control overfishing by reducing the size of the industry and discouraging entry by taking measures that affect revenues. Our data are collected through ethnographic research involving participant observation and interviews with fishers in North Shields, England. Based on our findings, we argue that the decision to carry on fishing, or even to return, is predominantly based on so-called intrinsic motivations, rather than on cost-benefit calculations, and stems from three interlinked basic human emotional needs which fishing seems to fulfil: the need to connect (sometimes also defined as the need to relate or belong); the desire for autonomy; and the desire to show competence (and have that competence recognized by relevant others). As such, the findings offer a fresh way to explain fishers’ decisions, based on a deliberated choice, to remain or leave the sector, and to understand and interrogate the challenges confronting present-day fishing both on a local level in the UK and also for Europe at large.","Christy, Des; de Jong, Edwin B.

In this study, interviews were conducted with 17 elementary school teachers who had participated in one of five selected residential programs in the Czech Republic in 2018 – 2019. As the findings show, all the teachers found the residential programs beneficial for their teaching. However, a majority of the teachers reported that the most significant outcome was the improvement in the students’ interpersonal competence and in the relationship between the teachers and their students. Interestingly, the effect of the residential programs on developing the students’ environmental understanding, attitudes, and values remained secondary or was questioned by the teachers. The aspect that the teachers appreciated most was the application of experiential learning methods providing emotional experiences for the students. The paper discusses the possible reasons for such perceptions of these programs and the implications for practice.","Cincera, Jan; Zalesak, Jan; Kolenaty, Miloslav; Simonova, Petra; Johnson, Bruce",Journal of Outdoor and Environmental Education,312,16

In order to understand its pathogenesis, targeted next-generation gene sequencing was performed on 77 Chinese EA patients and 431 Chinese healthy controls to obtain differential genomic variations. Among the 41 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) screened for mutation sites in more than 3 patients, filaggrin gene FLG rs192116923 T>G and FLG rs75235053 C>G were newly found to be associated with EA patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) (P <0.001) and severe EA (P=0.032), respectively. Filaggrin has been shown to be mainly expressed in epithelial cells and plays an important role in formation of an effective skin barrier. Bioinformatic analysis indicated FLG rs192116923 T>G may increase the binding of Smad3 to transmit TGF-β1 signaling, and thereby inhibit filaggrin expression, and FLG rs75235053 C>G may add new splicing sites to reduce filaggrin monomers. It has been known that the level of Th2 cytokine IL-4 is increased in EA patients, and IL-4 increases airway epithelial permeability and enhances inflammatory response through some unclear mechanisms. To figure out whether filaggrin is involved in immune responses in asthma, we have treated human respiratory epithelial cell line BEAS-2B cells with IL-4 and found that the expression levels of filaggrin and E-cadherin decreased significantly in a time and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that IL-4 increased airway epithelial permeability by reducing filaggrin and adhesion molecule. In addition, in our study, IL-4 increased the expression of epithel-derived inflammatory cytokines IL-33 and TSLP which further enhanced the Th2 inflammatory response. To investigate the role of filaggrin in development of EA, knockdown filaggrin with siRNA revealed a decrease in E-cadherin levels, which were further down-regulated by IL-4 stimulation. Knockdown of filaggrin alone did not affect the levels of IL-33 and TSLP, but further exacerbated the decrease of IL-33/TSLP caused by IL-4, suggesting that filaggrin may involve in IL-4R signaling pathway to regulate the level of IL-33/TSLP. In conclusion, in the Th2 cytokine milieu of asthma, FLG deficient mutation in airway epithelial cells may increase the epithelial permeability and the expression of IL-33/TSLP which positively feedback the Th2 inflammation response.","Gao, Wei; Gong, Jiuyu; Mu, Mi; Zhu, Yujin; Wang, Wenjuan; Chen, Wen; Han, Guojing; Hu, Hong; Bao, Pengtao",Front Immunol,312,1

The situation presented enormous challenges for many mathematics lecturers who had not delivered lectures or tutorials online before. This study looks closely at what a traditional (in-person) mathematics tutorial encompasses and examines learners’ needs with respect to support within a remotely delivered module. The work focuses on how well various formats of remote support address the affordances of the traditional in-person tutorial. The range of support formats explored here includes live tutorials, written homework with feedback, group work via breakout rooms in Zoom, a discussion forum and instant formative feedback through Canvas quizzes and the e-assessment tool Numbas. The effectiveness of the different formats of remote support is assessed through examining student engagement and student and lecturer feedback. Six student cohorts, of levels ranging from first year to MSc level, across three different departments, taking either a mathematics or statistics module, participated in the study and were surveyed on their experience and future preferences. The work highlights some of the key issues surrounding remote support within mathematics modules and discusses the findings in the context of the implications for a lecturer and the factors to consider when deciding on a strategy for remote learning.

BACKGROUND Arterial revascularization is a mainstay in patients with CLI. Previous diagnostic angiography is a crucial step that can be affected by CM injection discomfort compromising the revascularization results, and it could vary related to the CM agents. METHODS One hundred forty-eight patients received Iodixanol 270 mg iodine pro ml or Ioversol 320 mg iodine pro ml in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. Injection-associated discomfort was assessed by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). Diagnostic efficacy and safety up to 1 week were evaluated. RESULTS The incidence of pain has been around 50% of the all population in study, with lesser incidence of pain (25.7% vs 74.3%; P < 0.0001) and of heat sensation (55.4% vs 85.1%; P < 0.0001), after Iodixanol than after Ioversol injection. Discomfort mean score, according to VAS assessment, was less in the Iodixanol group (8.1 ± 15.3) than in the Ioversol group (36.0 ± 29.7), after first injection (P < 0.001) and for all injections (P < 0.001). A significant difference was also observed in favor of Iodixanol (P < 0.001), respect to mean score of discomfort and heat sensation, assessed by the operators after all the CM injections. CONCLUSIONS Iodixanol caused less frequent and severe discomfort, characterized as pain and heat during intra-arterial administration compared with Ioversol. The pain severity is tightly related to image and diagnosis quality with an impact on the patients for additional injections and larger CM volumes.","Palena, Luis Mariano; Sacco, Zeno Dal; Brigato, Cesare; Sultato, Enrico; Barra, Domenico; Candeo, Alessandro; Manzi, Marco",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,312,26

However, the molecular basis for the interaction between HCP and Aβ remains unclear. Herein, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the conformational conversion of an Aβ40 monomer at different concentrations (0-40 mM) of HCP at the atomic level. It is confirmed that the conformational transition of the Aβ40 monomer is prevented by HCP in a concentration-dependent manner in silico. In 40 mM HCP solution, the initial α-helix-rich conformation of Aβ40 monomer is kept under the action of HCP. The intra-peptide hydrophobic collapse and D23-K28 salt bridge are prevented by HCP. Moreover, it is indicated that the non-polar binding energy dominates the binding between HCP and Aβ40 monomer as evaluated by molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method. And, the residues of F4, Y10, V12, L17 and L34 in Aβ40 might contribute to the binding energy in HCP-Aβ40 complex. All these results elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of HCP against the conformational transformation of Aβ40, providing a support that HCP may be developed as a potential anti-Aβ compound for the treatment of Aβ-related diseases.

The da Vinci Surgical System was used to mobilize the colon and duodenum, and a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy was performed with hand-sewn anastomosis. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications. The blood loss was minimal and operative time was 120 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful with resolution of intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION Robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy as a surgical option for treatment of SMA syndrome is safe, feasible, and a valid alternative to open surgery with the added benefits of a minimally invasive approach.","Ayloo, Subhashini M; Masrur, Mario A; Bianco, Francesco M; Giulianotti, Pier C",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We evaluated echocardiographic correlates of transplant-free survival, re-intervention, and left ventricular (LV) function in mid-term follow-up. METHODS This retrospective, single-center study included all infants with CAS who underwent Ross by 1 year of age from 1/2000 to 9/2018. Serial echocardiograms were analyzed for LV ejection fraction (EF) and systolic and diastolic longitudinal strain (LS). The primary outcome was mortality or transplant; secondary outcomes were re-intervention and abnormal LVEF (≤55%). RESULTS In 40 infants (30 [75%] male; median age at Ross 51 days) with median follow-up 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.0-9.4), the primary outcome was met in 11/40 (28%). Transplant-free survival was 79%, 77%, and 69% at 1, 5, and 10 years post Ross. Predictors of transplant or death included neonatal surgery, cross-clamp time, and pre-operative left atrial dilatation and lower LVEF. Median freedom from re-intervention was at 7.1 years post Ross, with no identified associations. LV LS improved 1 year post-Ross (-21.1±3.8% vs. -17.4±5.1%, p=0.02), although LVEF did not reach significance. Lower LVEF at 1 year was related to pre-Ross LA dilatation (p=0.02), abnormal LVEF (p=0.04), and lower early diastolic LS rate (p=0.03). LVEF remained stable 3-years post Ross. CONCLUSION Both transplant-free survival and normalization of LV function post Ross in infancy are associated with pre-operative LV systolic and diastolic measures, highlighting the prognostic value of echocardiography in this population. Further data are necessary in a larger, multicenter cohort, to allow for more precise risk stratification.","Porter, Andrew; Yu, Sunkyung; Lowery, Ray; Fifer, Carlen G; Lu, Jimmy C",Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,312,1

The aim of this study is to compare the existing COVID-19 pre-operative screening protocols to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in surgical samples. METHODS We conducted a prospective study with consecutive convenience sampling of children undergoing adenoidectomy between January and April 2021. Total nucleic acid was extracted from adenoid tissue and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was conducted to test for presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Univariate logistic regression was used to summarize the effect size of variables of interest on the odds of having SARS-CoV-2 positive adenoid tissue. RESULTS Forty adenoid samples were collected and 11 (27.5%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction. Patients with positive adenoids were older (11.8 years vs 7.9 years, OR: 1.3, p=0.01) and more likely to have had a positive nasopharyngeal swab in the previous 90 days (4/11 or 36% vs 0). CONCLUSION This data is the first report on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in pediatric adenoidectomy specimens, with a high percentage of patients showing evidence of viral particles within the adenoid. This finding calls in to question the utility of preoperative COVID screening protocols which have yet to be rigorously validated in asymptomatic patients and have the potential to delay patients' surgical care.

In EDS, it has been reported that even conventional catheter diagnostic angiography may result in large artery dissections and vessel rupture. In addition, the treatment of CCF in EDS type IV can result in up to 59% mortality after initial treatment, of which 23% is attributed to direct complications of treatment. We present the case of a patient with EDS type IV who previously had spontaneous dissection and multiple pseudoaneurysms of both the iliac and femoral arteries and the distal abdominal aorta.

METHODS Systematic review of international, peer-reviewed literature. Development of the prepublished protocol and search strategy was done in consultation with stakeholder reference groups consisting of people with lived experience of long-term conditions, advocates and clinicians. We searched academic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, AMED, CINAHL, Proquest Dissertations and Theses database, and Business Source Complete for controlled trials comparing a specific vocational intervention against a control intervention or usual care, published between 1 January 2004 and 1 August 2019. Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and appraised studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Seven studies investigated Individual Placement and Support (IPS) modified for people who were not in intensive mental health treatment services. These studies occurred settings such as community vocational rehabilitation services, a housing programme and community mental health services. The studies provided very low quality evidence that people who receive IPS-style vocational rehabilitation are more likely to gain competitive employment than people who receive usual care (risk ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.34, seven studies, 1611 participants). The remaining four studies considered cognitive behavioural therapy or specific vocational rehabilitation interventions designed to fit a unique context. There was insufficient evidence from these studies to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of non-IPS forms of vocational rehabilitation for people with mild to moderate mental health conditions. DISCUSSION The meta-analysis showed a clear intervention effect but low precision, and more high-quality studies are needed in this field. There is currently very low quality evidence that IPS-style intervention results in more participants in competitive employment compared with 'usual care' control groups in populations with mild to moderate mental health conditions.","Fadyl, Joanna K; Anstiss, David; Reed, Kirk; Khoronzhevych, Mariya; Levack, William M M",BMJ open,312,1

The results showed that the carnauba powder treated with bentonite (CPTB) showed a better percentage of removal of Cu(II) ions when compared to natural carnauba powder (NCP). The best results for both adsorbents were obtained with pH 5. The adsorption kinetics was governed by the pseudo-second-order model for both bioadsorbents studied. While the isothermal behavior was governed by the Langmuir model and showed that the adsorption capacity of the CPTB for Cu(II) was 21.98 mg·g-1. The interaction of the metal and CPTB was also investigated by means of thermodynamic parameters showing that the adsorption process is not spontaneous, although the values of ΔG° decrease with the increase in temperature from 20 to 40 °C and endothermic causing an increase in the degree of disorder at the solid/liquid interface.

With bronchospasm and laryngospasm being most common. Standard treatment for bronchospasm is administration of inhaled salbutamol, via pressurised metered dose inhaler. There is little evidence on the best method of attaching the pressurised metered dose inhaler to the artificial airway during general anesthesia. AIM To investigate the best method to deliver aerosolised salbutamol via pressurised metered dose inhaler to the lungs of an anesthetised child. METHODS We measured salbutamol delivered by pressurised metered dose inhaler through different sized tracheal tubes, supraglottic airway devices and tracheostomies in vitro for methods commonly employed for connecting the pressurised metered dose inhaler to the artificial airway. Breathing was simulated for patients weighing 3, 16, 50 and 75 kg. Pressurised metered dose inhaler actuation coincided with inspiration. RESULTS A pressurised metered dose inhaler combined with an in-line non-valved or valved spacer, or the direct method, when delivered via tracheal tube, was linked with improved delivered dose of salbutamol, compared to all other methods for 3 or 50 kg simulated patients weights. The delivered dose when using a non-valved spacer was greater than all methods for 16 and 75 kg patient weights. A spacer improved delivery for the flexible supraglottic airway device type and there was no difference with or without a spacer for remaining types. CONCLUSION Via tracheal tube and non-valved spacer, the following doses should be delivered after single actuation of a 100 µg labelled-claim salbutamol dose: ~2 µg kg-1 per actuation to a 3 kg neonate, ~1 µg kg-1 per actuation to a 16 kg child, and ~0.5 µg kg-1 per actuation for a 50-75 kg child. The least effective methods were the syringe, and the uni- and bidirectional adaptor methods, which require replacement by the direct method if a spacer is unavailable.","Anderson, Natalie; Schultz, André; Ditcham, William; von Ungern-Sternberg, Britta S",Paediatric anaesthesia,312,12

Although antiviral therapy has been markedly improved by the licensing of direct-acting antivirals, safety, resistance, high costs and difficult-to-treat patients remain important challenges. AREAS COVERED This article focuses and comments on the recent development of synthetic anti-lipopolysaccharide peptides (SALPs) which bind to highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan/heparan sulfate (HS) on cell surface. HS serves as a primary docking site for several viruses to their respective host cells before the viruses interact with their cell surface receptor(s). In vitro studies have shown that SALPs inhibit entry of HCV without cell toxicity. EXPERT OPINION SALPs prevent viral infection in cell culture model systems. Treatment studies of established HCV infection in cell culture models as well as proof-of-concept and safety studies in animal models are needed to evaluate their potential for drug development. The mechanism of action of SALPs as entry inhibitors suggests a potential application for HCV-infected patients to prevent reinfection of the liver graft in liver transplantation. Potential limitations may include high doses to obtain an antiviral effect and a target which is widely expressed and has a key function in cell physiology.","Habersetzer, François; Leboeuf, Céline; Doffoël, Michel; Zeisel, Mirjam B; Baumert, Thomas F",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,312,19

The rapidly growing awareness of SARS-CoV-2 virology offers a large number of possible drug targets. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is steadily updating the treatment protocol for COVID-19 based on the recent clinical trials. In the present review, we have summarised the possible mode of action, clinical evidence, consequences of the dexamethasone as a therapeutic agent against Covid-19. Currently, there are many corticosteroids tested in ongoing randomised trials. Dexamethasone could come as a lifesaving drug. Dexamethasone drug looks useful only in those patients who are already in a critical state. We might allow dexamethasone as a fascinating shot if the long-term health effects of Covid-19 recovered patients safeguard favourable clinical meanings. It is commonly accepted to reinforce approved drugs in the fight against newly emerging diseases such as COVID-19 as these drugs have established pharmacokinetic profiles and protection. The current focus should be on the development of novel proven therapeutics along with vaccines.

Dogs with endotoxin-induced septic shock were subjected to intravenous infusion of saline solution or rhBNP at the concentrations of 5 μg/kg (low-dose intervention group) or 10 μg/kg (high-dose intervention group). At 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, the systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) as well as serum levels of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB-1) and creatinine were measured, and kidney tissue samples were taken for histological examination. We have found that low and high doses of rhBNP could significantly reduce kidney tissue damage, such as tubular epithelial swelling and atrophy, and interstitial cell swelling in response to LPS injection in the dog sepsis models. rhBNP administration significantly reduced SVRI and serum levels of creatinine in dogs with LPS-induced sepsis in a dose-dependent manner, and attenuated the rise in the circulating HMGB-1. In conclusion, these findings suggest that rhBNP may exert dose-dependent protective effect on kidney tissue with endotoxin-induced injury, and this effect may be associated with the changes in blood levels of HMGB-1. rhBNP may be considered as therapeutic agents for treating sepsis-induced AKI.","Li, Nan; Jin, Hong-Xu; Song, Zhi; Bai, Chuan-Zhe; Cui, Yan; Gao, Yan",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,312,1

These cases require more technically demanding procedures, and handedness of the surgeon may influence performance of these operations. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been proposed as a less-invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopic surgery. We report the first case of successful SILS cholecystectomy in a patient with SIT and discuss technical aspects of the operation related to the handedness of the surgeon. CASE A 49-year-old man who was known to have situs inversus totalis presented with symptomatic cholelithiasis. This patient was operated on by a right-handed surgeon. The surgeon and camera assistant were positioned on the right and left side respectively with the video monitor above the patient's left shoulder. The SILS port (Covidien), which has 3 operating channels, was placed in the abdomen via a 2-cm intraumbilical incision. SILS cholecystectomy was performed successfully.

The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the current literature on evidence for the use of the regenerative capacity of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin (AT), or the free radical scavenging activity of alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) as potential novel treatments for severe preeclampsia and Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count (HELLP). METHOD We conducted a systematic review of potential biological therapies for preeclampsia. We screened MEDLINE and Embase from inception through May 2017 for studies using AT, A1M or MSCs as potential treatments for preeclampsia and/or HELLP. A meta-analysis was performed to pool data from randomized control trials (RCTs) with homogenous outcomes using the inverse variance method. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs, and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies were used to investigate potential bias of studies. RESULTS The literature search retrieved a total of 1015 articles, however, only 17 studies met the selection criteria: AT (n = 9, 8 human and 1 animal); A1M (n = 4, 3 animal and 1 ex-vivo); and, MSCs (n = 4, 3 animal and 1 ex-vivo). A meta-analysis of AT therapy versus placebo and a meta-analysis for AT therapy with heparin versus heparin alone did not show significant differences between study groups. Animal and ex-vivo studies demonstrated significant benefits in relevant outcomes for A1M and MSCs versus control treatments. Most RCT studies were rated as having a low risk of bias across categories with some studies showing an unclear risk of bias in some categories. The two cohort studies both received a total of four out of nine stars (a rating of ""poor"" quality). Most animal studies had an unclear risk of bias across most categories, with some studies having a low risk of bias in some categories. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review are strengthened by rigorous systematic search and review of the literature. Results of our meta-analyses do not currently warrant further exploration of AT as a treatment of preeclampsia in human trials.

STUDY DESIGN Data were prospectively collected from 60 consecutive patients with uterine myomas at three institutions. Patients were managed by LESS-M with either traditional suture (the first 30 patients) or barbed suture (the next 30 patients). Operative time, blood loss, and technical difficulty were assessed for each patient. RESULTS Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, other demographic data, number of myomas, and location and size of the largest myoma) were similar between the two study groups. No significant differences in operative complications, failure rate of the intended surgeries, degree of postoperative pain, or hospital stay duration were observed between the two groups. The use of barbed suture significantly reduced the suturing time for treating the uterine wall defects (P=0.014), as well as the total operative time (P=0.027). The use of barbed suture was also associated with less operative blood loss (P=0.040) and less technical difficulty (P=0.001) compared with traditional suture.

However, despite its importance, no vaccine exists. The chimpanzee adenovirus, PanAd3-RSV, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-RSV, are replication-defective viral vectors encoding the RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), and matrix (M2-1) proteins for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. We performed an open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy adults in which four different combinations of prime/boost vaccinations were investigated for safety and immunogenicity, including both intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) administration of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine. The vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the most common reported adverse events being mild injection site reactions. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. RSV neutralizing antibody titers rose in response to IM prime with PanAd3-RSV and after IM boost for individuals primed by the IN route. Circulating anti-F immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were observed after the IM prime and IM boost. RSV-specific T cell responses were increased after the IM PanAd3-RSV prime and were most efficiently boosted by IM MVA-RSV.

This procedure gains additional intestinal length in a challenging area of autologous gut reconstruction. Herein, we report the successful application of this technique in an adult with ultra-short bowel syndrome. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old man with a history of mid-gut volvulus was referred to our center for intestinal transplant evaluation. Only a megaduodenum stump that reached as far as the third portion (30 cm of length) and the colon up to the hepatic flexure in the form of a mucous fistula was retained. A gastrostomy tube drained gastric and bilio-pancreatic secretions (output range: 2.5-4 liters/day). The time spent on parenteral nutrition (3 liters/day; 1500 calories/day) and I.V. fluid (1.5-2 liters/day) administration was 24 hours per day. The patient underwent duodenal lengthening and tapering with 7 sequential transverse applications (5 of 45 mm and 2 of 60 mm) of an endoscopic stapler on the anterior and posterior walls of the duodenum, respecting the pancreatic parenchyma and end-to-side duodeno-colonic anastomosis. The final duodenal length was 83 cm. The pre-lengthening citrulline level increased from 13.6 micromol/L to 21.6 micromol/L one year post-lengthening. After 24 month of follow-up, the time on a parenteral pump was shortened to 9 hours during the night. The volume and calorie requirements were also reduced by half. DISCUSSION Duodenal lengthening may be effective as part of the autologous intestinal reconstruction armamentarium in adults with short bowel syndrome.","Bueno, Javier; Burgos, Rosa; Redecillas, Susana; López, Manuel; Balsells, Joaquin",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,312,17

How P4P is conceptualised matters, because this shapes how stakeholders think, talk about, and act towards it. Further, multiple understandings can result in diverse expectations for graduate performance. This study therefore explores healthcare learners' solicited and unsolicited conceptualisations of P4P over their early graduate transition. METHODS We conducted longitudinal qualitative research including individual and group entrance interviews (phase 1: n=35), longitudinal audio-diaries (phase 2: n=30), and individual and group exit interviews (phase 3: n=22) with learners from four disciplines (dietetics, medicine, nursing and pharmacy). We employed framework analysis to interrogate data cross-sectionally and longitudinally. RESULTS We found 13 conceptualisations of P4P (e.g. knowledge, confidence), broadly similar across the disciplines. We found some conceptualisations dominant in both solicited and unsolicited talk (e.g. skills), some dominant only in solicited talk (e.g. competence), and others dominant only in unsolicited talk (e.g. experience). While most conceptualisations appeared relatively stable across time, some appeared to dominate at certain time points only (e.g. employability and skills in phases 1 and 2, and competence in phase 3). DISCUSSION This novel study extends previous uniprofessional work by illustrating a broader array of conceptualisations, differences between professions, solicited versus unsolicited talk, and longitudinal cohort patterns. We encourage healthcare educators to discuss these different P4P understandings in graduate transition interventions. Further research is needed to explore other stakeholders' conceptualisations, and over a duration beyond the early graduate transition.","Ottrey, Ella; Rees, Charlotte E; Kemp, Caitlin; Brock, Tina P; Leech, Michelle; Lyons, Kayley; Monrouxe, Lynn V; Morphet, Julia; Palermo, Claire",Medical education,312,27

Additionally, the antioxidant properties of foods are essential for human health. Therefore, in the present study we aimed to investigate the relationship between maternal diet and fatty acids composition as well as the antioxidant potential of breast milk from donors to human milk bank of Perugia's hospital, Italy. Results were compared with infant formulas. We observed increased levels of total fatty acids and, in particular, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in milk from mothers fed on a vegetable and fruit-rich diet compared with a Mediterranean diet. In the same milk, a reduced antioxidant potential was found. All infant formulas resulted in richer total fatty acid content than human breast milk. Only some formulas were qualitatively similar to breast milk. Of note, the antioxidant potential of the formulas was higher or lower than the human milk with the exception of one sample. The antioxidant potential of four formulas was very high. Dietary supplementation with antioxidants has been shown to have a teratogenic effect and to increase the formation of metastases in adult. There are no data on the effects of excess antioxidants in the infants, but the possibility that they can be harmful cannot be excluded.","Codini, Michela; Tringaniello, Carmela; Cossignani, Lina; Boccuto, Antonio; Mirarchi, Alessandra; Cerquiglini, Laura; Troiani, Stefania; Verducci, Giuseppa; Patria, Federica Filomena; Conte, Carmela; Cataldi, Samuela; Ceccarini, Maria Rachele; Paroni, Rita; Dei Cas, Michele; Beccari, Tommaso; Curcio, Francesco; Albi, Elisabetta",Molecules,312,17

Data were collected for each fertility trait from 3435 test-week records from 715 hens, 158 mate sires, and 972 pedigree animals. Three random regression models were analyzed: model 1 (M1: A + PE) was adjusted by using additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Model 2 (M2: A + PE + D) was adjusted by using the dominance effect. Finally, model 3 (M3: A + MS + PE + D) was adjusted by using the mate sire effect. The results found the low heritability of FER (M1 to M3), HOF (M1 to M3), and HOS (M1 to M3) ranged from 0.031-0.040, 0.037-0.066, and 0.040-0.059, respectively. Adjustment for the dominance and mate sire effects in M3 reduced the upward bias in heritability and improved the accuracy of variance component estimates compared to M1 and M2. In conclusion, the genetic evaluation for FER, HOF, and HOS can include the dominance and MS effects to increase the accuracy of evaluation of breeding values and plan for mate selection in breeding programs.","Mookprom, Suphunnee; Duangjinda, Monchai; Puangdee, Somsook; Kenchaiwong, Wootichai; Boonkum, Wuttigrai",Tropical animal health and production,312,1

However, there is little information on predictors of excellent functional outcome after aSAH. In this study, the authors investigated predictors of excellent outcome in a modern consecutive series of patients with aSAH. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients with aSAH admitted between 2001 and 2013. The primary outcome measure was excellent functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1 at last follow-up within 1 year of aSAH. RESULTS Three hundred seventy-three patients were identified with posthospital follow-up. Excellent outcome was noted in 236 patients (63.3%), including an mRS score of 0 in 122 (32.7%) and an mRS score of 1 in 114 (30.6%). On univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with an excellent outcome: indicators of less severe bleeding, such as better World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade at any of the times of assessment, better modified Fisher grade, and absence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and symptomatic hydrocephalus; aneurysm treatment with coil embolization; absence of symptomatic vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and radiological infarction; absence of in-hospital seizures; lack of need for CSF diversion; fewer hours with fever; less severe anemia; and absence of transfusion. On multivariable analysis, the 4 variables that were most strongly associated with excellent outcome were presence of good clinical grade after neurological resuscitation, absence of ICH on initial CT scan, blood transfusion during the hospitalization, and radiological infarctions on final brain imaging. CONCLUSIONS Excellent outcomes (mRS score 0-1) can be achieved in the majority of patients with aSAH. The likelihood of excellent outcome is predicted by good clinical condition after resuscitation, absence of ICH on presentation, no evidence of infarction on brain imaging, and absence of blood transfusion during hospitalization.","Pegoli, Marianna; Mandrekar, Jay; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery,312,1

However, there is currently a lack of simple and effective method for quantitative detection of CPV-2 in vaccine. Therefore, this study aims to prepare an accurate method to determine the CPV-2 antigen (CPV-2-Ag) in vaccine. Here a sandwich time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) was established and optimized: Anti-CPV-2 antibodies were immobilized on 96-well plates to capture CPV-2-Ag, and then bound together with the detection antibodies labeled with Europium(III) (Eu3+ ) chelates; finally time resolved fluorometry was employed to measure the fluorescence intensity. Vaccination was performed to evaluate the relationship between CPV-2-Ag concentration and antibody titer. The sensitivity is 1.15 mEU/mL (LogY = 1.524 + 0.8667 × LogX, R2 = 0.9933)), and the average recovery is among 91.00% to 106.39% without cross reactions with the other canine viral antigen. The correlation between ELISA assay and this method is up to 0.9861. And, there is high correlation between the CPV-2-Ag concentration and antibody titers (R2 = 0.9234). This immunoassay established has high sensitivity, accuracy and specificity, which indicate that this method could be suitable for quantitative detection of CPV-2-Ag in vaccine evaluation.

A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms.","Latkin, Carl; Dayton, Lauren; Yi, Grace; Jaleel, Afareen; Nwosu, Chikaodinaka; Limaye, Rupali",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,312,1

The international scientific community, following World Health Organization (WHO) indications, launched different trials for testing drugs putatively able to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection or treat the COVID-19 disease symptoms. In parallel, studies devoted to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology are in the course for designing an effective vaccine. One of the human membrane proteins known to be docked by the virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), proposed to be responsible for viral entry in target cells. Recently, the 3D structure of ACE2 has been obtained, showing its physical interaction with B0AT1 (SLC6A19), a plasma membrane transporter involved in the trafficking of amino acids in cells. The receptor targeted by SARS-CoV-2 is a supercomplex formed by a dimer of ACE2-B0AT1, in which ACE2 binds the viral protein and B0AT1 stabilizes the heterodimer. As a serendipity occurrence, nimesulide was shown to abolish the transport function of B0AT1. Here we suggest including nimesulide in the list of drugs to be tested for the identification of co-adjuvants in the treatment of COVID-19.","Scalise, Mariafrancesca; Indiveri, Cesare",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,312,1

Approaches to diagnosis include using mnemonics and clinical reasoning. OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this review was to assess the degree to which the criteria researchers use to evaluate diagnostic performance in pharmacy consultations, in studies that have simulated patients or vignettes, conform with a clinical reasoning and a mnemonic framework. A secondary aim of the review was to characterize staff performance in the studies, based on the authors' comments of their results. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched between October 2016 and April 2017. Only peer-reviewed studies assessing pharmacy staff's diagnostic performance using simulated patients or vignettes were eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted about how each study's criteria conformed with clinical reasoning and mnemonic frameworks. A scoring system between 0 and 4 was devised to determine the degree to which studies aligned to these two approaches. Risk of bias was assessed using the NHI Study Quality Assessment Tools. The review was registered in PROSPERO with identification number CRD42017054827. RESULTS Sixty-eight studies (55 cross-sectional, 11 educational interventions and 2 RCTs) with sample sizes between 10 and 2700 were included in the review. Most studies were of poor or fair quality. Performance of pharmacy staff was overwhelmingly reported as poor by study authors. This was the case regardless of geography, scenario used, or assessment framework adopted. Scrutiny on how authors arrived at these conclusions revealed that mnemonic criteria were employed to assess pharmacy staff's diagnostic performance rather than a clinical reasoning approach. CONCLUSIONS Potentially important aspects of the decision-making process, such as clinical reasoning, were left unexplored.

The Norwegian Pediatric Association was a key resource in this process, which involved contacts with all paediatric departments in Norway. We have also performed an international survey regarding the use of such national guidelines, showing that the majority of those queried confirm having national guidelines. The evidence base for any neonatal jaundice guideline is weak; therefore, it is not surprising that the various guidelines differ both in format and in specifics. In the Norwegian guidelines, treatment indications are based on bilirubin concentrations and related to birth weight. Postnatal age is also factored in because jaundice develops gradually during the first 3-4 days before it levels off.

In contrast to the classical PII encoding genes, in L. hilgardii genome the gene for PII homologue is located within the potABCD operon, encoding the ABC transporter for polyamines. Based on the unique genetic context and low sequence identity with genes of any other so-far characterized PII subfamilies, we termed this gene potN (Pot-protein, Nucleotide-binding). The second specific feature of L. hilgardii genome is that many genes encoding the proteins with similar function are present in two copies, while with low mutual identity. Thus, L. hilgardii LMG 7934 genome carries two genes of glutamine synthetase with 55% identity. One gene is located within classical glnRA operon with the gene of GlnR-like transcriptional regulator, while the second is monocistronic. Together with the relative large genome of L. hilgardii as compared to other Lactobacilli (2.771.862 bp vs ~ 2.2 Mbp in median), these data suggest significant re-arrangements of the genome and a wider range of adaptive capabilities of L. hilgardii in comparison to other bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus.","Zhuravleva, Darya E; Iskhakova, Zalina I; Ozhegov, Georgii D; Gogoleva, Natalia E; Khusnutdinova, Dilyara R; Shagimardanova, Elena I; Forchhammer, Karl; Kayumov, Airat R",Current microbiology,312,28

Conversational agents, also known as chatbots or voice assistants, are digital tools capable of holding natural language conversations. Since our last review in 2018, many new conversational agents and research have emerged, and we aimed to reassess the conversational agent landscape in this updated systematic review. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2020 using the PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and Cochrane databases. Studies included were those that involved a conversational agent assessing serious mental illness: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorder. RESULTS Of the 247 references identified from selected databases, 7 studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, there were generally positive experiences with conversational agents in regard to diagnostic quality, therapeutic efficacy, or acceptability. There continues to be, however, a lack of standard measures that allow ease of comparison of studies in this space. There were several populations that lacked representation such as the pediatric population and those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. While comparing 2018 to 2020 research offers useful insight into changes and growth, the high degree of heterogeneity between all studies in this space makes direct comparison challenging. CONCLUSIONS This review revealed few but generally positive outcomes regarding conversational agents' diagnostic quality, therapeutic efficacy, and acceptability, which may augment mental health care. Despite this increase in research activity, there continues to be a lack of standard measures for evaluating conversational agents as well as several neglected populations. We recommend that the standardization of conversational agent studies should include patient adherence and engagement, therapeutic efficacy, and clinician perspectives.","Vaidyam, Aditya Nrusimha; Linggonegoro, Danny; Torous, John",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Under nutrition is the result of insufficient intake of food, poor utilization of nutrients due to illnesses, or a combination of these factors. The purpose of this study was to identify associated risk factors and assess the variation of underweight among under-five children of different regions in Ethiopia. Methods Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey (EDHS-2016) weight-to-age data for under-five children is used. In order to achieve the objective of this study; descriptive, single level and multilevel ordinal logistic regression analysis were used. Results From a total of 8935 children about 8.1% were severely underweight, 17.1% were moderately underweight and 74.8% were normal. The test of heterogeneity suggested that underweight varies among region and multilevel ordinal model fit data better than single level ordinal model. Conclusion Educational level of mother, religion, birth order, type of birth, sex of child, mother body mass index, birth size of child, existence of diarrhea for last two weeks before survey, existence of fever for last two weeks before survey, duration of breast feeding, age child and wealth index had significant effect on underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The finding revealed that among the fitted multilevel partial proportional odds model, the random intercept model with fixed coefficients is appropriate to assess the risk factors of underweight among under-five children in Ethiopia. The findings of this study have important policy implications. The government should work closely with both the private sector and civil society to teach women to have sufficient knowledge, awareness and mechanisms of improving under-five underweight for children's wellbeing.","Birhan, Nigussie Adam; Belay, Denekew Bitew",African health sciences,312,23

Adolescence, with its increased focus on transitioning to independent living, presents particular challenges for youths with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often struggle to behave in a flexible way when faced with challenges. This review focuses on brain mechanisms underlying the development of flexible cognition during adolescence and how these neural systems are affected in ASD. Neuroimaging studies of task switching and set-shifting provide evidence for atypical lateral frontoparietal and midcingulo-insular network activation during cognitive flexibility task performance in individuals with ASD. Recent work also examines how intrinsic brain network dynamics support flexible cognition. These dynamic functional connectivity studies provide evidence for alterations in the number of transitions between brain states, as well as hypervariability of functional connections in adolescents with ASD. Future directions for the field include addressing issues related to measurement of cognitive flexibility using a combination of metrics with ecological and construct validity. Heterogeneity of executive function ability in ASD must also be parsed to determine which individuals will benefit most from targeted training to improve flexibility. The influence of pubertal hormones on brain network development and cognitive maturation in adolescents with ASD is another area requiring further exploration. Finally, the intriguing possibility that bilingualism might be associated with preserved cognitive flexibility in ASD should be further examined. Addressing these open questions will be critical for future translational neuroscience investigations of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in adolescents with ASD.","Uddin, Lucina Q",Biological psychiatry,312,1

The purpose of this review is to identify specific threats to the validity of the COVID-19 literature and to recommend resources for practicing rheumatologists and their patients. RECENT FINDINGS The COVID-19 literature has rapidly expanded and includes 17 998 publications through May of 2020, 1543 of which also address rheumatic disease-related topics. Specific obstacles to acquiring high-quality information have arisen, including 'pandemic research exceptionalism' and a 'parallel pandemic' of misinformation. Unique challenges to rheumatologists include specific interest in antirheumatic disease therapies and a paucity of rheumatology-specific information. Patients with rheumatic diseases have faced shortages of critical medications and a lack of information tailored to their health conditions and medications. SUMMARY We recommend rheumatologists develop a system to acquire high-quality information and offer guiding principles for triaging specific resources, which include relevance, accessibility, credibility, timeliness, and trustworthiness.

The mechanism of UAO in unconscious subjects shares many similarities with that of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially the hypotonic upper airway seen during rapid eye movement sleep. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via nasal mask is more effective at maintaining airway patency than a full face mask in patients with OSA. We hypothesized that CPAP via nasal mask and ventilation (nCPAP) would be more effective than full face mask CPAP and ventilation (FmCPAP) for unconscious subjects, and we tested our hypothesis during induction of general anesthesia for elective surgery. METHODS In total, 73 adult subjects requiring general anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of four groups: nCPAP P0, nCPAP P5, FmCPAP P0, and FmCPAP P5, where P0 and P5 represent positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 0 and 5 cm H2O applied prior to induction. After apnea, ventilation was initiated with pressure control ventilation at a peak inspiratory pressure over PEEP (PIP/PEEP) of 20/0, then 20/5, and finally 20/10 cm H2O, each applied for 1 min. At each pressure setting, expired tidal volume (Vte) was calculated by using a plethysmograph device. RESULTS The rate of effective tidal volume (Vte > estimated anatomical dead space) was higher (87.9% vs. 21.9%; P<0.01) and the median Vte was larger (6.9 vs. 0 mL/kg; P<0.01) with nCPAP than with FmCPAP. Application of CPAP prior to induction of general anesthesia did not affect Vte in either approach (nCPAP pre- vs. post-; 7.9 vs. 5.8 mL/kg, P = 0.07) (FmCPAP pre- vs. post-; 0 vs. 0 mL/kg, P = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS nCPAP produced more effective tidal volume than FmCPAP in unconscious subjects.

This has necessitated urgent reconfiguration within inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) services to ensure safety of patients and staff and seamless continuity of care provision. AIM To describe the adaptations made by a large inflammatory bowel disease service, caring for over 3,500 IBD patients, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A diary record of responses to the pandemic were logged, and meeting minutes were reviewed. Data were recorded from IBD advice lines, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting minutes, infusion unit attendances, and electronic referral systems for the 8-week period from 9 March 2020 until 2 May 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS The IBD service at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (IBD Hull) instituted rapid structural and functional changes to the service. Outpatient services were suspended and substituted by virtual consultations, and inpatient services were reduced and moved to ambulatory care where possible. The delivery of biologic and immunomodulatory therapies was significantly modified to ensure patient and staff safety. There was a substantial increase in IBD advice line calls. CONCLUSION The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic required a prompt response, regular reassessment and planning, and continues to do so.

The additional information that is obtained enables the endoscopist to better identify, delineate, and characterize lesions and can facilitate targeted biopsies or, in some cases, eliminate the need to send samples for histologic analysis. Some of these technologies have been available for more than a decade, but despite this fact, there is limited use of these technologies by endoscopists. Lack of formalized training in their use and a scarcity of guidelines on implementation of these technologies into clinical practice are contributing factors. In November 2014, the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for GI Innovation and Technology conducted a 2-day workshop to discuss endoscopic image-enhancement technologies. This article represents the third of 3 separate documents generated from the workshop and discusses the published literature pertaining to training and outlines a proposed framework for the implementation of endoscopic image-enhancement technologies in clinical practice. There was general agreement among participants in the workshop on several key considerations. Training and competency assessment for endoscopic image-enhancement technologies should incorporate competency-based education paradigms. To facilitate successful training, multiple different educational models that can cater to variations in learning styles need to be developed, including classroom-style and self-directed programs, in-person and web-based options, image and video atlases, and endoscopic simulator programs. To ensure safe and appropriate use of these technologies over time, refresher courses, skill maintenance programs, and options for competency reassessment should be established. Participants also generally agreed that although early adopters of novel endoscopic image-enhancement modalities can successfully implement these technologies by pursuing training and ensuring self-competency, widespread implementation is likely to require support from GI societies and buy-in from other key stakeholders including payors/purchasers and patients. Continued work by manufacturers and the GI societies in providing training programs and patient education, working with payors and purchasers, and creating environments and policies that motivate endoscopists to adopt new practices is essential in creating widespread implementation.","Gupta, Neil; Brill, Joel V; Canto, Marcia; DeMarco, Daniel; Fennerty, Brian M; Laine, Loren; Lieberman, David; Lightdale, Charles; Montgomery, Elizabeth; Odze, Robert; Rex, Douglas; Sharma, Prateek; Tokar, Jeffrey L; Kochman, Michael L",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,312,7

Wastewater surveillance using such methods has the potential to complement clinical testing in assessing community health. This interlaboratory assessment evaluated the reproducibility and sensitivity of 36 standard operating procedures (SOPs), divided into eight method groups based on sample concentration approach and whether solids were removed. Two raw wastewater samples were collected in August 2020, amended with a matrix spike (betacoronavirus OC43), and distributed to 32 laboratories across the U.S. Replicate samples analyzed in accordance with the project's quality assurance plan showed high reproducibility across the 36 SOPs: 80% of the recovery-corrected results fell within a band of ±1.15 log10 genome copies per L with higher reproducibility observed within a single SOP (standard deviation of 0.13 log10). The inclusion of a solids removal step and the selection of a concentration method did not show a clear, systematic impact on the recovery-corrected results. Other methodological variations (e.g., pasteurization, primer set selection, and use of RT-qPCR or RT-dPCR platforms) generally resulted in small differences compared to other sources of variability. These findings suggest that a variety of methods are capable of producing reproducible results, though the same SOP or laboratory should be selected to track SARS-CoV-2 trends at a given facility. The methods showed a 7 log10 range of recovery efficiency and limit of detection highlighting the importance of recovery correction and the need to consider method sensitivity when selecting methods for wastewater surveillance.","Pecson, Brian M; Darby, Emily; Haas, Charles N; Amha, Yamrot M; Bartolo, Mitchel; Danielson, Richard; Dearborn, Yeggie; Di Giovanni, George; Ferguson, Christobel; Fevig, Stephanie; Gaddis, Erica; Gray, Donald; Lukasik, George; Mull, Bonnie; Olivas, Liana; Olivieri, Adam; Qu, Yan",Environmental science : water research & technology,312,16

This meta-analysis investigates the effect and acceptability of MBSR on patients with elevated BP or hypertension. Relevant articles were searched in multiple databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and APA PsycInfo. Included studies were randomized controlled trials that involved patients with an elevated BP, had a control group, and investigated the effect of MBSR. The mean office and out-of-office (including 24-hour, daytime, and asleep) systolic BP and diastolic BP, psychological outcomes (depression/anxiety/stress), and dropout rate were compared between the MBSR arm and the control arm using a random-effects model. Quality assessment was conducted based on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Twelve studies were included, and only one was considered having low risk of bias. MBSR decreased the office systolic BP and diastolic BP by 6.64 and 2.47 mm Hg at postintervention, respectively; the reduction in diastolic BP was sustained until 3 to 6 months after the recruitment. Our meta-analyses did not find a significant reduction in out-of-office BP after MBSR. MBSR reduced depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The dropout rate from MBSR arm was 15% and was similar to that of control arm. The current evidence is limited by lack of high-quality and adequately powered trials with long-term follow-up.

METHODS A comprehensive literature review through an independent electronic search of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed, Medline, Google, and Google Scholar was performed on April 26-30, 2020. Resources identified comprised of published papers, national and international pediatric ENT society guidelines. RESULTS Fourteen guidelines fit the inclusion criteria. Key statements were formulated and graded: a) Strong recommendation (reported by 9 or more/14), b) Fair recommendation (7-8/14) c) Weak recommendation (5-6/14) d) Expert opinion (2-4/14). Any single source suggestion was included as a comment. Highly scored recommendations included definition of urgent/emergent cases that required surgery; surgery for acute airway obstruction; prompt diagnosis of suspected cancer and surgical intervention for sepsis following initial first-line medical management. Other well scored recommendations included senior faculty to perform the surgery; the use of open approaches rather than endoscopic ones; and avoidance of powered instruments that would aerosolise virus-loaded tissue. A tracheostomy should be performed on a case by case basis where key technical modifications become necessary. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short and long-term impact on pediatric ENT practice. During this rapidly evolving climate, guidelines have been based on local practice and expert opinion. Until evidence-based practice in the COVID era is established, a comprehensive set of recommendations for pediatric ENT surgical practice based on a review of currently available literature and guidelines, is therefore appropriate.

This lectin family shows unique carbohydrate binding properties with exclusive high specificity for HM glycans with core trisaccharide comprising Manα(1-3)Manα(1-6)Man at the D2 arm. At low nanomolar levels, these lectins exhibit potent antiviral activity against HIV and influenza viruses through the recognition of HM glycans on virus spike glycoproteins. In addition, some of these lectins, such as bacterial PFL, show cytotoxicity for various cancer cells at low micromolar levels. Cell surface molecules to which PFL bound were identified as integrin alpha 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by peptide mass finger printing with MALDI-TOF MS. Upon PFL binding, these molecules were rapidly internalized to cytoplasm. EGFR was time dependently degraded in the presence of PFL, and this process was largely responsible for autophagy. Furthermore, PFL sensitizes cancer cells to the EGFR kinase inhibitor, gefitinib. In vivo experiments showed that intratumoral injection of PFL significantly inhibited the growth of tumors in nude mice. PFL-mediated down regulation of integrin/EGFR ultimately contributed to the inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the novel anti-cancer mechanism of PFL suggests that this lectin is potentially useful as an anti-cancer drug or as an adjuvant for other drugs. This class of proteins will likely have beneficial impact as a tool for biochemical and biomedical research because of its unique carbohydrate specificity and various biological activities.","Sato, Yuichiro",Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,312,1

The aim of this study is to test whether decreasing the L-carnitine content represents an effective strategy to decrease accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines and to reduce fatty acid oxidation in order to protect the heart against acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. KEY RESULTS In this study, we used a novel compound, 4-[ethyl(dimethyl)ammonio]butanoate (Methyl-GBB), which inhibits γ-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (IC₅₀ 3 μM) and organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2, IC₅₀ 3 μM), and, in turn, decreases levels of L-carnitine and acylcarnitines in heart tissue. Methyl-GBB reduced both mitochondrial and peroxisomal palmitate oxidation rates by 44 and 53% respectively. In isolated hearts treated with Methyl-GBB, uptake and oxidation rates of labelled palmitate were decreased by 40%, while glucose oxidation was increased twofold. Methyl-GBB (5 or 20 mg·kg(-1)) decreased the infarct size by 45-48%. In vivo pretreatment with Methyl-GBB (20 mg·kg(-1)) attenuated the infarct size by 45% and improved 24 h survival of rats by 20-30%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Reduction of L-carnitine and long-chain acylcarnitine content by the inhibition of OCTN2 represents an effective strategy to protect the heart against ischaemia-reperfusion-induced damage. Methyl-GBB treatment exerted cardioprotective effects and increased survival by limiting long-chain fatty acid oxidation and facilitating glucose metabolism.","Liepinsh, E; Makrecka-Kuka, M; Kuka, J; Vilskersts, R; Makarova, E; Cirule, H; Loza, E; Lola, D; Grinberga, S; Pugovics, O; Kalvins, I; Dambrova, M",British journal of pharmacology,312,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. From December 2003 to May 2012, 64 patients were treated with MWA for a single hepatic lesion, in 64 sessions. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was treated in 25 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.33-cm; 95% CI, 2.65-4.18-cm; range, 1.0-12.0-cm), metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) was treated in 27 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 2.7-cm; 95% CI, 2.20-3.40-cm; range, 0.8-6.0-cm), and other histological-types were treated in 12 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.79-cm; 95% CI, 2.72-5.26-cm; range, 1.7-8.0-cm). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to analyze time event data. Chi-square and correlation evaluated the relationship between tumor size and treatment parameters. RESULTS Technical success rate was 95.3% (61/64). Treatment parameters were tailored to tumor size; as size increased more antennae were used (p<0.001), treatment with multiple activations increased (p<0.028), and treatment time increased (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship between time to recurrence and tumor size, number of activations, number of antennae, and treatment time. At one-year, K-M analysis predicted a likelihood of local recurrence of 39.8% in HCC patients, 45.7% in CRC metastases patients, and 70.8% in patients with other metastases. Median cancer specific survivals for patients were 38.3 months for HCC patients, 36.3 months for CRC metastases, and 13.9 months for other histological-types. Complications occurred in 23.4% (15/64) of sessions. CONCLUSION In our sample, tumor size did not appear to impact complete ablation rates or local recurrence rates for focal hepatic malignancies treated with MWA.","Alexander, Erica S; Wolf, Farrah J; Machan, Jason T; Charpentier, Kevin P; Beland, Michael D; Iannuccilli, Jason D; Haas, Richard H; Dupuy, Damian E",European journal of radiology,312,12

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine their spectrum, incidence, and impact on survival. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, COCHRANE, EMBASE through March 2019 for all types of primary studies. Two independent reviewers screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB). RESULTS We identified 552 eligible studies describing 57.972 patients; one randomized controlled trial, two case-control, 17 prospective, 86 retrospective cohort studies, 21 case series, and 425 case reports. RoB ranged from fair to high although case series were low-risk. The majority of studies traced infectious or drug-related neurologic manifestations. Infectious complications were present in 2.7% (95% CI 1.9-3.6) and 3.3% (95% CI 0.8-7.1) of patients in retrospective and prospective cohort studies, respectively. In retrospective studies, 3.4% (95% CI 2.1-4.9) of patients suffered from drug-related neurologic events. In prospective cohorts the equivalent incidence was 13% (95% CI 4.2-24.8). Neurologic complications had a detrimental impact on survival. INTERPRETATION Our study highlights the wide spectrum and significant impact of neurologic complications on survival post allo-HCT.

The first approved therapy derived from a transgenic platform--the epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist panitumumab to treat advanced colorectal cancer--was developed using XenoMouse(®) technology. Since its approval in 2006, the science of discovering and developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies derived from the XenoMouse(®) platform has advanced considerably. The emerging array of antibody therapeutics developed using transgenic technologies is expected to include antibodies and antibody fragments with novel mechanisms of action and extreme potencies. In addition to these impressive functional properties, these antibodies will be designed to have superior biophysical properties that enable highly efficient large-scale manufacturing methods. Achieving these new heights in antibody drug discovery will ultimately bring better medicines to patients. Here, we review best practices for the discovery and bio-optimization of monoclonal antibodies that fit functional design goals and meet high manufacturing standards.","Foltz, Ian N; Gunasekaran, Kannan; King, Chadwick T",Immunological reviews,312,31

Well-characterized examples include the KIR, SIRP, Ly49, Nkpr, and Siglec families. The difference in the repertoire of these genes in mouse and man indicates that these families have evolved rapidly. For example, KIRs are found in humans and not mice, and Ly49 shows the converse. These genes are often very polymorphic, e.g. KIR and the number of genes can vary as shown for Ly49 in different mouse strains. Paired receptors are expressed mainly on NK and myeloid cells and their evolution is thought to be pathogen driven. In this article, we review various receptor families for which pathogen interactions are known and discuss the possible molecular mechanisms driving their evolution.","Akkaya, Munir; Barclay, A Neil",European journal of immunology,312,31

Early Stages of the Pandemic in Spain.,18.257645,2.9069614,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVE The predominant mode of bare nitinol stent failure is diffuse in-stent restenosis, and failure rates correlate to the length and complexity of the treated lesion. Addition of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene lining to a nitinol stent frame, as found in the VIABAHN endoprosthesis, mitigates the ingrowth of intimal hyperplasia. We compared the long-term outcomes of complex superficial femoral artery disease intervention using the VIABAHN endoprosthesis to those obtained with bare nitinol stent implantation. METHODS One hundred forty-eight patients with symptomatic complex superficial femoral artery disease (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus I class C and D lesions, accompanied by intermittent claudication or ischemic rest pain) were randomized to endovascular intervention using either bare nitinol stent implantation (76 patients) or nonheparin-bonded VIABAHN endoprosthesis deployment (72 patients). Patency, limb hemodynamics, and quality of life were evaluated at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months following intervention. RESULTS The average treated lesion measured 18 ± 8 cm in length, and 58.8% of lesions displayed segmental or complete occlusion. At 3 years, primary patency rates (defined by peak systolic velocity ratio ≤ 2.0 and no target lesion revascularization) did not significantly differ between patients treated with the VIABAHN stent graft and those who received a bare nitinol stent (24.2% vs 25.9%; P = .392). Stent fractures were significantly more common in bare nitinol stents (50.0%) than in the VIABAHN endoprostheses (2.6%). Primary-assisted patency rates were higher in those receiving bare nitinol stents than the VIABAHN stent graft (88.8% vs 69.8%; P = .04), although secondary patency rates did not differ between bare nitinol stent and stent graft recipients (89.3% vs 79.5%; P = .304). There were no instances of procedure-related mortality or amputation. The hemodynamic improvement and quality measures improved equally in both groups. CONCLUSIONS The long-term outcomes of complex superficial femoral artery disease intervention using the VIABAHN endograft and bare nitinol stents are similar. Although primary patency rates are low in both study arms, excellent primary-assisted and secondary patency rates were achieved, with sustained augmentation of limb perfusion and quality-of-life measures. Patency rates diminish most rapidly in the first year after device implantation.","Geraghty, Patrick J; Mewissen, Mark W; Jaff, Michael R; Ansel, Gary M",Journal of vascular surgery,312,16

The aim of our study was to investigate the heat-enhancing effects of SiC in microwave ablation in an in vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Different concentrations of SiC powder were mixed with 2% gelatin, producing a 20-ml mixture that was then heated with a clinical microwave ablation system (5 min/45 W). Temperature was measured continuously fiberoptically. Additional heating properties were assessed for the most heatable concentrations at different energy settings (10, 20, and 30 W). As reference, 2% gelatin without SiC was heated. Statistical evaluation by analysis of variance with post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls testing was performed. RESULTS For the different SiC concentrations, maximum temperatures measured were 45.7 ± 1.2°C (0% SiC, control), 50.4 ± 3.6°C (2% SiC), 60.8 ± 1.8°C (10% SiC), 74.9 ± 2.6°C (20% SiC), and 83.4 ± 2.5°C (50% SiC). Differences between all data points were significant (P < 0.05). Maximum temperatures that used 20% SiC were 36.3 ± 2.76°C (10 W), 48.7 ± 4.18°C (20 W), and 50.6 ± 0.68°C (30 W). The use of 50% SiC maximum temperatures resulted in values of 46.2 ± 2.52°C (10 W), 70.1 ± 0.64°C (20 W), and 83.0 ± 4.69°C (30 W). With 20% SiC and 50% SiC mixtures, the 10 W maximum temperatures were significantly lower than at all other power levels, and maximum temperatures with 20 and 30 W were significantly lower when compared with 45 W (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS SiC is a nontoxic, highly effective substance for enhancing microwave-induced heating with a microwave ablation system in vitro. These data suggest its usefulness for enhancement of ablative effects in percutaneous tumor therapy. Further investigations need to be performed to evaluate the ex vivo and in vivo ablation effects and the possible methods for administration of SiC particles.","Isfort, P; Penzkofer, T; Pfaff, E; Bruners, P; Günther, R W; Schmitz-Rode, T; Mahnken, A H",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,312,31

These models rely on accurate estimates of key transmission parameters such as the force of infection (FoI), which is the per-capita risk of a susceptible person being infected. The FoI captures the fundamental dynamics of transmission and is crucial for gauging control efforts, such as identifying vaccination targets. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne, multiserotype pathogen that currently infects ∼390 million people a year. Existing estimates of the DENV FoI are inaccurate because they rely on the unrealistic assumption that risk is constant over time. Dengue models are thus unreliable for designing vaccine deployment strategies. Here, we present to our knowledge the first time-varying (daily), serotype-specific estimates of DENV FoIs using a spline-based fitting procedure designed to examine a 12-y, longitudinal DENV serological dataset from Iquitos, Peru (11,703 individuals, 38,416 samples, and 22,301 serotype-specific DENV infections from 1999 to 2010). The yearly DENV FoI varied markedly across time and serotypes (0-0.33), as did daily basic reproductive numbers (0.49-4.72). During specific time periods, the FoI fluctuations correlated across serotypes, indicating that different DENV serotypes shared common transmission drivers. The marked variation in transmission intensity that we detected indicates that intervention targets based on one-time estimates of the FoI could underestimate the level of effort needed to prevent disease. Our description of dengue virus transmission dynamics is unprecedented in detail, providing a basis for understanding the persistence of this rapidly emerging pathogen and improving disease prevention programs.","Reiner, Robert C; Stoddard, Steven T; Forshey, Brett M; King, Aaron A; Ellis, Alicia M; Lloyd, Alun L; Long, Kanya C; Rocha, Claudio; Vilcarromero, Stalin; Astete, Helvio; Bazan, Isabel; Lenhart, Audrey; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo M; Paz-Soldan, Valerie A; McCall, Philip J; Kitron, Uriel; Elder, John P; Halsey, Eric S; Morrison, Amy C; Kochel, Tadeusz J; Scott, Thomas W",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,312,5

METHODS This is a single-centre prospective observational study on adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Brain and muscle NIRS were recorded during surgery. Cystatin C was measured on the first postoperative day, while NGAL directly before and 3 h after surgery. RESULTS CS-AKI was diagnosed in 18 (16%) of 114 patients. NIRS values recorded 20 min after CPB (with cut-off value ≤ 54.5% for muscle and ≤ 62.5% for the brain) were revealed to be the most accurate predictors of CS-AKI. Preoperative NGAL ≥ 91.5 ng/mL, postoperative NGAL ≥ 140.5 ng/mL, and postoperative cystatin C ≥ 1.23 mg/L were identified as independent and significant CS-AKI predictors. CONCLUSIONS Brain and muscle oxygen saturation 20 min after CPB could be considered early parameters possibly related to CS-AKI risk, especially in patients with increased cystatin C and NGAL levels.","Szymanowicz, Wiktor; Daniłowicz-Szymanowicz, Ludmiła; Karolak, Wojtek; Kowalik, Maciej Michał; Lango, Romuald",Diagnostics,312,15

Understanding the mechanisms of their replication has important implications for global health and economic stability. Nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) is an essential RNA binding protein for coronavirus replication. However, the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. Here, we report four crystal structures, including wild-type porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) nsp9, PDCoV nsp9-ΔN7 (N-terminal 7 amino acids deleted), wild-type porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) nsp9, and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutant. These structures reveal the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9. We first found that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile, PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. Interestingly, size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that the PDCoV nsp9-ΔN7 and PEDV nsp9-C59A mutants are monomeric in solution. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and microscale thermophoresis analysis indicate that the monomeric forms of PDCoV nsp9 and PEDV nsp9 still have nucleic acid binding affinity, although it is lower than that of the wild type. Our results show that the diverse dimerization forms of coronavirus nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses cause widespread respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system diseases in humans and other animals, threatening human health and causing economic loss. Coronavirus nsp9, a member of the replication complex, is an important RNA binding subunit in the RNA-synthesizing machinery of all coronaviruses. However, the mechanisms of the dimerization and nucleic acid binding of nsp9 remain elusive. In this study we determined the nsp9 crystal structures of PDCoV and PEDV. We first found that the N-finger of nsp9 from PDCoV plays a critical role in dimerization. Meanwhile, PEDV nsp9 is distinguished by the presence of a disulfide bond in the dimer interface. This study provides a structural and functional basis for understanding the mechanism of dimerization and shows that the diverse dimerization modes of coronavirus nsp9 proteins enhance their nucleic acid binding affinity.

Comprehensive analyses identify changes in subgenomic evolution from asymmetrical oscillation in goldfish and common carp to diverse stabilization and balanced gene expression during continuous rediploidization. The homoeologs are coexpressed in most pathways, and their expression dominance shifts temporally during embryogenesis. Homoeolog expression correlates negatively with alternation of DNA methylation. The results show that allotetraploid cyprinids have a unique strategy for balancing subgenomic stabilization and diversification.

Due to the decreased water clarity in the Yellow Ocean, upper ocean heat content was lower and temperatures were colder compared to the Green Ocean. The difference between these simulations is opposite to the ocean warming that has been observed in recent decades. Increasing precipitation in high-latitude regions has also been observed, with greater inputs of terrestrial organic materials to the ocean.

Tumor pretargeting is obtained by using a bispecific monoclonal antibody [BsmAb, anti-CEA × anti-DTPA-indium complex (DTPA-In)] and pegylated radioactive liposomes containing a lipid-hapten conjugate (DSPE-PEG-DTPA-In). In this work, the immunospecificity of tumor targeting is demonstrated both in vitro by fluorescence microscopy and in vivo by biodistribution studies. METHODS Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing cells (LS174T) were used either in cell culture or as xenografts in nude mice. Doubly fluorescent liposomes or doubly radiolabeled liposomes were, respectively, used for in vitro and in vivo studies. In each case, a tracer of the lipid bilayer [rhodamine or indium-111 ((111)In)] and a tracer of the aqueous phase [fluorescein or iodine-125 ((125)I)] were present. The targeting of liposomes was assessed with BsmAb for active targeting or without for passive targeting. RESULTS Data obtained with the lipid bilayer tracer showed a fluorescent signal on cell membranes two to three times higher for active than for passive targeting. This immunospecificity was confirmed in vivo with tumor uptake of 7.5 ± 2.4% ID/g (percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue) for active targeting versus 4.5 ± 0.45% ID/g for passive targeting (p = 0.03). Regarding the aqueous phase tracer, results are slightly more contrasted. In vitro, the fluorescent tracer seems to be released in the extracellular matrix, which can be correlated with the in vivo data. Indeed, the tumor uptake of (125)I is lower than that of (111)In: 5.1 ± 2.5% ID/g for active targeting and 2.7 ± 0.6% ID/g for passive targeting, but resulted in more favorable tumor/organs ratios. CONCLUSION This work demonstrated the tumor targeting immunospecificity of DSPE-PEG-DTPA-In liposomes by two different methods. This original and new approach suggests the potential of immunospecific targeting liposomes for the RIT of solid tumors.","Rauscher, Aurore; Frindel, Mathieu; Rajerison, Holisoa; Gouard, Sébastien; Maurel, Catherine; Barbet, Jacques; Faivre-Chauvet, Alain; Mougin-Degraef, Marie",Frontiers in medicine,312,0

RECENT FINDINGS Pulse-field gel electrophoresis and other traditional techniques remain powerful tools in outbreak investigations and continue to be used by multiple groups. Newer techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass-spectrometry and whole genome sequencing show great promise. However, there is a lack of standardization regarding definitions for genetic relatedness, nor are there established criteria for accuracy and reproducibility. There are also challenges regarding availability of trained bioinformatics staff, and concerns regarding reimbursement. SUMMARY There are many tools available for molecular epidemiologic investigation. Epidemiologists and clinical laboratorians should work together to determine which testing methods are best for each institution.","Lee, Francesca",Current opinion in infectious diseases,312,29

To mitigate the potential negative effects of COVID-19 on surgical education, it is important to quantify how the pandemic influenced resident operative volume. Objective To examine the association of the pandemic with general surgical residents' operative experience by postgraduate year (PGY) and case type and to evaluate if certain institutional characteristics were associated with a greater decline in surgical volume. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective review included residents' operative logs from 3 consecutive academic years (2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020) from 16 general surgery programs. Data collected included total major cases, case type, and PGY. Faculty completed a survey about program demographics and COVID-19 response. Data on race were not collected. Operative volumes from March to June 2020 were compared with the same period during 2018 and 2019. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for within-program correlations. Main Outcome and Measures Total major cases performed by each resident during the first 4 months of the pandemic. Results A total of 1368 case logs were analyzed. There was a 33.5% reduction in total major cases performed in March to June 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019 (45.0 [95% CI, 36.1-53.9] vs 67.7 [95% CI, 62.0-72.2]; P < .001), which significantly affected every PGY. All case types were significantly reduced in 2020 except liver, pancreas, small intestine, and trauma cases. There was a 10.2% reduction in operative volume during the 2019-2020 academic year compared with the 2 previous years (192.3 [95% CI, 178.5-206.1] vs 213.8 [95% CI, 203.6-223.9]; P < .001). Level 1 trauma centers (49.5 vs 68.5; 27.7%) had a significantly lower reduction in case volume than non-level 1 trauma centers (33.9 vs 63.0; 46%) (P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance In this study of operative logs of general surgery residents in 16 US programs from 2017 to 2020, the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant reduction in operative experience, which affected every PGY and most case types. Level 1 trauma centers were less affected than non-level 1 centers. If this trend continues, the effect on surgical training may be even more detrimental.","Purdy, Amanda C; de Virgilio, Christian; Kaji, Amy H; Shields Frey, Edgar; Lee-Kong, Steven; Inaba, Kenji; Gauvin, Jeffrey M; Neville, Angela L; Donahue, Timothy R; Smith, Brian R; Salcedo, Edgardo S; Calhoun, Kristine E; Poola, V Prasad; Namm, Jukes P; Spain, David A; Dickinson, Karen J; Tanner, Tiffany; Wolfe, Mary; Amersi, Farin",JAMA surgery,312,0

METHODS An in vitro breathing model consisting of an uncuffed TT (4.5-mm inner diameter) was attached to a collecting filter (Respirgard) connected to a dual-chamber test lung and a ventilator (Hamilton Medical) to simulate breathing parameters of a 2-y-old child (breathing frequency, 25 breaths/min; tidal volume, 150 mL; inspiratory time, 0.8 s; peak inspiratory flow, 20 L/min). Albuterol sulfate was administered using a jet nebulizer (MicroMist, 2.5 mg/3 mL), vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aeroneb Solo, 2.5 mg/3 mL), and pMDI (ProAir HFA, 432 μg). Each device was tested 5 times with an unassisted technique (direct administration of aerosols with simulated spontaneous breathing) and with an assisted technique (using a manual resuscitation bag in conjunction with an aerosol device and synchronized with inspiration). Drug collected on the filter was analyzed by spectrophotometry. RESULTS With the unassisted technique, the pMDI had the highest inhaled mass percent (IM%, 47.15 ± 7.82%), followed by the vibrating mesh nebulizer (19.77 ± 2.99%) and the jet nebulizer (5.88 ± 0.77%, P = .002). IM was greater with the vibrating mesh nebulizer (0.49 ± .07 mg) than with the pMDI (0.20 ± 0.03 mg) and the jet nebulizer (0.15 ± 0.01 mg, P = .007). The trend of lower deposition with the assisted versus unassisted technique was not significant for the jet nebulizer (P = .46), vibrating mesh nebulizer (P = .19), and pMDI (P = .64). CONCLUSIONS In this in vitro pediatric breathing model with a TT, the pMDI delivered the highest IM%, whereas the vibrating mesh nebulizer delivered the highest IM. The jet nebulizer was the least efficient device. Delivery efficiency was similar with unassisted and assisted administration techniques.","Alhamad, Bshayer R; Fink, James B; Harwood, Robert J; Sheard, Meryl M; Ari, Arzu",Respiratory care,312,10

Whether active oncologic treatment is an additional risk factor in this population remains unclear. Therefore, here we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence for the effect of active oncologic treatment on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS Systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase) was conducted for studies published from inception to July 1, 2020, with a subsequent search update conducted on 10 October 2020. In addition, abstracts and presentations from major conference proceedings (ASCO, ESMO, AACR) as well as pre-print databases (medxriv, bioxriv) were searched. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes in cancer patients with laboratory confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and details of active or recent oncologic treatment were selected. Random-effects model was applied throughout meta-analyses. Summary outcome measure was the pooled odds ratio (OR) of death for active cancer therapy versus no active cancer therapy for each of the following modalities: recent surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. RESULTS Sixteen retrospective and prospective studies (3558 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Active chemotherapy was associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.14-2.23). No significant association with risk of death was identified for active targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, or recent surgery. Meta-analysis of multivariate adjusted OR of death for active chemotherapy was consistently associated with higher risk of death compared to no active chemotherapy (OR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.01-2.01). CONCLUSIONS Active chemotherapy appears to be associated with higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19. Further research is necessary to characterize the complex interactions between active cancer treatment and COVID-19.","Park, Robin; Lee, Sul A; Kim, Seong Yoon; de Melo, Andreia Cristina; Kasi, Anup",Acta oncologica,312,29

PoCUS is also being implemented in general practice despite a lack of clinical guidelines and training programs for general practitioners (GPs). OBJECTIVES This study aimed to elucidate the employment of PoCUS by Danish GPs following a short training program. METHODS Thirty GPs were enrolled in a short ultrasound training program and taught how to perform 22 selected scanning modalities. In the following 3 months, the GPs registered all performed PoCUS examinations according to the Audit Project Odense method. After 5 months, the GPs were invited to participate in an evaluation seminar, where questionnaires were distributed. RESULTS During the registration period, 1598 patients were examined with PoCUS. A total of 1948 scanning modalities were registered, including 207 examinations outside the taught curriculum. The majority of the ultrasound examinations were performed within 10 minutes (89%), most were considered to be conclusive (87%) and/or to increase diagnostic certainty (67%), whereas one in four examinations entailed a change in patient management. Most GPs attending the evaluation seminar continued to use PoCUS and found the scanning modalities included in the course curriculum relevant in their daily work. CONCLUSION The GPs found several indications for performing PoCUS following the attendance of a 2-day basic training program. The majority of examinations were registered to be conclusive and/or increase diagnostic certainty. However, few GPs used PoCUS on a daily basis and not all examinations were registered to have an impact on patient care.","Andersen, Camilla Aakjær; Frandsen, Annika Kamp; Valentiner-Branth, Christian; Lykkegaard, Jesper; Løkkegaard, Thomas; Thomsen, Janus Laust; Jensen, Martin Bach; Hansen, Malene Plejdrup",Family practice,312,30

We prospectively assessed outcomes in patients managed in a hepatology clinic (HC) alone versus those managed in combination with a multidisciplinary weight management program (MWMP). We describe each group's readiness to change at the time of NAFLD diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD were given a modified Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) at enrollment (T1) to assess readiness to change. They were then followed at 3-9 months (T2) and at 10-15 months (T3). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate changes in BMI, BMI z-score, and transaminases over time and between the two groups. There were no significant treatment group main effects or treatment x time interactions for our primary endpoints for HC alone (n=75) or with MWMP (n=18). There was a significant main effect for time for BMI z-score, with BMI z-scores declining on average by 0.0568 (p=.004) from visit to visit. Low SOCRATES subscales scores in HC alone (n=33) or with MWMP (n=4) suggested a patient population with low recognition of disease and likelihood of taking steps for change. Patients with obesity and NAFLD had low scores on all three SOCRATES sub-scales. Despite this, both groups had improvement in BMI z-score without significant difference between the two treatment groups in other primary endpoints.

Surgery is often performed to correct cervical alignment, but the optimal amount of correction required to improve patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are not yet well-defined. Methods A review of the literature was performed and Fisher's z-transformation (Zr) was used to pool the correlation coefficients between alignment parameters and PROs. The strength of correlation was defined according to the following: poor (0 < r ≤ 0.3), fair (0.3 < r ≤ 0.5), moderate (0.5 < r ≤ 0.8), and strong (0.8 < r ≤ 1). Results Increased C2-C7 SVA was fairly associated with increased Neck Disability Index (NDI) (pooled Zr = 0.31; 95% CI, -0.03, 0.58). Changes in TS-CL poorly correlated with NDI (pooled Zr = -0.04; 95% CI, -0.23-0.30). Increased C7-S1 was poorly associated with worse EQ-5D (pooled Zr = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.36, -0.06). Correction of horizontal gaze (CBVA) did not correlate with legacy metrics. mJOA correlated with C2-slope, C7-S1, and C2-S1. Conclusion Spinal alignment parameters variably correlated with improved HRQoL and myelopathy after corrective surgery for ACD. Further studies evaluating legacy PROs, PROMIS, and ACD specific instruments are needed for further validation.","Massaad, Elie; Hadzipasic, Muhamed; Kiapour, Ali; Lak, Asad M; Shankar, Ganesh; Zaidi, Hasan A; Hershman, Stuart H; Shin, John",Neurospine,312,0

Various herbal remedies have been claimed to be effective for the treatment of dyslipidemia in traditional and folkloric medicine of different regions clinical trials have been conducted to investigate their efficacy. The aim of the current systematic review is to critically assess the meta-analyses of controlled trials (CT) evaluated herb medicines for dyslipidemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Relevant studies from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist until January 2021 have been searched. All meta-analyses which pooled studies on the effect of herbal medicines on lipid profile including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low- or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C) were also included. Meta-analyses of in vitro, animal or observational studies were excluded. RESULTS The overall of 141 meta-analyses were revealed. Vegetable oils, phytosterols, tea, soy protein, nuts, and curcumin have been studied frequently among the herbal medicines. Among 13 meta-analyses on vegetable oils, the greater reduce of TC (18.95 mg/dl), LDL-C (16.24 mg/dl) and TG (13.69 mg/dl) were exhibited from sunflower oil. Furthermore, rice bran oil (6.65 mg/dl) increased HDL-C significantly. Phytosterols in 12 meta-analyses demonstrated significant improvements in reducing TC, LDL-C and TG as 16.4, 23.7, and 8.85 mg/dl, respectively, and rise in HDL-C as 10.6 mg/dl. The highest reduction in serum level of TC, LDL-C and TG was reported while intake Green tea; 27.57, 24.75, and 31.87 mg/dl, accordingly within 9 meta-analyses. Average improvement of lipid profiles by 6 meta-analyses on plant proteins were 23.2, 21.7, 15.06, and 1.55 mg/dl for TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C, respectively. Among 11 meta-analyses on nuts, almond showed better and significant alleviations in TC (10.69 mg/dl), walnut in LDL-C (9.23 mg/dl), pistachio in TG (22.14 mg/dl), and peanut in HDL-C (2.72 mg/dl). Overall, Curcumin, Curcuminoid, and Turmeric have resulted in the reduction of TC (25.13 mg/dl), LDL-C (39.83 mg/dl), TG (33.65 mg/dl), and an increase in the HDL-C (4.31 mg/dl). CONCLUSION The current systematic review shed light on the use of herbal medicines for the management of dyslipidemia. However, more well-conducted CTs are required to determine effective doses of herbal medicines.","Adel Mehraban, Mohammad Sadegh; Tabatabaei-Malazy, Ozra; Rahimi, Roja; Daniali, Marzieh; Khashayar, Patricia; Larijani, Bagher",Journal of ethnopharmacology,312,13

Chemical compositions were analyzed by spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. Antioxidant activities of the samples were tested by using five different test systems. Enzyme inhibitory activities of the extracts were also studied. As a result of the LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses, chlorogenic acid, hesperidin, and hyperoside were found to be the major compounds of the extracts, especially the MeOH extract (6559.59, 2499.22, and 2047.66 μg/g extract, respectively). Antioxidant activity tests have proven that MeOH extract showed higher activity than others (DPPH: 4.15 mg/mL, ABTS: 2.05 mg/mL, CUPRAC: 1.80 mg/mL, FRAP: 0.83 mg/mL, phosphomolybdenum: 1.69 mg/mL).

METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for two senior surgeons who supervised and performed USLS with both suture types in 2008-2009. Permanent and delayed absorbable sutures were compared for failure of anatomical support. Failure, defined as recurrent prolapse beyond the hymen, was evaluated using survival analysis. RESULTS Two hundred forty-eight procedures were performed. One percent in the permanent group had a loss of support beyond the hymen compared to 6% in the delayed absorbable group (p = 0.034). The preoperative prolapse stage and duration of follow-up did not differ between the two groups. The number of sutures used did not differ between patients who failed and those who did not fail. CONCLUSIONS The use of permanent sutures for USLS of the vaginal apex was associated with a lower failure rate than delayed absorbable sutures in the short-term.","Chung, Christopher P; Miskimins, Richard; Kuehl, Thomas J; Yandell, Paul M; Shull, Bobby L",International urogynecology journal,312,12

PURPOSE To investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 during Humphrey Visual field testing in a real-world scenario. METHODS A particle counter was placed within the bowl of Humphrey Visual Field Analyser before and after turning on the machine to ascertain the effect of the air current produced by the ventilation system on aerosols. A second experiment was run where the particle counter was placed in the bowl and recorded particulates, in the air, as a 24-2 SITA standard was performed by a mock patient and then again immediately after the patient had moved away. We measured aerosol particle counts sized ≤0.3▒μm, >0.3 ≤0.5▒μm, >0.5 ≤1▒μm, >1 ≤2.5▒μm, >2.5≤5▒μm and >5≤10▒μm. RESULTS Particulates of all sizes were shown to be significantly reduced within the bowl after turning the machine on, demonstrating that the air current produced by the Humphrey visual field analyser pushes air out of the bowl and it cannot stagnate. There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol while there was a patient performing the test and immediately after they had moved away, suggesting that aerosols breathed out by the patient are not able to remain in suspension in the bowl due to the ventilation current. CONCLUSION There is no significant difference between aerosol count in the bowl of a Humphrey visual field analyser before, during and after testing. This suggests the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is low between subsequent patients. This is in keeping with manufacturer's guidance on Humphrey visual field testing.","Jain, Nikhil; Kaur, Simerdip; Kopsachilis, Nick; Zia, Rashid",Journal of glaucoma,312,16

Making Medicaid an entirely federal program using Congress' budget reconciliation process will reverse the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that enabled states to reject Medicaid expansion. Such legislation achieves Congress' original intention to create universal entitlements for low-income persons who lack health coverage and concentrate new federal health spending on them (unlike M4A). Arguments for federalizing Medicaid involve state budget relief, efficiency, social justice and the history that created national industries from local and state-based health systems. Theory suggests that liberal democracies are generally more successful when path dependent, building incrementally on existing policies instead of plunging into new, untested innovations no matter how rational. In addition to realizing the congressional intent of the ACA, federalizing Medicaid can be a cost-effective, incremental path to single-payer health coverage.","Brandon, William P",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,312,28

Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes counterfactual subsets to better support user exploration of feature relationships.

The construction of the feature vector is based on the contents of amino acids, total distance of each amino acid from the first amino acid in the protein sequence and the distribution of 20 amino acids. The obtained cosine distance metric (also called the similarity matrix) is used to construct the phylogenetic tree by the neighbour joining method. In order to show the applicability of our approach, we tested it on three proteins: 1) ND5 protein sequences from nine species, 2) ND6 protein sequences from eight species, and 3) 50 coronavirus spike proteins. The results are in agreement with known history and the output from the multiple sequence alignment program ClustalW, which is widely used. We have also compared our phylogenetic results with six other recently proposed alignment-free methods. These comparisons show that our proposed method gives a more consistent biological relationship than the others. In addition, the time complexity is linear and space required is less as compared with other alignment-free methods that use graphical representation. It should be noted that the multiple sequence alignment method has exponential time complexity.","Gupta, M K; Niyogi, R; Misra, M",SAR and QSAR in environmental research,312,28

There is no conclusive research into the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, although evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak appears to suggest that there is no increased risk of transmission. However, close contact with a COVID-19 patient, especially those displaying respiratory symptoms, is likely to increase the risk of transmission. Nasogastric tube insertion requires increased time spent at a patient's bedside and can also cause pharyngeal irritation, resulting in coughing. In addition, the nasogastric tube can expose the healthcare worker to potentially infectious saliva. Therefore, there is a clear need for increased evidence regarding the risk of transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, to ensure that such risks can be mitigated.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Fanning, Sinead J; Khan, Mansoor; Sajid, Muhammad S",British journal of hospital medicine,312,27

SETTING Aerosol and droplet quantification laboratory DESIGN:: Laboratory study. METHODS In an experimental set up, phacoemulsification was performed on enucleated goat eyes and cadaveric human corneo-scleral rims mounted on an artificial anterior chamber. Standard settings for sculpt and quadrant removal mode were used on Visalis 100 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Microincision and standard phacoemulsification were done using titanium straight tips (2.2 and 2.8 mm in diameter). The main wound incisions were titrated equal to and larger than the sleeve size. High speed shadowgraphy technique was used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. The visualization and quantification of size of the aerosols and droplets along with calculation of their spread were the main outcome measures. RESULTS In longitudinal phacoemulsification using a peristaltic pump device with a straight tip, no aerosol generation was seen in a closed chamber. In larger wounds, there was a slow leak at the main wound. The atomization of balanced salt solution was observed only when the phaco tip was completely exposed next to the ocular surface. Under this condition, the nominal size of the droplet was ∼ 50 µm and the maximum calculated spread was 1.3 meters. CONCLUSIONS There was no visible aerosol generation during microincision or standard phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification is safe to perform in the COVID-19 era by taking adequate precautions against other modes of transmission.","Shetty, Naren; Kaweri, Luci; Khamar, Pooja; Balakrishnan, Nikhil; Rasheed, Abdur; Kabi, Prasenjit; Basu, Saptarshi; Shetty, Rohit; Nuijts, Rudy M M A; Roy, Abhijit Sinha",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,312,5

This study aims to identify clinical and behavioral factors associated with poor life functioning in this population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at an ambulatory clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong. Licensed occupational therapists administered the Life Functioning Assessment Inventory on survivors diagnosed with cancer <19 years old and ≥5 years post-diagnosis. Survivors' career development self-efficacy, subjective happiness, and motivation were evaluated using structured questionnaires. Clinical information was obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate factors associated with life functioning outcomes, adjusting for clinically relevant variables. Results: Eighty survivors were recruited (58.7% male; age at diagnosis: 6.7 [standard deviation (SD) = 4.8] years; age at evaluation: 24.4 [SD = 6.5] years). Compared to survivors of leukemia, survivors of brain tumor performed worse in social functioning (β = -0.79, standard error [SE] = 0.36; p = 0.034). Survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation also had lower worker life functioning than those who had not (β = -0.91, SE = 0.031; p = 0.021). Higher activity motivation was significantly associated with better leisure functioning (β = 0.086, SE = 0.03; p = 0.008), social functioning (β = 0.036, SE = 0.02; p = 0.036), and career development self-efficacy (β = 1.04, SE = 0.26; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Survivors of brain tumors and survivors who were treated with radiation have poorer life functioning, particularly in social and work domains. Future work includes validating the study findings in a larger cohort of survivors in Hong Kong. Addressing modifiable behavioral factors include motivating survivors to engage in meaningful activities that contribute to self-care and participation in society, as well as providing at-risk survivors with ongoing support from community vocational services.","Yang, Hellen; Fong, Sanne; Chan, Phoebe; Cheung, Alice; Peng, Liwen; Yan, Jiaqi; Cheung, Yin Ting; Li, Chi-Kong",Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,312,1

They have the same large-pore structure yet are composed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). This study compares the long-term (3 and 6 months) behavior of meshes of different pore size (HW compared with LW) and composition (PP compared with PTFE). METHODS Partial defects were created in the lateral wall of the abdomen in New Zealand White rabbits and then repaired by the use of a HW or LW PP mesh or a new monofilament, large-pore PTFE mesh (Infinit). At 90 and 180 days after implantation, tissue incorporation, gene and protein expression of neocollagens (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/immunofluorescence), macrophage response (immunohistochemistry), and biomechanical strength were determined. Shrinkage was measured at 90 days. RESULTS All three meshes induced good host tissue ingrowth, yet the macrophage response was significantly greater in the PTFE implants (P < .05). Collagen 1/3 mRNA levels failed to vary at 90 days yet in the longer term, the LW meshes showed the reduced genetic expression of both collagens (P < .05) accompanied by increased neocollagen deposition, indicating more efficient mRNA translation. After 90-180 days of implant, tensile strengths and elastic modulus values were similar for all 3 implants (P > .05). CONCLUSION Host collagen deposition is mesh pore size dependent whereas the macrophage response induced is composition dependent with a greater response shown by PTFE. In the long term, macroporous meshes show comparable biomechanical behavior regardless of their pore size or composition.","Pascual, Gemma; Hernández-Gascón, Belén; Rodríguez, Marta; Sotomayor, Sandra; Peña, Estefania; Calvo, Begoña; Bellón, Juan M",Surgery,312,11

METHODS The questionnaire asked about the demographics of dental hygienists, characteristics of practice, patient load, career intentions, opinion about dental hygienists workforce and the need of governmental workforce regulation. The study consisted of all licensed dental hygienists in Lithuania in 2018 (N=1109). RESULTS The final response rate was 52.1% (n=578). 64% (n=370) of respondents lived in the country's five main cities and 73.5% (n=425) worked in these population centres, with 94.3% (n=545) worked in private sector. Over two thirds of respondents said there was an excess of dental hygienists in Lithuania. Nearly 80% 'always' or 'sometimes' reported that they had insufficient patients, which may account for the prevalence of supplementary work (48.4%, n=280), i.e. work as a dental assistant (67.9%, n=190). Data obtained shows that dental hygienists with less than ten years' experience were likely to work as a dental assistant (p<0.05). Notwithstanding, 73.9% (n=428) of the dental hygienists reported that they only want to practice their profession. Most (83.4%, n=483) struggled to find dental hygienist work, and 70.5% (n=408) wanted regulation of number of dental hygienists at a national level. CONCLUSIONS The respondents suggested there is: a) a lack of dental hygiene patients, b) available workload for additional preventive dental hygiene services, c) pressure to search for additional work, usually as a dental assistant. Governmental support to optimally regulate oral health human resources is, according to most dental hygienists, an emphatic wish as a possible solution at national level.","Rederiene, Gitana; Berlin, Vilija; Buunk-Werkhoven, Yvonne A B; Puriene, Alina",International journal of dental hygiene,312,26

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been introduced for the treatment of COVID-19. However, efficacy differs among herbal medicines, and the ideal prescription pattern for TCM herbal formulae for COVID-19 treatment needs to be explored. Therefore, the data mining method has been used in this study to analyze the TCM prescription pattern for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to analyze the TCM prescription pattern in Regional Schemes in China for COVID-19 in order to provide a new reference for the use of TCM in COVID-19 treatment. METHOD By searching the TCM treatment protocols of COVID-19 in 23 Regional Schemes, TCM syndromes and herbal medicines were analyzed by data mining. The Ancient and Modern Medical Case Cloud Platform (V2.1 personal Edition) was used to perform frequency statistics, correlation analysis, and cluster analysis. A total of 82 TCM syndromes and 171 Chinese herbal medicines were found. The course of the disease can be divided into the early stage, middle stage, severe stage, and recovery stage. RESULTS In the early stage, the focus is primarily on resolving dampness, dispelling cold, and diffusing the lungs. In the middle stage, the treatment priority is clearing heat and resolving toxins, promoting lung function, and relieving asthma. In the severe stage, the focus is on tonifying Qi, restoring Yang, and relieving depletion of Yin and Yang. In the recovery stage, the main treatment is to invigorate the spleen and regulate Qi, tonify Qi, nourish Yin, and clear residual disease evil. There are certain differences between the Regional Schemes and the Nation Schemes, but the core prescription pattern of the former is consistent with the latter. The effectiveness of these 171 Chinese herbs include but are not limited to inhibiting COVID-19, strengthening immune system function, preventing heart failure, acting as antioxidants, oxidative stress inhibitory effects, maintaining organ function, and improving leukocyte survival. CONCLUSION This study may help to improve understanding of TCM herbal prescription pattern, practices, reveal the efficacy of combinations of Chinese herbs, and provide new ideas for TCM treatment for COVID-19.","Yin, LiWei; Gao, YaCen; Li, ZiPing; Wang, MengYu; Chen, KaiXin",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,312,1

In Cuba, all confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hospitalized from this point forward. OBJECTIVE Characterize the first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba. INTRODUCTION METHODS We carried out a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 415 suspected cases of COVID-19 admitted to the Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana, Cuba, from March 11, 2020 through April 10, 2020. (In Cuba, all patients suspected of being COVID-19-positive were admitted to hospitals or isolation centers for observation and treatment.) Of these 415 individuals, 63 (15.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Information was obtained from the Institute's databases as well as a standardized interview form for cases confirmed or suspected as infected with the novel coronavirus. We considered the following variables: age, sex, occupation at the time of interview, national origin, personal health history, time elapsed between symptom onset and hospital admission, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and status at discharge. We based our analysis on frequency distributions and double-entry contingency tables. RESULTS The mean age was 50 years (range: 16-94 years). The 45-54 age group represented the largest share of cases (25.4%; 16/63); persons aged ≥65 years were 20.6% (13/63); there were more men than women (55.6% vs. 44.4%). Cubans represented 52.4% (33/63) of patients while 47.6% (30/63) were from 14 countries where COVID-19 had already been identified. All foreigners and Cubans who arrived from abroad were considered imported cases (54.0%; 34/63). Health personnel (10 doctors and 1 nurse) represented 17.5% (11/63) of cases. Cough (50.8%), fever (46.0%), sore throat (22.2%) and headache (19.0%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Asymptomatic patients represented 25.4% (16/63) of cases. Hypertension was the most frequently associated chronic disease (28.6%), followed by asthma (25.0%) and diabetes (17.9%). Patients who were admitted to hospital ≥3 days after symptom onset represented 66.7% (42/63) of cases. Mean hospital stay was 13.7 days (range: 1-27 days). Factors associated with a higher risk of contracting the disease included occupation as a healthcare worker (OR: 1.85; 95%, CI: 0.88-3.87) and aged ≥65 years (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 0.85-3.34). Five individuals died, for a fatality rate of 7.9% (three foreigners and two Cubans; four men and one woman). Four of these patients were infected outside of Cuba and one was identified as a contact of a confirmed case. All patients who died had significant comorbidities (diabetes, asthma and hypertension). Age of deceased patients ranged from 54 to 87 years. CONCLUSION The first patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Cuba were admitted to the Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana. They share characteristics with those reported by other countries: more men than women were affected, and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and asthma were all important risk factors, as was age ≥65 years. More than half of all cases were imported, and autochthonous patients were all contacts of confirmed cases.","Molina-Águila, Niurka; Cruz-Rodríguez, Elba; Ferrán-Torres, Rita M; Galindo-Santana, Belkys M; López-Almaguer, Yanaris; Romero-Placeres, Manuel",MEDICC review,312,30

We aimed to systematically identify risk factors for poor short-term outcomes of gastric ESD with the purpose to improve patients' selection and management. METHODS Three online databases (MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus) were searched (last search on June 2018) for poor outcomes of gastric ESD (deep submucosal invasion, piecemeal/incomplete resection, noncurative resection and local recurrence). RESULTS One hundred five studies were included referring to 52.126 ESDs. Undifferentiated histology and upper location (vs lower) were associated with submucosal invasion [odds ratio (OR) = 2.42 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-3.61] and OR = 3.20 (1.04-9.86), respectively] and deep submucosal invasion [OR = 2.98 (2.02-4.39) and OR = 2.35 (1.45-3.81), respectively]. Lesion size greater than 30 mm and ulceration were associated with piecemeal resection [OR = 2.78 (1.17-6.60) and OR = 2.76 (1.23, 6.20), respectively]. Lesion size greater than 30 mm, ulceration, upper location and fibrosis were risk factors for incomplete resection [OR = 3.83 (2.68-5.49), OR = 4.06 (1.62-10.16), OR = 3.71 (2.49-5.54) and OR = 4.46 (1.66-11.96), respectively]. A noncurative resection was more often observed for lesions located in the upper third of the stomach [OR = 1.49 (1.24-1.79)], depressed morphology [OR = 1.49 (1.04-2.12)] and those outside standard criteria [OR = 3.56 (2.31-5.48)]. Older age was significantly linked with local recurrence rates [OR = 3.08 (1.13-5.02)]. CONCLUSION Several risk factors influence poor efficacy short-term outcomes of gastric ESD that may be used to inform both patients and health providers about the expected efficacy.","Figueirôa, Gonçalo; Pimentel-Nunes, Pedro; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mário; Libânio, Diogo",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,312,19

The number of cases detected increased significantly over the period of scale-up of mass screening (P=0.003), as did the number of recovered cases (P=0.001). The number of deaths due to COVID-19 did not change before versus after mass screening. CONCLUSION Following the scale-up of mass screening for COVID-19 in Iran, the rate of new cases detected and reported recovered accelerated significantly. Mass screening is likely to have detected many mild and asymptomatic cases that were infectious. Our data support the role that mass screening, coupled with isolation and contract tracing, can have in slowing the COVID-19 epidemic.","Taheri Soodejani, Moslem; Tabatabaei, Seyyed Mohammad; Dehghani, Ali; McFarland, Willi; Sharifi, Hamid",Archives of Iranian medicine,312,16

Variants of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene may increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events. OBJECTIVE To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base for associations between NAT2 variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity. METHOD This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched for studies in Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science. We included data from 41 articles (39 distinct cohorts of patients). We pooled effect estimates for each genotype on each outcome using meta-analyses stratified by country. RESULTS We assessed the quality of the included studies, which was variable, with many areas of concern. Slow/intermediate NAT2 acetylators were statistically significantly more likely to experience hepatotoxicity than rapid acetylators (OR 1.59, 95%CI 1.26-2.01). Heterogeneity was not detected in the overall pooled analysis (I² = 0%). NAT2 acetylator status was significantly associated with the likelihood of experiencing anti-tuberculosis drug-related hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION We encountered several challenges in performing robust syntheses of data from pharmacogenetic studies, and we outline recommendations for the future reporting of pharmacogenetic studies to enable high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses to be performed.","Richardson, M; Kirkham, J; Dwan, K; Sloan, D J; Davies, G; Jorgensen, A L",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,312,28

We aim to assess time trends in the Cochrane risk of bias domains and sample size in RCTs of intensive care unit (ICU) interventions. METHODS AND DESIGN We will conduct a meta-epidemiologic study of RCTs included in Cochrane systematic reviews assessing any intervention used in adult patients admitted to the ICU. We will search the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and include reviews published from March 2011 corresponding to the latest update in the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We will extract data on risk of bias judgments in the seven Cochrane bias domains and trial sample sizes and evaluate time trends using run charts. The primary outcome will be time trends in the annual proportion of trials with overall low risk of bias (low risk of bias in all bias domains). The secondary outcomes include time trends in the annual median trial sample size, and the annual proportion of trials with low-, unclear- and high risk of bias in each of the seven Cochrane bias domains. DISCUSSION The outlined meta-epidemiologic study will assess time trends in risk of bias and sample sizes in RCTs assessing ICU interventions. This will inform researchers, healthcare personnel and policymakers on the general reliability of findings from RCTs of ICU interventions over time, and inform future RCT design and reporting.","Anthon, Carl Thomas; Granholm, Anders; Perner, Anders; Laake, Jon Henrik; Møller, Morten Hylander",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,312,19

Fifty employees, 38 women, aged 20-60 (M=37.4±10.5) participated in a two-hour group psychoeducation workshop, concerning psychoeducation on stress and application in diaphragmatic breathing exercises. The measurement of the success of the intervention was performed using a proportional stress assessment scale before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS26.ResultsStress levels before the intervention ranged from 0 to 10 (M=5.7±5.7) while after the intervention ranged from 0 to 7 (M=2.3±2.04). Age did not appear to play a role in stress reduction, but was found to be positively and significantly associated with pre-existing stress in employees (r=0.423 p=0.002). On the contrary, gender was found to be related both to the pre-existence of stress, with women reporting the highest levels (t=-3.534 p=0.001), and to the reduction of stress after the intervention (t=-2,534 p=0.001).ConclusionsThe above findings indicate the importance of implementing group psychoeducation programs to reduce stress at the organizational level, a very important result considering the cumulative effect that the recent existence of covid-19 has had on nursing staff.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Lyrakos, G.; Androutsos, D.; Aslani, E.; Spinaris, V.",European Psychiatry,312,1

With such improvements, the world might find cures for incurable diseases like HIV disease and Cancer sooner. Our approach presented in this paper is to utilize a multi-core environment to introduce Data Level Parallelism (DLP) to the Autodock Vina software, which is a widely used for molecular docking software. Autodock Vina already exploits Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) in multi-core environments and therefore optimized for such environments. However, with the results we have obtained, it can be clearly seen that our approach has enhanced the throughput of the already optimized software by more than six times. This will dramatically reduce the time consumed for the lead identification phase in drug designing along with the shift in the processor technology from multi-core to many-core of the current era. Therefore, we believe that the contribution of this project will effectively make it possible to expand the number of small molecules docked against a drug target and improving the chances to design drugs for incurable diseases.","Senanayake, Upul; Prabuddha, Rahal; Ragel, Roshan",,312,5

It is a 45-minute reflective practice using storytelling. It provides an opportunity for people taking part to share recent experiences of their work in health and social care, focusing on participants' emotional and social response to their work. Unlike Schwartz Rounds, the audience is restricted in numbers (maximum 30), is drawn from a single department of a healthcare site rather than from across the organisation, is run and facilitated using virtual platforms, and relays stories from the recent (not distant) past. Methods/Design Two facilitators already trained in delivering Schwartz Rounds (one PEM consultant from the department plus one Trust clinical psychologist) were given additional specific training for running Team Time in March 2020. Six sessions between April and July 2020 were held. The formats of these sessions were as per guidance set by the Point of Care Foundation (UK). A theme for each session was set in advance, with two storytellers invited and prepared in advance by the two facilitators. Two storytellers related a five minute story each uninterrupted, followed by a facilitated discussion with the audience to share their own experiences and/or resonances to the stories told.

Patients and clinicians are faced with difficult choices at every turn, and no approach is without risk. Many primary mood stabilizers have been associated with risk of congenital malformations. In the last 15 years, there has been an increase of antepartum use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, many of which could be viable alternatives to mood stabilizers. Electroconvulsive therapy has been recommended as a safe and efficacious treatment of bipolar depressive and manic episodes in pregnant women.ObjectivesThis case presents a 24-year-old woman, with COVID-19 infection, that underwent an acute manic episode at her 20-weeks-pregnancy. The goal was to stabilize the patient by the use of electroconvulsive therapy.MethodsThe patient was admitted in isolation in the psychiatric ward. Treatment was started with olanzapine 20mg/d and lorazepam 4mg/d. The patient maintained psychotic agitation that required higher dosage, while on the second week of isolation the PCR test was negative. After six weeks of treatment severe manic symptoms continued and electroconvulsive therapy was started.ResultsShe received 10 electroconvulsive therapy sessions. The patient showed a substantial clinical improvement after the seventh administration. She gave birth at 37 weeks, with no complications during labor (Apgar 9/10).ConclusionsElectroconvulsive therapy has been shown as a suitable option for patients with severe psychiatric disorders in the pregnancy period, either medication resistant illness and psychotic agitation.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Tascon Guerra, M.

Recent examples, including hurri-canes, storms, extreme temperatures (cold/hot), and heavy rains, have damaged airport facilities, interrupted air traffic, and caused higher operational costs. With the development of civil aviation and the pre-COVID-19 surging demand for flights, the passengers’ complaints of flight delay in-creased, according to FoxBusiness. This study aims to discover the weather factors affecting flight punctuality and determine a high-dimensional scale of consequences stemming from weather conditions and flight operational aspects. Machine learning has been developed in correlation with the weather and statistical data for operations at Birmingham Airport as a case study. The cross-corre-lated datasets have been kindly provided by Birmingham Airport and the Meteorological Office. The scope and emphasis of this study is placed on the machine learning application to practical flight punctuality prediction in relation to climate conditions. Random forest, artificial neural net-work, support vector machine, and linear regression are used to develop predictive models. Grid-search and cross-validation are used to select the best parameters. The model can grasp the trend of flight punctuality rates well where R2 is 0.80 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 15% using the model developed by random forest technique. The insights derived from this study will help Airport Authorities and the Insurance industry in predicting the scale of consequences in order to promptly enact and enable adaptative airport climate resilience plans, including air traffic rescheduling, financial resilience to climate variances and extreme weather conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Nanopore metagenomic sequencing has the potential to be deployed for near-patient testing, providing rapid diagnosis of infection, rationalising antimicrobial therapy, and supporting interventions for infection control. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of this sequencing approach as a routine laboratory test for influenza in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted Nanopore metagenomic sequencing for 180 respiratory samples from a UK hospital during the 2018/19 influenza season, and compared results to routine molecular diagnostic testing. We investigated drug resistance, genetic diversity, and nosocomial transmission using influenza sequence data. Results: Metagenomic sequencing was 83% (75/90) sensitive and 93% (84/90) specific for detecting influenza A viruses compared with the diagnostic standard (Cepheid Xpress/BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel). We identified a H3N2 genome with the oseltamivir resistant S331R mutation in the NA protein, potentially associated with the emergence of a distinct intra-subtype reassortant. Whole genome phylogeny refuted suspicions of a transmission cluster in the infectious diseases ward, but identified two other clusters that likely reflected nosocomial transmission, associated with a predominant strain circulating in the community. We also detected a range of other potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria from the metagenome. Conclusion: Nanopore metagenomic sequencing can detect the emergence of novel variants and drug resistance, providing timely insights into antimicrobial stewardship and vaccine design. Generation of full genomes can contribute to the investigation and management of nosocomial outbreaks.","Xu, Y.; Lewandowski, K.; Downs, L.; Kavanagh, J.; Hender, T.; Lumley, S.; Jeffery, K.; Foster, D.; Sanderson, N.; Vaughan, A.; Morgan, M.; Vipond, R.; Carroll, M.; Peto, T.; Crook, D.; Walker, S.; Matthews, P.; Pullan, S.",,312,20

The main objective of this study was to prospectively re-confirm the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNAB using the IAC Yokohama system. Additionally, separate separate secondary subgroup analysis was done to confirm the accuracy of breast FNAB excluding lymph-node positive and lymphadenopathy positive tumors. Material and methods: A prospective study was done in a tertiary care centre in North India on patients undergoing core-needle /incisional/excisional biopsy of breast lesions between 1st September 2019 to 30th November,2020 (519 biopsies on 487 unique patients). Of these 519 histopathology biopsies, 505 had corresponding FNAB report of the same site. The FNAB was reported using the IAC Yokohama system and the most suitable category was allotted in every case. The rates of malignancy for each category and the accuracy of breast FNAB in diagnosing malignancy were calculated. Results: Of the total 487 patients, 120 cases were benign on histology, while 367 were malignant. The rates of malignancy in benign, atypical, suspicious and malignant categories were 5%, 25%, 71% and 99.7% respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of atypical, suspicious and malignant categories was calculated as 90.1%, 95.2% and 93.3% respectively.

Attention has focussed on the viral spike protein, but substantial variation has been seen in the ORF8 gene. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein undergoes signal peptide-mediated processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted as a glycosylated, disulphide-linked dimer. The secreted protein from the prototype SARS-CoV-2 virus had no major effect on viability of a variety of cell types, or on IFN or NF-κB signalling. However, it modulated cytokine expression from primary CSF1-derived human macrophages, most notably by decreasing IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, a sequence polymorphism L84S that appeared early in the pandemic associated with the Clade S lineage of virus, showed a markedly different effect, of increasing IL-6 production. We conclude that ORF8 sequence polymorphisms can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 virulence and should therefore be monitored in sequencing-based surveillance.","Kriplani, Nisha; Clohisey, Sara; Fonseca, Sonia; Fletcher, Sarah; Lee, Hui-Min; Ashworth, Jordan; Kurian, Dominic; Lycett, Samantha J.; Tait-Burkard, Christine; Kenneth Baillie, J.; Woolhouse, Mark E.

Those with COVID-19 positivity within their social circle were marginally more likely to have COVID-19 testing (adjusted OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.89 – 3.19, p = 0.107). Concern for COVID infection or COVID-19 in social circle was not associated with sexual intercourse or condom use.ConclusionUrban AYAs remain at risk for STIs and COVID-19 given community rates, low condom use, and low COVID risk perceptions.

Objectives: To determine if laboratory tests predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia upon admission to hospital. Secondary outcome: evaluate if any laboratory parameter predicts longer hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Case control retrospective study of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, admitted to the Peruvian Air Force Hospital from April 6th to June 27th, 2020. Patients were divided in two groups: recovered and deceased and their laboratory parameters entered the statistical analysis. Cox regression was performed (95% CI, p value &lt;0.05, as statistically significant). Bivariate analysis to compare the RDW means of recovered vs. deceased and multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression to evaluate the predictive value of RDW in relation to hospital mortality in our cohort. The statistical package Stata version 14.2 was used. Results: 186 patients were included. The mean age of the recovered patients was 53.6 ± 16.4 years vs 75.9 ± 13.9 years in the deceased group (p &lt;0.0001). The mean value of RDW was 13.14% in recovered vs. 13.96% of deaths (p&lt; 0.0005), associated with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.66 (CI: 1.58-1.74) adjusted for the model.

Food waste generation has noticeably increased during the pandemic across the globe. To alleviate the associated health and environmental concerns, food waste could be converted into electricity and heat through FEWWN systems using waste-to-energy facilities, such as anaerobic digesters and combined heat and power units in wastewater treatment plants and livestock farms. In this work, a multi-period multi-objective optimization model is proposed for the design of efficient nexus systems under various impacts of the pandemic. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed modelling framework, a case study for New York State is presented. The optimized nexus systems could potentially reduce the food waste disposal amounts by 38%. A clear trade-off between the objectives is revealed by the Pareto-optimal solutions. The minimum total cost for the FEWWN system is $27.1 million;the optimal unit processing profit is $11.9 per ton processed food waste. Spatial analyses illustrate a strong correlation between facility selections and their processing capacities.

There is great uncertainty regarding how countries characteristics will affect the spread of the epidemic; to date, there are few studies that attempt to predict the spread of the epidemic in African countries. In this paper, we investigate the role of demographic patterns, urbanization and co-morbidities on the possible trajectories of COVID-19 in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal. Methods: We use an augmented deterministic SIR model to predict the true spread of the disease, under the containment measures taken so far. We dis-aggregate the infected compartment into asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic to match observed clinical development of COVID-19. We also account for age structures, urbanization, and co-morbidities (HIV, tuberculosis, anemia). Results: In our baseline model, we project that the peak of active cases will occur in July, subject to the effectiveness of policy measures. When accounting for the urbanization, and factoring-in co-morbidities, the peak may occur between June 2nd and June 17th (Ghana), July 22 and August 29 (Kenya), and finally May 28th and June15th. Successful containment policies could lead to even lower rates of severe infections. While most cases will be mild, we project accounting for rural areas and comorbidities and in the absence of policies further containing the spread that between 0.78 and 1.03%, 0.61 and 1.22%, and 0.60 and 0.84% of individuals in Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal will be actively infected and develop severe symptoms at the peak of the epidemic. Conclusion: Compared to Europe, Africa's younger and rural population may modify the severity of the epidemic. The large youth population may lead to more infections but most of these infections will be asymptomatic or mild, and will probably go undetected. The higher prevalence of underlying conditions must be considered.","Diop, B. Z.; Ngom, M.; Pougue Biyong, C.; Pougue Biyong, J. N.",,312,16

In this study, 136 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were divided into a critical group (94 cases) and a general group (42 cases). In addition, a questionnaire was used to investigate the mental health of COVID-19 patients in early low-incidence areas, including 147 medical staff members and 213 nonmedical staff members. The effects were compared between the optimized GA template matching (OGATM) algorithm proposed in this study and traditional GATM, which were applied in CT images of COVID-19 patients. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could improve the accuracy of pneumonia detection and reduce the false-positive rate. The average age of patients in the severe group was markedly higher than that of the general group (P < 0.05). The number of cases with diabetes mellitus (49.6%) from the severe group was more than that from the general group (12.4%) (P < 0.05). Lymphocyte count in patients from the severe group (0.68 ± 0.26 × 109/L) was sharply lower than that of the general group (1.12 ± 0.34 × 109/L) (P < 0.05). The total T lymphocyte count in patients from the severe group reduced steeply in contrast to that of the general group (P < 0.05). The anxiety and depression scores of medical patients (39.45 ± 9.45 points and 47.58 ± 10.47 points) were obviously lower than the scores of nonmedical patients (43.57 ± 9.54 points and 52.48 ± 10.25 points) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the elderly and staffs with diabetes mellitus were more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Moreover, the total T lymphocytes of COVID-19 patients were lower than their normal levels, and nonmedical staffs had more psychological stress than medical staffs.

However, traditional approaches to autism research have often problematised and pathologized autistic1 individuals, reinforcing autistic people?s positions as passive subjects. This has resulted in autistic people being largely excluded from the production of knowledge about autism, and about the needs of autistic people. Participatory approaches promote collaborative approaches to enquiry and posit autistic people as active co-constructors of knowledge, a stance that is congruent with social work values of social justice and liberation. However, Covid-19 is not only altering our everyday life but also upending social research. This paper discusses the challenges faced by a participatory study involving autistic people during the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper examines how Covid-19 increased the individual vulnerability of autistic participants and changed their research priorities, increased the researcher?s decision-making power, and placed greater emphasis on barriers created by inaccessible methods. Covid-19 did not present novel challenges, but rather exacerbated existing tensions and inevitable challenges that are inherent in adopting an approach that aims to oppose oppression.","Rudd, Danielle Hwang Se Kwang",Qualitative Social Work,312,20

Early experience with insensitive maternal interactions appears to be predictive of poorer cognitive functioning. These children present a higher risk for the onset of socioemotional development, nutrition, growth and sleep disorders. Research on Covid-19 pandemic suggests that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk of psychological distress.ObjectivesThis study evaluates the effect of perinatal depression on child development and the impact of distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.MethodsWe designed a case-control study comparing, during Covid-19 pandemic, a group-A of children of mothers with PD (n=19), with a group-B of children of healthy mothers (n=21). The age of the children recruited was 4-35 months. Participating mothers underwent DP3-Interview and the socioemotional and adaptive-behavior Bayley’s scales by telephone and completed an online survey (IES-R).ResultsWe found significantly lower scores on the Bayley socioemotional scale and in all the DP3-scales, in group-A. There is an inversely proportional correlation between the age of these children and overall development score of the DP3. On the IES-R scale, the medium scores in both groups show no psychological distress as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, although mothers with PD show borderline total scores and higher hyperarousal scale values.ConclusionsThis study confirms that PD is a risk factor for the onset of disorders in all areas of the child’s development. Mothers with PD are less likely to manage psychological distress secondary to the pandemic.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Pucci, C.; P, M.

Two dimensions of exposure to temperature are generally used to model budbreak: accumulation of time spent at low temperatures (chilling); and accumulation of heat units (forcing). These two effects have a well-established negative correlation: the more chilling, the less forcing required for budbreak. Furthermore, temperate plant species are assumed to vary in amount of chilling required to complete endodormancy and begin the transition to breaking bud. Still, prediction of budbreak remains a challenge. The present work demonstrates across a wide range of species how bud cold hardiness must be accounted for to study dormancy and accurately predict time to budbreak. Cold hardiness defines the path length to budbreak, meaning the difference between the cold hardiness buds attain during the winter, and the cold hardiness at which deacclimated buds are predicted to open. This distance varies among species and throughout winter within a species. Increases in rate of cold hardiness loss (deacclimation) measured throughout winter show that chilling controls deacclimation potential – the proportion of the maximum rate response attained at high chill accumulation – which has a sigmoid relationship to chilling accumulation. For forcing, rates of deacclimation increase non-linearly in response to temperature. Comparisons of deacclimation potential show a dormancy progresses similarly for all species. This observation suggests that comparisons of physiologic and genetic control of dormancy requires an understanding of cold hardiness dynamics and the necessity for an update of the framework for studying dormancy and its effects on spring phenology.","Kovaleski, Al",bioRxiv,312,25

Despite their popularity, clinical studies to evaluate the reliability in obtaining information on a patient's oxygenation status, are lacking. Aim: To evaluate the performance of pulse oximeters under clinical conditions, with arterial blood gas measurement (SaO2) as reference standard. Methods: We studied the accuracy of ten top-selling pulse oximeters in Europe and the USA in an intensive care population at the Flevoziekenhuis in Almere, the Netherlands. The studied pulse oximeters were: AFAC FS10D, AGPTEK FS10C, ANAPULSE ANP 100, Cocobear, Contec CMS50D1, HYLOGY MD-H37, Mommed YM101, PRCMISEMED F4PRO, PULOX PO-200, and Zacurate Pro Series 500DL. Adult patients in whom an SaO2 measurement was obtained as part of routine care were asked for inclusion. Directly after obtaining the SaO2 blood sample we obtained the pulse oximeter readings (SpO2) of the investigational devices, in random order. Outcomes were bias (SpO2-SaO2) mean, root mean square difference (ARMS), mean absolute error (MAE), and accuracy in identifying hypoxemia (SaO2<=90%). As a clinical index test, we included a hospital-grade SpO2-monitor. Results: In 35 consecutive patients we obtained 2,258 SpO2-readings and 234 SaO2-samples. Mean bias ranged from -0.6 to -4.8. None of the pulse oximeters had an ARMS<=3%, the requirement set by ISO-standards and required for FDA 501(k) clearance. The MAE ranged from 2.3 to 5.1, and 5 out of 10 pulse oximeters met the requirements of [≤]3%. For hypoxemia, negative predictive values were 98-99%. Positive predictive values ranged from 11-30%. Highest accuracy (95%CI) were found for Contec CMS50D1; 91% (86-94) and Zacurate Pro Series 500DL; 90% (85-94). The hospital-grade SpO2-monitor had an ARMS of 3.0 and MAE of 1.9, and an accuracy of 95% (91-97%).

Various studies have investigated the role of risk-related information in terms of its certainty and immediacy. This research introduces a model that differentiates and investigates different types of information provided by organizations through social network sites (SNSs) that are related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, including situational information and precautionary measures information specifically. The proposed model targeted users of SNSs in Saudi Arabia, where around 72.38% of its population is considered active SNSs users with 3 h of average daily time spent on SNSs. Based on the survey data collected from 356 online shoppers in Saudi Arabia, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test the proposed model. The reliability of instrument was tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), where the results showed acceptable model fit indices (X-2/df = 2.6, GFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, and RMSEA = 0.067). Based on that, the structural model was built and tested, which also showed acceptable fit indices (X-2/df = 2.9, GFI = 0.92, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91, and RMSEA = 0.073). The findings highlight that situational and adopted precautionary measures information had a significant impact on recommendations (gamma = 0.73) and purchase intentions (gamma = 0.39). Further, organizations that hold themselves accountable for broadcasting updated information related to the crisis and disseminating the necessary preventive measures develop a high level of recommendations and purchase intentions among customers. A personal recommendation construct was confirmed as a partial mediator, where an indirect significant influence was found of broadcasting information on purchase intention through personal recommendation (gamma = 0.309). Therefore, this paper suggests that organizations should consider offering customers all the necessary types of information related to the COVID-19 crisis.","Alhubaishy, A.; Aljuhani, A.",Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research,312,1

To address potential social desirability bias, we use both direct and indirect (list experiment) questions to measure anti-Asian sentiment and link these variables to key socioeconomic factors. We find that, instead of being universal among general populations, anti-Asian sentiment is patterned differently across both country contexts and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, the most significant predictor of anti-Asian bias is political affiliation. By contrast, in Australia, anti-Asian bias is closely linked to a wide range of socioeconomic factors including political affiliation, age, gender, employment status and income.","Tan, Xiao Lee Rennie Ruppanner Leah",Australian Journal of Social Issues,312,1

Different effects such as multipath scattering, noise, degradation, distortion, attenuation, and fading affect the distribution of signals adversely. Deep learning techniques can be used to differentiate among different modulated signals for reliable detection in a communication system. This study aims at distinguishing COVID-19 disease images that have been modulated by different digital modulation schemes and are then passed through different noise channels and classified using deep learning models. We proposed a comprehensive evaluation of different 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for the task of multiclass (24-classes) classification of modulated images in the presence of noise and fading. It is used to differentiate between images modulated through Binary Phase Shift Keying, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying, 16- and 64-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation and passed through Additive White Gaussian Noise, Rayleigh, and Rician channels. We obtained mixed results under different settings such as data augmentation, disharmony between batch normalization (BN), and dropout (DO), as well as lack of BN in the network. In this study, we found that the best performing model is a 2D-CNN model using disharmony between BN and DO techniques trained using 10-fold cross-validation (CV) with a small value of DO before softmax and after every convolution and fully connected layer along with BN layers in the presence of data augmentation, while the least performing model is the 2D-CNN model trained using 5-fold CV without augmentation.","Khan, Rahim Yang Qiang Ahsan Bin Tufail Alam Noor Yong-Kui Ma",Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing (Online),312,26

This often requires a phone evaluation before organising an unscheduled appointment. These sporadic interactions heavily affect available resources. This strain on resources will be further impacted when considering that data from the European CF registry predicts that there will be a 75% increase in the adult CF population by 2025. Furthering this, CF services are increasingly more strained now during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Objective: This research first sets about to design and develop a Virtual Doctor system based on the expertise of a MDT through multiple consultations. Next, pilot data pertaining to user acceptance and experience with using this novel technology is gathered. We therefore aim to investigate if the use of such technology can be beneficial in a specific clinical setting. Method: The final collaborative-design of the Virtual Doctor comprises several technical features and is primarily a voice synthesis system allowing the patient to interact with natural language. The virtual doctor asks the patient questions regarding their health concerns and can collect real-time clinical metrics such as FEV1, oxygen saturation, temperature. The patients’ responses and metrics are then compared to baseline values calculating a score which stratifies a response time from the CF team. This information is then collated in a report and sent to the CF team for action. Future works: Initial stress testing of the technical performance is now complete. Supportive visual media to improve coaching of using clinical devices have now been implemented in preparation for patient pilot testing which is currently ongoing. It is anticipated that a virtual system such as the Virtual Doctor will become more accessible and acceptable to patients, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Morrissy, D.; Curran, A.; Vagg, T.; Dorgan, J.; Fleming, C.; McCarthy, M.; Howlett, C.; Tabirca, S.; Plant, B.

Case Report: The high risk antenatal anaesthetic clinic became aware of a 26-year-old woman (G1P0) of 30 weeks’ gestation with extreme needle phobia. She had no medical history, the pregnancy was low risk and a midwifery-led delivery was planned. The woman declined blood tests in pregnancy. We met the woman with her community midwife. She stated she would run for the hills rather than have a cannula or would lock herself in the bathroom if the need arose. She was indifferent on hearing that a cannula is required for anaesthesia or that refusing one may be life-threatening. Her phobia possibly stemmed from a childhood experience but she had no recall of this. Although sceptical, the woman worked with us on a multifaceted plan. We emphasised the importance of her engagement. A referral for cognitive behavioural therapy failed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead we suggested hypno-birthing techniques and mindfulness apps to manage anxiety. We taught applied tension although doubtful of its use as the woman did not suffer vasovagal symptoms with her phobia. We described graded exposure and gave resources, however she did not manage any of these. We devised distractions involving her partner and media, for example FaceTiming her mother and using headphones to listen to music or watch videos. We asked her to work on positive visualisation, focusing on gains, empowerment and rewards. Medical strategies were planned, specifically topical anaesthesia before cannulation and Entonox. In the event of an emergency caesarean we ruled out inhalational induction before cannulation. In turn, we agreed to be empathetic to her phobia and respect her choices. We agreed to minimise interventions but would not be influenced into deviating from safe protocol. Following initial consultation we remained in telephone contact. She remained unsure if she would consent. Hospital legal services were contacted for advice and a discussion with a QC was arranged. We were advised to create advance consent documents to avoid applying to the courts. After a few hesitant weeks the woman turned a corner and the community midwife reported improvement in mindset. We discussed the legal paperwork but the woman decided it was not necessary. An action plan was attached to her notes. Ultimately she required a cannula for antibiotics, induction of labour, epidural and caesarean delivery under epidural top-up. She was compliant and coped by using varying degrees of the above outlined strategies. On follow-up in the community the midwifery team reported a happy mother looking forward to future pregnancies and being able to keep her phobia under check. Discussion: This case demonstrates the importance of developing a management plan for the extreme needle phobic parturient.

In this work, a human supervisor designates a surface to be disinfected. Then the robot autonomously plans a set of motions to disinfect the surface, using an ultraviolet light held in its gripper. Finally, the system displays the amount of ultraviolet radiation delivered to each part of the surface, so that the human supervisor can verify that the operation was successful. In this paper, we describe this work, and discuss how it could be adapted to the other pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we discuss how to move from disinfecting surfaces, which are of concern for Ebola, to open space disinfection, which is important in the fight against COVID-19. © 2021 ACM.","Sanchez, A.

As exogenous variables, we included a linear time trend and a dummy for the week in which the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID‐19 a global pandemic.Our analysis of Granger causal ordering between the four variables demonstrates that there is significant heterogeneity across the Brazilian federation. These findings can be interpreted as underscoring that there is no common model applicable to all states, and that the dynamics are context‐dependent.Our suggested approach allows researchers to account for the complex interrelationship between government policy, citizen behavior, the economy, and COVID‐related health outcomes.

We initiated the boarding restriction protocol that limits ED length of stay (LOS) for patients awaiting hospitalization to 24 hours from arrival. This study aimed to determine the effect of the protocol on ED crowding. Method This was a pre-post comparative study to compare ED crowding before and after protocol implementation. The primary outcome was the red stage fraction with more than 71 occupying patients in the ED (severe crowding level). LOS in the ED, treatment time and boarding time were compared. Additionally, the pattern of boarding patients staying in the ED according to the day of the week was confirmed. Results Analysis of the number of occupying patients in the ED, measured at 10-minute intervals, indicated a decrease from 65.0 (51.0-79.0) to 55.0 (43.0-65.0) in the pre- and post-periods, respectively (p<0.0001). The red stage fraction decreased from 38.9% to 15.1% of the pre- and post-periods, respectively (p<0.0001). The proportion beyond the goal of this protocol of 24 hours decreased from 7.6% to 4.0% (p<0.0001). The ED LOS of all patients was similar: 238.2 (134.0-465.2) and 238.3 (136.9-451.2) minutes in the pre- and post-periods, respectively. In admitted patients, ED LOS decreased from 770.7 (421.4-1587.1) to 630.2 (398.0-1156.8) minutes (p<0.0001); treatment time increased from 319.6 (198.5-482.8) to 344.7 (213.4-519.5) minutes (p<0.0001); and boarding time decreased from 298.9 (109.5-1149.0) to 204.1 (98.7-545.7) minutes (p<0.0001). In the pre-period, boarding patients accumulated in the ED on weekdays, with the accumulation resolved on Fridays; this pattern was alleviated in the post-period. Conclusions The protocol effectively resolved excessive ED crowding by alleviating the accumulation of boarding patients in the ED on weekdays. Additional studies should be conducted on changes this protocol brings to patient flow hospital-wide.","Lee, J. H.; Kim, J. H.; Park, I.; Lee, H. S.; Park, J. M.; Chung, S. P.; Kim, H. C.; Kim, M.

Although detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater may be prompted with good recoveries during periods of high community prevalence, in the early stages of population outbreaks concentration procedures are required to overcome low viral concentrations. Several methods have become available for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from raw wastewater, generally involving filtration. However, these methods are limited to small sample volumes, possibly missing the early stages of virus circulation, and restrained applicability across different water matrices. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of three methods enabling the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes of wastewater: i) hollow fiber filtration using the inuvai R180, with an enhanced elution protocol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation; ii) PEG precipitation; and iii) skimmed milk flocculation. The performance of the three approaches was evaluated in wastewater from multiple wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with distinct singularities, according to: i) effective volume; ii) percentage of recovery; iii) extraction efficiency; iv) inhibitory effect; and v) the limits of detection and quantification (The inuvai R180 system had the best performance, with detection of spiked controls across all samples, average recovery percentages of 64% for SARS-CoV-2 control and 68% for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), with low variability. The inuvai R180 enables the scalability of volumes without negative impact on the costs, time for analysis, and recovery/inhibition. Moreover, hollow fiber filters favor the concentration of different microbial taxonomic groups. Such combined features make this technology attractive for usage in environmental waters monitoring.","Monteiro, S.; Rente, D.; Cunha, M.

Analysis involving 22,897 firm-year observations from 37 countries shows that companies with higher product competition have lower ESG and those with higher corporate governance have higher ESG. The results also indicate the moderating effect of corporate governance, as the negative relationship between product market competition and ESG diminishes for companies with higher corporate governance. The results remain robust in additional analysis using alternative measures for product market competition and corporate governance. The findings support the joint effect of product market competition and corporate governance in determining corporate performance in ESG. The findings reflect the various pressures influencing ESG practices, and on how the strength of corporate governance plays a vital role in ensuring strategic ESG being employed for the sustainable performance of companies. The findings have implications on companies that want to factor ESG into their plans especially to reinvent their companies for the period that follows the COVID-19 pandemic. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Muhmad, S.

The purpose of this study is to develop two predictive algorithms: one to predict opioid prescription and one to predict OUD. Materials and Methods: We developed an informatics algorithm that trains two deep learning models over patient EHRs using the MIMIC-III database. We utilize both the structured and unstructured parts of the EHR and show that it is possible to predict both of these challenging outcomes. Results: Our deep learning models incorporate both structured and unstructured data elements from the EHRs to predict opioid prescription with an F1-score of 0.88 +/- 0.003 and an AUC-ROC of 0.93 +/- 0.002. We also constructed a model to predict OUD diagnosis achieving an F1-score of 0.82 +/- 0.05 and AUC-ROC of 0.94 +/- 0.008. Discussion: Our model for OUD prediction outperformed prior algorithms for specificity, F1 score and AUC-ROC while achieving equivalent sensitivity. This demonstrates the importance of a.) deep learning approaches in predicting OUD and b.) incorporating both structured and unstructured data for this prediction task. No prediction models for opioid prescription as an outcome were found in the literature and therefore this represents an important contribution of our work as opioid prescriptions are more common than OUDs. Conclusion: Algorithms such as those described in this paper will become increasingly important to understand the drivers underlying this national epidemic.","Kashyap, A.; Callison-Burch, C.; Boland, M.

Some of these constraints likely have impacts on aspects of immunology, such that larger fliers might prioritize risk reduction and safety. Addressing how the evolution of flight may have driven relationships between body size and immunity could be particularly informative for understanding the propensity of some taxa to harbor many virulent and sometimes zoonotic pathogens without showing clinical disease. Here, we used a scaling framework to quantify scaling relationships between body mass and the proportions of two types of white blood cells--lymphocytes, and granulocytes (neutr-/heterophils)--across 60 bat species, 414 bird species, and 256 non-volant mammal species. By using phylogenetically-informed statistical models on field-collected data from wild Neotropical bats, data gleaned from other wild bats available in the literature, and data from captive non-volant mammals and birds, we show that lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions do not vary systematically with body mass among bats. In contrast, larger birds and non-volant mammals have disproportionately higher granulocyte proportions than expected for their body size. Future comparative studies of wild bats, birds, and non-volant mammals of similar body mass should aim to further differentiate evolutionary effects and other aspects of life history on immune defense. Summary statement Powered flight might constrain morphology such that certain immunological features are prioritized. We show that bats largely have similar cell proportions across body mass compared to strong allometric scaling relationships in birds and non-flying mammals.","Ruhs, Emily Cornelius; Becker, Daniel J.; Oakey, Samantha J.; Ogunsina, Ololade; Fenton, M.

Conjugating the peptide to an inert chemical moiety is a strategy that has repeatedly proven to be successful in extending the half-life of some therapeutics. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the available literature and assess it in an unbiased manner to determine which conjugates, both biological and synthetic, provide the greatest increase in therapeutic peptide half-life. Systematic searches run on PubMed, Scopus and SciFinder databases resulted in 845 studies pertaining to the topic, 16 of these were included in this review after assessment against pre-specified inclusion criteria registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42020222579). The most common reasons for exclusion were non-IV administration and large peptide size. Of the 16 studies that were included, a diverse suite of conjugates that increased half-life from 0.1 h to 33.57 h was identified. Amongst these peptides, the largest increase in half-life was seen when conjugated with glycosaminoglycans. A meta-analysis of studies that contained fatty acid conjugates indicated that acylation contributed to a statistically significant extension of half-life. Additionally, another meta-analysis followed by a sensitivity analysis suggested that conjugation with specifically engineered recombinant peptides might contribute to a more efficient extension of peptide half-life as compared to PEGylation. Moreover, we confirmed that while polyethylene glycol is a good synthetic conjugate, its chain length likely has an impact on its effectiveness in extending half-life. Furthermore, we found that most animal studies do not include as much detail when reporting findings as compared to human studies. Inclusion of additional experimental detail on aspects such as independent assessment and randomization may be an easily accomplished strategy to drive more conjugated peptides towards clinical studies.","Wijesinghe, Ashan; Kumari, Sarika; Booth, Valerie",bioRxiv,312,16

Whether excess mortality has occurred during the Delta wave is less well understood. Methods: We performed an observational study using data from the Massachusetts Department of Health. Five years of US Census population data and CDC mortality statistics were applied to a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) model to project the number of expected deaths for each week of the pandemic period, including the Delta period (starting in June 2021, extending through August 28th 2021, for which mortality data are >99% complete). Weekly Covid-19 cases, Covid-19-attributed deaths, and all-cause deaths are reported. County-level excess mortality during the vaccine campaign are also reported, with weekly rates of vaccination in each county that reported 100 or more all-cause deaths during any week included in the study period. Results: All-cause mortality was not observed after March 2021, by which time over 75% of persons over 65 years of age in Massachusetts had received a vaccination. Fewer deaths than expected (which we term 'deficit mortality') occurred both during the summer of 2020, the spring of 2021 and during the Delta wave (beginning June 13, 2021 when Delta isolates represented >10% of sequenced cases). After the initial wave in the spring of 2020, more Covid-19-attributed deaths were recorded that all-cause excess deaths, implying that Covid-19 was misattributed as the underlying cause, rather than a contributing cause of death in some cases. Conclusion: In a state with high vaccination rates, excess mortality has not been recorded during the Delta period. Deficit mortality has been recorded during this period.","Faust, J.

The common element of these models is that some (or all) of the intra/inter-molecular inter-actions are explicitly defined to stabilize an experimentally-determined structure. To facilitate the development and application of this broad class of models, we previously released the SMOG 2 software package. This suite allows one to easily customize and distribute structure-based (i.e. SMOG) models for any type of polymer-ligand system. Since its original release, user feedback has driven the implementation of numerous enhancements. Here, we describe recent extensions to the software and demonstrate the capabilities of the most recent version, SMOG v2.4. Changes include new tools that aid user-defined customization of force fields, as well as an interface with the OpenMM simulation libraries (OpenSMOG v1.0). To illustrate the utility of these advances, we present several applications of SMOG2 and OpenSMOG, which include systems with millions of atoms, long polymers and explicit ions. We also highlight how one can incorporate non-structure-based (e.g. AMBER-based) energetics to define a hybrid class of models. The representative applications include large-scale rearrangements of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the HIV-1 capsid in the presence of explicit ions, and crystallographic lattices of ribosomes and proteins.

Despite a daily record jump in the number of deaths and cases each day since mid-March, India’s Ministry of Health, Family, and Welfare has consistently maintained a narrative that the growth rate of the Covid-19 cases in India has remained linear and not exponential;that its strict twenty-one-day lockdown, whose objective was preventive, has successfully slowed the spread of the virus;that India is “on the path of success and will win the war against the pandemic” and that the two extensions of the lockdown should be considered an exit strategy.

The study further tested if specific subfactors within the diagnostic classification of hypermobility predict clinical presentations. Design: We report part of a larger case-control study exploring mechanisms of chronic pain and fatigue in Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS (https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN78820481) Setting: an NHS Clinical Research Facility. Participants: A subsample of 87 participants were assessed for symptomatic hypermobility by a trained clinician; 63 presented with a clinical diagnosis of either Fibromyalgia and or ME/CFS confirmed at screening; 24 participants were confirmed as healthy controls. Main outcome measures: 1) Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome and 2017 hEDS diagnostic criteria. 2) ACR 2010 Diagnostic Criteria for Fibromylagia and Canadian and Fukada diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. 3) Self report measures of subjective pain, fatigue and interoceptive sensibility. Results: Twenty of the 63 patients (32%) presented with a clinical diagnosis of Fibromyalgia; 24 (38%) with a clinical diagnosis of ME/CFS and 19 (30%) with dual diagnoses of fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. After evaluation using clinical research tools, 56 patients (89%) met ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia; 59 (94%) Canadian Criteria for ME/CFS; and 61 (97%) Fukada Criteria for ME/CFS. After research evaluation 52 patients (85%) in fact met diagnostic criteria for Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS on all three sets of tools (ACR, Canadian, Fukada). In addition, 51 patients (81%) and 9 (37.5%) healthy controls met Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome and 11 (18%) and 2 (8%) of patients and controls respectively, on the 2017 hEDS criteria. Of these patient participants with symptomatic hypermobility only 12 (23.5%) had received a prior diagnosis of hypermobility. Across all participants meeting Brighton Criteria, 13 (22%) also endorsed a hEDS diagnosis. Membership of the patient group was predicted by meeting the Brighton Criteria for joint hypermobility syndrome (p=<0.001, OR 7.08, 95% CI 2.50 to 20.00), but not by meeting the hEDS criteria. The historical, rather than current Beighton score correlated with; 1) total pain reported on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (short form), (r= 0.25, n= 73, p=0.03); 2) Widespread Pain Index (derived from ACR diagnostic criteria) (r=0.26, n= 86, p=0.01); 3) ACR symptom severity (r=0.27, n=85, p=0.01); 4) Fatigue Impact (r=0.29, n=56, p=0.28); and 5) interoceptive sensibility (r=0.30, n=56, p=0.02. Conclusions: Symptomatic joint hypermobility is relevant to symptoms and diagnosis in Fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. These conditions are poorly understood yet have a considerable impact on quality of life. Further work is needed to determine the prevalence of hEDS within the general population and define the critical clinical dimensions within symptomatic hypermobility.

Testing at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of preventing early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Sample collection protocols were developed and refined during preliminary sampling from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Optimized sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n=105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. However, if the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive then the sensitivity would be 95.2% but the specificity would drop to 52%. We determined a highly sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 shedding in building wastewater however our methods could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Future work must focus on methods to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to widely deploy this promising wastewater surveillance tool.","Colosi, Lisa M; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Porter, Michael D; Poulter, Melinda D; Ratliff, Cameron; Simmons, William; Morse, Rena G; Steinberg, Limor I; Wilson, D.

This paper presents a shift in methodological thinking and deployment of participatory processes toward a more dynamic and resilient approach of user-centered design in a multi-year joint academia-industry design project. We moved beyond an overreliance on resource-intensive formal discrete events - such as in-person design workshops, focus groups, or traditional field studies and observations - toward including more continuous inputs to create a more sustainable and fluid approach within a living lab ecosystem. User-centered data collection methods were organized in a framework across three dimensions of interaction: 1) Communication;2) Timing;and 3) Presence. Expanding methodological options along these differing dimensions increased opportunities for more diversified inputs and sample recruitment, while increasing overall data and design feedback collected. Lowering participation and knowledge sharing thresholds enabled more continuous, inclusive involvement of key stakeholders throughout design processes.","Mallam, S.

Tongue thickness measurement is one of the evaluations for swallowing function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between tongue thickness and tongue pressure in the Japanese elderly. We evaluated 254 elderly patients; all the participants underwent tongue ultrasonography and tongue pressure measurement. To determine tongue thickness, we measured the vertical distance from the surface of the mylohyoid muscle to the tongue dorsum using ultrasonography. Result analyses revealed that tongue thickness was linearly associated with tongue pressure in both sexes. In male participants, dyslipidemia, lower leg circumference, and tongue pressure were independently significantly associated with tongue thickness. In female participants, body mass index and tongue pressure were independently significantly associated with tongue thickness. Tongue thickness was significantly decreased by age for both men and women. The optimal cutoff for tongue thickness to predict the tongue pressure of < 20 kPa was 41.3 mm in males, and 39.3 mm in females. In the Japanese elderly, tongue thickness using ultrasonography is associated with tongue pressure. Tongue thickness and tongue pressure, which are sensitive markers for oral frailty, decrease in aging. The tongue ultrasonography provides a less invasive technique for determining tongue thickness and related aspiration risks for elderly patients.","Nakamori, Masahiro; Imamura, Eiji; Fukuta, Masako; Tachiyama, Keisuke; Kamimura, Teppei; Hayashi, Yuki; Matsushima, Hayato; Ogawa, Kanami; Nishino, Masami; Hirata, Akiko; Mizoue, Tatsuya; Wakabayashi, Shinichi",bioRxiv,312,1

Insertion of this reporter ORF between the first and second codons of the BYV ORFs encoding the HSP70 homolog (HSP70h), a major capsid protein (CP), and a 20-kDa protein (p20) resulted in the expression of the processed GUS-Pro reporter from corresponding subgenomic RNAs. The high sensitivity of GUS assays permitted temporal analysis of reporter accumulation, revealing early expression from the HSP70h promoter, followed by the CP promoter and later the p20 promoter. The kinetics of transcription of the remaining BYV genes encoding a 64-kDa protein (p64), a minor capsid protein (CPm), and a 21-kDa protein (p21) were examined via Northern blot analysis. Taken together, the data indicated that the temporal regulation of BYV gene expression includes early (HSP70h, CPm, CP, and p21 promoters) and late (p64 and p20 promoters) phases. It was also demonstrated that the deletion of six viral genes that are nonessential for RNA amplification resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of transcription from one of the two remaining subgenomic promoters. Comparison with other positive-strand RNA viruses producing multiple subgenomic RNAs showed the uniqueness of the pattern of closterovirus transcriptional regulation.","Hagiwara, Y; Peremyslov, V V; Dolja, V V",Journal of virology,312,28

METHODS Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with TCM to treat NPC were extensively searched in eight databases. Two researchers independently assessed the quality and validity of the included trials and extracted outcome data. Thirteen RCTs were included for analysis. RESULTS Compared to using RT and/or CT, TCM combined with conventional cancer therapy had significantly improved Karnofsky performance status (KPS) [odds ratio (OR) 4.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.06-7.56]. TCM as an adjunctive therapy significantly reduced the serious adverse effects of RT to the oral mucosa and skin so that grade I+II prevailed [OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.31-3.66; OR 8.63, 95% CI 3.28-22.70, respectively].

METHODS Volunteers from employees of the animal market were recruited and their serum specific antibody against SARS-CoV were determined by enzyme linked immunesorbent assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS Positive SARS-CoV specific IgG antibody was found 25.61% (n = 328), 13.03% (n = 238), 12.59% (n = 135), 5.04% (n = 139) and 9.43% (n = 53) among volunteers, which were sampled in May 2003, Dec. 2003, Jan. 2004, July 2004 and June 2005 respectively. No specific IgM antibody was found in all of those samples. Among 129 samples which were tested twice or more, 97 were all negative, 18 all positive, 13 changed from positive to negative but only one sample from negative to positive. When the volunteers were divided by the duration of their working experiences as short-term or long-term, those who had worked at animal market for less than or more then 6 months when being tested, the positive rate for long-term employees were relatively constant, however, all of the persons employed after January 2004, when the palm civets and raccoon dogs were culled from the market, were tested negative. CONCLUSION The prevalence of specific antibody against SARS-CoV in employees of the animal market were somehow related with the presence or absence of palm civet. No serum was tested positive for persons who were employed after palm civets and raccoon dogs were culled from market. This data indicated that the SARS-CoV might have been from the palm civets and raccoon dog, and the animal market seemed to serve as one of the sources of infection.","Xu, Hui-Fang; Xu, Rui-Heng; Xu, Jian-Guo; Gu, Jing; Zhang, Zhou-Bin; Gao, Kai; Jing, Huai-Qi; Luo, Hui-Ming; Gao, Yang; Guo, Rong-Tong; Liang, Cai-Yun; Zhao, Yu-Teng; Zou, Xiao-Zhong; Wang, Ming",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,312,5

We hypothesized that this might reduce positive airway pressure in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, inducing alveolar collapse and causing impaired oxygenation and compliance of the respiratory system. METHODS We studied 40 consecutive ICU subjects (P(aO2)/F(IO2) ratio ≤ 300 mm Hg), mechanically ventilated with pressure-regulated volume control or pressure support and PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O. Before the filter exchange, (baseline) tidal volume, breathing frequency, end-inspiratory plateau pressure, and PEEP were recorded. Compliance of the respiratory system was calculated; F(IO2), blood pressure, and pulse rate were registered; and P(aO2), P(aCO2), pH, and base excess were measured. Measurements were repeated 15 and 60 min after the filter exchange. In addition, a bench test was performed with a precision test lung with similar compliance and resistance as in the clinical study. RESULTS The exchange of the filter took 3.5 ± 1.2 s (mean ± SD). There was no significant change in P(aO2) (89 ± 16 mm Hg at baseline vs 86 ± 16 mm Hg at 15 min and 88 ± 18 mm Hg at 60 min, P = .24) or in compliance of the respiratory system (41 ± 11 mL/cm H2O at baseline vs 40 ± 12 mL/cm H2O at 15 min and 40 ± 12 mL/cm H2O at 60 min, P = .32). The bench study showed that auto-triggering by the ventilator when disconnecting from the expiratory circuit kept the tracheal pressure above PEEP for at least 3 s with pressure controlled ventilation. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a short disconnection of the expiratory ventilator circuit from the ventilator during filter exchange was not associated with any significant deterioration in lung function 15 and 60 min later. This result may be explained by auto-triggering of the ventilator with high inspiratory flows during the filter exchange, maintaining airway pressure.","Engström, Joakim; Reinius, Henrik; Fröjd, Camilla; Hans, Jonsson; Hedenstierna, Göran; Larsson, Anders",Respiratory care,312,15

This was tragically highlighted during the international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 with attack rates of more than 50% in HCW. The purpose of this article is to review common airborne and droplet-transmitted bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections with regard to their impact on health care workers. Lessons need to be learned from the SARS epidemic. The three main strategies to prevent or control occupationally acquired infections are relatively simple and cost-effective-droplet and contact precautions and for some pathogens also vaccination. Enforced implementation of stringent droplet precautions during the SARS crisis should be maintained; and this will most likely have a major additional impact on other nosocomial infections. Employee health services should proactively and creatively devise delivery systems that enhance compliance with vaccination programs for all health care workers. Hospital surveillance should be expanded to all respiratory diseases to facilitate early detection of nosocomial outbreaks, and this should also include surveillance of all HCW. Integrated syndromic and virological surveillance systems set up during the SARS epidemic will also further our understanding of other respiratory infections in the hospital setting. Even if pursuing early diagnosis for unspecific respiratory illnesses is expensive, identification of the causative organism may reduce unnecessary isolation, contact tracing and anxiety, in particular during an outbreak situation.

METHODS Thirty four patients of mean age 14.7 years completed both pulmonary function and maximal aerobic capacity tests at 6 months. All had normal clinical examination and were asymptomatic. Their exercise responses were compared with a group of healthy controls. Complete data were collected on 27 of the original 34 cases at 15 months. RESULTS Compared with normal controls, the patient group had significantly lower absolute and mass related peak oxygen consumption (peak V o(2) (p<0.01)), higher ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (p<0.01), lower oxygen pulse (p<0.01), and a lower oxygen uptake efficiency slope (p<0.01) at 6 months. This impairment was unexpected and out of proportion with the degree of lung function abnormality. Residual high resolution computed tomography of thorax (HRCT) abnormalities were present in 14 patients. Those with abnormal HRCT findings had significantly lower mass related peak V o(2) than subjects with normal radiology (p<0.01). Absolute and mass related peak V o(2) in the patient group remained impaired at 15 months despite normalisation of lung function in all patients. CONCLUSIONS The mechanism for the reduced aerobic capacity in children following SARS is not fully understood, but it is probably a consequence of impaired perfusion to the lungs at peak exercise and deconditioning.","Yu, C C W; Li, A M; So, R C H; McManus, A; Ng, P C; Chu, W; Chan, D; Cheng, F; Chiu, W K; Leung, C W; Yau, Y S; Mo, K W; Wong, E M C; Cheung, A Y K; Leung, T F; Sung, R Y T; Fok, T F",Thorax,312,5

Here we show that in an evolutionary response to sport hunting of bighorn trophy rams (Ovis canadensis) body weight and horn size have declined significantly over time. We used quantitative genetic analyses, based on a partly genetically reconstructed pedigree from a 30-year study of a wild population in which trophy hunting targeted rams with rapidly growing horns, to explore the evolutionary response to hunter selection on ram weight and horn size. Both traits were highly heritable, and trophy-harvested rams were of significantly higher genetic 'breeding value' for weight and horn size than rams that were not harvested. Rams of high breeding value were also shot at an early age, and thus did not achieve high reproductive success. Declines in mean breeding values for weight and horn size therefore occurred in response to unrestricted trophy hunting, resulting in the production of smaller-horned, lighter rams, and fewer trophies.","Coltman, David W; O'Donoghue, Paul; Jorgenson, Jon T; Hogg, John T; Strobeck, Curtis; Festa-Bianchet, Marco",Nature,312,1

However, little is known about a closely related strain, MHV-2, which is only weakly neurotropic. To better understand the molecular basis of neurotropism of MHVs, we compared the pathogenesis and genomic sequence of MHV-2 with that of MHV-A59. Intracerebral injection of MHV-2 into 4-week-old C57B1/6 mice produces acute meningitis and hepatitis without encephalitis or chronic inflammatory demyelination. Sequence comparison between MHV-2 and MHV-A59 reveals 94-98% sequence identity of the replicase gene, 83-95% sequence identity of genes 2a, 3, 5b, 6, and 7, and marked difference in the sequence of genes, 2b, 4, and 5a. This information provides the basis for further studies exploring the mechanism of viral neurotropism and virus-induced demyelination.","Das Sarma, J; Fu, L; Hingley, S T; Lavi, E",Experimental and molecular pathology,312,16

Little is known, however, about the effect of influenza vaccination on the whole range of severity of respiratory tract infections. METHODS We investigated the effect of annual influenza vaccination on the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in community-dwelling elderly individuals. From 1996 to 2002, we performed a population-based cohort study, using the computerized Integrated Primary Care Information database in the Netherlands, of community-dwelling subjects who were 65 years or older on January 1 of the year of study entry. For each year, the individual cumulative exposure to influenza vaccination since study entry was computed. We compared the risk of LRTI after a first vaccination or revaccination with the risk for no vaccination using a time-varying multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and underlying disease. RESULTS In the study population of 26 071 subjects, 3412 developed LRTIs during follow-up. During the influenza epidemic periods, a first vaccination did not reduce risk for LRTI. In the total population, the hazard ratio following a first vaccination was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.05); in the population without or with comorbidity, these ratios were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.45) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.04), respectively. During epidemic periods, revaccination reduced risk of LRTI by 33% (95% CI, 8% to 52%) in individuals without comorbidity. In individuals with comorbidity, the risk reduction of 5% was nonsignificant (95% CI, -10% to 18%). CONCLUSION In this study, annual influenza revaccination was associated with a reduction in LRTI in community-dwelling elderly individuals.","Voordouw, Bettie C G; Sturkenboom, Miriam C J M; Dieleman, Jeanne P; Stijnen, Theo; van der Lei, Johan; Stricker, Bruno H C",Archives of internal medicine,312,1

VLPs are multiprotein structures that resemble viable virus particles in conformation but lack the viral genome. Consequently, they are non-infectious and non-replicative, but retain the ability to penetrate cells, making them useful for a vast spectrum of applications. Above all, VLPs mimicking genuine viruses in antigenic structure provide a safe alternative to attenuated and inactivated viruses in vaccine development. Moreover, due to their transducing proprieties, VLPs may efficiently deliver foreign nucleic acids, proteins, or conjugated compounds to the organism, or even to specific cell types. Additionally, VLPs are versatile nanovectors due to their flexibility in terms of composition and expression systems. In this review, different approaches for of virus-like particle synthesis and manipulation, as well as their potential applications, will be discussed.","Naskalska, Antonina; Pyrć, Krzysztof",Polish journal of microbiology,312,10

BRSV infection frequently leads to the death of young infected animals. The presence of BRSV in postmortem specimens is routinely detected using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). However, this technique requires special equipment and considerable expertise. The present paper describes the development of a 1-step ELISA for rapid (1.5 hours) detection of BRSV antigen in organ homogenates. The performance of the new 1-step ELISA was evaluated using bovine postmortem specimens (n = 108) in comparison with 3 other BRSV diagnostic techniques: indirect immunofluorescence, the Clearview respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relative sensitivity, specificity, and the kappa coefficient of 1-step ELISA, the Clearview RSV electroimmunoassay (EIA), and IIF were calculated, using real-time RT-PCR as the reference test. The new 1-step ELISA was the most sensitive and specific of the 3 tests. Thus, the new 1-step ELISA is a reliable test for detecting BRSV antigen in organ homogenates.","Quinting, Birgit; Robert, Béatrice; Letellier, Carine; Boxus, Mathieu; Kerkhofs, Pierre; Schynts, Frédéric; Collard, Alfred","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",312,10

AIM A comparative quantitative-qualitative analysis of complications and failure of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in a 5-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred ten adult participants with varicose veins clinical grade C2 to C6, treated for isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) insufficiency in a single lower extremity in 2009 to 2010, were enrolled and subdivided into EVLA (n = 56) and RFA (n = 54) groups. Both groups were compared for demography, disease stage, affected veins, perioperative, and postoperative complications as well as treatment efficacy. RESULTS The perioperative and postoperative complications were statistically insignificant. Treatment efficacy, expressed as the number of participants with recurrent varicosity and recanalization, was comparable in both groups. The clinically significant recanalization rate was 3.6% and 5.6% in EVLA and RFA groups, respectively. CONCLUSION Endovenous laser ablation and RFA for the management of lower extremity varicose vein offer comparable efficacy and safety in a 5-year follow-up.","Woźniak, Witold; Mlosek, R Krzysztof; Ciostek, Piotr",Vascular and endovascular surgery,312,24

Currently, the association between DPP-4 inhibitor and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcome is not yet established. This study aims to analyze the potential association between DPP-4 inhibitor and the composite poor outcome of COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until November 29th, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and DPP-4 inhibitor were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. Results: Our pooled analysis showed that DPP-4 inhibitor use was not associated with composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 [OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.93-1.28), p = 0.29, I 2 = 0%, random-effect modelling], and its subgroup which comprised of severe COVID-19 [OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.87-1.31), p = 0.54, I 2 = 0%, random-effect modelling], and mortality [OR 1.14 (95% CI 0.87-1.51), p = 0.35, I 2 = 8%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association was not influenced by age (p = 0.663), hypertension (p = 0.454), and admission blood glucose (p = 0.310). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in East Asian populations (OR 1.02) compared to European populations (OR 1.11). Conclusion: DPP-4 inhibitor in diabetic patients did not alter the outcomes from COVID-19. Our study suggest that the use of DPP-4 inhibitor in COVID-19 patients with diabetes may still be continued according to the patients' need.

As this occupational group treats ever-increasing mental health problems, it is essential to appraise key factors for their mental health. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore burnout of professional psychotherapists. A total of 110 participants completed self-report measures regarding burnout, self-compassion, work-life balance and telepressure. Correlation, regression and moderation analyses were conducted. Both of the burnout components-emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation-were positively associated with weekly working hours and telepressure, and negatively associated with age, self-compassion and work-life balance. Weekly working hours and work-life balance were significant predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation. Lastly, self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between work-life balance and emotional exhaustion but did not mediate the relationship between work-life balance and depersonalisation. The findings suggest that maintaining high work-life balance is particularly important for the mental health of psychotherapists, protecting them from burnout. Moreover, self-compassion needs to be cultivated to mitigate emotional exhaustion. Mental health care for this occupational group needs to be implemented to achieve sustainable mental health care for workers and the public.","Kotera, Yasuhiro; Maxwell-Jones, Robert; Edwards, Ann-Marie; Knutton, Natalie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),312,16

Applications to the COVID-19 Pandemic,18.26197,2.9986312,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Egypt started in 2000 at 8 sentinel sites geographically distributed all over the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 °C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","Fahim, Manal; Ghonim, Hanaa Abu El Sood; Roshdy, Wael H; Naguib, Amel; Elguindy, Nancy; AbdelFatah, Mohamad; Hassany, Mohamed; Mohsen, Amira; Afifi, Salma; Eid, Alaa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,312,24

We therefore explored the role of relevant comorbidities and medications in relation to the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. METHODS: All ICU COVID-19 patients in Sweden until 27 May 2020 were matched to population controls on age and gender to assess the risk of ICU admission. Cases were identified, comorbidities and medications were retrieved from high-quality registries. Three conditional logistic regression models were used for risk of ICU admission and three Cox proportional hazards models for risk of ICU mortality, one with comorbidities, one with medications and finally with both models combined, respectively. RESULTS: We included 1981 patients and 7924 controls. Hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, asthma, obesity, being a solid organ transplant recipient and immunosuppressant medications were independent risk factors of ICU admission and oral anticoagulants were protective. Stroke, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) were independent risk factors of ICU mortality in the pre-specified primary analyses; treatment with statins was protective. However, after adjusting for the use of continuous renal replacement therapy, RAASi were no longer an independent risk factor. CONCLUSION: In our cohort oral anticoagulants were protective of ICU admission and statins was protective of ICU death. Several comorbidities and ongoing RAASi treatment were independent risk factors of ICU admission and ICU mortality.","Ahlström, Björn; Frithiof, Robert; Hultström, Michael; Larsson, Ing-Marie; Strandberg, Gunnar; Lipcsey, Miklos",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,312,24

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from psychiatric professionals in 34 hospitals between 29 January and 7 February 2020, in China. Hospitals equipped with fever clinics or deployed on wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. PRIMARY OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The severity of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress were assessed by the Chinese versions of 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder, 7-item Insomnia Severity Index and 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 610 psychiatric professionals were included. 29.8% were employed in Wuhan, and 22.5% were frontline workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (461 (75.6%)), anxiety (282 (46.2%)), insomnia (336 (55.1%)) and mental stress (481 (78.9%)). Psychiatric symptoms were associated with worrying about infection (eg, OR 2.36 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.39) for anxiety), risks of exposure to COVID-19 (eg, having inadequate personal protection equipment, OR 2.43 (1.32 to 4.47) for depression) and self-perceived physical health (eg, OR 3.22 (2.24 to 4.64) for mental stress). Information sources of COVID-19 were also found to be both positively (eg, information from relatives, OR 2.16 (1.46 to 3.21) for mental stress) and negatively (eg, information from TV, OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.77) for mental stress) associated with mental stress. There is preliminary evidence that mental health might benefit from greater availability of mental healthcare services. The structural equation model analysis indicated that worrying about infection may be the primary mediator via which risk of exposure to COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of psychiatric professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings demonstrate several pathways via which the COVID-19 pandemic may have negatively affected the mental health of psychiatric professionals in China.","Guo, Xin; McCutcheon, Robert; Pillinger, Toby; Arumuham, Atheeshaan; Chen, Jianhua; Ma, Simeng; Yang, Jun; Wang, Ying; Hu, Shaohua; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhong-Chun",BMJ Open,312,5

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the primary framework employed for analysis, in which system quality and e-learning experience were included as external constructs to seek out a much better model to improve the understanding of students' intention to adopt e-learning. An extended TAM model was developed and tested in this study. The model consists of six constructs: system quality, e-learning experience, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward use, and behavioural intention. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and SMART PLS 3.0 software were applied for data analysis. The findings informed that the proposed model has been succefully explained factors university students use of e-learning during the pandemic in Indonesia.

Infection with CoVs typically presents as mild to severe respiratory or enteric disease, but CoVs have the potential to cause significant morbidity or mortality in highly susceptible age groups. CoVs have exhibited a penchant for jumping species barriers throughout history with devastating effects. The emergence of highly pathogenic or infectious CoVs in humans over the past 20 years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), and most recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscores the significant threat that CoV spillovers pose to humans. Similar to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have been devastating to commercial animal production over the past century, including infectious bronchitis virus in poultry and bovine CoV, as well as the emergence and reemergence of multiple CoVs in swine including transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. These naturally occurring animal CoV infections provide important examples for understanding CoV disease as many animal CoVs have complex pathogenesis similar to SARS-CoV-2 and can shed light on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We provide an overview and update regarding selected existing animal CoVs and their primary host species, diseases caused by CoVs, how CoVs jump species, whether these CoVs pose an outbreak risk or risk to humans, and how we can mitigate these risks.","Kenney, Scott P; Wang, Qiuhong; Vlasova, Anastasia; Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda",Vet Pathol,312,2

To describe a simple and convenient method for detection and manual compensation of cyclotorsion during the procedure. METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 164 eyes from 114 patients over 20 years of age with at least 1.5 diopters (D) of myopic astigmatism were treated by SMILE. Any cyclotorsion was manually compensated by gently rotating the cone to align the horizontal marks on the cornea to the 0° to 180° axis of the reticule after activating the suction. RESULTS: The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.3±2.01 D, and the mean cylinder was -2.01±0.67 D. Three months after surgery, a total of 87% of eyes were within±0.50 D of attempted post-operative SE, and 98% of eyes were within±1.00 D. Overall, the predictability of cylinder correction was excellent, with 96.3% of eyes within±1.00 D of attempted post-operative cylinder. The mean postoperative cylinder at three months was -0.3±0.39 D. We noted a slight undercorrection with treatment of high cylinder. However, 82% of eyes achieved postoperative refractive astigmatism less than 0.5 D. 91% of eyes achieved uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) equal to or better than 8/10. 22% of eyes gained one line of visual acuity. CONCLUSION: SMILE is a predictable and safe technique for the surgical correction of astigmatism. Manual compensation may be an effective approach to improve astigmatic outcomes of SMILE, especially in moderate and high astigmatism.","Assad, M; Chazalon, T; Naguszewski, D; Muraine, M",,312,4

The four countries were chosen due to their ability to contain the spread and mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on their societies. Methods: We use document analysis based on the available national reports, media announcements, official coronavirus websites and governmental decrees in each of the four countries starting from the 1st of January o the 9th of August announcements. We apply a policy gradient to compare and examine the policies implemented in the four countries. Findings: The four countries have different demographic, epidemiological, socioeconomic profiles but managed to control the pandemic at an early stage in terms of total number of positive cases. The four countries managed to absorb the health system shock and decrease the case fatality ratio of COVID-19. Early interventions were crucial to avoid expected life lost in case of no early lockdown. The pandemic triggered several economic stimulus and relief measures in the four countries; the impact or the economic rebound is yet to be fully observed. Conclusions: We conclude that early, proactive and strict interventions along with leveraging previous experience on communicable diseases and the evolution of testing strategies are key lessons that can be synthesized from the interventions of the four countries and that could be useful for a potential second wave or similar pandemics.","Fouda, Ayman; Mahmoudi, Nader; Moy, Naomi; Paolucci, Francesco",,312,32

In this paper, we discuss use of an external emergency department (ED) site by a hospital system based in Charlotte, North Carolina to address concerns of a local surge similar to those seen around the country. OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate how expansion of ED facilities can increase efficiency of care for patients while also improving safety for clinicians, staff, and non-infected patients. METHODS: We describe development and implementation of our external ED drive-through testing sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from three external ED sites in the Atrium Health system between March 15th and April 15th, 2020. Patients were included if they were seen at one of the sites and tested for COVID-19. There were no exclusion criteria. We analyzed the data to identify any differences in patient demographics between sites. RESULTS: We saw 580 patients across the three sites, 302 of whom met criteria for COVID-19 testing. The majority of patients tested were Caucasian females. The majority who tested positive, however, were males. Thirteen patients were redirected into the hospital ED for further medical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: External expansion of the ED is an important strategy that can allow hospitals to accommodate potentially infectious patients while maintaining appropriate isolation and rapid throughput. Proper implementation of the right system to meet hospital-specific needs can prove effective for the healthcare system.","Bradley, Keegan; Constantine, Tyler; Morel, Benjamin; Waggy, Catherine; O039,; Bryon, Stephanie; Barnard, Kathy; Callaway, David",J. emerg. med,312,2

Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome the limitations of observational studies, e.g., unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. We aimed to elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To that end, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable, and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released in January 2021). In single-variable Generalized Summary MR analysis, the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for genetic liability to BIP-SCZ (a combined GWAS of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls) increasing risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). However, we found a significant, positive genetic correlation between BIP-SCZ and COVID-19 of 0.295 and could not confirm causal or horizontally pleiotropic effects using another method. No genetic liabilities to COVID-19 phenotypes increased the risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR using both neuropsychiatric and a range of other phenotypes, only genetic instruments of BMI remained causally associated with COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia combined slightly increased COVID-19 susceptibility in one univariable analysis, other MR and multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of BMI to be causally implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no consistent proof of genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID-19 liability or vice versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. Previously reported positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 by others may have resulted from statistical models incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate.","Luykx, Jurjen J; Lin, Bochao D",Transl Psychiatry,312,1

METHODS: Retrospectively, ten children with confirmed COVID-19 in the Jinan Infectious Disease Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University were enrolled between January 23, 2020 to March 9, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of the children were analyzed. RT-PCR assays were performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in the respiratory tract and fecal specimens in the follow-up after discharge. RESULTS: Among ten patients, five (50%) were asymptomatic and five (50%) showed mild symptoms of respiratory illness. The average age of asymptomatic children was younger than that of symptomatic children (p = 0.03). The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) (p = 0.03) and lymphocyte (p = 0.03) counts were more severe in symptomatic patients than those in asymptomatic patients. During the follow-up examination after discharge, seven out of ten patients contained SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in their fecal specimens, despite all patients showed negative results in respiratory tract specimens.

Identifying resources that help mitigate stress is critical to maintaining HCPs' well-being. However, to our knowledge, no instrument has systematically examined how different levels of resources help HCPs cope with stress during COVID-19. This cross-sectional study involved 119 HCPs (64 nurses and 55 physicians) and evaluated the perceived availability, utilization, and helpfulness of a list of personal, hospital, and healthcare system resources. Participants also reported on their level of burnout, psychological distress, and intentions to quit. Results revealed that HCPs perceived the most useful personal resource to be family support; the most useful hospital resources were a safe environment, personal protective equipment, and support from colleagues; the most useful system resources were job protection, and clear communication and information about COVID. Moreover, HCPs who perceived having more available hospital resources also reported lower levels of psychological distress symptoms, burnout, and intentions to quit. Finally, although training and counseling services were perceived as useful to reduce stress, training was not perceived as widely available, and counseling services, though reported as being available, were underutilized. This instrument helps identify resources that support HCPs, providing implications for healthcare management.","Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Drouin, Susan; Harley, Jason M",Eval Health Prof,312,16

Herein we characterize biopsy and excisional breast cancer specimens submitted for 21-gene testing. METHODS: US samples submitted to Genomic Health for 21-gene testing (01/2004-04/2020) were assessed by pathologists and analyzed by a standardized quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Predefined cutoffs were: ESR1 (positive &#8805;6.5), PGR (positive &#8805;5.5), and ERBB2 (negative <10.7). ER status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and lymph node status were determined locally. Median and interquartile range were reported for continuous variables, and total and percent for categorical variables. Distributions were assessed overall, by age, and by nodal involvement. RESULTS: Of 919 701 samples analyzed, 13% were biopsies and 87% were excisions. Initial assay success rates were 94.5% (biopsies) and 97.3% (excisions). ER IHC concordance with central ESR1 was 96.8% (biopsies) and 97.6% (excisions). Biopsy and excisional medians were: Recurrence Score results 16 (each); ESR1 10.2 (each); PGR 7.7 and 7.6; ERBB2 9.4 and 9.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy submissions for 21-gene testing are common and consistently generate results that are very similar to the experience with excisions. The 21-gene test can be performed reliably on core biopsies.","Jakubowski, Debbie M; Bailey, Helen; Abran, John; Blacklock, Andrea; Ciau, Nancy; Mies, Carolyn; Tan, Vivian; Young, Rebekah; Lau, Anna; Baehner, Frederick L",J. surg. oncol,312,29

We hypothesized that an aging-associated increase in estrogens and decrease in androgens would correlate with an increase in adiposity. DESIGN: 10-year prospective, observational study STUDY SUBJECTS: 190, community-dwelling men in the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study MEASUREMENTS: At 0 and 10 years, CT scanning quantified intraabdominal fat (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) areas while plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem-mass spectrometry at each timepoint. Multivariate linear regression analyses assessed correlations between 10-year changes in hormone concentrations and IAF or SCF, adjusting for age and baseline fat depot area. RESULTS: Participants were middle-aged [median 54.8 years, interquartile range (IQR) 39.9-62.8] men and mostly overweight by Asian criterion (median BMI 24.9, IQR 23.3-27.1) and with few exceptions had normal sex steroid concentrations. Median estradiol and dihydrotestosterone did not change significantly between 0 and 10 years (p=0.084 and p=0.596 respectively) while median estrone increased (p<0.001) and testosterone decreased (p<0.001). Median IAF and SCF increased from 0 to 10 years (both p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, change in estrone positively correlated (p=0.019) while change in testosterone (p=0.003) and dihydrotestosterone (p=0.014) negatively correlated with change in IAF. Plasma estradiol and estrone positively correlated with change in SCF (p=0.041 and p=0.030, respectively) while testosterone (p=0.031) negatively correlated in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Among 190 community-dwelling, Japanese-American men, increases in IAF were associated with decreases in plasma androgens and increases in plasma estrone, but not estradiol, at 10 years. Further research is necessary to understand if changing hormone concentrations are causally related to changes in regional adiposity or if the reverse is true.","Dinh, Kathryn T; Amory, John K; Matsumoto, Alvin M; Marck, Brett T; Fujimoto, Wilfred Y; Leonetti, Donna L; Boyko, Edward J; Page, Stephanie T; Rubinow, Katya B",Clin. endocrinol,312,24

This family of viruses is known for its cardiotropism2. Arrhythmia is possible clinical manifestation in COVID-19 patients and several cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported, some as a cause of death3. Case report: We present a case of a 37-years old, previously healthy, female patient who was admitted to COVID-19 Intensive care unit (ICU) at University Hospital Centre Zagreb after out of hospital cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. She manifested episodes of chest pain and palpitations during two months prior to cardiac arrest. Initial laboratory findings showed elevated levels of high-sensitive troponin I and NT-proBNP, significant hypokalemia and normal values of C-reactive protein. Additional urgent work-up (pulmonary CT angiography and brain CT scan) showed no significant pathology and Sars-Cov-2 PCR RNA test came positive, without respiratory involvement. Due to ECG changes and ultrasound finding of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 25-30%) with anteroseptal and apical akinesia and inferior hypokinesia, urgent coronary angiography was performed, there were no signs of coronary artery disease, and the suspected diagnosis was Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Soon after admission heart failure therapy was introduced, and follow-up echocardiography showed improvement in LVEF (40-45%). Patient was given no specific antiviral treatment nor corticosteroid therapy. Additional work-up regarding serology for cardiotropic viruses came negative, and IgG antibodies for Covid-19 showed borderline result. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 18 days after initial event described recovered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 53%), with mild hypokinesia, oedema and mid-wall late gadolinium enhancement in apical 2/3 of anterior, anteroseptal and anterolateral wall, with pattern characteristic for myocarditis (Figure 1)4. At follow-up, one month after discharge, patient is completely recovered, without signs of heart failure or arrhythmias, with preserved LVEF and normal NTproNBP levels. Conclusion: This case once again highlights cardiac complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, without respiratory involvement. Also, it shows good prognosis without specific antiviral treatment, emphasizing importance of early introduction of heart failure therapy.

Modern RFB systems are based on highly corrosive and/or flammable electrolytes. Organic redox active species for RFBs are gaining commercial traction, but there is a trade-off in choosing aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes in terms of rate capabilities, energy density, safety and cost. While modification of organic redox molecules to mitigate these issues is prevalent in the literature, the search for novel electrolyte systems is scarce. Here we present microemulsion-based electrolytes as an alternative for the next generation of organic RFBs. Micro-emulsion electrolytes (MEs) offer the advantages of decoupled solubility and ionic conductivity, broad electrochemical windows, non-flammability, simple fabrication modes and low cost of constituent chemicals. The electrochemical properties of organic redox species in MEs have been investigated for RFB requirements and a proof-of-concept flow cell with a widely studied redox system and a commercial membrane is shown. The compositions of MEs can be tailored to the redox system, making them a platform of electrolytes for all organic redox systems under consideration and benefit.","Borah, Rohan; Hughson, Fraser R; Nann, Thomas",,312,24

We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7$\%$ to 21$\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of foods and nutrients as complementary approaches on the recovery from COVID-19 in 170 countries, especially considering the complexity of the disease and the current scarcity of active treatments. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using the Kaggle database, which links the consumption of various foods with recovery from COVID-19 in 170 countries, using multivariate analysis based on a generalized linear model. RESULTS: The results showed that certain foods had a positive effect on recovery from COVID-19: eggs, fish and seafood, fruits, meat, milk, starchy roots, stimulants, vegetable products, nuts, vegetable oil and vegetables. In general, consumption of higher levels of proteins and lipids had a positive effect on COVID-19 recovery, whereas high consumption of alcoholic beverages had a negative effect. In developed countries, where hunger had been eradicated, the effect of food on recovery from COVID-19 had a greater magnitude than in countries with a higher global hunger index (GHI), where there was almost no identifiable effect. CONCLUSION: Several foods had a positive effect on COVID-19 recovery in developed countries, especially food groups with a higher content of lipids, proteins, antioxidants and micronutrients (e.g., selenium and zinc). In countries with extreme poverty (high GHI), foods presented little effect on recovery from COVID-19.","Cobre, Alexandre F; Surek, Monica; Vilhena, Raquel O; Böger, Beatriz; Fachi, Mariana M; Momade, Danilo R; Tonin, Fernanda S; Sarti, Flavia M; Pontarolo, Roberto",Clin. nutr.

The epidemiological, symptomatic, laboratory, radiological and treatment records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of the 14 patients was 56.7 (SD 15.3) years, and 8 (57.1%) were older than 50 years. Eight (57.1%) were men, and 11 (78.6%) had one or more high risk factors. The most common chronic diseases among these patients were cardiovascular disease (7, 50.0%), hypertension (6, 42.9%), and chronic kidney disease (5, 35.7%). General symptoms included cough (12, 85.7%), fever (11, 78.6%), and dyspnea (10, 71.4%). The median duration from the onset of symptoms to death was 11 (IQR 6.5-19.5) days, and the median duration from admission to death was 4.5 (1.0-11.8) days.

Research continues to rapidly develop in order to fully comprehend the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study focuses on the rare ophthalmologic manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 disease process in both adults and children. There is evidence to suggest that viral transmission can occur via tears and conjunctival secretions, although it is not a predominant finding. This review considers all the published studies describing ocular findings and SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission through the eye. The review addresses the ongoing debate over the importance of ocular manifestations during this pandemic. The most updated safety guidelines, protocols, timelines of ocular manifestations during the disease course, and treatment recommendations are discussed. The majority of patients with COVID-19 with eye symptoms presented with them initially. It is possible that the virus becomes inoculated at the site of the eye and spreads via the nasolacrimal duct to the respiratory system. There are also some reports which show that ocular findings present later in the disease course, suggestive of a correlation between ocular manifestation and increased disease severity as the infection becomes systemic. We highlight the importance of recognizing conjunctivitis as an early finding of COVID-19, and that testing or appropriate follow-up could be beneficial in both the pediatric and adult populations.","Danthuluri, Veena; Grant, Maria B",Ophthalmol Ther,312,2

Many researchers are working continuously to find effective drug treatments for COVID-19;however, the optimal treatment approach remains unclear. In this article, current advances in pharmacological treatments for patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Data obtained from recent studies indicate a mortality benefit with the administration of dexamethasone or adjunctive tocilizumab and potential clinical benefits with remdesivir (with or without baricitinib). Several monoclonal antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been developed. The US Food and Drug Administration issued two emergency use authorizations: one for bamlanivimab/etesevimab and another for casirivimab/imdevimab for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, at high risk of progression to severe disease and/or hospitalization. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 indicates that antiviral treatments would be most beneficial in the early phase of the infection that is primarily driven by replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, whereas immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapies are likely to be more beneficial during the late phase of the infection, when the disease is driven by an exaggerated immune/inflammatory response to the virus that causes tissue damage.","Sun Bean, Kim Joon-Sup Yeom",Journal of the Korean Medical Association / Taehan Uisa Hyophoe Chi,312,24

When data contains private and sensitive information, the data owner often desires to publish a synthetic database instance that is similarly useful as the true data, while ensuring the privacy of individual data records. Existing differentially private data synthesis methods aim to generate useful data based on applications, but they fail in keeping one of the most fundamental data properties of the structured data -- the underlying correlations and dependencies among tuples and attributes (i.e., the structure of the data). This structure is often expressed as integrity and schema constraints, or with a probabilistic generative process. As a result, the synthesized data is not useful for any downstream tasks that require this structure to be preserved. This work presents Kamino, a data synthesis system to ensure differential privacy and to preserve the structure and correlations present in the original dataset. Kamino takes as input of a database instance, along with its schema (including integrity constraints), and produces a synthetic database instance with differential privacy and structure preservation guarantees. We empirically show that while preserving the structure of the data, Kamino achieves comparable and even better usefulness in applications of training classification models and answering marginal queries than the state-of-the-art methods of differentially private data synthesis.","Ge, Chang; Mohapatra, Shubhankar; He, Xi; Ilyas, Ihab F.",,312,20

In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic, there has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have examined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such incidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we collected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis ignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address correlation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation of the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson model. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly show the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020. However, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but shows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by individuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a global crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model that can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.","Karmakar, Sayar; Das, Sanchari",,312,16

This paper critically reviews Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the role of the federal government in this public health emergency, considering areas within its jurisdiction (international borders), areas where an increased federal role may be warranted (long-term care), as well as its technical role in terms of generating evidence and supporting public health surveillance, and its convening role to support collaboration across the country. This accounting of the first 12 months of the pandemic highlights opportunities for a strengthened federal role in the short term, and some important lessons to be applied in preparing for future pandemics.","Allin, Sara; Fitzpatrick, Tiffany; Marchildon, Gregory P; Quesnel-Vallée, Amélie",Health Econ Policy Law,312,24

METHODS: To simulate a human source, an aerosol generating system was made using a bacterial suspension in a nebulizer attached to an oxygen cylinder. A fan connected to the nebulizer created aerosols. Transmitted aerosols were detected using blood agar plates at 0.1524 and 1.8288 meters from source, simulating exposed person. The study was performed under controlled conditions at room temperature in a biohazard hood with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and UV light. RESULTS: When face shields were used alone, significant numbers of bacterial colonies grew on blood agar plates. When a mask used alone for both the subjects (source and exposed), the blood agar yielded minimal colony forming units at both distances. When face shields were used in combination with masks, no significant improvement was observed as compared to masks alone. DISCUSSION: Our results were similar to what have been observed in related studies.

Nous avons réalisé une étude pour évaluer les taux d’attaque, d’hospitalisation et de mortalité liés à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 dans une population de résidents de centres d’hébergement pour sans-abri et du personnel à leur contact. Matériels et méthodes Une étude sérologique rétrospective a été réalisée sur l’ensemble des résidents et des membres du personnel de trois centres d’hébergement pour sans-abri entre mars et mai 2020 : 2 centres de lits halte soins santé (LHSS) et un dortoir de femmes. Nous avons inclus tous les adultes présents dans les centres d’hébergement ou décédés d’une infection avérée par le SARS-CoV-2. Les IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 étaient détectés par le test ELISA « SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect (Abbott) ». Un cas confirmé de SARS-CoV-2 était défini comme tout participant présentant une PCR ou une sérologie positive. Des sérologies de contrôle ont été prélevées quatre mois après la première sérologie positive. Résultats Nous avons inclus 100 résidents et 83 membres du personnel. Le taux de SARS-CoV-2 confirmé par PCR ou sérologie était de 72/100 (72,0 %) pour les résidents et de 17/83 (20,5 %) pour le personnel. Le taux d’hospitalisation chez les résidents était de 17/72 (25 %) et le taux de décès de 4/72 (5,6 %). Toutes les hospitalisations sauf une et tous les décès sont survenus chez des résidents des LHSS. Trente-quatre sur 68 (50 %) des résidents des LHSS présentaient au moins deux facteurs de risque de forme grave d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2. Les femmes hébergées dans le dortoir étaient plus jeunes, présentaient moins de comorbidité, avaient le taux d’attaque le plus élevé (90,6 %) et une morbidité-mortalité quasi nulle. Cinquante-deux sur 80 (63,4 %) des personnes ayant une première sérologie positive ont eu une sérologie de contrôle à 4 mois de la première sérologie et 8 mois environ de leur infection.

This study has been conducted to understand whether there is a correlation between the number of infections and the different rural landscapes of the country. Italy's rural landscape can be classified in four types, according to the intensity of energy inputs used in the agricultural process, socioeconomic and environmental features. Type A includes areas of periurban agriculture surrounding the metropolitan cities, type B areas of intensive agriculture with high concentration of agroindustry, type C hilly areas with highly diversified agriculture and valuable landscape, and type D high hills and mountains with forests and protected areas. Areas A and B are located in the plains, covering 21% of the territory and accounting for 57% of the population. They produce most of the added value, consume high levels of energy and represent the main source of pollution. Areas C and D cover 79% of the territory and 43% of the population. We find that provinces with 10% more type C and D areas exhibit on average 10% fewer cases of contagion. The result is statistically significant, after controlling for demographic, economic and environmental characteristics of the provinces. The pollution produced in more energy-intensive landscape has triggered an intense debate of how to ensure the economic competitiveness of Italian agriculture, without compromising environmental integrity or public health. Our findings speak to this debate, by suggesting that planning for more rural territory with lower energy inputs may come with the added benefit of new development opportunities and decreasing the exposure of the population to covid-19. Cost benefit-analyses should take into account that policies aimed at revitalizing more rural areas may reduce the economic impact of covid-19 and of potential future pandemics.","Agnoletti, Mauro; Manganelli, Simone; Piras, Francesco",Landsc.

Semen was collected from 15 pangolins; two captive and 13 confiscated individuals at the mean weight of 9.36 ± 1.94 kg. The three semen collection methods employed were electroejaculation, rectal massage and a combination of both techniques. The semen characteristics (mean ± standard deviation) of the Malayan pangolin are volume (73.75 ± 144.57 µL), pH (7.63 ± 0.53), spermatozoa concentration (997.19 ± 728.98 × 106 /mL), total motility (59.60% ± 30.00%), progressive motility (48.95% ± 30.93%), mass motility (3.50 ± 1.50) and live spermatozoa (80.25% ± 13.45%). There was no significant difference in semen characteristics between the three collection methods. The percentages of live spermatozoa were significantly different, suggesting better samples from captive compared to confiscated animals. However, there was no significant difference in spermatozoa kinetics between the captive and confiscated samples, suggesting the potential of utilizing confiscated individuals for gamete recovery to conserve the genetic pool of pangolins. All three methods of semen collection were successfully performed in pangolins and should be considered; however, electroejaculation remains the most consistent method of obtaining semen from the species.","Tarmizi, Reza; Keng Chee, Yap; Sipangkui, Symphorosa; Zainuddin, Zainal Zahari; Fitri, Wan-Nor",,312,1

With the resolution revolution of single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), rapid progress has been made for structural elucidation of isolated MPs. The next challenge is to preserve the electrochemical gradients and membrane curvature for a comprehensive structural elucidation of MPs that rely on these chemical and physical properties for their biological functions. Toward this goal, here we present a convenient workflow for cryo-EM structural analysis of MPs embedded in liposomes, using the well-characterized AcrB as a prototype. Combining optimized proteoliposome isolation, cryo-sample preparation on graphene grids, and an efficient particle selection strategy, the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of AcrB embedded in liposomes was obtained at 3.9 Å resolution. The conformation of the homotrimeric AcrB remains the same when the surrounding membranes display different curvatures. Our approach, which can be widely applied to cryo-EM analysis of MPs with distinctive soluble domains, lays out the foundation for cryo-EM analysis of integral or peripheral MPs whose functions are affected by transmembrane electrochemical gradients or/and membrane curvatures.","Yao, Xia; Fan, Xiao; Yan, Nieng",Proc.

Cellular senescence contributes to inflammation, multiple chronic diseases, and age-related dysfunction, but effects on responses to viral infection are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells (SnC) become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-1, increasing expression of viral entry proteins and reducing anti-viral gene expression in non-SnCs through a paracrine mechanism. Old mice acutely infected with pathogens that included a SARS-CoV-2-related mouse ß-coronavirus experienced increased senescence and inflammation with nearly 100% mortality. Targeting SnCs using senolytic drugs before or after pathogen exposure significantly reduced mortality, cellular senescence, and inflammatory markers and increased anti-viral antibodies. Thus, reducing the SnC burden in diseased or aged individuals should enhance resilience and reduce mortality following viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.","Camell, Christina D; Yousefzadeh, Matthew J; Zhu, Yi; Langhi Prata, Larissa G P; Huggins, Matthew A; Pierson, Mark; Zhang, Lei; O039,; Kelly, Ryan D; Pirtskhalava, Tamar; Xun, Pengcheng; Ejima, Keisuke; Xue, Ailing; Tripathi, Utkarsh; Machado Espindola-Netto, Jair; Giorgadze, Nino; Atkinson, Elizabeth J; Inman, Christina L; Johnson, Kurt O; Cholensky, Stephanie H; Carlson, Timothy W; LeBrasseur, Nathan K; Khosla, Sundeep; Sullivan, M Gerard; Allison, David B; Jameson, Stephen C; Meves, Alexander; Li, Ming; Prakash, Y S; Chiarella, Sergio E; Hamilton, Sara E; Tchkonia, Tamara; Niedernhofer, Laura J; Kirkland, James L; Robbins, Paul D","Sci.

Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The repeatability and within-laboratory precision were obviously good in validations, following to the CLSI document EP15-A3. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this new automated method for detecting antibody against both N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","Yokoyama, Rin; Kurano, Makoto; Morita, Yoshifumi; Shimura, Takuya; Nakano, Yuki; Qian, Chungen; Xia, Fuzhen; He, Fan; Kishi, Yoshiro; Okada, Jun; Yoshikawa, Naoyuki; Nagura, Yutaka; Okazaki, Hitoshi; Moriya, Kyoji; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Yatomi, Yutaka",PLoS One,312,11

METHODS: A literature research was conducted on respiratory viruses and nasal congestion, following a recently published review on how temperature sensitivity is important for the success of common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: The literature reported that common respiratory viruses are temperature sensitive and replicate well at the cooler temperatures of the upper airways (32°C), but replication is restricted at body temperature (37°C). The amplitude of the phases of congestion and decongestion associated with the nasal cycle was increased on infection with respiratory viruses and this caused unilateral nasal congestion and obstruction. Nasal congestion and obstruction increase nasal mucosal temperature towards 37°C and therefore restricted the replication of respiratory viruses.

Infection by COVID-19 is especially detrimental to patients on hemodialysis. In this study, we evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and prognoses of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 16 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were recruited from Wuhan Fourth Hospital from 5 February to 20 March 2020 for a retrospective, single-center study. A total of 62 non-dialysis patients with COVID-19 were the control group. We collected data on the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments, and clinical outcomes of patients affected by the virus. Results: Hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had a lower incidence of fever (P = 0.001) and relatively higher incidence of pre-admission comorbidities and shortness of breath than non-dialysis patients with COVID-19 (75% vs. 61%, P = 0.467 50% vs. 33.87%, P = 0.248 ). Hemodialysis patients had lower levels of hemoglobin (P < 0.001), white blood cell counts (P = 0.015), neutrophils (P = 0.016), AST (P = 0.037), ALT (P < 0.001) and procalcitonin (P < 0.001), and higher levels of D-dimer (P < 0.001) and thrombin time (P < 0.001). Hemodialysis patients had a higher incidence of pulmonary effusion, cord-like high-density shadows, pleural thickening, and atelectasis (P < 0.05). Hemodialysis patients also had relatively higher rates of mortality and prolonged hospital stays compared with the control group.

However, little empirical research has been published on resilience factors in these individuals. The present study aims to examine authenticity as a resilience factor among those with chronic pain and/or PTSD. Methods: Prior to the national response to the pandemic (January 10-24, 2020), participants were screened for pain-related disability (Oswestry Disability Index;ODI) and PTSD symptoms (Posttraumatic Checklist for DSM-5;PCL-5), and on the basis of those responses were categorized into one of four groups: healthy, chronic pain only, PTSD only, or comorbid chronic pain and PTSD. During the CV-19 pandemic (May 5-May 13, 2020), participants responded again to the ODI and PCL-5, in addition to the Wood Authenticity Scale, Brief Pain Inventory, and items related to the CV-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 110 participants (54.55% women), aged 42.19 (SD = 13.16), completed the survey during the pandemic. The comorbid group endorsed higher levels of CV-19 Threat and Impact compared to all other groups. Authenticity moderated this relationship relevant to CV-19 Threat among those in the chronic pain only group, and not in any other group. Conclusion: The comorbid group endorsed higher levels of CV-19 Threat and Impact compared to all other groups. Importantly, greater authenticity was associated with less CV-19 Threat in the chronic pain only group, and not in any other group. The present study also highlights the importance of engaging authentically for those with chronic pain during the pandemic.","Reed, D. E.; 2nd, Lehinger E.; Cobos, B.; Vail, K. E.; 3rd, Nabity P.

We aim to identify the spectrum of medical causes of mortality in our ED, the demographic pattern and duration of stay before death. Method: This is a retrospective study that looked at medical mortality in the ED from January 2004 to December 2009. We obtained data on the demographics and causes of death from the medical records and case notes of the deceased. Results: A total of 16587 patients were admitted during the period under review, of these 1262 (7.61%) died in the ED. The male to female ratio was 1.58:1.0 [772 males (61.2%), and 489 females (38.8%)]. Mortality was highest among the 20-45 years age range, followed by 46-65 years, >65 years and < 20 years in decreasing frequency [589(46.7%), 421(33.4%), 186 (14.8%) and 66(5.2%) respectively]. The three most common causes of death were stroke 315(25%), HIV related illnesses 126(10.0%), and heart failure 123(9.7%). Most deaths occurred less than 24hours of admission, 550(43.6%), followed by one day (36.0%) and two days (10.8%) post admissions respectively. Conclusion: The commonest cause of death in the ED was stroke. The burden of death was highest in the younger age group, with most occurring less than 24 hours of admission.","Olusegun-Joseph, A D; Akande, O; Otrofanowei, E; Nwoye, E O; Olopade, O B; Ajuluchukwu, J N",Afr Health Sci,312,15

Associated causes have been due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohystiocytosis (HLH) syndrome, medication-induced, or acute liver failure. Statins, omega-3 polyunsaturated acids, niacin, and fibrates are common oral lipid lowering therapy options in patients at risk for hypertriglyceridemia. The severity of hypertriglyceridemia in COVID-19 patients with triglyceride values reaching greater than 1,000 mg/dL put them at a heightened risk of pancreatitis and therefore an essential need to acutely lower their levels. We present a case series of 5 patients who achieved rapid triglyceride lowering through continuous insulin infusion therapy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 48 critical COVID-19 patients who were admitted from March 22 to April 15, 2020 was conducted. Inclusion criteria consisted of mechanical ventilation and continuous insulin infusion to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting with 5 eligible patients in this case report. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In addition to standard oral lipid lowering therapies, continuous insulin infusion successfully treated severe hypertriglyceridemia in critically ill COVID-19 patients. None of the patients experienced pancreatitis or hypoglycemia necessitating cessation of insulin. Further studies are needed to show the optimum dose and duration of insulin infusion as monotherapy and in combination with oral therapies.","Thomas, Caitlin M; Vicent, Martie; Moore, Shawn; Ali, Fahd; Wooten, Leslie; Louzon, Patricia R",J Pharm Pract,312,26

Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma. There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience. Case report: A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation. Conclusions: We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient. The evolution was favorable with timely support management and antibiotic therapy in a third-level hospital.","Páez-Velásquez, Jackelyn S; Romero-Uribe, Ilse E; Castilla-Peón, María F; Lezana-Fernández, José L; Chávez-López, Adrián",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,312,16

A meta-analysis in China found that the proportions of people with COVID-19 and diabetes was 9.7% and that having diabetes resulted in a two-fold increased risk of having a severe case. Global guidance on confinement measures for the prevention of COVID-19 have a particular emphasis on vulnerable populations which include people with diabetes. These recommendations are coherent to avoid the spread of SARSCoV-2 infection, but are in contradiction with comprehensive diabetes care, which requires regular patient-provider interactions for patient education, prescriptions and possible management of complications or mental health. Moreover, confinement drives risk for unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, mental health related concerns, in parallel to delayed care-seeking due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Another weakness in the current COVID-19 response is the focus on hospital care which overlooks the importance of Primary Care in guaranteeing continuity of care. Ensuring the availability of insulin, other medicines, self-monitoring and diagnostic tools is another challenge. These are all global concerns for the diabetes community, as well as for those suffering from other chronic conditions. Undoubtedly, the global priority is to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19. However, health systems still need to meet the needs of the entire population, including individuals with diabetes. Clear guidance for preparedness, crisis and post-crisis management of diabetes and chronic diseases during mass disruptions to health systems are lacking. Therefore, in parallel to the epidemic response efforts to ensure existing healthcare services keep running should be supported to avoid health consequences that might be worse than the epidemic itself. This includes targeted messaging for people with diabetes and vulnerable populations with regards to possible risk of infection as well as their disease-related management; continued support via telephone, video conferencing or even home visits; ensuring access to insulin and other medicines and supplies both nationally and individually; and most importantly, preparing for the future.","Beran, David; Aebischer Perone, Sigiriya; Castellsague Perolini, Montserrat; Chappuis, François; Chopard, Pierre; Haller, Dagmar M; Jacquerioz Bausch, Frédérique; Maisonneuve, Hubert; Perone, Nicolas; Gastaldi, Giacomo",,312,16

Based on two alternative approaches (that is, the beta diversity partitioning proposed by Baselga and the Local Contributions to Beta Diversity (LCBD) partitioning proposed by Legendre), we examined the patterns of beta diversity components of lacustrine benthos, from bacteria to diatoms and chironomids, in the surface sediments along a 100-m water-depth gradient in Lugu Lake. We further quantified the relative importance of spatial, environmental and biotic variables in explaining water-depth patterns in beta diversity. Based on the Baselga's framework, there was a taxonomic dependency for the patterns of beta diversity components with water-depth, showing a significant species turnover pattern for bacteria, while diatoms and chironomids showed significant nestedness. This dependency was also evident in the patterns of community uniqueness with water-depth because based on Legendre's framework, the LCBD decreased with water depth for bacteria whereas increased with depth for diatoms. The total beta diversity and species turnover of bacteria could be explained by the pure effects of spatial, environmental and biotic variables. A total of 26.8% and 23.6% of the nestedness component of diatoms and chironomids was explained by environmental variables, respectively, while species turnover was mostly related to spatial variables. Bacteria total LCBD and species replacement were driven only by environmental variables. For diatoms and chironomids, however, most of the total LCBD and its two components were explained by spatial variables, and biotic variables were most important for the diatom replacement component. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for community organizations along water-depth gradients from the perspective of beta diversity components.","Wu, Kaiyuan; Zhao, Wenqian; Li, Mingjia; Picazo, Félix; Soininen, Janne; Shen, Ji; Zhu, Lifeng; Cheng, Xiaoying; Wang, Jianjun",Sci Total Environ,312,1

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation.

Effective government communication of COVID-19 information with the public is of crucial importance. OBJECTIVE: We investigate how the most-read state-owned newspaper in China, People's Daily, used an online social networking site, Sina Weibo, to communicate about COVID-19 and whether this could engage the public. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework to examine the content, message style, and interactive features of COVID-19-related posts and determine their effects on public engagement in the largest social media network in China. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to scrutinize 608 COVID-19 posts, and coding was performed on three main dimensions: content, message style, and interactive features. The content dimension was coded into six subdimensions: action, new evidence, reassurance, disease prevention, health care services, and uncertainty, and the style dimension was coded into the subdimensions of narrative and nonnarrative. As for interactive features, they were coded into links to external sources, use of hashtags, use of questions to solicit feedback, and use of multimedia. Public engagement was measured in the form of the number of shares, comments, and likes on the People's Daily's Sina Weibo account from January 20, 2020, to March 11, 2020, to reveal the association between different levels of public engagement and communication strategies. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey test and negative binomial regression analysis were employed to generate the results. RESULTS: We found that although the content frames of action, new evidence, and reassurance delivered in a nonnarrative style were predominant in COVID-19 communication by the government, posts related to new evidence and a nonnarrative style were strong negative predictors of the number of shares. In terms of generating a high number of shares, it was found that disease prevention posts delivered in a narrative style were able to achieve this purpose. Additionally, an interaction effect was found between content and style. The use of a narrative style in disease prevention posts had a significant positive effect on generating comments and likes by the Chinese public, while links to external sources fostered sharing. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for governments, health organizations, medical professionals, the media, and researchers on their epidemic communication to engage the public. Selecting suitable communication strategies may foster active liking and sharing of posts on social media, which in turn, might raise the public's awareness of COVID-19 and motivate them to take preventive measures. The sharing of COVID-19 posts is particularly important because this action can reach out to a large audience, potentially helping to contain the spread of the virus.","Ngai, Cindy Sing Bik; Singh, Rita Gill; Lu, Wenze; Koon, Alex Chun",J Med Internet Res,312,20

We investigated a stochastic epidemic model with the metapopulation approach in which patches represent municipalities. Contagion follows a stochastic compartmental model for municipalities; the latter, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent mobility. As a case of study, we consider the epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil performing data-driven simulations. Properties of the simulated epidemic curves have very broad distributions across different geographical locations and scales, from states, passing through intermediate and immediate regions down to municipality levels. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and distance from the respective capital cities were predicted to be strong in several states and weak in others, signaling influences of multiple epidemic foci propagating towards the inland cities. Responses of different regions to a same mitigation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region' specificity but integrated with the overall situation. Real series of reported cases confirm the qualitative scenarios predicted in simulations. Even though we restricted our study to Brazil, the prospects and model can be extended to other geographical organizations with heterogeneous demographic distributions.","Costa, Guilherme S.; Cota, Wesley; Ferreira, Silvio C.",,312,7

In 2020, a novel coronavirus caused a global pandemic with a clinical picture termed COVID-19, accounting for numerous cases of ARDS. However, there are still other infectious causes of ARDS that should be considered, especially as the majority of these pathogens are specifically treatable. Case Presentation. We present the case of a 36-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the hospital with flu-like symptoms, after completing a half-marathon one week before admission. As infection with SARS-CoV-2 was suspected based on radiologic imaging, the hypoxemic patient was immediately transferred to the ICU, where he developed ARDS. Empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy was initiated, the patient deteriorated further, therapy was changed, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary care ARDS center. As cold agglutinins were present, the hypothesis of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 was then questioned. Bronchoscopic sampling revealed Mycoplasma (M.) pneumoniae. When antimicrobial chemotherapy was adjusted, the patient recovered quickly. Conclusion. Usually, M. pneumoniae causes mild disease. When antimicrobial chemotherapy was adjusted, the patient recovered quickly. The case underlines the importance to adhere to established treatment guidelines, scrutinize treatment modalities, and not to forget other potential causes of severe pneumonia or ARDS.

Enjoyable home-based exercise programs are greatly needed. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to examine the feasibility of a virtual reality (VR) active video gaming system (ie, bundle of consumer-available equipment) to meet US physical activity guidelines in two youth with SB. METHODS: Two youth with SB-a 12-year-old female and a 13-year-old male; both full-time wheelchair users-participated in a brief, 4-week exercise program using a popular VR head-mounted display: Oculus Quest (Facebook Technologies). The system included a Polar H10 (Polar Canada) Bluetooth heart rate monitor, a no-cost mobile phone app (VR Health Exercise Tracker [Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise]), and 13 games. The intervention protocol was conducted entirely in the homes of the participants due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The VR system was shipped to participants and they were instructed to do their best to complete 60 minutes of moderate-intensity VR exercise per day. Exercise duration, intensity, and calories expended were objectively monitored and recorded during exercise using the heart rate monitor and a mobile app. Fatigue and depression were measured via self-report questionnaires at pre- and postintervention. Participants underwent a semistructured interview with research staff at postintervention. RESULTS: Across the intervention period, the total average minutes of all exercise performed each week for participants 1 and 2 were 281 (SD 93) and 262 (SD 55) minutes, respectively. The total average minutes of moderate-intensity exercise performed per week for participants 1 and 2 were 184 (SD 103) (184/281, 65.4%) and 215 (SD 90) (215/262, 82.1%) minutes, respectively. One participant had a reduction in their depression score, using the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) test, from baseline to postintervention, but no other changes were observed for fatigue and depression scores. Participants reported that the amount of exercise they completed was far higher than what was objectively recorded, due to usability issues with the chest-worn heart rate monitor. Participants noted that they were motivated to exercise due to the enjoyment of the games and VR headset as well as support from a caregiver. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that two youth with SB who used wheelchairs could use a VR system to independently and safely achieve exercise guidelines at home. Study findings identified a promising protocol for promoting exercise in this population and this warrants further examination in future studies with larger samples.","Lai, Byron; Davis, Drew; Narasaki-Jara, Mai; Hopson, Betsy; Powell, Danielle; Gowey, Marissa; Rocque, Brandon G; Rimmer, James H",JMIR Serious Games,312,15

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five publicly available databases comprising normal CXR, confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases, and other pneumonias were used. After the harmonization of the data, the training set included 7966 normal cases, 5451 with other pneumonia, and 258 CXRs with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas in the testing data set, each category was represented by 100 cases. Eleven blinded radiologists with various levels of expertise independently read the testing data set. The data were analyzed separately with the newly proposed artificial intelligence-based system and by consultant radiologists and residents, with respect to positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and F-score (harmonic mean for PPV and sensitivity). The &#967; test was used to compare the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and F-scores of the readers and the system. RESULTS: The proposed system achieved higher overall diagnostic accuracy (94.3%) than the radiologists (61.4% ± 5.3%). The radiologists reached average sensitivities for normal CXR, other type of pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia of 85.0% ± 12.8%, 60.1% ± 12.2%, and 53.2% ± 11.2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than the results achieved by the algorithm (98.0%, 88.0%, and 97.0%; P < 0.00032). The mean PPVs for all 11 radiologists for the 3 categories were 82.4%, 59.0%, and 59.0% for the healthy, other pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively, resulting in an F-score of 65.5% ± 12.4%, which was significantly lower than the F-score of the algorithm (94.3% ± 2.0%, P < 0.00001). When other pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia cases were pooled, the proposed system reached an accuracy of 95.7% for any pathology and the radiologists, 88.8%. The overall accuracy of consultants did not vary significantly compared with residents (65.0% ± 5.8% vs 67.4% ± 4.2%); however, consultants detected significantly more COVID-19 pneumonia cases (P = 0.008) and less healthy cases (P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: The system showed robust accuracy for COVID-19 pneumonia detection on CXR and surpassed radiologists at various training levels.","Fontanellaz, Matthias; Ebner, Lukas; Huber, Adrian; Peters, Alan; Löbelenz, Laura; Hourscht, Cynthia; Klaus, Jeremias; Munz, Jaro; Ruder, Thomas; Drakopoulos, Dionysios; Sieron, Dominik; Primetis, Elias; Heverhagen, Johannes T; Mougiakakou, Stavroula; Christe, Andreas",Invest. radiol,312,16

Many drugs have shown promise for treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, up to date, no drugs have been confirmed as a definitive treatment for COVID-19. Trials such as the SOLIDARITY and RECOVERY are ongoing, and first results were announced in favour of therapy with dexamethasone with a significant trend showing greatest benefit among those patients requiring ventilation. The drawbacks of these trials include exposing the patients to drugs with well-documented systemic adverse effects or unknown complications of novel therapies without proof of clinical benefit. We present here the hypothesis that bronchial artery infusion could be an alternative for systemic drug infusion in COVID-19 trials with superadded benefits of high drug concentration and low systemic adverse effects. The concept of this idea has many uncertainties and no current clinical data to support. Perhaps, the technique should be first applied in animal models to determine its safety and calculate the effective dose of the drugs.

Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may provide a higher filtration crisis alternative, but it is unknown if effective sterilization can be achieved for a virus without impairing respirator function. We evaluated the viricidal efficacy of Bioquell vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) on contaminated N95 respirators and tested the particulate particle penetration and inhalation/exhalation resistance of respirators after multiple cycles of VHP. METHODS: 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) were contaminated with 3 aerosolized bacteriophages: T1, T7, and Pseudomonas phage phi-6 followed by one cycle of VHP decontamination using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA). Additionally, new and unused respirators were sent to an independent laboratory, Nelson Labs (Salt Lake City, UT), for particulate filter penetration testing and inhalation/exhalation resistance after 3 and 5 cycles of VHP. RESULTS: A single VHP cycle resulted in complete eradication of bacteriophage from respirators (limit of detection 10 PFU). Respirators showed acceptable limits for inhalation/exhalation resistance after 3 and 5 cycles of VHP. Respirators demonstrated a filtration efficiency >99 % after 3 cycles, but fell below 95% after 5 cycles of HPV. CONCLUSION: Bioquell VHP demonstrated high viricidal activity for N95 respirators inoculated with aerosolized bacteriophages. Bioquell technology can be scaled for simultaneous decontamination of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. Reprocessing should be limited to 3 cycles due to concerns both about impact of clinical wear and tear on fit, and to decrement in filtration after 3 cycles.","Kenney, Patrick A; Chan, Benjamin K; Kortright, Kaitlyn E; Cintron, Margaret; Russi, Mark; Epright, Jacqueline; Lee, Lorraine; Balcezak, Thomas J; Havill, Nancy L; Martinello, Richard A",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,312,24

Little data exists on COVID-19 incidences and risk mitigation strategies in youth club sports. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reported incidence of COVID-19 cases among youth club sport athletes and the information sources used to develop COVID-19 risk mitigation procedures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online surveys. PATIENTS: Soccer and volleyball youth club directors. INTERVENTION: A survey was completed by directors of youth volleyball and soccer clubs across the country in October 2020. Surveys included self-reported date of re-initiation, number of players, player COVID-19 cases, sources of infection, COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and information sources for the development of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of cases reported, number of players, and days since club re-initiation were used to calculate an incidence rate of cases per 100,000 player-days. To compare reported incidence rates between soccer and volleyball, a negative binomial model was developed to predict player cases with sport and state incidence as covariates and log(player-days) as an offset. Estimates were exponentiated to yield a reported incidence rate ratio (IRR) with Wald confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 205,136 athletes (soccer=165,580; volleyball=39,556) were represented by 437 clubs (soccer=159; volleyball=278). Club organizers reported 673 COVID-19 cases (soccer=322; volleyball=351), for a reported incidence rate of 2.8 cases per 100,000 player-days (soccer=1.7, volleyball=7.9). Volleyball had a significantly higher reported COVID-19 incidence rate compared to soccer (reported IRR = 3.06 [2.0-4.6], p<0.001). Out of 11 possible mitigation strategies, the median number of strategies used by all clubs was 7 with an interquartile range of 2. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of self-reported cases of COVID-19 was lower in soccer clubs than volleyball clubs. Most clubs report using many COVID-19 mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19.","Biese, Kevin M; McGuine, Timothy A; Haraldsdottir, Kristin; Goodavish, Leslie; Watson, Andrew M",J. athl. train,312,24

A substantial proportion of lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues. Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will be stratified by smoking rate (<16 vs &#8805;16 cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment, enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights on user views of the app through qualitative interviews.

Comprehensive analysis of this unprecedented outbreak may help to fight against the disease and may play a pivotal role in decreasing the mortality rate linked with it. Papain like protease (PLpro), a multifunctional polyprotein facilitates the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and evades it from the host immunological response by antagonizing cytokines, interferons and may be considered as potential drug target to combat the current pandemic. METHODS: Natural moieties obtained from medicinal plants were analysed for their potency to target PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking study and were compared with synthetic analogs named as remdesivir, chloroquine and favipiravir. The stability of complexes of top hits was analysed by MD Simulation and interaction energy was calculated. Furthermore, average RMSD values were computed and deepsite ligand binding pockets were predicted using Play Molecule. Drug like abilities of these moieties were determined using ADMET and bond distance between the ligand and active site was assessed to predict the strength of interaction. RESULTS: Nimbocinol (-7.6 Kcal/mol) and sage (-7.3 Kcal/mol) exhibited maximum BA against PLpro SARS-CoV-2 as evident from molecular docking study which was found to be even better than remdesivir (-6.1 Kcal/mol), chloroquine (-5.3 Kcal/mol) and favipiravir (-5.7 Kcal/mol). Both nimbocinol-PLpro and sage-PLpro SARS-CoV-2 complex exhibited stable conformation during MD Simulation of 101ns at 310 K and potential, kinetic and electrostatic interaction energies were computed which was observed to be concordant with results of molecular docking study. RMSD average values were found to be 0.496 ± 0.015 Å and 0.598 ± 0.023 Å for nimbocinol and sage respectively thus revealing that both the deviation and fluctuations during MD Simulation were observed to be least. Deepsite prediction disclosed that both compounds occupied cryptic pockets in receptor and non-bond distance analysis revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds during ligand-receptor interaction. ADMET exploration further validated the drug like properties of these compounds. CONCLUSION: Present study revealed that active constituents of Azadirachta indica and Salvia officinalis can be potentially used to target SARS-CoV-2 by hindering its replication process.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Mittal, Rashmi; Arya, Vedpriya",Curr pharm. biotechnol,312,25

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospective registry for demographics, hospital course, and discharge dispositions of rehab-eligible acute stroke survivors admitted 6 months prior to (10/2019-03/2020) and during (04/2020-09/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) as opposed to other facilities using descriptive statistics, and IRF versus home using unadjusted and adjusted backward stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 507 rehab-eligible stroke survivors, there was no difference in age, premorbid disability, or stroke severity between study periods (p>0.05). There was a 9% absolute decrease in discharges to an IRF during the pandemic (32.1% vs. 41.1%, p=0.04), which translated to 38% lower odds of being discharged to IRF versus home in unadjusted regression (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.42-0.92, p=0.016). The lower odds of discharge to IRF persisted in the multivariable model (aOR 0.16, 95%CI 0.09-0.31, p<0.001) despite a significant increase in discharge disability (median discharge mRS 4 [IQR 2-4] vs. 2 [IQR 1-3], p<0.001) during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Admission for stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significantly lower probability of being discharged to an IRF. This effect persisted despite adjustment for predictors of IRF disposition, including functional disability at discharge. Potential reasons for this disparity are explored.","Thau, Lauren; Siegal, Taylor; Heslin, Mark E; Rana, Ameena; Yu, Siyuan; Kamen, Scott; Chen, Austin; Vigilante, Nicholas; Gallagher, Sheri; Wegner, Kevin; Thon, Jesse M; Then, Ryna; Patel, Pratit; Yeager, Terri; Jovin, Tudor G; Kumar, Rohini J; Owens, David E; Siegler, James E",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,312,1

This type of screening is non-contact, does not require specialist medical expertise or laboratory facilities and can be deployed on inexpensive consumer hardware. We use datasets that contain recordings of coughing, sneezing, speech and other noises, but do not contain COVID-19 labels, to pre-train three deep neural networks: a CNN, an LSTM and a Resnet50. These pre-trained networks are subsequently either fine-tuned using smaller datasets of coughing with COVID-19 labels in the process of transfer learning, or are used as bottleneck feature extractors. Results show that a Resnet50 classifier trained by this transfer learning process delivers optimal or near-optimal performance across all datasets achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC) of 0.98, 0.94 and 0.92 respectively for all three sound classes (coughs, breaths and speech). This indicates that coughs carry the strongest COVID-19 signature, followed by breath and speech. Our results also show that applying transfer learning and extracting bottleneck features using the larger datasets without COVID-19 labels led not only to improve performance, but also to minimise the standard deviation of the classifier AUCs among the outer folds of the leave-$p$-out cross-validation, indicating better generalisation. We conclude that deep transfer learning and bottleneck feature extraction can improve COVID-19 cough, breath and speech audio classification, yielding automatic classifiers with higher accuracy.","Pahar, Madhurananda; Klopper, Marisa; Warren, Robin; Niesler, Thomas",,312,1

This hyperinflammatory response predisposes patients to thromboembolic disease, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In burn injuries, damaged tissues induce a local and systemic inflammatory response through pathways associated to COVID-19. As such, a COVID-19 positive patient sustaining burn injuries may have an amplified response to the burn insult due to their baseline hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states. Burn patients may have compromised physiological reserve to withstand the insult of surgical intervention before reaching clinical instability.

An important factor in its under-recognition is the variability in chest radiograph interpretation for ARDS. We sought to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect ARDS findings on chest radiographs. METHODS: CNNs were pretrained on 595 506 radiographs from two centres to identify common chest findings (eg, opacity and effusion), and then trained on 8072 radiographs annotated for ARDS by multiple physicians using various transfer learning approaches. The best performing CNN was tested on chest radiographs in an internal and external cohort, including a subset reviewed by six physicians, including a chest radiologist and physicians trained in intensive care medicine. Chest radiograph data were acquired from four US hospitals. FINDINGS: In an internal test set of 1560 chest radiographs from 455 patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, a CNN could detect ARDS with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0·92 (95% CI 0·89-0·94). In the subgroup of 413 images reviewed by at least six physicians, its AUROC was 0·93 (95% CI 0·88-0·96), sensitivity 83·0% (95% CI 74·0-91·1), and specificity 88·3% (95% CI 83·1-92·8). Among images with zero of six ARDS annotations (n=155), the median CNN probability was 11%, with six (4%) assigned a probability above 50%. Among images with six of six ARDS annotations (n=27), the median CNN probability was 91%, with two (7%) assigned a probability below 50%. In an external cohort of 958 chest radiographs from 431 patients with sepsis, the AUROC was 0·88 (95% CI 0·85-0·91). When radiographs annotated as equivocal were excluded, the AUROC was 0·93 (0·92-0·95). INTERPRETATION: A CNN can be trained to achieve expert physician-level performance in ARDS detection on chest radiographs. Further research is needed to evaluate the use of these algorithms to support real-time identification of ARDS patients to ensure fidelity with evidence-based care or to support ongoing ARDS research.

METHODS: CNNs were pretrained on 595 506 radiographs from two centres to identify common chest findings (eg, opacity and effusion), and then trained on 8072 radiographs annotated for ARDS by multiple physicians using various transfer learning approaches. The best performing CNN was tested on chest radiographs in an internal and external cohort, including a subset reviewed by six physicians, including a chest radiologist and physicians trained in intensive care medicine.

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.","Letko, Michael; Marzi, Andrea; Munster, Vincent",Nat Microbiol,312,26

It is necessary to analyze and predict its epidemic situation to help formulate effective public health policies. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. R 3.6.2 software was used to fit the data from January 31 to May 20, 2020, and predict the data for the next 30 days. The COVID-19 epidemic in Russia was divided into two stages and reached its peak in May. The epidemic began to stabilize on May 19. The case fatality rate has been at an extremely low level. ARIMA (2,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) were the models of cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. After testing, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of three models were 0.6, 3.9, and 2.4, respectively. This paper indicates that Russia's health system capacity can effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three ARIMA models have a good fitting effect and can be used for short-term prediction of the COVID-19 trend, providing a theoretical basis for Russia to formulate new intervention policies.","Fang, Lanlan; Wang, Dingjian; Pan, Guixia",SN Compr Clin Med,312,20

Among those with evidence of past or current infection, 40.0% (26/65) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. Here we report a relatively low seroprevalence of antibodies among HCW at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain. A large proportion of HCW with past or present infection had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19, which calls for active periodic rRT-PCR testing in hospital settings.","Garcia-Basteiro, Alberto L; Moncunill, Gemma; Tortajada, Marta; Vidal, Marta; Guinovart, Caterina; Jiménez, Alfons; Santano, Rebeca; Sanz, Sergi; Méndez, Susana; Llupià, Anna; Aguilar, Ruth; Alonso, Selena; Barrios, Diana; Carolis, Carlo; Cisteró, Pau; Chóliz, Eugenia; Cruz, Angeline; Fochs, Silvia; Jairoce, Chenjerai; Hecht, Jochen; Lamoglia, Montserrat; Martínez, Mikel J; Mitchell, Robert A; Ortega, Natalia; Pey, Nuria; Puyol, Laura; Ribes, Marta; Rosell, Neus; Sotomayor, Patricia; Torres, Sara; Williams, Sarah; Barroso, Sonia; Vilella, Anna; Muñoz, José; Trilla, Antoni; Varela, Pilar; Mayor, Alfredo; Dobaño, Carlota",Nat Commun,312,23

SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes seasonal outbreaks with a case fatality rate of ~37â%. Here we show that there exists a theoretical possibility of future recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA. Through computational analyses, we have identified homologous genomic regions within the ORF1ab and S genes that could facilitate recombination, and have analysed co-expression patterns of the cellular receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, ACE2 and DPP4, respectively, to identify human anatomical sites that could facilitate co-infection. Furthermore, we have investigated the likely susceptibility of various animal species to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing known virus spike protein-receptor interacting residues. In conclusion, we suggest that a recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RNA is possible and urge public health laboratories in high-risk areas to develop diagnostic capability for the detection of recombined coronaviruses in patient samples.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Doxey, Andrew C; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M; Mansfield, Michael J; Subudhi, Sonu; Hirota, Jeremy A; Miller, Matthew S; McArthur, Andrew G; Mubareka, Samira; Mossman, Karen",J. gen. virol,312,14

The catenin beta interacting protein 1 (CTNNBIP1) is an inhibitor of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, whose role in osteogenesis remains elusive. This study aimed to reveal the effects of miR-486-3p/CTNNBIP1 in osteogenesis. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from healthy individuals and osteoporosis patients and mice with sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgeries were collected. Levels of CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p were assessed. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interactions between CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p mimics/inhibitor or CTNNBIP1 overexpression lentiviruses were transfected to human BMSCs (hBMSCs) and an osteogenic assay was performed. Alizarin red S (ARS) and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) intensity and expression of osteogenic genes Runx2, Alp, Cola1 and Bglap were measured. Key proteins in the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway including active ß-catenin, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1 were assessed. RESULTS: CTNNBIP1 was upregulated while miR-486-3p was downregulated in osteoporosis patients and OVX mice. CTNNBIP1 was confirmed as a target of miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p overexpression promoted, while miR-486-3p knockdown suppressed, osteogenic differentiation and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Rescue experiments confirmed the negative effects of CTNNBIP1 overexpression on osteoblastic differentiation and that miR-486-3p mimics could reverse canonical Wnt signaling. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that miR-486-3p targets CTNNBIP1, thus activating the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenesis of BMSCs.","Zhang, Zheng; Jiang, Weiwei; Hu, Miao; Gao, Rui; Zhou, Xuhui",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,312,23

BACKGROUND: Nurses are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection because they are in closer, longer-duration contact with patients. These situations can negatively affect the mental health of nurses. METHODS: This study analysed data from COVID-19 module in the Korean Nurses' Health Study. Data from 906 participants were analysed. To identify the factors influencing mental health, descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Caring for patients who are COVID-19-positive increased levels of fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms of nurses. The hospital safety climate influenced mental well-being among nurses. CONCLUSION: Caring for patients with COVID-19 had a negative impact on fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, the higher was the perceived hospital safety climate, the lower were the nurses' psychological symptoms. Further research on the mental health of nurses is warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Institutions should manage human resources to enable periodic rotation of nurses' work and working periods related to COVID-19.

The goal of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant ""epitope hotspot"" regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3,400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA haplotypes of approximately 22,000 individuals to develop a ""digital twin"" type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population; the approach identified an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identified a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","Malone, Brandon; Simovski, Boris; Moliné, Clément; Cheng, Jun; Gheorghe, Marius; Fontenelle, Hugues; Vardaxis, Ioannis; Tennøe, Simen; Malmberg, Jenny-Ann; Stratford, Richard; Clancy, Trevor",Sci Rep,312,29

Tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies are indicative but unreliable measures of exposure. Here instead, for four highly-affected countries, we determine population susceptibilities by directly comparing country-wide observed epidemic dynamics data with that of their main metropolitan regions. We find significant susceptibility reductions in the metropolitan regions as a result of earlier seeding, with a relatively longer phase of exponential growth before the introduction of public health interventions. During the post-growth phase, the lower susceptibility of these regions contributed to the decline in cases, independent of intervention effects. Forward projections indicate that non-metropolitan regions will be more affected during recurrent epidemic waves compared with the initially heavier-hit metropolitan regions.

Understanding of the immune response and biomarker analysis is needed to progress toward understanding disease pathology and developing improved treatment options. The goal of this study is to identify pathogenic factors that are linked to disease severity and patient characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from March 17 to June 5, 2020 were analyzed for clinical features of disease and soluble plasma cytokines in association with disease severity and sex. Data from COVID-19 patients with acute illness were examined along with an age- and gender-matched control cohort. We identified a group of 16 soluble factors that were found to be increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, whereas 2 factors were decreased. In addition to inflammatory cytokines, we found significant increases in factors known to mediate vasculitis and vascular remodeling (PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB-BB, soluble CD40L (sCD40L), FGF, and IP10). Four factors such as platelet-derived growth factors, fibroblast growth factor-2, and IFN-Î³-inducible protein 10 were strongly associated with severe disease and ICU admission. Th2-related factors (IL-4 and IL-13) were increased with IL-4 and sCD40L present at increased levels in males compared with females. Our analysis revealed networking clusters of cytokines and growth factors, including previously unknown roles of vascular and stromal remodeling, activation of the innate immunity, as well activation of type 2 immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

Little is known about the factors associated with household transmission, at the level of the case, contact or household, or how these have varied over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. RESULTS: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66-0.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","Hall, J A; Harris, R J; Zaidi, A; Woodhall, S C; Dabrera, G; Dunbar, J K",Int. j. epidemiol,312,16

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed between January 2020 and February 2020 at District 2 Hospital. A systematic random sampling strategy was carried out and the data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. Descriptive analysis was reported to describe the demographic, mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers. Inferential statistics including t-test, ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to evaluate the relationship between study variables. Results: A total of 327 eligible healthcare workers had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8.17±1.3 (range 4-10) and 1.86±0.43 (range 1-5), respectively.

As a primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) exists in different hosts that are in close contact with humans, especially cats and dogs. However, the underlying mechanism of how the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 cooperates with human ACE2 (hACE2), cat ACE2 (cACE2) and dog ACE2 (dACE2) and the variation in binding remains largely unsolved. Therefore, we explored the binding behavior of the spike RBD with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2 via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. In accordance with the binding free energies and residue interactions, the spike RBD has respective binding specificities with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2, and the binding affinities decrease in the order of hACE2, cACE2, dACE2, mainly due to changes in the amino acids Q24L, H34Y, and M82T in cACE2 or dACE2. Furthermore, alanine scanning analysis results validated some key residues of the spike RBD interact with ACE2 and provided clues to the variation of amino acid that could influence the transmissibility or immune responses of SARS-CoV-2. Decreasing dynamic correlations strengths of ACE2 with the RBD were found in all hACE2-RBD, cACE2-RBD and dACE2-RBD systems. The ACE2 protein shows variable motion modes across the zinc metallopeptidase domain, which induces different interactions between ACE2 and the RBD. Our studies reveal that the motion pattern of the zinc metallopeptidase domain is critical to the binding behavior of RBD with ACE2. These findings could aid our understanding of selective recognition involving various ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and shed further light on the binding mechanisms.","Zang, Yongjian; Li, Xuhua; Zhao, Yizhen; Wang, He; Hao, Dongxiao; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Zhiwei; Yuan, Xiaohui; Zhang, Shengli",Phys Chem Chem Phys,312,16

Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling.","Kunin, A; Sargheini, N; Birkenbihl, C; Moiseeva, N; Fröhlich, Holger; Golubnitschaja, Olga",EPMA J,312,16

DATA SOURCES: Searches in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles made available in 2020, using the terms ""diagnosis"" OR ""diagnostic"" OR ""diagnostic tests"" OR ""tests"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" in the title. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Tests for the etiological agent identify genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 or humoral responses to it. The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract materials during the first week of symptoms. Serological tests should be indicated from the second week of symptoms onwards. A wide range of different tests is available, with variable sensitivity and specificity, most of which require validation. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, clotting tests, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and procalcitonin identify risk of disease with greater severity, thromboembolic complications, myocardial damage, and/or worse prognosis. Imaging tests may be useful for diagnosis, especially when there is a compatible clinical picture, and other tests presented negative results or were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genetic material of the virus by RT-PCR is the gold standard test, but its sensitivity is not satisfactory. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on clinical data, epidemiological history, tests for etiological diagnosis, and tests to support the diagnosis of the disease and/or its complications. New diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity and specificity, as well as faster results, are necessary.","Goudouris, Ekaterini S",,312,16

METHODS: Fifty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 10 groups (n=5 in each group) and orally treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight each of methanol, aqueous ethanol (H-EtOH) and chloroform extracts of A. djalonensis. Corn oil was used as vehicle (2 mL/kg). After 60 days of treatment, testosterone (T) and cholesterol (CHOL) concentrations, catalase (CAT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3ß-HSD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the testes along with myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and nitrite concentrations (NO) in the serum and testes as well as sperm quality were measured. RESULTS: T and CHOL concentrations along with 3ß-HSD activity were significantly higher in the animals treated with the low dose than in those treated with the high dose of the chloroform extract (P<0.05). Furthermore, the chloroform extract was more effective than the methanol extract that had the most marginal effect on T level at the high dose and the H-EtOH extract that was only effective at the medium dose. LDH activity was dose-dependently increased by the extracts in all groups. The CAT-SOD antioxidant system was increased in the treated animals at all doses compared to the control values, but the increase in glutathione level reached significant level in those treated with the low dose H-EtOH aqueous ethanol extract (P<0.05). Only the high dose of chloroform extract had significant inhibitory effects on MPO activity (P<0.05). Serum NO concentration was decreased at all doses of the extracts. The inhibitory effects of the extracts on testicular NO concentrations follow this order, chloroform extract > H-EtOH > methanol. Although all extracts at all doses showed excellent stimulatory effects on sperm quality (count, motility and morphology), the methanol extract at the high dose was the most effective on sperm count (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The chloroform extract of A. djalonensis has better androgen-like and anti-inflammatory effects whereas the methanol extract has the best effect on sperm count.","Ezirim, Chioma Yvonne; Abarikwu, Sunny O; Mgbudom-Okah, Chidimma J; Uwakwe, Augustine A; Njoku, Rex-Clovis C; Ogunlaja, Aemere",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,312,16

Yet, with respect to form itself, more and more favor electronic form over substantive media and signatures. Companies, consumers, and governments increasingly use electronic communications, documents, and signatures instead of ink and paper. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated an existing shift to digitization. Yet, many remain unsure about the legality or effectiveness of different forms of electronic signatures and find laws on the subject confusing. Transactions, documents, and signatures are separate concepts. Transactions and other legally relevant actions, decisions, and declarations can be recorded in documents and effectuated with signatures. Documents and signatures can be created or copied electronically or in other formats. Transactions, actions, decisions, and declarations on the other hand exist in the abstract and independent of the electronic or other form in which they may be documented or signed. In practice, people commonly ask whether electronic signatures are legal. But, the more relevant questions to ask are whether electronic signatures are effective and binding;whether they meet statutory form requirements;whether they protect interests as well as handwritten signatures on paper documents;and whether one is required to create, obtain, or retain paper documents with handwritten signatures in addition to electronic records and signatures. To better answer these and other questions, one has to consult not only newer laws specifically regulating electronic signatures and documents, but also older laws prescribing form requirements. Many older laws do not contemplate modern technologies and therefore do not give clear answers as to whether one can satisfy form requirements electronically. Numerous different form requirements apply in myriad use cases and jurisdictions with respect to particular transactions, documents, and signatures. Legal and political uncertainties hinder adoption of electronic signature products and global harmonization of applicable laws. Existing laws are complex, confusing, and diverse due to historic factors. As electronic signatures, documents, and records were first adopted more broadly, lawmakers were uncertain regarding the purposes of existing form requirements, how well electronic signatures can address purposes of form requirements, which technologies will be adopted by businesses and consumers, and what legal problems could arise from forgeries. Additionally, lawmakers had reason to be concerned that businesses and consumers would need some time to adapt to new technologies and realize and handle the binding effect of electronically issued declarations. These considerations may have provided a valid excuse in the mid-1990s for somewhat timid, complex, and consciously incomplete and experimental legislation, but twenty years later, they no longer do. It is time for change. Lawmakers can and should improve electronic signature laws and harmonize them internationally with clearer default rules favoring electronic form;detailed whitelists enumerating transactions that can be concluded with electronic documents and signatures;possibly blacklists specifying additional form requirements for particular use cases;less complex definitions;and clear conflicts of law rules, ideally permissive ones, possibly paired with bilateral or multilateral recognition or adequacy arrangements to drive international harmonization. At the same time, lawmakers should abandon overly prescriptive regulations that require ""qualified electronic signatures"" certified by nationally licensed providers, because such constructs have not been widely adopted in the last twenty years and seem to stand little chance or need of being adopted going forward. This Article analyzes the current landscape, applicable legislation, and options for change. Following an introduction, this Article clarifies terms and definitions in Part I, reviews the history and rationale of form requirements outside the electronic sphere in Part II, compares the advantages and disadvantages of electronic signatures and documents in Part III, examines basic approaches for legislation and their potential impact on public and individual interests in Part IV, describes and compares current electronic signature legislation in key jurisdictions in Part V, examines effects of international divergence in Part VI, proposes policy arguments for changes in Part VII, and concludes with a summary.","Determann, L.",Hastings Law Journal,312,24

Severely symptomatic COVID-19 is associated with lung inflammation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, thereby raising concerns of elevated risk of COVID-19-associated mortality among lung cancer patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells. The single-cell expression landscape of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung cancer patients remains unknown. We sought to delineate single-cell expression profiles of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. We examined the expression levels and cellular distribution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in 5 LUADs and 14 matched normal tissues by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. scRNA-seq of 186,916 cells revealed epithelial-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4. Analysis of 70,030 LUAD- and normal-derived epithelial cells showed that ACE2 levels were highest in normal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and that TMPRSS2 was expressed in 65% of normal AT2 cells. Conversely, the expression of TMPRSS4 was highest and most frequently detected (75%) in lung cells with malignant features. ACE2-positive cells co-expressed genes implicated in lung pathobiology, including COPD-associated HHIP, and the scavengers CD36 and DMBT1. Notably, the viral scavenger DMBT1 was significantly positively correlated with ACE2 expression in AT2 cells. We describe normal and tumor lung epithelial populations that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor and proteases, as well as major host defense genes, thus comprising potential treatment targets for COVID-19 particularly among lung cancer patients.","Han, Guangchun; Sinjab, Ansam; Hara, Kieko; Treekitkarnmongkol, Warapen; Brennan, Patrick; Chang, Kyle; Bogatenkova, Elena; Sanchez-Espiridion, Beatriz; Behrens, Carmen; Solis, Luisa M; Gao, Boning; Girard, Luc; Zhang, Jianjun; Sepesi, Boris; Cascone, Tina; Byers, Lauren A; Gibbons, Don L; Chen, Jichao; Moghaddam, Seyed Javad; Ostrin, Edwin J; Scheet, Paul; Fujimoto, Junya; Shay, Jerry; Heymach, John V; Minna, John D; Dubinett, Steven; Wistuba, Ignacio I; Stevenson, Christopher S; Spira, Avrum E; Wang, Linghua; Kadara, Humam",,312,33

Methods We searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA), in December 2019. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that reported outcomes following treatment of BPH for prostate less than 80g with Aquablation, Rezum, or UroLift, were included in the analysis. Results A total of 4 RCTs reporting the outcomes after treatment with newer MIST for BPH were identified. Patients undergoing the resective procedures i.e. TURP and Aquablation, had greater improvement in urinary domain outcomes: International Prostate Symptom Score, Quality of Life, peak flow rate and Post Voiding Residual compared to patients undergoing non-resective procedures: UroLift and Rezum. Patients in UroLift group maintained a higher sexual function domain score compared to TURP but not Aquablation. Our multiple comparison analysis did not reveal a significant difference in urinary and sexual domain scores between patients undergoing UroLift and Rezum at 24 months of follow-up. Conclusions Aquablation and TURP necessitate general or regional anesthesia, both produced significantly better urinary domain scores compared to Rezum and UroLift. On the other hand, UroLift demonstrated better sexual function domain scores compared to TURP but not Aquablation. There was no significant difference in urinary domain scores between UroLift and Rezum at 24 months follow up.","Tanneru, Karthik; Jazayeri, Seyedbehzad; Muhammad, Alam; Kumar, Jatinder; Bazargani, Soroush; Kuntz, Gretchen; PalayapalayamGanapathi, Hariharan; Bandyk, Mark; Marino, Robert; Koochekpour, Shahriar; Gautam, Shiva; K C, Balaji; Costa, Joseph",J. endourol,312,1

In order to meet this overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, we must employ innovative approaches to significantly expand the capacity of mental healthcare delivery. While it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or the number of hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtual and digital delivery of psychotherapy, which is shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good candidate to address this growing demand. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research protocol is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of treating mental health issues started or aggravated by the stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic using an online, digital and asynchronous model of care. METHODS: This non-randomized control trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) program tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material, providing an overview of behavioral skills, and completing related weekly homework. Participants (n = 80) will receive personalized feedback and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires completed by participants at baseline, week 5 and post-treatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent, a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and/or major depressive disorder with symptoms that have started or gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to speak and read English, and having consistent and reliable access to the Internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and/or active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: The study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020, and the recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (35 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020, and analyses are expected to be completed by February 2021 with linear regression analysis (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: If proven feasible, this method of care delivery could increase care capacity by up to four-folds. The findings from this project have the potential to influence clinical practices and policies, and to increase accessibility to care during the COVID-19 pandemic, without sacrificing the quality of care.

To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the dinucleotide regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus.

With the world scampering for a possible vaccine, early detection and containment are the only redress. Existing diagnostic technologies with high accuracy like RT-PCRs are expensive and sophisticated, requiring skilled individuals for specimen collection and screening, resulting in lower outreach. So, methods excluding direct human intervention are much sought after, and artificial intelligence-driven automated diagnosis, especially with radiography images, captured the researchers' interest. This survey marks a detailed inspection of the deep learning-based automated detection of COVID-19 works done to date, a comparison of the available datasets, methodical challenges like imbalanced datasets and others, along with probable solutions with different preprocessing methods, and scopes of future exploration in this arena.

From December 2016 to April 2021, 16 patients (7 males and 9 females, aged 3-49 years) with contracture scars causing impaired function of the adjacent joint were admitted to Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Eighteen joint scars of 16 patients were treated with fractional carbon dioxide laser every 2-3 months until the joint retained its normal range of motion or the effect plateaued. The treatment times of each patient were recorded. Before the first intervention and 6 months after the last treatment, the range of motion of the affected joint were measured in each patient, and the difference was calculated, meanwhile, the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was used to evaluate the scar of each patient. In the treatment of 1 joint scar in each of 6 patients (totally 6 treatments), the range of motion before the current treatment, immediately after treatment, and at the first follow-up after treatment was noted, and the differences between the range before and immediately after the treatment as well as the range before and at the first follow-up after treatment were calculated. Adverse effects in the treatment area caused by the treatment were noted. At the last follow-up, a self-made questionnaire was used to collect the implementation status of the physical therapy and other scar management modalities during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: Eighteen joint scars in 16 patients went through 2 (1, 3) times of treatments by fractional carbon dioxide laser. The range of motion of the affected joint of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment was 56.5 (39.0, 128.8)°, notably higher than 38.4 (22.9, 116.3)° before the first treatment (Z=-3.724, P<0.01), which was improved by 17.4 (8.0, 24.1)°. The vascular distribution, softness, and thickness scores, and total score in VSS scoring of scars of 16 patients 6 months after the last treatment were significantly lower than those before the first treatment (Z=-2.989, -3.762, -2.814, -3.739, P<0.01), with the most obvious improvement in softness. In 6 treatments, the range of motion immediately after treatment and at the first follow-up of (2.5±0.6) months after treatment were 156.2 (148.0, 164.2)° and 160.2 (156.7, 166.4)°, both notably higher than 151.4 (145.7, 155.3)° before treatment (Z=-2.201, -2.201, P<0.05), which were improved by 9.1 (4.4, 13.0)° and 13.1 (8.0, 15.7)°, respectively. Adverse effects such as blisters, infection, or hypertrophic scar formation was not observed in the treatment area of 16 patients. Most patients adopted physical therapy, compression, silicone gel or sheets, and braces during the treatment interval and follow-up period. Conclusions: The fractional carbon dioxide laser can soften the scar and increase the range of motion of the affected joint, which is suitable for the treatment of mild contracture scars.","Xi, W J; Zhang, Z; Li, J; Su, W J; Li, H; Pu, Z M; Zhang, Y; Feng, S Q; Zhang, Y X",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,312,24

Confirmatory factor analysis models determined that a unidimensional approach best accounted for covariation among types of economic anxiety. Zero-order and semi-partial correlations with economic anxiety were estimated. Younger adults tended to report greater anxiety than older adults. Black respondents reported significantly more anxiety, whereas respondents without children living at home reported less anxiety. Low collective self-esteem, low conscientiousness, and low openness to experience were associated with greater economic anxiety. High neuroticism, perceived vulnerability to disease, and belongingness stemming from large group activities also were associated with greater anxiety.

Additionally, the isolation that results from social distancing may be harming well-being for families as formal and informal supports become less accessible. For those living with dementia and experiencing agitation, social distancing may be even harder to maintain, or social distancing could potentially aggravate dementia-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. To understand the lived experience of social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, we remotely interviewed 21 participants who normally attend a dementia specialty clinic in Calgary, Alberta, during a period where essential businesses were closed and health care had abruptly transitioned to telemedicine. A reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview and field note data. The impacts of the public health measures in response to the pandemic emerged through iterative analysis in three main categories of experience: (1) personal, (2) health services, and (3) health status (of both persons living with dementia and care partner). Isolation and mental health needs emerged as important impacts to family experiences. This in-depth understanding of the needs and experiences of the pandemic for people living with dementia suggests that innovative means are urgently needed to facilitate provision of remote medicine and also social interaction and integration.","Roach, Pamela; Zwiers, Angela; Cox, Emily; Fischer, Karyn; Charlton, Anna; Josephson, Colin B; Patten, Scott B; Seitz, Dallas; Ismail, Zahinoor; Smith, Eric E",Dementia (London),312,1

Moderate cases may require hospitalization and severe cases have resulted in death. Interferons (IFNs) are a class of immune molecules typically involved in the anti-viral response. Their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial as IFNs may increase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, yet also enhance viral clearance. IFN-α2 stimulation increases gene expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that activates STAT proteins and is associated with poor hospital outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, surfactant protein A (SP-A), an immunomodulatory respiratory protein, is known from our work to bind to cytokine receptors such as IL-13α1 and IL-13 ligand (Francisco et al, JI 2020). Therefore, we hypothesized that SP-A binds to ACE2 and IL-6, making it a possible novel regulator of SARS-CoV-2 infection that potentially impacts disease severity.Methods: Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and asthmatic diseased bronchial human epithelial cells (DHBE) were cultured at air liquid interface for 2 weeks and stimulated with increasing doses of IFN-α2 (0.1, 1, and 10 ng/ml) for 48 hours. RT-PCR was performed and gene expression for ACE2 and IL-6 was assessed by normalizing to PPIA. Binding assays were performed using a 96-well, immunosorbent assay coated with either IL-6, IL-6Rα, GP130, ACE2, IFN-α2 or the negative control, EGFR and incubated with increasing concentrations of full-length SP-A (0-5000 ng/ml) and a SPA-HRP conjugated antibody. In separate experiments, western blotting was used to detect levels of total and phosphorylated STAT-1 in primary asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells treated for 30 minutes with IL-6 (10 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of SP-A2 (20 ug/ml) peptide.Results: Stimulation with 10 ng/ml IFN-α2 significantly increased ACE2 and IL-6 gene expression in NHBE and DHBE cells (p&lt;.05). Full length SP-A was found to bind ACE2, both IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rα and GP-130), and to a lesser extent, IL-6 cytokine. SP-A did not bind to IFN-α2 or EGFR. Asthmatic primary human lung epithelial cells treated with IL-6 resulted in phosphorylation of STAT-1, and pre-treatment with SP-A2 peptides reduced this activation by approximately 45%.Conclusion: While IFNs may play a role in viral clearance, our data suggest potential dysregulation of mechanisms affecting the response to SARS-CoV-2. SP-A may be protective based upon its effects on ACE2 and IL-6.","Conway, M.; Francisco, D.; Sierra, B.; Kimura, H.; Kraft, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,312,20

However, research in this area is thus far limited. Additionally, as a result of the pandemic, many eating disorder treatments have converted to tele-health platforms, however, little is known about patient perceptions of this modality. The aim of the present, exploratory study was to qualitatively examine: (1) The impact of COVID-19 on binge eating spectrum disorder symptoms (2) Patient perceptions of tele-therapy, and (3) Ways to address COVID-19 in eating disorder treatment. Data were collected through one-on-one, semi-structured interviews (N = 11), conducted as part of a mid-program assessment for those undergoing individual, outpatient therapy for binge eating spectrum disorders. After thematic analysis, it was identified that patients reported both symptom deterioration and improvement during COVID-19. Factors surrounding social distancing and stay-at-home measures were found to both improve and worsen symptoms for different patients. Further, patients reported positive perceptions of tele-therapy, particularly appreciating the convenience of this modality. Finally, patients provided variable feedback on the incorporation of COVID-related concerns into their eating disorder treatment, with some participants wishing for this inclusion, and others viewing COVID-19 and their eating disorder as separate issues. Findings from the present study preliminarily identify ways in which binge eating spectrum disorder symptoms may have improved due to COVID-19 and indicate positive patient perceptions of tele-therapy.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was therefore to verify whether the ROX index is an accurate predictor of HFNC failure for COVID-19 patients treated outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the validity of the previously suggested threshold. DESIGN: Multicenter study. Retrospective observational analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: 3 centres specialized in non-invasive respiratory support (Buenos Aires, Argentina; Bolzano and Treviso, Italy). Patients treated outside the ICU were analysed MEASUREMENTS: The variables to calculate the ROX index were collected during the first day of therapy at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then recorded every 24 hours. HFNC failure was defined as escalation of respiratory support to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 35 (29%) patients failed HFNC and required intubation. ROC analysis identified the 12-hour ROX index as the best predictor of intubation with an AUC of 0.7916[CI 95% 0.6905-0.8927] and the best threshold to be 5.99[Specificity 96% Sensitivity 62%]. In the survival analysis, a ROX value <5.99 was associated with an increased risk of failure (pâ¯=â¯0008â¯log - rank test). The threshold of 4,9 identified by Roca as the best predictor in non-COVID patients, was not able to discriminate between success and failure (pâ¯=â¯0.4â¯log-rank test) in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: ROX index may be useful in guiding the clinicians in their decision to intubate patients, especially in patients with moderate ARF, treated therefore outside the ICU. Indeed, it also demonstrates a different threshold value than reported for non-COVID patients, possibly related to the different mechanisms of hypoxia.","Vega, María Laura; Dongilli, Roberto; Olaizola, Gustavo; Colaianni, Nicolás; Sayat, Mauro Castro; Pisani, Lara; Romagnoli, Micaela; Spoladore, Greta; Prediletto, Irene; Montiel, Guillermo; Nava, Stefano","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",312,27

Furthermore, we investigated NHE1 and GLUT1 expression in the myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-blood quantitative assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA was performed using quantitative PCR in patients with respiratory infection upon first contact in the emergency department and subsequently stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Assessment of NHE1 and GLUT1 RNA using PCR was also performed in left ventricular myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. NHE1 expression is up-regulated in whole blood of patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory infections at first medical contact in the emergency department (control: 0.0021 ± 0.0002, COVID-19: 0.0031 ± 0.0003, P = 0.01). The ratio of GLUT1 to NHE1 is significantly decreased in the blood of COVID-19 patients who are subsequently intubated and/or die (severe disease) compared with patients with moderate disease (moderate disease: 0.497 ± 0.083 vs. severe disease: 0.294 ± 0.0336, P = 0.036). This ratio is even further decreased in the myocardium of patients who deceased from COVID-19 in comparison with the myocardium of non-infected donors. CONCLUSIONS: NHE1 and GLUT1 may be critically involved in the disease progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 infection critically disturbs ion channel expression in the heart. A decreased ratio of GLUT1/NHE1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Mustroph, Julian; Hupf, Julian; Hanses, Frank; Evert, Katja; Baier, Maria J; Evert, Matthias; Meindl, Christine; Wagner, Stefan; Hubauer, Ute; Pietrzyk, Gabriela; Leininger, Simon; Staudner, Stephan; Vogel, Manuel; Wallner, Stefan; Zimmermann, Markus; Sossalla, Samuel; Maier, Lars S; Jungbauer, Carsten",ESC Heart Fail,312,0

METHODS: In this case series, we report three patients with confirmed COVID-19 and pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis from three hospitals in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak in China. RESULT: Patient 1 was a 53-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Though receiving intensive support, he died of irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 48 days after the onset of the illness. Patient 2 was a 75-year-old woman with a history of schistosomiasis-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites. Her family members requested that invasive rescue measures not be undertaken, and she died of acute respiratory distress syndrome 40 days after presenting with COVID-19 infection. Patient 3 was an 87-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and esophageal variceal hemorrhage. He was discharged from the hospital 29 days after illness onset. CONCLUSION: The case series raise the possibility that decompensated cirrhosis may be a risk factor for a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Qi, Xiaolong; Wang, Jitao; Li, Xinyu; Wang, Zhengyan; Liu, Yanna; Yang, Hua; Li, Xiaodan; Shi, Jindong; Xiang, Huihua; Liu, Tao; Kawada, Norifumi; Maruyama, Hitoshi; Jiang, Zicheng; Wang, Fengmei; Takehara, Tetsuo; Rockey, Don C; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",Hepatol Int,312,23

Over the past two decades, the concept of “communication” has significantly evolved given the introduction of multimedia digital technologies, which have enabled people to communicate without necessarily their physical presence. During the COVID-19 pandemic, “virtual mobility” (or “virtual communication”) played a crucial role in ensuring communications between people in different contexts of social life, growing in few months to previously unforeseeable levels and demonstrating that it can substitute physical movements in many occasions. A smart management of mobility that combines the ability to virtually communicate and the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to support physical mobility, can therefore strongly influence people's choice to move or not, and how. Starting from the analysis of physical mobility and virtual communications trends before and during the health emergency in Italy, this paper analyses the relationships between these two forms of communication, evaluating how virtual communication affected the different segments of Italian mobility during the pandemic and how it will affect the way people move in the post COVID-19 period. A SWOT analysis of virtual mobility is performed for each communication segment, with the aim of highlighting its pros and cons, but also future opportunities and possible threats. Some policy indications are also provided in relation to different mobility segments, governance levels (urban, regional and national) and congestion/pollution scenarios, highlighting how virtual mobility can help regulate physical movements, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a safe, sustainable, effective, efficient and connected mobility.","Caballini, Claudia Agostino Matteo Dalla Chiara Bruno",Transport Policy,312,1

The superior half of the main nasal cavity is opened up, increasing accessibility to the region. This is expected to increase inhalation dosimetry to the region during exposure to airborne particles. This study investigated the influence of middle turbinate resection on the deposition of inhaled pollutants that cover spherical and non-spherical particles (e.g. pollen). A computational model of the nasal cavity from CT scans, and its corresponding post-operative model with virtual surgery performed was created. Two constant flow rates of 5â¯L/min, and 15â¯L/min were simulated under a laminar flow field. Inhaled particles including pollen (non-spherical), and a spherical particle with reference density of 1000â¯kg/m3 were introduced in the surrounding atmosphere. The effect of surgery was most prominent in the less patent cavity side, since the change in anatomy was proportionally greater relative to the original airway space. The left cavity produced an increase in particle deposition at a flow rate of 15â¯L/min. The main particle deposition mechanisms were inertial impaction, and to a lesser degree gravitational sedimentation. The results are expected to provide insight into inhalation efficiency of different aerosol types, and the likelihood of deposition in different nasal cavity surfaces.","Inthavong, Kiao; Shang, Yidan; Del Gaudio, John M; Wise, Sarah K; Edwards, Thomas S; Bradshaw, Kimberley; Wong, Eugene; Smith, Murray; Singh, Narinder",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,312,25

To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals' everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate risk communication and targeted mental health recommendations especially for vulnerable groups during these challenging times.","Benke, Christoph; Autenrieth, Lara K; Asselmann, Eva; Pané-Farré, Christiane A",Psychiatry Res,312,26

We validated several structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells.

Validation of a questionnaire in the healthcare sector",18.4824,2.9858978,2021,"Blood flow partially determines specific climbing endurance (SCE) as it mediates oxygen bio-availability in the finger flexors. Blood flow is related to occlusion threshold (OT), which is defined as the contraction intensity at which intramuscular pressure exceeds perfusion blood pressure resulting in the cessation of local blood flow. The OT is represented as an inflection point on a force-time graph when isometric force is registered and applied through maximal and continuous tests. Endurance time (ET) to exhaustion is influenced by the relative isometric applied force and is different for each climber. The aim of this study was to explore whether an approximation of the finger flexors OT in sport climbers through records of ET to exhaustion at different isometric relative intensities was possible. We measured maximum finger hang ETs at 6 intensities ranging from 85% to 35% maximal force in 34 sport climbers of advanced and elite level. The values obtained were analyzed by two different methods in an attempt to determine a change in the shape of the curve in the intensity-ET relationship graphs that approximated the OT for each climber. The results suggest that the finger flexors OT could be different among climbers, regardless of their strength and ability level. The presented methods do not accurately reflect the OT, but could indicate the intensity at which blood flow is restored in the active muscles. This is the first study to indirectly approximate the finger flexors OT in sport-climbers, a parameter that could be essential to assess SCE.","Gómez, Pedro Bergua; Montero-Marin, Jesús; Gomez-Bruton, Alejandro; A Casajús, José",Eur J Sport Sci,312,10

As a result, the public was confined to indoors, and most of their daily activities were happening in their indoor places, which might have resulted in lower indoor environment quality. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in household dust (n = 40) collected from different residential districts of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, during the lockdown period. PAHs' levels were two folds higher than the previously reported PAHs in indoor dust from this region. We detected low molecular weight (LMW) with two to four aromatic ring PAHs in all the samples with a significant contribution from Phenanthrene (Phe), present at an average concentration of 1590 ng/g of dust. Although high molecular weight (HMW) (5-6 aromatic ring) PAHs were detected at lower concentrations than LMW PAHs, however, they contributed >90% in the carcinogenic index of PAHs. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of specific PAHs was above the reference dose (RfD) for young children in high-end exposure and the calculated Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) was >1.00 × 10-4 for both Saudi adults and young children. The study highlighted that indoor pollution has increased significantly during lockdown due to the increased indoor activities and inversely affect human health.

Here, we perform single-cell deep-immune profiling of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 5 patients with mild and 26 with critical COVID-19 in comparison to BALs from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal lung. We use pseudotime inference to build T-cell and monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories and model gene expression changes along them. In mild COVID-19, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and CD4+ T-helper-17 (TH17) cells undergo active (presumably antigen-driven) expansion towards the end of the trajectory, and are characterized by good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they remain more naïve. Vice versa, CD4+ T-cells with T-helper-1 characteristics (TH1-like) and CD8+ T-cells expressing exhaustion markers (TEX-like) are enriched halfway their trajectories in mild COVID-19, where they also exhibit good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they show evidence of inflammation-associated stress at the end of their trajectories. Monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories show that chronic hyperinflammatory monocytes are enriched in critical COVID-19, while alveolar macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, are depleted. In critical COVID-19, monocytes contribute to an ATP-purinergic signaling-inflammasome footprint that could enable COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsen disease-severity.

We examine peer-reviewed studies which estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be 1.8-2.8% of global GHG emissions. Our findings indicate that published estimates all underestimate the carbon footprint of ICT, possibly by as much as 25%, by failing to account for all of ICT's supply chains and full lifecycle (i.e. emissions scopes 1, 2 and fully inclusive 3). Adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we estimate that ICT's share of emissions could actually be as high as 2.1-3.9%. There are pronounced differences between available projections of ICT's future emissions. These projections are dependent on underlying assumptions that are sometimes, but not always, made explicit - and we explore these in the report. Whatever assumptions analysts take, they agree that ICT will not reduce its emissions without a major concerted effort involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring a targeted intervention, and we note that in light of these, it seems risky to assume that ICT will, by default, assist in the attainment of climate targets. Based on our analysis, we find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's carbon footprint in alignment with the Paris Agreement. We further contend that a global carbon constraint should be viewed as a significant opportunity for the ICT sector, as efficiencies within and enabled by ICT would be even greater enablers of productivity and utility than they are today.","Freitag, Charlotte; Berners-Lee, Mike; Widdicks, Kelly; Knowles, Bran; Blair, Gordon; Friday, Adrian",,312,24

How genetic deficits in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) lead to these defects remains unknown. Rapid advances in genomic editing such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system provide new tools for scientific study. We aimed to create a stable CFTR knockout (KO) in human macrophages in order to study how CFTR regulates macrophage function. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from non-CF healthy volunteers and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). MDMs were transfected with a CRISPR Cas9 CFTR KO plasmid. CFTR KO efficiency was verified and macrophage halide efflux, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, apoptosis, and cytokine functional assays were performed. CFTR KO in human MDMs was efficient and stable after puromycin selection. CFTR KO was confirmed by CFTR mRNA and protein expression. CFTR function was abolished in CFTR KO MDMs. CFTR KO recapitulated known defects in human CF MDM (CFTR class I/II variants) dysfunction including (1) increased apoptosis, (2) decreased phagocytosis, (3) reduced oxidative burst, and (4) increased bacterial load. Activation of the oxidative burst via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase assembly was diminished in CFTR KO MDMs (decreased phosphorylated p47phox). Cytokine production was unchanged or decreased in response to infection in CFTR KO MDMs. In conclusion, we developed a primary human macrophage CFTR KO system. CFTR KO mimics most pathology observed in macrophages obtained from persons with CF, which suggests that many aspects of CF macrophage dysfunction are CFTR-dependent and not just reflective of the CF inflammatory milieu.","Zhang, Shuzhong; Shrestha, Chandra L; Wisniewski, Benjamin L; Pham, Hanh; Hou, Xucheng; Li, Wenqing; Dong, Yizhou; Kopp, Benjamin T",Front Immunol,312,5

It has been hypothesized that intervals of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)-breathing 100% oxygen at atmosphere absolute (ATA) greater than the 1.0 normal at sea level-may similarly improve lower extremity ulcer healing outcomes. This month's Evidence Corner summarizes 2 studies regarding patients receiving HBO.

Many of the preventive measures implemented during the pandemic can increase sedentary lifestyles, which can lead to the development of chronic diseases, including obesity, among the general population and cause serious threats to people's physical health and overall quality of life. Individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and may hence have higher levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity levels and mental health status on an individual level and to compare them between those with and those without comorbidities in a cohort of Texas residents, before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey was disseminated throughout various regions of Texas. In total, 160 individuals were asked questions about their demographic characteristics, time spent on daily physical activities, and daily mental health status before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 94 (58%) participants reported having &#8805;1 medical condition, and 31 (13.1%) had >3 medical conditions. Physical activity levels among participants with &#8805;1 pre-existing comorbidity drastically-but not significantly-decreased, as evident from a 10% increase in sedentary lifestyles after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. On the contrary, we observed a 9% increase in the number of individuals without a pre-existing comorbidity who reported 30-60 min of physical activity per week. There was a 2-fold increase in the number of participants reporting more frequent feelings of nervousness, too much worry, trouble relaxing, and the fear of something awful happening after the pandemic. More specifically, individuals with pre-existing medical conditions reported, on average, a 10% higher incidence of feelings of stress, anxiety, and sadness compared to their healthy counterparts after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life conditions and chronic comorbidities are risk factors that can affect mental health and reduce the ability to perform activities of daily life. Therefore, when implementing pandemic protocols, municipalities should consider providing mental health support to their citizens to protect them from this rather inconspicuous adverse effect.","Patel, Darpan I; Gamez, Yazmin; Shah, Lajja; Patel, Jaini",J Med Internet Res,312,16

In particular, solid organ transplant patients are subjected to increased morbidity and mortality from infection. In the face of these challenges, transplant centers need to develop innovative protocols to ensure high-quality care. METHODS: A multidisciplinary protocol was developed that included the following: virtual selection meetings, coronavirus disease 2019 negative donors, pretransplant symptom screening, rapid testing on presentation, telehealth follow-up, and weekly community outreach town halls. All orthotopic liver transplants completed between January 2018 and August 2020 were included in the study (n = 344). The cohort was stratified from January 2018 to February 2020 as ""pre-COVID-19,"" and from March 2020 to August 2020 as ""COVID-19."" Patient demographics and postoperative outcomes were compared. RESULTS: From March 2020 to August 2020, there was a significant decrease in average monthly referrals for orthotopic liver transplantation (29.8 vs 37.1, P = .01). However, listings (11.0 vs 14.3, P = .09) and transplant volume remained unchanged (12.2 vs 10.6, P = .26). Rapid testing was utilized on arrival for transplant, zero patients tested positively preoperatively, and median time from test result until abdominal incision was 4.5 h [interquartile range, 1.2, 9.2]. Simultaneously, telehealth visits increased rapidly, peaking at 85% of all visits. It is important to note that there was no difference in outcomes between cohorts. CONCLUSION: Orthotopic liver transplant can be accomplished safely and effectively in the coronavirus disease 2019 era without compromising outcomes through increasing utilization of telehealth, rapid coronavirus disease 2019 testing, and multidisciplinary protocols for managing immunosuppressed patients.","Delman, Aaron M; Turner, Kevin M; Jones, Courtney R; Vaysburg, Dennis M; Silski, Latifa S; King, Corey; Luckett, Keith; Safdar, Kamran; Quillin, Ralph C; Shah, Shimul A",Surgery (St. Louis),312,10

We adopt an oft-used tool in mathematical finance, the Heston Stochastic Volatility model, to forecast the short-term and long-term evolution of motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate a number of extensions to the Heston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision rate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of accelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of collision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a short-term forecast of collision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term forecasts. The short-term forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates (over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road safety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios suggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and targets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half) could have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this scenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations suggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044. The main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting unreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents the effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the long run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that underlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the effectiveness of implemented policies.","Shannon, Darren; Fountas, Grigorios",,312,26

However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW. In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population. The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure. As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.

Tourism has been one the most affected economic sectors because of the mobility restrictions established by governments and uncoordinated actions from origin and destination regions. The coordination of restrictions and reopening policies could help control the spread of virus and enhance economies, but this is not an easy endeavor since touristic companies, citizens, and local governments have conflicting interests. We propose an evolutionary game model that reflects a collective risk dilemma behind these decisions. To this aim, we represent regions as players, organized in groups; and consider the perceived risk as a strict lock-down and null economic activity. The costs for regions when restricting their mobility are heterogeneous, given that the dependence on tourism of each region is diverse. Our analysis shows that, for both large populations and the EU NUTS2 case study, the existence of heterogeneous costs enhances global agreements. Furthermore, the decision on how to group regions to maximize the regions' agreement of the population is a relevant issue for decision makers to consider. We find out that a layout of groups based on similar costs of cooperation boosts the regions' agreements and avoid the risk of having a total lock-down and a negligible tourism activity. These findings can guide policy makers to facilitate agreements among regions to maximize the tourism recovery.","Chica, Manuel; Hernández, Juan M; Bulchand-Gidumal, Jacques",Sci Rep,312,1

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the effects of prior trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on changes in the amount of TV news watching and its effect on subsequent PTSD. More specifically, we examined the interrelations of prior exposure to war captivity, long-term PTSD trajectories, and amount of change TV news watching with PTSD severity during the COVID-19 pandemic, among aging Israeli combat veterans. METHODS: One-hundred-and-twenty Israeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) from 1973 Yom Kippur War and 65 matched controls (combat veterans from the same war) were followed up at five points of time: 1991 (T1), 2003 (T2), 2008 (T3), 2015 (T4), and in April-May 2020 (T5), during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Ex-POWs had higher odds of COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to PTSD severity at T5. In addition, delayed PTSD trajectory was associated with COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to more severe PTSD at T5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the negative implications of TV news watching during a mass trauma for traumatized individuals. More specifically, they demonstrate its potential pathogenic role in exacerbating prior PTSD among trauma survivors.","Solomon, Zahava; Ginzburg, Karni; Ohry, Avi; Mikulincer, Mario",Soc Sci Med,312,6

This study reports on survey responses from 190 analytic therapists on their transition to online therapy via videoconferencing during the pandemic and their previous experience with remote therapy (the majority had such experience). During the pandemic they prepared themselves and their patients for the transition in a variety of ways. The majority of those surveyed reported feeling as confident and as competent in their online sessions as in their earlier in-person work. Moreover, despite technical and relational challenges, they remained as strong, emotionally connected, and authentic in their online therapy sessions as they were in person.

Given the urgency to release coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology tests, most manufacturers have developed qualitative tests. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical performance of six different SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and their quantitative results to better elucidate the clinical role of serology testing in COVID-19. DESIGN: Six SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays were tested using remnant specimens from 190 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for each assay with the current manufacturer's cutoff and a lower cutoff. A numeric result analysis and discrepancy analysis were performed Results: The specificity was >93% for all assays, and sensitivity was >80% for all assays (&#8805; 7 days post-polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing). Inpatients with more severe disease had higher numeric values compared to health care workers with mild or moderate disease. Several discrepant serology results were those just below the manufacturers cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 especially with negative PCR. Quantitative COVID-19 IgG results are important to better understand the immunological response and disease course of this novel virus and to assess immunity as part of future vaccination programs.","Forest, Stefanie K; Orner, Erika P; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Bortz, Robert H; Laudermilch, Ethan; Florez, Catalina; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Vergnolle, Olivia; Lo, Yungtai; Campbell, Sean T; Barnhill, Jason; Cadoff, Evan M; Lai, Jonathan R; Chandran, Kartik; Weiss, Louis M; Fox, Amy S; Prystowsky, Michael B; Wolgast, Lucia R",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pregnant women at the time of delivery presents a unique challenge. To fulfill the goal of providing adequate management of such women and their infants, and to decrease the risk of exposure of the healthcare providers, tentative guidelines are needed until more evidence is collected. Practical preventative action is required that takes into account the following infection routes: (i) aerosol transmission from mothers to healthcare providers, (ii) horizontal transmission to healthcare providers from infants infected by their mothers, and (iii) horizontal transmission from mothers to infants. To develop standard operating procedures, briefings/training simulations should be carried out, taking into account the latest information. Briefings should be carefully conducted to clarify the role and procedures. Healthcare providers should wear personal protective equipment. If it is physically possible, neonatal resuscitation should be performed in a separate area next to the delivery room. If a separate area is not available, the infant warmer should be placed at least 2 m away from the delivery table, or partitioned off in the same room. A minimum number of skilled personnel should participate in resuscitation using the latest neonatal resuscitation algorithms.","Hosono, Shigeharu; Isayama, Tetsuya; Sugiura, Takahiro; Kusakawa, Isao; Kamei, Yoshimasa; Ibara, Satoshi; Tamura, Masanori",Pediatr Int,312,1

Here, we proposed to assess the relationship between IL-6 and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our cohort consisted of 46 adult patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a COVID-19 ward of the Hospital de Braga (HB) from April 7 to May 7, 2020, whose IL-6 levels were followed over time. We found that IL-6 levels were significantly different between the disease stages. Also, we found a significant negative correlation between IL-6 levels during stages IIb and III, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), showing that IL-6 correlates with respiratory failure. Compared to the inflammatory markers available in the clinic routine, we found a positive correlation between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, when we assessed the predictive value of these two markers, IL-6 behaves as a better predictor of disease progression. In a binary logistic regression, IL-6 level was the most significant predictor of the non-survivors group, when compared to age and CRP. Herein, we present IL-6 as a relevant tool for prognostic evaluation, mainly as a predictor of outcome.","Santa Cruz, André; Mendes-Frias, Ana; Oliveira, Ana Isabel; Dias, Luís; Matos, Ana Rita; Carvalho, Alexandre; Capela, Carlos; Pedrosa, Jorge; Castro, António Gil; Silvestre, Ricardo",Front Immunol,312,23

Our objective in this paper was to evaluate ex-ante (before the flattening of the curve) the effectiveness of the measures adopted by the Spanish Government to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. Our hypothesis was that the behavior of the epidemic curve is very similar in all countries. We employed a time series design, using information from January 17 to April 5, 2020 on the new daily COVID-19 cases from Spain, China and Italy. We specified two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with variable response from the Gaussian family (i.e. linear mixed models): one to explain the shape of the epidemic curve of accumulated cases and the other to estimate the effect of the intervention. Just one day after implementing the measures, the variation rate of accumulated cases decreased daily, on average, by 3.059 percentage points, (95% credibility interval: -5.371, -0.879). This reduction will be greater as time passes. The reduction in the variation rate of the accumulated cases, on the last day for which we have data, has reached 5.11 percentage points.

Emerging literature has not yet investigated the extent to which responses are evolving in the best interests of the child, in line with the treaty-based rights of children. This article makes a unique contribution to scholarship by applying a child rights lens to safeguarding efforts in the aid sector with a focus on the least developed countries in Africa. The article first reviews the safeguarding landscape—providing a snapshot of self-regulatory and standard setting initiatives by non-government organisations (NGOs) and bilateral government donors. Next, the article examines the relevant standards in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and respective Committee observations to enrich the safeguarding discussion. Finally, the article discusses key dilemmas and remaining challenges for safeguarding children in the developing world. The article suggests that a rights-based approach provides for a more nuanced and contextualised response, avoiding the temptation of ‘tick-box’ exercises driven by reputational management and ‘programming siloes’ imposed by humanitarian and development actors. To support sustained and consistent progress, efforts should go beyond intra-organisational policy and sectoral self-regulation. Child rights law monitoring mechanisms can be leveraged to encourage effective government oversight of NGOs in contact with children, as part of national frameworks for child protection. Donor governments should also consider and increase investment in national and local child protection systems to address risk factors to child abuse and ensure appropriate responses for any child that experiences harm.","Afrooz Kaviani, Johnson Sloth-Nielsen Julia",Social Sciences,312,30

Except the one with massive cerebellar infarct, a desirable outcome occurred with a mean mRS 2.6 at discharge. The mean ESR and CRP level was elevated to 30.4 ml and 32 mg/dl. The severity of COVID-19 infection was considered mainly as mild. COVID-19 infection has the potential to induce hypercoagulability state contributing to stroke development even in the mild form of disease.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a low-dose MBI on distress in a sample of young unemployed adults. The sample included 239 young unemployed adults enrolled for a 6-week long employability-related training camp. Participants were allocated into an intervention group that received weekly 1-hour mindfulness training over 4 weeks, and a control group. Dispositional mindfulness, distress and well-being were assessed in the entire sample prior to the start and upon completion of the mindfulness training. A mixed model ANCOVA showed that distress was inversely and significantly predicted by baseline levels of mindfulness and well-being. After accounting for the baseline levels of mindfulness and well-being, a significant effect of the mindfulness intervention was evident. This result shows that a low-dose MBI can decrease distress in a sample of young unemployed adults and its effectiveness is positively associated with initial levels of dispositional mindfulness and well-being.","Roemer, Anja; Sutton, Anna; Grimm, Carsten; Medvedev, Oleg N",,312,24

Method: A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis. Findings: Contradictory to the study hypothesis, states initially with a high COVID-19 prevalence rate enacted mitigation strategies slowly. Three mitigation strategies (nonessential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states. Conclusion: Some states may have missed optimal timing to implement mitigations. Swift implementation of mitigations is crucial. Reopening economy by fully lifting mitigation interventions is risky.","Guo, Shenyang; An, Ruopeng; McBride, Timothy D.; Yu, Danlin; Fu, Linyun; Yang, Yuanyuan",Res. Soc. Work Pract.,312,16

Among various efforts to address vaccine hesitancy and foster vaccine confidence, evidence-based communication strategies are critical. There are opportunities to consider the role of emotion in communication efforts. In this commentary, we highlight several ways negative as well as positive emotions may be considered and leveraged.

It was contended that ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonists (ARBs) increase ACE2 expression in lung cells and their administration in Covid-19 patients could be detrimental and/ or constitute a potential risk factor. As there were no evidences supporting this hypothesis we investigated the effect of ACEis/ARBs on ACE2 expression in lung cells. Design and method: Calu-3 cells, epithelial cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma, were treated with 10 μM irbesartan (ARB), or 10 μM ramipril (ACEi) alone or in the presence of 100 nM Angiotensin II (Ang II) for 12 hours in serum-free media. After 12 hrs ACE2 mRNA expression was evaluated by Digital droplet (dd)PCR. Results: We found that Ang II increased by two-fold ACE2 mRNA copies (vehicle 792.7 ± 161.3 vs Ang II 1475 ± 319.9;p&lt;0.001), while both irbesartan and ramipril did not affect ACE2 expression levels (722.3 ± 170.2 and 747.8 ± 313.8, respectively). Moreover, pretreatment with irbesartan abolished Ang II-induced ACE2 expression (722.3 ± 170.2 copies irbesartan vs 1046 ± 182.4 copies Ang II + irbesartan;p&lt;0.05), while pretreatment with rampiril had no such effect (1252 ± 246,4 copies Ang II + ramipril). Conclusions: ARBs and ACEis do not increase ACE2 expression at mRNA levels in human epithelial lung cells. Ang II increased ACE2 expression by acting via AT1R. Therefore, these results provided mechanistic support to a beneficial effect of both ACEi and ARB treatment in Covid19 patients with Sars-CoV-2 infection.","Caputo, I.; Caroccia, B.; Seccia, T.

During the Level 1 RMPHE, social production and public transport were maintained at minimal levels, and residents stayed in and worked from home. The universal impact of anthropogenic activities on air pollution can be evaluated by comparing it with air quality under such extreme conditions. We investigated the concentration of both gaseous and particulate pollutants and aerosol light absorption at different levels of (RMPHE) in an urban area of southwestern China. During the lockdown, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, and BC decreased by 30-50%, compared to the pre-Level 1 RMPHE period. Meanwhile, the decrease of NOx caused the rise of O3 by up to 2.3 times due to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) limitation. The aerosol light absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths decreased by 50%, and AAE decreased by 20% during the Level 1 RMPHE. BrC played essential roles in light absorption after the RMPHE was announced, accounting for 54.0% of the aerosol absorption coefficient at 370 nm.

Disinfection, the elimination of microbial species via the application of biocidal chemicals, is essential to control infectious diseases and safeguard animal and human health. In an era of antimicrobial resistance and emerging disease, the effective application of biocidal control measures is vital to protect public health. The COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the increasing demand for effective biocidal solutions to reduce and eliminate disease transmission. However, there is increasing recognition into the relationship between biocide use and the proliferation of Antimicrobial Resistance species, particularly multidrug-resistant pathogens. The One Health approach and WHO action plan to combat AMR require active surveillance and monitoring of AMR species;however, biocidal resistance is often overlooked. ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens and numerous fungal species have demonstrated drug and biocidal resistance where increased patient mortality is a risk. Currently, there is a lack of information on the impact of biocide application on environmental habitats and ecosystems. Undoubtedly, the excessive application of disinfectants and AMR will merge to result in secondary disasters relating to soil infertility, loss of biodiversity and destruction of ecosystems.","Meade, Elaine Slattery Mark Anthony Garvey Mary",Pathogens,312,1

Fifty to 95% of all infants with NEC develop thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <150 × 109/L) within 24-72 h of receiving this diagnosis. In many patients, thrombocytopenia is severe and is treated with one or more platelet transfusions. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and biological implications of NEC-related thrombocytopenia remain unclear. This review presents current evidence from human and animal studies on the clinical features and mechanisms of platelet depletion in NEC. Anecdotal clinical experience is combined with evidence from laboratory studies and from an extensive literature search in databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus and the electronic archives of abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies. To avoid bias in identification of existing studies, key words were short-listed prior to the actual search both from anecdotal experience and from PubMed's Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus. IMPACT: Fifty to 95% of infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) develop idiopathic thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <150 × 109/L) within 24-72 h of disease onset.Early clinical trials suggest that moderate thrombocytopenia may be protective in human NEC, although further work is needed to fully understand this relationship.We have developed a neonatal murine model of NEC-related thrombocytopenia, where enteral administration of an immunological stimulant, trinitrobenzene sulfonate, on postnatal day 10 induces an acute necrotizing ileocolitis resembling human NEC.In this murine model, thrombocytopenia is seen at 15-18 h due to platelet consumption and mild-moderate thrombocytopenia is protective.","Maheshwari, Akhil",Pediatr. res,312,12

The world's attention has turned to address this unanticipated development; however, the viral infection that has long plagued outcomes after solid organ transplantation still requires vigilance. With physical distancing as the key intervention to reduce the healthcare burden, and the unease related to healthcare contact within the transplant population given the associated morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in transplant recipients, providers have struggled to evaluate and streamline essential in-person healthcare contact, including laboratory visits. Owing to this, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on the delivery of CMV prophylaxis and treatment after solid organ transplantation.

Data were collected through interviews and field notes. The data were analyzed with conventional content analysis. Results: Data analysis of nurses’ experiences with respect to COVID-19 patients resulted in the extraction of information on 5 major categories: “security in care-giving,” “healing hands, empty hands,” “mental and physical problems,” “multiple feelings,” and “self-reassurance” and 11 subcategories. Conclusion: We found that giving care to COVID-19 patients entailed complex, intermingled, and interrelated physical, mental, and emotional aspects that underwent changes over time so that it can be called “journey of nursing in COVID-19 crisis.” The findings of this study further revealed that nurses’ experiences, feelings, and thoughts underwent modifications gradually, over time.

We aimed to investigate age-related differences in symptom presentations of patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: SETTING: Calls to the medical helpline (1-8-1-3) and emergency number (1-1-2) in Copenhagen, Denmark. At both medical services all calls are recorded. PARTICIPANTS: We included calls for patients who called for help/guidance at the medical helpline or emergency number prior to receiving a test for SARS-CoV-2 between April 1st and 20th 2020 (8423 patients). Among these calls, we randomly sampled recorded calls from 350 patients who later tested positive and 250 patients tested negative and registered symptoms described in the call. OUTCOME: RESULTS: After exclusions, 544 calls (312 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 232 negative) were included in the analysis. Fever and cough remained the two most common of COVID-19 symptoms across all age groups and approximately 42% of SARS-CoV-2 positive and 20% of negative presented with both fever and cough. Symptoms including nasal congestion, irritation/pain in throat, muscle/joint pain, loss of taste and smell, and headache were common symptoms of COVID-19 for patients younger than 60 years; whereas loss of appetite and feeling unwell were more commonly seen among patients over 60 years. Headache and loss of taste and smell were rare symptoms of COVID-19 among patients over 60 years. CONCLUSION: Our study identified age-related differences in symptom presentations of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients calling for help or medical advice.

METHODS: The results are based on the analysis of surveys that were distributed among members of 26 random Facebook groups in April-May, 2020. Perceived COVID-19 pandemic related stress and health concerns were examined by using the ANOVA test. RESULTS: Among 315 respondents, 64% have experienced COVID-19 related stress and identified anxiety, headache, insomnia, and weight gain as their primary health concerns. The ANOVA test revealed that females are more impacted by the COVID-19 stress than males. Around 40% of respondents believed that the COVID-19 would lead to an increase in the cost of health services, and 20% of respondents anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic would increase their need for health services. CONCLUSIONS: Learning about how people perceive the COVID-19 pandemic impact on their health, particularly in the pandemic's early stages can allow health professionals to develop targeted interventions that can influence pandemic preventative behaviors among different population groups.

As localities enforce lockdowns and pass emergency OUD treatment regulations, questions arise about how these changes will affect access and retention in care. In this study, we explore the influence of COVID-19 on access to, experiences with, and motivations for OUD treatment through a qualitative analysis of public discussion forums on Reddit. METHODS: We collected data from Reddit, a free and international online platform dedicated to public discussions and user-generated content. We extracted 1000 of the most recent posts uploaded between March 5th and May 13th, 2020 from each of the two most popular opioid subreddits ""r/Opiates"" and ""r/OpiatesRecovery"" (total 2000). We reviewed posts for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use and coded content using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach. Thematic analysis identified common themes related to study questions of interest. RESULTS: Of 2000 posts reviewed, 300 (15%) discussed topics related to the intersection of opioid use and COVID-19. Five major themes related to OUD treatment were identified: Concern about closure of OUD treatment services; transition to telehealth and virtual care; methadone treatment requirements and increased exposure to COVID-19; reactions to changing regulations on medications for OUD; and influences of the pandemic on treatment motivation and progress. CONCLUSION: In the face of unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, reactions of Reddit opioid forum users ranged from increased distress in accessing and sustaining treatment, to encouragement surrounding new modes of treatment and opportunities to engage in care. New and less restrictive avenues for treatment were welcomed by many, but questions remain about how new norms and policy changes will be sustained beyond this pandemic and impact OUD treatment access and outcomes long-term.","Krawczyk, Noa; Bunting, Amanda M; Frank, David; Arshonsky, Joshua; Gu, Yuanqi; Friedman, Samuel R; Bragg, Marie A",Int J Drug Policy,312,22

The aim of this study was to quantify the effects on physical activity (PA) levels using data from the prospective Triage-HF Plus Evaluation study. METHODS: This study represents a cohort of adult patients with implanted cardiac devices capable of measuring activity by embedded accelerometery via a remote monitoring platform. Activity data were available for the 4 weeks pre-implementation and post implementation of 'stay at home' lockdown measures in the form of 'minutes active per day' (min/day). RESULTS: Data were analysed for 311 patients (77.2% men, mean age 68.8, frailty 55.9%. 92.2% established heart failure (HF) diagnosis, of these 51.2% New York Heart Association II), with comorbidities representative of a real-world cohort.Post-lockdown, a significant reduction in median PA equating to 20.8 active min/day was seen. The reduction was uniform with a slightly more pronounced drop in PA for women, but no statistically significant difference with respect to age, body mass index, frailty or device type. Activity dropped in the immediate 2-week period post-lockdown, but steadily returned thereafter. Median activity week 4 weeks post-lockdown remained significantly lower than 4 weeks pre-lockdown (p&#8804;0.001).

The A-SIR model, i.e. a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model with a compartment for infected individuals with no symptoms or few symptoms was proposed by Giuseppe Gaeta, arXiv:2003.08720 [q-bio.PE] (2020). In this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and S\~ao Paulo state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemics. For each case we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic.","Neves, Armando G. M.; Guerrero, Gustavo",,312,16

Home confinement during COVID-19 made this less feasible. Our objective was to ascertain whether a transition to virtual online meetings among TS members took place, and whether it was potentially effective. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred fifty-two long-standing USA members of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) were surveyed to ascertain their recovery-related experiences and their relation to the transition to virtual meetings. RESULTS: During the previous week (ie, 'during COVID-19') respondents attended more virtual meetings (â=â4.13[SD4.64]) than they had attended both face-to-face meetings before COVID-19 (â=â3.35[SD2.05]), and also face-to-face meetings during COVID-19 (â=â0.75[SD1.8]). Many of the meetings were accessed from sites remote from their homes (44.4%), even overseas (21.5%). The majority (64.9%) found virtual meetings at least as effective in promoting their abstinence as were face-to-face meetings, and 41.8% estimated the same for newcomers. A shorter period of antecedent abstinence from drugs and increased loneliness were associated with increased craving during the transition period. Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In a survey of well-established NA members, most had made a successful transition from face-to-face to virtual meetings, relative to their antecedent characteristics. This successful transition suggests the possibility of an enhanced opportunity for stabilizing TS membership.","Galanter, Marc; White, William L; Hunter, Brooke",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),312,26

It is vital to comprehend how to help the workforce in this service sector grow resilient through such a crisis. This paper aims to unpack the role of employer event communication in promoting hotel workers' resilience. Design/methodology/approach The data were garnered from 462 hotel workers who were on unpaid leave or layoff during the hotel shutdown. Findings The results unfolded the positive link between employer event communication and hotel workers' resilience, for which core beliefs examination served as a mediation mechanism. Family support was found to moderate the effect of employer event communication on core beliefs examination. Practical implications The findings indicate to hospitality organizations that in face of a crisis such as the COVID-19, their employee resilience can be activated if they implement event communication activities. They should further realize that their support should go hand in hand with family support in fueling employee resilience from the crisis. Originality/value This study advances the understanding of how and when to promote resilience among hotel workers during a pandemic crisis.","Tuan, L.

The objectives of this study were to determine whether there is an association between HLA genetic polymorphisms and the susceptibility to and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. DESIGN: Observational and prospective study. SETTING: Eight Intensive Care Units (ICU) from 6 hospitals of Canary Islands (Spain). PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients admitted in ICU and healthy subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Determination of HLA genetic polymorphisms. MAIN VARIABLE OF INTEREST: Mortality at 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 3886 healthy controls and 72 COVID-19 patients (10 non-survivors and 62 survivor patients at 30 days) were included. We found a trend to a higher rate of the alleles HLA-A*32 (p=0.004) in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients, and of the alleles HLA-B*39 (p=0.02) and HLA-C*16 (p=0.02) in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls; however, all these p-values were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of certain alleles was associated with higher mortality, such as the allele HLA-A*11 after controlling for SOFA (OR=7.693; 95% CI=1.063-55.650; p=0.04) or APACHE-II (OR=11.858; 95% CI=1.524-92.273; p=0.02), the allele HLA-C*01 after controlling for SOFA (OR=11.182; 95% CI=1.053-118.700; p=0.04) or APACHE-II (OR=17.604; 95% CI=1.629-190.211; p=0.02), and the allele HLA-DQB1*04 after controlling for SOFA (OR=9.963; 95% CI=1.235-80.358; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The new finding from our preliminary study of small sample size was that HLA genetic polymorphisms could be associated with COVID-19 mortality; however, studies with a larger sample size before definitive conclusions can be drawn.","Lorente, L; Martín, M M; Franco, A; Barrios, Y; Cáceres, J J; Solé-Violán, J; Perez, A; Marcos Y Ramos, J A; Ramos-Gómez, L; Ojeda, N; Jiménez, A","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",312,6

Educating specialist public health practitioners poses several challenges for educators, especially when low student, or appropriately qualified staff, numbers threaten viability of courses within individual universities. One solution is teaching programmes delivered through interuniversity collaborations. This study examines the features of two comparative case studies to explore how these correlate with barriers and enablers to sustainability. Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of social fields is then utilised to explore the impacts of external influences on interuniversity collaborations that determine their autonomy. A correlation between the purpose, membership, structure and leadership of specialised teaching collaborations and the mechanisms determining their autonomy is revealed and a model for achieving autonomy of interuniversity collaborations is outlined. Finally, a need to expand the use of collaborative specialist public health teaching programmes based on specialty disciplines is discussed.

Some institutions have started to treat these patients showing encouraging results. To shorten procedure times is crucial for the comfort of symptomatic patients receiving respiratory support and to optimize institutional facilities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At our institution, LD-RT is offered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and signs of early cytokine-released syndrome on behalf of a multicenter study. We designed a coordinated process flow starting from the patient transfer to the simulation CT-scan (first-step), to the end of the LD-RT treatment (last step). The times spent on each step of the process flow were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of treated patients was 83 (72-91) years-old. The timing parameters of the first 10 consecutive patients were analyzed. Except for the first (dummy run), patients were managed from the first to the last step in a median of 38 min (25-58, SD 10.67). The most time-consuming sub-process was the contouring of the treatment volumes and dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: LD-RT is not only an encouraging option for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, but a convenient and feasible procedure if performed in a coordinated way by reducing procedure times.","Bonet, M; Vázquez, S; García, E; Visus, M; Jové, D; Ripol, O; Solé, C; Gutiérrez, L; Morales-Rull, J L; Montero, Á; Algara, M; Arenas, M; Mira, M",Clin. transl. oncol.

A total of 14 health centers with different levels of care complexity provide care to patients in the region. The information of each patient with COVID-19 evaluated by SN, was incorporated in an Epidemiological Dashboard. The investigation was designed and reported with consideration of observational studies in epidemiology. We describe the hospitals presentation and care of persons who required SN response and were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. From April 8, 2020, to August 18, 2020, were included 1495 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in SN. A total of 58% patients were men, and the mean age (SD) was 48.9 (15.59) years. Eighty one percent patients with pre-existing diseases, most frequent hypertension and diabetes, but hypertension, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease presented higher risk. A total of 13% were hospitalized in Intensive Therapy Unit. The mortality of the cohort was 9.77%. Mortality was higher for patients aged 65 or more (OR 5.09), and for those had some pre-existing disease (OR 2.61). Our observations are consistent with reports demonstrating older persons, and those with comorbidities have the highest risk of mortality related to COVID-19. However, unlike other reports from developed or some developing countries, the mortality in our study is lower. This finding may be related to age of our cohort is younger than other published.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. ISAAC Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific IgE tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty-one (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR ), recurrent wheezing, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma was 10.3%, 5.5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. While having asthma ± AR, AD, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization due to COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to be decreased risk of hospitalization (OR: 0.191, 95% CI: 0.047-0.779, p = 0.021). Spirometry tests revealed a higher FEV1/FVC ratio and a PEF reversibility in hospitalized patients compared to nonhospitalized ones (p = 0.023 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthma and allergic diseases do not appear to be risk factors for hospitalization due to COVID-19 in children, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect. Pulmonary function testing seems to be important for monitoring lung damage following COVID-19.","Beken, Burcin; Ozturk, Gokcen Kartal; Aygun, Fatma Deniz; Aydogmus, Cigdem; Akar, Himmet Haluk",,312,6

Identifying patients with a higher probability of infection becomes crucial in settings with limited access to testing. We developed a prediction instrument to assess the likelihood of a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, based solely on clinical variables that can be determined within the time frame of an emergency department (ED) patient encounter. METHODS: We derived and prospectively validated a model to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in patients visiting the ED with symptoms consistent with the disease. RESULTS: Our model was based on 617 ED visits. In the derivation cohort, the median age was 36 years, 43% were men, and 9% had a positive result. The median time to testing from the onset of initial symptoms was four days (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-5 days, range 0-23 days), and 91% of all patients were discharged home. The final model based on a multivariable logistic regression included a history of close contact (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-4.7); fever (AOR 3.63, 95% CI, 1.931-6.85); anosmia or dysgeusia (AOR 9.7, 95% CI, 2.72-34.5); headache (AOR 1.95, 95% CI, 1.06-3.58), myalgia (AOR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.39-4.89); and dry cough (AOR 1.93, 95% CI, 1.02-3.64). The area under the curve (AUC) from the derivation cohort was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.85) and AUC 0.7 (95% CI, 0.61-0.75) in the validation cohort (N = 379). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a clinical tool to predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in patients presenting to the ED to assist with patient disposition in environments where COVID-19 tests or timely results are not readily available.","Lara, Barbara A; Torres, Francisco; Holger, Patricia; Perales, Claudia; Basauri, Sofia; Clausdorff, Hans; Escobedo, Ernesto; Saldias, Fernando; Swadron, Stuart; Aguilera, Pablo",West J Emerg Med,312,16

Using direct RNA sequencing, we decipher the extent of poly(A) tail dynamics in yeast defective in all relevant exonucleases, deadenylases, and poly(A) polymerases. Predominantly ncRNA poly(A) tails are 20-60 adenosines long. Poly(A) tails of newly transcribed mRNAs are 50 adenosine long on average, with an upper limit of 200. Exonucleolysis by Trf5-assisted nuclear exosome and cytoplasmic deadenylases trim the tails to 40 adenosines on average. Surprisingly, PAN2/3 and CCR4-NOT deadenylase complexes have a large pool of non-overlapping substrates mainly defined by expression level.

Manganese (Mn) is capable of inducing IFN production, but its applications are limited by nonspecific distributions and neurotoxicity. Here, we exploit chemical engineering strategy to fabricate a nanodepot of manganese (nanoMn) based on Mn2+. Compared with free Mn2+, nanoMn enhances cellular uptake and persistent release of Mn2+ in a pH-sensitive manner, thus strengthening IFN response and eliciting broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. Preferentially phagocytosed by macrophages, nanoMn promotes M1 macrophage polarization and recruits monocytes into inflammatory foci, eventually augmenting antiviral immunity and ameliorating coronavirus-induced tissue damage. Besides, nanoMn can also potentiate the development of virus-specific memory T cells and host adaptive immunity through facilitating antigen presentation, suggesting its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations uncover that nanoMn treatment hardly induces neuroinflammation through limiting neuronal accumulation of manganese. Therefore, nanoMn offers a simple, safe, and robust nanoparticle-based strategy against coronavirus.

Symptoms caused by these three viruses are extremely similar, including acute diarrhea, vomiting and even death in piglets. To date, strict biosecurity is still the most effective disease prevention and control measures, and the early detection of pathogens is the most important link. Here, we developed a microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system for the first time, which could detected PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV simultaneously, and had advantages of rapid, simple, sensitive, high-throughput, and accurate at point-of-care settings. The lowest detection limits of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip method are 101 copies/µL, 102 copies/µL and 102 copies/µL for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively. The whole detection procedure can be finished rapidly in 40 min without any cross-reaction with other common swine viruses. A total of 173 clinical swine fecal samples characterized with diarrheal symptoms were used to evaluate the performance of the newly developed system, which presented good stabilities (C.V.s<5%) and specificities (100%), and possessed sensitivities of 92.24%, 92.19% and 91.23% for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV respectively. In summary, the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system could satisfy the demanding in field diagnoses, which was suitable for promotion in remote areas due to its fast, portable and cost-effective characters.","Zhou, Ling; Chen, Yonghui; Fang, Xueen; Liu, Yanhong; Du, Mengkan; Lu, Xiandong; Li, Qianniu; Sun, Yuan; Ma, Jingyun; Lan, Tian",Anal Chim Acta,312,20

Using a global federated research network, the objectives were to determine: 1) if COVID-19 is associated with 30-day thromboembolic events and mortality for people with dementia receiving antipsychotic medications; and 2) if the proportion of people with dementia receiving antipsychotics is higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX, a global federated health research network. The network was searched for people aged &#8805;â¯65 years with dementia, COVID-19 and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days prior to COVID-19 recorded in electronic medical records between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020. These individuals were compared to historical controls from 2019 with dementia and use of antipsychotics in the 30-days before a visit to a participating healthcare organisation. Propensity score matching for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants was used to balance cohorts with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Within the TriNetX network, 8414 individuals with COVID-19, dementia and use of antipsychotics and 31,963 historical controls were identified. After propensity score matching there were 8396 individuals with COVID-19 and 8396 historical controls. The cohorts were well balanced for age, sex, race, co-morbidities and use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants. The odds of 30-day thromboembolic events and all-cause mortality were significantly higher in adults with COVID-19 (Odds Ratios: 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.52) and 1.93 (1.71-2.17), respectively). The number of people with dementia with a visit to a participating healthcare organisation was lower between 20/01/2020 and 05/12/2020 (nâ¯=â¯165,447) compared to the same period in 2019 (nâ¯=â¯217,391), but the proportion receiving antipsychotics increased from 14.7% (95%CI: 14.6-14.9%) to 16.4% (95%CI: 16.2-16.5%), Pâ¯<â¯.0001.

METHODS: APA PsycINFO; Cochrane; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); EBSCOhost; EMBASE; Google Scholar; MEDLINE; ProQuest Medical; ScienceDirect; Scopus; and Web of Science from 01 November 2019 to 05 July 2020. Additionally, four preprints servers (medRxiv.org; Preprints.org; psyarxiv.com; arXiv.org; biorxiv.org) were also searched for papers accepted after peer-review but not yet published and indexed. There was no language restriction. The random-effect models meta-analysis model were used with the DerSimonian and Laird methodology. RESULTS: Forty-four papers, involving a total of 54,231 participants from 13 countries, were judged relevant and contributed to the systematic review and meta-analysis of sleep problems during COVID-19. The global pooled prevalence rate of sleep problems among all populations was 35.7% [95%CI 29.4-42.4%]. COVID-19 patients appeared to be the most affected group, with a pooled rate of 74.8% [95%CI 28.7-95.6%]. Healthcare workers and the general population had comparative rates of sleep problems with rates of 36.0% [95%CI 21.1-54.2%] and 32.3% [95%CI 25.3-40.2%], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic is high and approximately affect 40% of people from the general and healthcare populations. COVID-19 active patients appeared to have higher prevalence rates of sleep problems.","Jahrami, Haitham; BaHammam, Ahmed S; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Saif, Zahra; Faris, MoezAlIslam; Vitiello, Michael V",J. clin. sleep med,312,20

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved in a cohort of 146 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Potential risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: On admission, lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, eosinophils, and albumin and pre-albumin were dramatically lower, whereas neutrophils, and interleukin (IL)-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were significantly higher in severe cases. By the second week after discharge, all variables improved to normal levels. Covariate logistic regression results showed that the CD8+ cell count and CRP level were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lower peripheral immune cell subsets in patients with severe disease recovered to normal levels as early as the second week after discharge. CD8+ T cell counts and CRP levels on admission are independent predictive factors for severe COVID-19.","Jin, Xiao-Hong; Zhou, Hui-Li; Chen, Ling-Ling; Wang, Guan-Fu; Han, Qiu-Yue; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Chen, Qiong-Yuan; Ye, Yao-Han; Lin, Aifen; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Immunol,312,16

Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic's psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult's psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. AIM: To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. RESULTS: Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults' ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.","Parlapani, Eleni; Holeva, Vasiliki; Nikopoulou, Vasiliki Aliki; Kaprinis, Stergios; Nouskas, Ioannis; Diakogiannis, Ioannis",Aging Clin Exp Res,312,5

However, these materials mostly emit in the blue or green region, in which preparation of materials with long-wavelength (especially near-infrared) emission is still a great challenge. In this work, it is found that 2-(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate (DMA) and itaconic anhydride (ITA) undergo a ring-opening reaction at room temperature, and subsequently generate zwitterionic compound (IDMA). Based on the clustering-triggered emission (CTE) mechanism, ionic bond can effectively promote the isolated electron-rich chromophores to form new emissive clusters with extended electron delocalization. Herein, two oligomers (P1 and P2) with different fluorescence emissions by controlling the concentration of zwitterionic monomers before polymerization are synthesized. It is worth noting that the maximum emission wavelength of P2 at high concentration is up to 712 nm, which is very rare in previous reports. In addition, the resulting oligomer (P2) shows typical aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE), excitation-dependent fluorescence, temperature-sensitive emission, and solvatochromism. The cytotoxicity assay demonstrates that P2 was low toxic to Huh7 and LM3 cells, and suitable for cell imaging. This research provides the possibility for rational molecular design and the feasibility of luminescence regulation.","Huang, Qing; Cheng, Jiaqi; Tang, Yuran; Wu, Yongqiong; Xia, Dan; Zheng, Yuchen; Guo, Mingming",Macromol Rapid Commun,312,23

Data were collected between 24 August 2020 and 8 September 2020 through an online survey. A total of 4131 responses were included; mean age of respondents was 35 years (standard deviation: 11.5); 68.4% were females; 71% had elementary or secondary school education. One fourth (24.1%) were convinced that COVID-19 did not exist. Overall, 2310 (55.9%) indicated they were willing to be vaccinated. In a multivariable regression model, belonging to the middle and high-income category (OR = 1.85, CI: 1.46-2.35 and OR = 2.91, CI: 2.15-3.93, respectively), being tested for COVID-19 (OR = 4.71, CI: 3.62-6.12; p < 0.001), COVID-19 community vaccine acceptance (OR = 14.45, CI: 2.91-71.65; p = 0.001) and acknowledging the existence of COVID-19 (OR = 6.04, CI: 4.42-8.23; p < 0.001) were associated with an increased willingness to be vaccinated. Being a healthcare worker was associated with a decreased willingness for vaccination (OR = 0.46, CI: 0.36-0.58; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the current willingness for COVID-19 vaccination among citizens of the DRC is too low to dramatically decrease community transmission. Of great concern is the low intention of immunization among healthcare workers.

Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand, and then further assist in providing decision-making support for rerouting the vehicles as per travel restrictions in areas.

As lockdowns were implemented, the significant changes caused by these restrictions brought a dramatic improvement in air quality in metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles (LA Basin).Methods: We use real-time data from The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the California Department of Transportation to evaluate the drivers of the pollution sources. We also mapped monthly spatial variations and constructed hourly heatmaps of those pollutants in 2020 to understand the impacts of the lockdown on different locations and times of day in the LA Basin. Results: Compared to the same dates in 2019, traffic flow on highways in the Los Angeles Basin dropped by 20.86 % when the stay at home order was initiated and it continued to decrease along with dramatic declines in NO2, CO, and PM2.5. The correlation (Pierson r) between truck flow change and changes of NO2, CO, and PM2.5 is statistically significant. Conclusion: The declines in truck flow are mainly responsible for the drop of NO2 and CO, with traffic having a slightly smaller effect on PM2.5. The lockdowns provided a large-scale experiment into air quality research. The result of this research would provide an important reference for the policy markers regarding truck management in light of air quality control to prepare for the 2028 Summer Olympics in LA.","Yang, Jiani; Wang, Yuan; Pinto, Joseph; Kuai, Le; Li, King-Fai; Sander, Stanley P; Yung, Yuk L",,312,14

A rapid testing mechanism is a primary obstacle to controlling the spread of COVID-19. Current tests focus on the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The PCR test takes around 4-6 h to identify COVID-19 patients. Various research has recommended AI-based models leveraging machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to classify COVID-19 and non-COVID patients from chest X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan images. However, no model can be claimed as a standard since models use different datasets. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning models are widely used for image analysis to diagnose and classify various diseases. In this research, we develop a CNN-based diagnostic model to detect COVID-19 patients by analyzing the features in CT scan images. This research considered a publicly available CT scan dataset and fed it into the proposed CNN model to classify COVID-19 infected patients. The model achieved 99.76%, 96.10%, and 96% accuracy in training, validation, and test phases, respectively. It achieved scores of 0.986 in area under curve (AUC) and 0.99 in the precision-recall curve (PRC). We compared the model's performance to that of three state-of-the-art pretrained models (MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and Xception). The results show that the model can be used as a diagnostic tool for digital healthcare, particularly in COVID-19 chest CT image classification.","Masud, M.; Alshehri, M.

The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID-19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the 'cytokine storm' induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow®, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow® contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.","O039,; Kennedy, Niamh; Duttaroy, Asim K",Med Hypotheses,312,24

Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. Results: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. Conclusions: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients. These findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective, adequately powered studies.","Macaya, Fernando; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Valls, Adrián; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; González Del Castillo, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, F Javier; Runkle, Isabelle; Rubio Herrera, Miguel Ángel",Nutr Hosp,312,16

All the patients who were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection were admitted from February 19 with the nasopharyngeal swabs collected outside the hospital before admission. (1) Thirty-four swabbing operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who applied the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method+ protective face screen group (15 males and 1 female, aged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the East District of People's Hospital of Wuhan University) who applied the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years). In supine position method+ protective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and face turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10°. The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time for a single swab sample, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators in the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients (22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method+ protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs sampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically analyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected out of those 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in the process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients.

Data were statistically analyzed with t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) Compared with those of sitting position method group, the cooperation score of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method+ protective face screen group was significantly higher (Z=-4.928, P<0.01), the incidence of nausea, choking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators in supine position method+ protective face screen group were significantly lower (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P<0.01), and the operation time for a single swab sample in supine position method+ protective face screen group was significantly longer (t=223.17, P<0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method+ protective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting position method (&#967;(2)=4.432, P<0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method+ protective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position method (Z=-5.319, P<0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative to positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method+ protective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in addition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.","Ma, S Y; Luo, Y M; Hu, T Y; You, Z C; Sun, J G; Yu, S Y; Yuan, Z Q; Peng, Y Z; Luo, G X; Xu, Z",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,312,16

In some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, it has been reported that the nervous tissues and the eyes were also affected. However, evidence supporting that the retina is a target tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still lacking. This present study aimed to investigate whether ACE2 expression plays a role in human retinal neurons during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures derived from dissociated retinal organoids were generated. To validate the potential entry of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the retina, we showed that hiPSC-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures endogenously express ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) on the mRNA level. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in retinal organoids and monolayer cultures. Furthermore, using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus spike protein with GFP expression system, we found that retinal organoids and monolayer cultures can potentially be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Collectively, our findings highlighted the potential of iPSC-derived retinal organoids as the models for ACE2 receptor-based SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ahmad Mulyadi Lai, Henkie Isahwan; Chou, Shih-Jie; Chien, Yueh; Tsai, Ping-Hsing; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Hsu, Chih-Chien; Jheng, Ying-Chun; Wang, Mong-Lien; Chiou, Shih-Hwa; Chou, Yu-Bai; Hwang, De-Kuang; Lin, Tai-Chi; Chen, Shih-Jen; Yang, Yi-Ping",Int. j. mol. sci.

Closely monitoring public engagement and perceptions of COVID-19 and preventive measures using social media data could provide important information for understanding the progress of current interventions and planning future programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the public's behaviors and perceptions regarding COVID-19 and its effects on daily life during 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms were used to identify COVID-19-related and unrelated topics in over 300 million online data sources from June 15 to November 15, 2020. Posts in the sample were geotagged by NetBase, a third-party data provider, and sensitivity and positive predictive value were both calculated to validate the classification of posts. Each post may have included discussion of multiple topics. The prevalence of discussion regarding these topics was measured over this time period and compared to daily case rates in the United States. RESULTS: The final sample size included 9,065,733 posts, 70% of which were sourced from the United States. In October and November, discussion including mentions of COVID-19 and related health behaviors did not increase as it had from June to September, despite an increase in COVID-19 daily cases in the United States beginning in October. Additionally, discussion was more focused on daily life topics (n=6,210,255, 69%), compared with COVID-19 in general (n=3,390,139, 37%) and COVID-19 public health measures (n=1,836,200, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a decline in COVID-19-related social media discussion sourced mainly from the United States, even as COVID-19 cases in the United States increased to the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. Targeted public health messaging may be needed to ensure engagement in public health prevention measures as global vaccination efforts continue.","Massey, Daisy; Huang, Chenxi; Lu, Yuan; Cohen, Alina; Oren, Yahel; Moed, Tali; Matzner, Pini; Mahajan, Shiwani; Caraballo, César; Kumar, Navin; Xue, Yuchen; Ding, Qinglan; Dreyer, Rachel; Roy, Brita; Krumholz, Harlan",J Med Internet Res,312,16

Recent methods attempting to address this issue while respecting the ordinal structure of the labels have resorted to converting ordinal regression into a series of extended binary classification subtasks. However, the adoption of such methods remains inconsistent due to theoretical and practical limitations. Here we address these limitations by demonstrating that the subtask probabilities form a Markov chain. We show how to straightforwardly modify neural network architectures to exploit this fact and thereby constrain predictions to be universally rank consistent. We furthermore prove that all rank consistent solutions can be represented within this formulation. Using diverse benchmarks and the real-world application of a specialized recurrent neural network for COVID-19 prognosis, we demonstrate the practical superiority of this method versus the current state-of-the-art.

Coping with mental and physical stressors amidst the global lockdown is especially strenuous for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and more (LGBT+) community, who are frequently subjected to social stigma and minority stress. Systematic stigma and discrimination place LGBT+ individuals at higher risk for deleterious behaviors, such as substance abuse (e.g., injection drug use, smoking, alcohol) and risky sexual practices (e.g., anal/vaginal/oral sex). Maladaptive coping behaviors consequently increase the chances of HIV/AIDS risk among LGBT+ individuals, compared to heterosexual individuals. LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS perpetually face higher rates of unemployment, income disparity, and intimate partner violence. Prolonged home confinement, and impaired accessibility to healthcare, legal, and criminal justice services during lockdown may deplete the quality of life of LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is critical that multidisciplinary service providers, including health professionals, employers, social services providers, educational institutions and community organizations, move toward online service delivery, so that homebound HIV-positive LGBT+ individuals are secured with a wide range of care options. Non-judgemental, tele-counseling may bridge the gap to mental health services. Community clinics catering to HIV-positive and/or LGBT+ clients may consider precociously supplying essential amenities, such as Preexposure (PrEP)/postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), condoms, emergency contraception, and sterile needles. Lastly, efforts directed at the sustenance of at-risk/HIV-positive LGBT+ health should persevere, even after the pandemic.","Tomar, A.; Spadine, M. N.; Graves-Boswell, T.; Wigfall, L.

METHODS: Admission chest CT-scans and clinical records of swab-negative patients, treated according to the COVID-19 protocol or deceased during hospitalization, were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists and two clinicians, respectively. RESULTS: Of 254 patients, 169 swab-confirmed cases and one patient without chest CT-scan were excluded. A total of 84 patients were eligible for the reliability study. Of these, 21 patients died during hospitalization; the remaining 63 underwent serological testing and were eligible for the accuracy evaluation.

METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model for capecitabine and its three metabolites was built. Typical parameter values, characteristics of random distributions, associated with parameters, and covariates impact were estimated. Area under the curve (AUC) were computed for 5-FU and compared with grades of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic modeling was based on data collected on the first treatment cycle. Toxicity was assessed on the two first treatment cycles. RESULTS: The study was conducted in 43 patients. The population pharmacokinetic model (a one-compartment model per compound) was able to capture the very complex absorption process of capecitabine. Statistically significant covariates were cytidine deaminase, alkaline phosphatase and dihydrouracilemia (UH2)/uracilemia (U) ratio. UH2/U ratio was the most significant covariate on 5-FU elimination and CDA on the transformation of 5'-DFCR in 5'-DFUR. A trend was observed between 5-FU AUC and thrombopenia toxicity grades, but not with other toxicities. Best clinical response was not linked to systemic exposure of capecitabine metabolites. CONCLUSION: In our study, we propose a model able to describe, meanwhile, and its main metabolites, with a complex absorption process and inclusion of enzyme activity covariates such as CDA and UH2/U ratio.

It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","Solans, Oscar; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Roig Cabo, Pasqual; Mora, Núria; Coma, Ermengol; Bonet Simó, Josep Maria; Hermosilla Pérez, Eduardo; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Olmos Domínguez, Carmen; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi; Abizanda González, Mercè; López Seguí, Francesc",J Med Internet Res,312,11

What is needed now is head-to-head comparison of existing drugs, testing of safety including in the background of predisposing chronic diseases, and the development of new and targeted preventions and treatments. This is most efficiently achieved using representative animal models of primary infection including in the background of chronic disease with validation of findings in primary human cells and tissues.

Under certain atmospheric conditions culms can split longitudinally with detrimental effects on their appearance and structural integrity. Here we describe the first ever systematic study of this phenomenon. We tested culms of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys Pubescens), which had been commercially dried to a moisture content of 12.5%. Using a purpose-built environmental chamber, we measured the rate of splitting for ten different test conditions, varying temperature and humidity and testing samples with and without nodes. A 50% probability of splitting after one week was found to be associated with a reduction in moisture content to 8%. We found that splitting was mainly determined by a change in relative humidity, as opposed to absolute humidity. We hypothesised that splitting occurs owing to an incompatibility in shrinkage in the tangential direction during drying, creating tensile residual stress near the outer surface of the culm. Using data from the published literature we developed a simple theoretical model capable of predicting splitting. Higher residual stress was predicted near nodes, which was consistent with our finding that splitting rarely occurs in samples having no nodes. These findings will be useful in the prevention of splitting, through control of the environment or other protective measures.","Hone, Timothy; Cahill, Luke; Robinson, Anthony; Korde, Chaaruchandra; Taylor, David",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,312,26

Considering the severity of the disease and the lack of active treatments, 14 patients with Covid-19 and severe lung inflammation received inhaled adenosine in the attempt to therapeutically compensate for the oxygen-related loss of the endogenous adenosineâA2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-mediated mitigation of the lung-destructing inflammatory damage. This off label-treatment was based on preclinical studies in mice with LPS-induced ARDS, where inhaled adenosine/A2AR agonists protected oxygenated lungs from the deadly inflammatory damage. The treatment was allowed, considering that adenosine has several clinical applications. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: Fourteen consecutively enrolled patients with Covid19-related interstitial pneumonitis and PaO2/FiO2 ratio<300 received off-label-treatment with 9 mg inhaled adenosine every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and subsequently, every 24 days for the next 4 days. Fifty-two patients with analogue features and hospitalized between February and April 2020, who did not receive adenosine, were considered as a historical control group. Patients monitoring also included hemodynamic/hematochemical studies, CTscans, and SARS-CoV2-tests. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated with no hemodynamic change and one case of moderate bronchospasm. A significant increase (> 30%) in the PaO2/FiO2-ratio was reported in 13 out of 14 patients treated with adenosine compared with that observed in 7 out of52 patients in the control within 15 days. Additionally, we recorded a mean PaO2/FiO2-ratio increase (215 ± 45 vs. 464 ± 136, P = 0.0002) in patients receiving adenosine and no change in the control group (210±75 vs. 250±85 at 120 hours, P>0.05). A radiological response was demonstrated in 7 patients who received adenosine, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA load rapidly decreased in 13 cases within 7 days while no changes were recorded in the control group within 15 days. There was one Covid-19 related death in the experimental group and 11in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our short-term analysis suggests the overall safety and beneficial therapeutic effect of inhaled adenosine in patients with Covid-19-inflammatory lung disease suggesting further investigation in controlled clinical trials.","Correale, Pierpaolo; Caracciolo, Massimo; Bilotta, Federico; Conte, Marco; Cuzzola, Maria; Falcone, Carmela; Mangano, Carmelo; Falzea, Antonella Consuelo; Iuliano, Eleonora; Morabito, Antonella; Foti, Giuseppe; Armentano, Antonio; Caraglia, Michele; De Lorenzo, Antonino; Sitkovsky, Michail; Macheda, Sebastiano",PLoS One,312,13

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CMD for COVID-19. Method: A literature search was performed in six databases from injection to June 2020. Both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were considered as eligible. The quality of included RCTs were assessed by Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and Review Manager 5.3 software was used to do meta-analysis. Result: Eleven studies with 1259 patients were included in this study. CMD included herbal decoction and Chinese patent medicine. The methodological quality was evaluated as generally unclear.

This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. METHOD: The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. RESULTS: The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.","Tang, Wanjie; Hu, Tao; Hu, Baodi; Jin, Chunhan; Wang, Gang; Xie, Chao; Chen, Sen; Xu, Jiuping",J Affect Disord,312,2

It is unknown how public interest and demand for total knee arthroplasties was affected. Public interest in knee pain, knee osteoarthritis and knee arthroplasty in Germany and the UK was investigated using Google Trend Analysis. In addition, we monitored for changes in patient composition in our outpatient department. As of early March in Germany and of late March in the UK, until the lockdown measures, a 50 to 60% decrease in relative search frequency was observed in all categories investigated compared to the beginning of the year. While public interest for knee pain rapidly recovered, decreased interest for knee osteoarthritis and replacement lasted until the easing of measures. Shortly prior to and during the first lockdown mean search frequency for knee replacement was significantly decreased from 39.7% and 36.6 to 26.9% in Germany and from 47.7% and 50.9 to 23.7% in the UK (Germany: p = 0.022 prior to lockdown, p < 0.001 during lockdown; UK: p < 0.0001 prior to and during lockdown). In contrast, mean search frequencies did not differ significantly from each other for any of the investigated time frames during the second half of 2020 in both countries. Similarly, during the first lockdown, the proportion of patients presenting themselves to receive primary knee arthroplasty compared to patients that had already undergone knee replacement declined markedly from 64.7% to 46.9%. In contrast, patient composition changed only marginally during the lockdown measures in late 2020 in both Germany and the UK. We observed a high level of public interest in knee arthroplasty despite the ongoing pandemic. The absence of a lasting decline in interest in primary knee arthroplasty suggests that sufficient symptom reduction cannot be achieved without surgical care for a substantial number of patients.","Kienzle, Arne; Biedermann, Lara; Babeyko, Evgeniya; Kirschbaum, Stephanie; Duda, Georg; Perka, Carsten; Gwinner, Clemens",,312,6

METHODS: We analyzed repeated cross-sectional data from the Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trend Survey (FHInTS) in 2016 (N = 4036) and 2017 (N = 4051) and the COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHInS) in April 9-23, 2020 (N = 1501) using population-based random samples of general adults by landline telephone and online panel. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4), anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorders 2), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), subjective happiness (4-point Likert item), and sociodemographic factors were collected. RESULTS: Compared with 2016 and 2017, the stress level increased by 28.3%, prevalence of anxiety increased by 42.3%, and the depression symptoms and unhappiness have doubled (all P for trends <0.001) during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Atopy and food anaphylaxis disease states require improved characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. To provide the first such characterization, we assessed serum samples of a highly atopic, food anaphylactic, asymptomatic pediatric cohort from across the US during the height of the pandemic. From our biobank, 172 pediatric patient serum samples were characterized specific to atopic, food anaphylactic, and immunologic markers in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, from 1 February to 20 April 2020. Clinical and demographic data were further analyzed in addition to sample analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were positive in six patients (4%). Nearly half of the pediatric patients had a history of asthma (49%). Total IgE, total IgG, and IgG1-3 were similar in those positive and negative to SARS-CoV-2. Median total IgG4 in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was nearly three times (p-value = 0.02) that of the negative group. Atopy controller medications did not confer additional benefit. Our data suggest that food anaphylaxis and highly atopic children are not at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. This specific population appears either at equal or potentially less risk than the general population. Total and specific IgG4 may be a novel predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk specific to the allergic pediatric population.","Marsteller, Nathan L.; Fregoso, Diana J.; Morphew, Tricia L.; Randhawa, Inderpal S.",Antibodies,312,16

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions.","Nadeem, Muhammad Shahid; Zamzami, Mazin A; Choudhry, Hani; Murtaza, Bibi Nazia; Kazmi, Imran; Ahmad, Habib; Shakoori, Abdul Rauf",,312,16

Understanding the viral transmission and impeding the replication process within human cells are considered as the vital point to control and overcome COVID-19 infection. Non-structural Protein 1, one among the proteins initially produced upon viral entry into human cells, instantly binds with the human ribosome and inhibit the host translation process by preventing the mRNA attachment. However, the formation of NSP1 bound Ribosome complex does not affect the viral replication process. NSP1 plays an indispensable role in modulating the host gene expression and completely steals the host cellular machinery. The full-length structure of NSP1 is essential for the activity in the host cell and importantly the loop connecting N and C-terminal domains are reported to play a role in ribosome binding. Due to the unavailability of the experimentally determined full-length structure of NSP1, we have modelled the complete structure using comparative modelling and the stability and conformational behaviour of the modelled structure was evaluated through molecular dynamics simulation. Interestingly, the present study reveals the significance of the inter motif loop to serves as a potential binding site for drug discovery experiments. Further, we have screened the phytochemicals from medicinal plant sources since they were used for several hundred years that minimizes the traditional drug development time. Among the 5638 phytochemicals screened against the functionally associated binding site of NSP1, the best five phytochemicals shown high docking score of -9.63 to -8.75 kcal/mol were further evaluated through molecular dynamics simulations to understand the binding affinity and stability of the complex. Prime MM-GBSA analysis gave the relative binding free energies for the top five compounds (dihydromyricetin, 10-demethylcephaeline, dihydroquercetin, pseudolycorine and tricetin) in the range of -45.17 kcal/mol to -37.23 kcal/mol, indicating its binding efficacy in the predicted binding site of NSP1. The density functional theory calculations were performed for the selected five phytochemicals to determine the complex stability and chemical reactivity. Thus, the identified phytochemicals could further be used as effective anti-viral agents to overcome COVID-19 and as well as several other viral infections.","Prabhu, Dhamodharan; Rajamanikandan, Sundaraj; Sureshan, Muthusamy; Jeyakanthan, Jeyaraman; Saraboji, Kadhirvel",J Mol Graph Model,312,1

The current analytical methods for the quantification of sunscreen are mostly specific to individual chemical ingredients and based on complex analytical and instrumental techniques. A simple, selective, rapid, reproducible and low-cost spectrophotometric procedure for the quantification of commercial sunscreen in seawater is described here. The method is based on the inherent properties of these cosmetics to absorb in the wavelength of 300-400 nm. The absorption at 303 nm wavelength correlates with the concentration of most commercial sunscreens. This method allows the determination of sunscreens in the range of 2.5-1500 mg L-1, it requires no sample pretreatment and offers a precision of up to 0.2%. The spectrophotometric method was applied to quantify sunscreen concentrations at an Atlantic Beach with values ranging from 10 to 96.7 mg L-1 in the unfiltered fraction and from the undetectable value to 75.7 mg L-1 in the dissolved fraction. This method is suggested as a tool for sunscreen quantifications in environmental investigations and monitoring programs.","Tovar-Sánchez, Antonio; Sparaventi, Erica; Gaudron, Amandine; Rodríguez-Romero, Araceli",PLoS One,312,29

Nevertheless, Weber's understanding of everyday action is closely related to the various religious interpretations of what deprivations were suffered by humanity as a consequence of Adam's original sin and the paradisiacal yearning for salvation it engenders. Moreover, Weber's interpretation of the Fall is characteristic for his tragic sociology in the sense that it guarantees the freedom to subjectively create self-conscious meaning that is, however, no longer embedded in a context of common knowledge. His solution to this epistemological problem involves a Nietzschean heroic existentialism whereby individuals give personality to one's character by freely choosing their own values. Yet, he also realizes that many will not be able to choose by themselves and, therefore, will be attracted by charismatic leaders that can invoke a paradisiacal community of choice. Weber's modern antinomical interpretation of the Fall is still relevant today because it provides insight in the epistemological underpinnings of the contemporary populist Zeitgeist.","Thijssen, Peter",Br. j. sociol,312,16

In a professional setting, particularly in health caredepartments during the COVID-19 pandemic, empathy becomes a necessary tool in the care of patients. During theCOVID-19 pandemic, a new wave of stress, anxiety and fear has been experienced by all patients, which posesnew challenges for health care professionals who work closely with patients on a daily basis. Here, we discuss theimportance of empathy training of nuclear medicine technologists, and how we can better improve the experienceand care of our patients through methods which implement empathy in the nuclear medicine department. Methods: There are three components of empathy: cognitive, affective and behavioral. Cognitive refers to the abilityto view the perspective of others;in other words, putting oneself in another's shoes. The affective component refers to experiencing the feelings of others. The behavioral component involves communication to reflect understandingof another's feelings;therefore, it must be perceived that one person understands another in a meaningful way. Inempathy training, not all components are necessary to master in order to express empathy. Empathy can still beexperienced by patients even if only one of the components are met. Empathy training is effective and can beenhanced through didactic training and experiential techniques, whereby the student gains insight and educationabout empathy through lectures on empathy theories, followed by experience, whether simulated or in the form of agame. Skill training is another effective method, whereby students are given a list of skills to learn, the skills aremodeled for the students, and finally the students practice performing such skills. Results: Nuclear medicine technologists should actively practice empathy in the workplace, which involves theaction of active listening, framing, reflecting back to the patient, identifying emotions, and looking for feedback.Patients who interact with empathetic medical professionals feel understood, respected, and validated. Thispromotes patient satisfaction, enhances the quantity and quality of clinical data, improves adherence, and fostersbetter relationships. Conclusions: Empathy training is an essential and necessary component to the training ofhealth care professionals, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are scared and anxious, and usingempathy training to our advantage may help alleviate these fears in our patients during such a difficult time. Byimplementing empathy training techniques, technologists will be better able to make patients comfortable and lessenfears during imaging.","Monteparo, I.; Kohanzad, S.; Meshekow, J.; Sonke, P.

Here, we demonstrate that by using a membrane targeted genetic calcium sensor, we can measure quantal synaptic events at the individual synaptic sites of Aplysia sensory neuron to motor neuron synaptic connections. These results show that synaptic strength is not evenly distributed between all contacts in these cultures, but dominated by multiquantal sites of synaptic contact, likely clusters of individual synaptic sites. Surprisingly, most synaptic contacts were not found opposite presynaptic varicosities, but instead at areas of pre- and postsynaptic contact with no visible thickening of membranes. The release probability, quantal size, and quantal content can be measured over days at individual synaptic contacts using this technique. Homosynaptic depression was accompanied by a reduction in release site probability, with no evidence of individual synaptic site silencing over the course of depression. This technique shows promise in being able to address outstanding questions in this system, including determining the synaptic changes that maintain long-term alterations in synaptic strength that underlie memory.","Dunn, Tyler W; Sossin, Wayne S",Learn Mem,312,20

In Nigeria, as of 21st April 2020, 668 confirmed cases, 22 deaths and 188 recoveries have been reported. Police officers are at the forefront of enforcing advisories to ensure public compliance. However, there is a paucity of data on knowledge, risk perception, and adherence to COVID-19 advisories issued by the Health authorities particularly among the police officers. We, therefore, assessed the knowledge, risk perceptions and adherence to NCDC recommended advisory on COVID-19. Methods: we conducted a two-stage sampling cross-sectional study among different cadres of police officers in Benue State, Nigeria using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. The results of the study were presented in frequencies and proportions. Chi-square test was used for an association between variables at p-value < 0.05. Results: the mean age of the 305 participants was 39.1 ± 8.4 years and most, 124 (40.7%) of the participants were within age-group 30-39 years, 19 (64.3%.8) were male, 250 (82.0%) were married and 160 (52.5%) had secondary education as the highest qualification. Majority of the participants, 301 (98.7%) have heard about COVID-19 and the commonest source of information was via television/radio, 230 (76.4%). Most participants demonstrate a good knowledge of COVID-19 infection, 302 (99.0%) and positive risk perception of COVID-19, 303 (99.3%) but few demonstrated good adherences on COVID-19 prevention practices, 133 (43.6%). Participants' academic qualification (X2 = 10.98, p = 0.001) and cadre (X2 = 112.5, p = 0.001) were found to be associated with good adherence. Conclusion: while most participants had a good knowledge of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, and positive risk perception about COVID-19, good adherence to public health advisories were low. We recommended periodic training, provision of adequate PPE and personal hand-sanitizers as a strategy to improve adherence.","Okon, Ubong Akpan; Onche, Christiana; Ajisegiri, Simeon Whenayon; Katchy, Uche; Onyema, Peter; Uwazie, Charles; Anastasia, Isika; Abdullahi, Araga; Balogun, Muhammad Shakir",Pan Afr Med J,312,33

Objective: The objective of this study is to estimate the nonparticipation rates among FSWs and its effect on the observed HIV prevalence rate during HSS-2017. Methods: The data were collected from FSW sentinel sites located in the states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (Central Zone). The HIV positivity rate among FSWs who participated in HSS-2017 was compared with the HIV positivity rate of those who did not participate. HIV status of the participants was obtained from HSS-2017 data. The master list of participating targeted intervention sites was accessed to obtain the last known HIV status of the eligible nonparticipants. Results: Nonparticipation rate of FSWs from the central zone during HSS2017 was 10.8%. The HIV positivity rate among nonparticipant FSW was four times and six times higher in Delhi and UP, respectively.

The current study aims to investigate the acute and long-term effects of COVID-19 disease on (1) the desire for food, hunger, and satiety sensations;(2) smell, taste, and flavour perception;(3) meals and intake of food types;and (4) the frequency of commonly applied strategies to tackle potential changes in appetite and sensory perception. An online survey was conducted among Danish adults (n = 102) who had experienced changes in appetite, sensory perception, and/or food-related pleasure due to COVID-19 disease. Key results include appetite-altering effects at all times during the day when suffering from COVID-19 and often associated with impaired sensory function. Severe sensory perception alterations were found, namely, for the perception of taste, ageusia &gt; hypogeusia &gt; hypergeusia, and for the perception of smell, anosmia &gt; parosmia &gt; hyposmia &gt; hyperosmia. Eating behavioural changes included alteration in quantitative and qualitative aspects of intake.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 2015 to June 2016 to assess to assess the association of parents' health behaviors with children's vaccinations in Bialystok city, Poland. We used the the Inventory of Health Behaviours and an original questionnaire including demographic data and questions about vaccination. Three hundred parents were recruited from the Pro Medica Family Medica Center in Bialystok, Poland. RESULTS: Only 3.7% of respondents did not vaccinate their children. The level of health behaviours was average in 42.3% of the respondents, low in 33%, and high in 24.7%. Significant differences in health behaviours, mainly the level of normal eating habits (p = 0.038) and positive mental attitude (p = 0.022), were found in relation to views on the toxicity of vaccines. Participants who reported that vaccines can cause autism engaged in a higher level of prophylactic behaviours. Respondents who vaccinated their children with combined vaccines had a significantly higher level of health practices. CONCLUSIONS: Parents preferred health behaviours did not effect on children vaccination. Parents who believed in the toxicity of vaccines were more concerned about proper nutrition, had a positive mental attitude, and engaged in a higher level of preventive behaviours and health practices.

We report colonoscopy follow-up rates after a positive FIT overall and by population characteristics in the BeneFIT demonstration pilot, a Medicaid health insurance plan-delivered mailed FIT outreach program. METHODS: In 2016, 2 health insurance plans in Oregon and in Washington state mailed FIT kits to Medicaid patients who, based on claims data, were overdue for CRC screening. We report follow-up colonoscopy completion rates after positive FIT, and differences in completion rates by age, sex, race, ethnicity, preferred language, and number of primary care visits in the prior year. This research was human subjects approved with a waiver of consent for data collection. RESULTS: The FIT positivity rates in Health Plan Oregon and Health Plan Washington were 7.9% (39/488) and 14.6% (125/857), respectively. Colonoscopy completion rates within 12 months of the positive test were 35.9% (14/41) in Health Plan Oregon and 32.8% (41/125) in Health Plan Washington. Colonoscopy completion rates were higher among individuals who preferred a language other than English (Non-English speakers 70.0%, English speakers 31.3%, P = .04). CONCLUSION: In a health plan-delivered mailed FIT outreach program, follow-up colonoscopy rates after a positive test were low.

DESIGN: Mixed methods approach involving an online cross-sectional survey (conducted between 19th April and 11th May 2020) and semi-structured telephone interviews (conducted between 27th April and 27th May 2020). PARTICIPANTS: 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey respondents took part in follow-up interviews. RESULTS: The majority of survey respondents (85.7%) considered it important for their children to receive routine vaccinations on schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, several barriers to vaccination were identified. These included a lack of clarity around whether vaccination services were operating as usual, particularly amongst respondents from lower income households and those self-reporting as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity; difficulties in organising vaccination appointments; and fears around contracting COVID-19 while attending general practice. Concerns about catching COVID-19 while accessing general practice were weighed against concerns about children acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease if they did not receive scheduled routine childhood vaccinations. Many parents and guardians felt their child's risk of acquiring a vaccine-preventable disease was low as the implementation of stringent physical distancing measures (from March 23rd 2020) meant they were not mixing with others. CONCLUSION: To promote routine childhood vaccination uptake during the current COVID-19 outbreak, further waves of COVID-19 infection, and future pandemics, prompt and sustained national and general practice level communication is needed to raise awareness of vaccination service continuation and the importance of timely vaccination, and invitation-reminder systems for vaccination need to be maintained. To allay concerns about the safety of accessing general practice, practices should communicate the measures being implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Bell, Sadie; Clarke, Richard; Paterson, Pauline; Mounier-Jack, Sandra",PLoS One,312,1

Here, we designed a unique ""posture"" of rose Bengal (RB) on cotton-based super-adsorptive fibrous equipment, with RB being separately captured in the mesopores of porous organic polymers (POPs). The resultant daylight-induced biocidal cotton fabric with enhanced efficiency was named as DBwEE-Cotton. The enhanced biocidal activity of the DBwEE-Cotton was achieved based on two mechanisms: (1) the separation of RB in mesopores on the fabric avoids the aggregation-caused self-quenching;and (2) other than singlet oxygen generation, RB is forced to undergo type I photoreaction by surrounding the RB with massive amounts of good hydrogen donors (i.e., POP) under daylight irradiation. Given the enhanced production efficiency of reactive oxygen species by the DBwEE-Cotton, 99.9999% of E. coli and L. innocua bacteria were killed within 20 min of daylight exposure. The DBwEE-Cotton also presents excellent wash and light durability with no biocidal function loss. The development of DBwEE-Cotton provides a facile strategy of avoiding aggregation-caused self-quenching and modulating photoreactions of PS on a flexible substrate, which may guide the design of novel personal protective equipment (PPE) integrated with improved biocidal efficiency, wearability, and repeated and long-term applicability for protecting people from lethal infectious diseases.","Tang, P.

We set out to investigate if this was also true for injury-related ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP), we looked at 28 years of injury-related ED visits at the Montreal Children's Hospital, a provincially designated Pediatric Trauma Centre. We compared data from a two-month period during the COVID-19 lockdown (16 March to 15 May) to the same period in previous years (1993-2019) to determine whether the 2020 decrease in ED visit numbers was unprecedented (i.e. a similar decrease had never occurred) for different age groups, nature of injuries, mechanisms and severity. RESULTS: The 2020 decrease was unprecedented across all age groups between 1993 and 2019. When compared with the 2015 to 2019 average, the decrease was smallest in children aged 2 to 5 years (a 35% decrease), and greatest in the group aged 12 to 17 years (83%). Motor vehicle collisions and sports-related injuries practically vanished during the COVID-19 lockdown. Surprisingly, more children aged 6 to 17 years presented with less urgent injuries during the COVID-19 lockdown than in previous years. CONCLUSION: As was the case with SARS in 2003, COVID-19 acted as a deterrent for pediatric ED visits. The lockdown in particular had a profound impact on injury-related visits. The de-confinement period will be monitored to determine the impact in both the short and the long term.","Keays, Glenn; Friedman, Debbie; Gagnon, Isabelle",Health Promot. Chronic Dis. Prev.

The objective of the present study was to clarify further the clinical characteristics and blood parameters in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three suspected patients and 64 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection were admitted to a designated hospital. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 64 patients studied, 47 (73.4%) had been exposed to a confirmed source of COVID-19 transmission. On admission, the most common symptoms were fever (75%) and cough (76.6%). Twenty-eight (43.8%) COVID-19 patients showed leukopenia, 10 (15.6%) showed lymphopenia, 47 (73.4%) and 41 (64.1%) had elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), respectively, and 30 (46.9%) had increased fibrinogen concentration. After the treatment, the counts of white blood cells and platelets, and the level of prealbumin increased significantly, while aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and hsCRP decreased. COVID-19 patients with the hospital stay longer than 12 days had higher body mass index (BMI) and increased levels of AST, LDH, fibrinogen, hsCRP, and ESR. CONCLUSIONS: Results of blood tests have potential clinical value in COVID-19 patients.","An, Xu-Sheng; Li, Xiang-Yu; Shang, Fu-Tai; Yang, Shu-Feng; Zhao, Jun-Yan; Yang, Xiao-Zhong; Wang, Hong-Gang",Ann Clin Lab Sci,312,16

However, mechanistic proof that reducing pollution may be beneficial to prevent atherothrombotic events is limited. We aimed at appraising the impact of temporary traffic bans in a large metropolitan area on the risk of acute coronary syndromes. METHODS: Aggregate and anonymized data from 15 tertiary cardiac care centers were obtained detailing pre-coronarivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) daily cases of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Data on pollutants and climate were sought for the same days. Mixed level regression was used to compare the week before vs after the traffic ban (Fortnight analysis), the 3 days before vs after (Weekly analysis) and the Sunday before vs after (Sunday analysis). RESULTS: A total of 8 days of temporary traffic bans were included, occurring between 2017 and 2020, totaling 802 STEMI and 1196 NSTEMI in the Fortnight analysis, 382 STEMI and 585 in the Weekly analysis, and 148 STEMI and 210 NSTEMI in the Sunday analysis. Fortnight and Sunday analysis did not disclose a significant impact of traffic ban on STEMI or NSTEMI (all p>0.05). Conversely, Weekly analysis showed non-significant changes for STEMI but a significant decrease in daily NSTEMI when comparing the 3 days before the traffic ban with the ban day (p=0.043), as well as the 3 days before vs the 3 days after the ban (p=0.025). No statistically significant effect of traffic ban was found at Fortnight, Weekly or Sunday analyses for daily mean concentrations of benzene, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter (PM) <2.5 µm or PM <10 µm (all p>0.05). However, minimum daily concentrations showed a significant reduction of ozone during the ban in comparison to the week preceding it (p=0.034), nitric oxide during the ban in comparison to the 3 days preceding it (p=0.046), and an increase in benzene during the ban in comparison to the Sunday before (p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Temporary traffic ban may favorably reduce coronary atherothrombotic events, and in particular NSTEMI, even if not globally and immediately impacting on environmental pollution. Further controlled studies are required to confirm and expand this hypothesis-generating results.","Versaci, Francesco; Gaspardone, Achille; Danesi, Alessandro; Ferranti, Fabio; Mancone, Massimo; Mariano, Enrica; Rotolo, Francesco; Musto, Carmine; Proietti, Igino; Berni, Andrea; Trani, Carlo; Sergi, Sonia C; Speciale, Giulio; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Tomai, Fabrizio; Di Giosa, Alessandro; Marchegiani, Giada; Calcagno, Simone; Romagnoli, Enrico; Frati, Giacomo; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe",Panminerva med,312,16

Many institutions implemented a government-mandated restructured set of safety and administrative protocols to treat urgent orthopaedic trauma patients. The objective of this study was to compare two cohorts of patients, a COVID group and non-COVID control group, and to evaluate the effectiveness of safety measures outlined in the [Institution Name] Orthopaedic Trauma Patient Safety Protocol (******). Secondary outcomes were to elucidate risk factors for complications associated with fractures and COVID-19. Methods Patients treated for orthopaedic traumatic injuries were retrospectively identified between March and May 2020, and compared to a series of patients from the same time period in 2018. Main outcome measures included surgical site infections (SSI), length of stay (LOS), post-operative LOS (poLOS), presentation to OR time (PORT), and length of surgery. Results After review, 349 patients (201 non-COVID, 148 COVID) undergoing 426 surgeries were included. Average LOS (11.91 days vs. 9.27 days, p = 0.04), poLOS (9.68 days vs. 7.39 days, p = 0.03), and PORT (30.56 vs. 25.59 h, p &lt; 0.01) was significantly shorter in the COVID cohort. There were less SSI in the COVID group (5) compared to the non-COVID group (14) (p = 0.03). Overall complications were significantly lower in the COVID group. Patients receiving Cepheid tests had significantly shorter LOS and poLOS compared to patients receiving the RNA and DiaSorin tests (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The Cepheid test carried the best benefit-to-cost ratio, 0.10, p &lt; 0.05. Conclusion The restructuring of care protocols caused by COVID-19 did not negatively impact perioperative complication rates, PORT or LOS. Cepheid COVID test type administered upon admission plays an integral role in a patient's hospital course by reducing both length of stay and hospital costs. This information demonstrates we can continue to treat orthopaedic trauma patients safely during the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing strict safety protocols.","Batko, Brian D.; Hreha, Jeremy Potter James S.; Guinand, Luis Reilly Mark C.; Sirkin, Michael S.; Vosbikian, Michael M.; Adams, Mark R.",Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma,312,21

For instance, the enhancement of radiative heat transport that takes place by infra red or far infra red light at low temperature is due to diffractive propagation. The wavelength of light in this part of the spectrum usually lie in the range of mm to cms. Hence it can get bent across an obstacle while propagating forward. Apart from radiative, the convective and conductive processes also get affected due to appearance of non linearities in the modes of lattice vibrations and anomalies in material transport due to the appearance of vorticity and turbulence in the intervening media. The Multilayer insulation technique has offered a robust thermal protective mechanism to provide proper insulation to the cold walls of the cryostats from the heat of the surroundings. This work is focused on the estimation of performance and efficiency of the MLI technique as well as exploration of its versatile applicability. Three different spacer materials such as Dacron, Glass tissue, and Silk net with radiation shields are selected for the intervening medium in the present study. This article explores the thermal performance of MLI system by changing the physical parameters, varying the geometry of the radiation shields perforation styles of radiation shields and by analyzing the effect of arrangement of radiation shields on the conduction heat load. This analysis is concluded by studying the possibility of using MLI technique in the health sector by reducing the evaporation rate of liquid Oxygen during pandemic situations e.g. in COVID19.","Singh, D.; Singh, M.

We performed high-throughput sequencing on nine samples that were found to have a high concentration of viral RNA. We also assessed the potential impact that long-distance transport of samples to testing centres may have on sequencing results. Here, two samples that were similar in terms of viral RNA concentration but were transported from sites that are over 400 km apart were analyzed. All sequences were compared to previous sequences from Ghana and representative sequences from regions where our patients had previously travelled. Three complete genome sequences and another nearly complete genome sequence with 95.6% coverage were obtained. Sequences with coverage in excess of 80% were found to belong to three lineages, namely A, B.1 and B.2. Our sequences clustered in two different clades, with the majority falling within a clade composed of sequences from sub-Saharan Africa. Less RNA fragmentation was seen in sample KATH23, which was collected 9 km from the testing site, than in sample TTH6, which was collected and transported over a distance of 400 km to the testing site. The clustering of several sequences from sub-Saharan Africa suggests regional circulation of the viruses in the subregion. Importantly, there may be a need to decentralize testing sites and build more capacity across Africa to boost the sequencing output of the subregion.","Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; El-Duah, Philip; Owusu, Michael; Schneider, Julia; Yeboah, Richmond; Ayisi-Boateng, Nana Kwame; Gorman, Richmond; Adu, Eric; Kwarteng, Alexander; Frimpong, Michael; Binger, Tabea; Aryeetey, Sherihane; Asamoah, Jesse Addo; Amoako, Yaw Ampem; Amuasi, John Humphrey; Beheim-Schwarzbach, Jörn; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Obiri-Danso, Kwasi; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian; Phillips, Richard",Arch Virol,312,24

Mammalian genomes encode about 100 different DUBs, which can be grouped into seven different classes. Members of other DUB classes are found in pathogenic bacteria, which use them to target the host defense. By combining bioinformatical and experimental approaches, we address the question if the known DUB families have a common evolutionary ancestry and share conserved features that set them apart from other proteases. By systematically comparing family-specific hidden Markov models, we uncovered distant relationships between established DUBs and other cysteine protease families. Most DUB families share a conserved aromatic residue linked to the active site, which restricts the cleavage of substrates with side chains at the S2 position, corresponding to Gly-75 in ubiquitin. By applying these criteria to Legionella pneumophila ORFs, we identified lpg1621 and lpg1148 as deubiquitinases, characterized their cleavage specificities, and confirmed the importance of the aromatic gatekeeper motif for substrate selection.","Hermanns, Thomas; Woiwode, Ilka; Guerreiro, Ricardo Fm; Vogt, Robert; Lammers, Michael; Hofmann, Kay",,312,1

However, the clinical outcome and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we recruited 43 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We found that prolonged viral RNA shedding or recurrence mainly occurred in severe/critical patients (P<0.05). The average viral shedding time in severe/critical patients was more than 50 days, and up to 100 days in some patients, after symptom onset. However, chest computed tomography gradually improved and complete absorption occurred when SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was still positive, but specific antibodies appeared. Furthermore, the viral shedding time significantly decreased when the A1,430G or C12,473T mutation occurred (P<0.01 and FDR<0.01) and increased when G227A occurred (P<0.05 and FDR<0.05). High IL1R1, IL1R2, and TNFRSF21 expression in the host positively correlated with viral shedding time (P<0.05 and false discovery rate <0.05).

The aim of the study was to explore the self-reported future compliance of citizens with such measures and its relationship with potentially impactful psychological variables. Subjects and methods: An online survey was completed by 931 people (18-76 years) distributed across the Italian territory. In addition to demographics, five dimensions were measured: self-reported compliance with containment measures over time (today, at 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 180 days from now) at three hypothetical risk levels (10, 50, 90% of likelihood of contracting the COVID-19), perceived risk, generalized anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and relevance of several psychological needs whose satisfaction is currently precluded. Results: The mean compliance scores follow a hyperbolic-like curve, decreasing over time for the lowest level of risk (10%), whilst they tend to flatten for &#8805; 50% risk (90%). Significantly higher levels of anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and perceived risk were reported by women compared to men (p < 0.001 for each variable). Outdoor sports was the only need associated with the discounting rate of compliance (r s = - 0.08, p = 0.018). Conclusion: The duration of containment measures plays a crucial role in tackling the spread of the disease as people will be less compliant over time. Psychological needs of citizens impacting on the compliance should be taken into account when planning an easing of the lockdown, along with interventions for protecting vulnerable groups from mental distress.","Nese, Mattia; Riboli, Greta; Brighetti, Gianni; Sassi, Valentina; Camela, Elvira; Caselli, Gabriele; Sassaroli, Sandra; Borlimi, Rosita",Z Gesundh Wiss,312,22

Medical schools around the United States faced difficult decisions, temporarily suspending hospital-based clerkship rotations for medical students due to potential shortages of personal protective equipment and a need to social distance. This decision created a need for innovative, virtual learning opportunities to support undergraduate medical education. APPROACH: Educators at Yale School of Medicine developed a novel medical student curriculum converting high-fidelity, mannequin-based simulation into a fully online virtual telesimulation format. By using a virtual videoconferencing platform to deliver remote telesimulation as an immersive educational experience for widely dispersed students, this novel technology retains the experiential strengths of simulation-based learning while complying with needs for social distancing during the pandemic. The curriculum comprises simulated clinical scenarios that include live patient actors, facilitator interactions, and real-time assessment of vital signs, labs, and imaging. Each 90-minute session includes two sets of simulation scenarios and faculty-led teledebriefs. A team of three students performs the first scenario while an additional team of three students observes. Teams reverse roles for the second scenario. OUTCOMES: The six-week virtual telesimulation elective enrolled the maximum 48 medical students and covered core clinical clerkship content areas. Communication patterns within the virtual telesimulation format require more deliberate turn-taking than normal conversation. Using the chat function within the video-conferencing platform allowed teams to complete simultaneous tasks. A nurse confederate provided cues not available in the virtual telesimulation format. NEXT STEPS: Rapid dissemination of this program, including online webinars and live demonstration sessions with student volunteers, support the development of similar programs at other universities. Evaluation and process improvement efforts include planned qualitative evaluation of this new format to further understand and refine the learning experience. Future work is needed to evaluate clinical skill development in this educational modality.","Ray, Jessica M; Wong, Ambrose H; Yang, Thomas J; Buck, Samuel; Joseph, Melissa; Bonz, James W; Auerbach, Marc A; Couturier, Katherine; Tomassoni, Anthony J; Schwartz, Michael L; Evans, Leigh V",Acad. med,312,26

The most common infections that were associated with hyponatremia were viral and bacterial infections, including COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The etiology varied according to the infection site, setting and patient cohort it concerned. In several studies, hyponatremia was associated with prolonged hospitalization, worse outcomes, and higher mortality rates. Hyponatremia can also play a diagnostic role in differentiating pathogens that cause a certain infection type, as it was observed in community-acquired pneumonia. Although many mechanisms leading to hyponatremia have already been described, it is impossible with any certainty to ascribe the etiology of hyponatremia to any of them.","Królicka, Anna L; Kruczkowska, Adrianna; Krajewska, Magdalena; Kusztal, Mariusz A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),312,16

By public messaging, we are referring to a well-established evidence-driven method of disseminating information at scale that enables the public to take action to protect their health. Our project plan was upended by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-but we used the opportunity to conduct focus groups during the pandemic that, compared with focus groups conducted before the pandemic, provide an important portrait of public perceptions of serious illness care that can be used to design for greater public engagement. Our findings can be summarized in three observations. First, misunderstanding of ACP, PC, and hospice is wide ranging and deep. Second, COVID-19 evokes its own brand of confusion and ambivalence that is distinct from other serious illnesses. And third, distrust of the health care system has become the new normal. Despite these findings, our focus group participants strongly endorsed five messaging principles (1) talk up the benefits, (2) present choices for every step, (3) use stories that are positive and aspirational, (4) invite dialogue-more than once, and (5) invoke a new team-of people who matter, clinicians, medical institutions, and community organizations who are ready to help. After listening to 100-word stories describing real patient experiences with ACP, PC, and hospice, our focus group participants expressed interest and appreciation. But to improve public engagement broadly, we need to explain our work to the general public in a way that makes them want to know more.","Back, Anthony L; Grant, Marian S; McCabe, Patrick J",J. palliat. med,312,20

Weather components recently came to notice as the northern hemisphere was hit by escalated incidence in winter. This study investigated the association between COVID-19 cases and two components, average temperature and relative humidity, in the 16 states of Germany. Three main approaches were carried out in this study, namely temporal correlation, spatial auto-correlation, and clustering-integrated panel regression. It is claimed that the daily COVID-19 cases correlate negatively with the average temperature and positively with the average relative humidity. To extract the spatial auto-correlation, both global Moran's [Formula: see text] and global Geary's [Formula: see text] were used whereby no significant difference in the results was observed. It is evident that randomness overwhelms the spatial pattern in all the states for most of the observations, except in recent observations where either local clusters or dispersion occurred. This is further supported by Moran's scatter plot, where states' dynamics to and fro cold and hot spots are identified, rendering a traveling-related early warning system. A random-effects model was used in the sense of case-weather regression including incidence clustering. Our task is to perceive which ranges of the incidence that are well predicted by the existing weather components rather than seeing which ranges of the weather components predicting the incidence. The proposed clustering-integrated model associated with optimal barriers articulates the data well whereby weather components outperform lag incidence cases in the prediction. Practical implications based on marginal effects follow posterior to model diagnostics.","Ganegoda, Naleen Chaminda; Wijaya, Karunia Putra; Amadi, Miracle; Erandi, K K W Hasitha; Aldila, Dipo",Sci Rep,312,16

Other helpful conditions included: (1) a still quite well-equipped and decentralized public health system (which, before the crisis, was even criticized for having overcapacities) with comparatively good – though not ‘world-beating’ – testing and tracing abilities;(2) an exceptionally well-positioned state budget (‘schwarze Null’) throughout the last decade, allowing for financially powerful stimulus packages;as well as (3) the existence of crisis-proven mechanisms, in particular ‘Kurzarbeit’ (working short hours, up to 67%, whereby temporarily as much as 87% of the income is paid for by the federal government), which was later adopted in some form or other by many European countries. The source of this tension is the fact that the more jobs are classified as being essential for managing the pandemic (as, e.g., in health care, nursing homes, logistics, retailing, and transportation), the less workers are paid and the poorer are their working conditions, including fewer options for participation which, considering their added exposure to COVID-19, has become a bone of contention. Besides causing problems for global production and supply networks, this also reiterates an old observation: On a more positive note, the federal government was able to offer another huge economic stimulus package, building on already made decisions regarding temporarily subsidizing investments, and guaranteeing purchases in order to stimulate conversion processes and increase the local production of personal protection equipment, disinfectants, vaccines, and medical devices. [...]these stimuli allowed firms to retain their employees during the pandemic, and enabled workers to combine childcare and work – although often for lower wages.","Sydow, Jörg Helfen Markus Auschra Carolin",Management and Organization Review,312,8

With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coinfections, patients with TB are predisposed to getting COVID-19 disease. The severity of the disease coupled with drug resistance on the currently used drugs warrants for the search for alternative remedies from plants. Africa is rich with plant diversity with a promise as sources of drugs, one of which is Eichhornia crassipes. This work aimed at isolating a fatty acid and dock it to β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase for possible anti-TB drug development prospects using computational tools. (9z,12z)-Octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid was isolated from Eichhornia crassipes for the first time using chromatographic techniques and identified using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods (1H-NMR, COSY, HSQC, HMBC and 13C-NMR). The compound was then docked to β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KasA), an essential member of the b-ketoacyl synthases encoded in the M. tuberculosis genome in comparison with its co-crystalized ligand JSF-3285, also for the first time. (9z,12z)-Octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid interacted with only phenylalanine239 and proline201 while JSF-3285 interacted with proline201, glutamine120, alanine119, leucine116, glutamine199, histadine345, phenylalanine239, glycine240 and glycine200. (9z,12z)-Octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid had a ligand efficiency of 0.24, compared to the co-crystallized ligand's 0.36. The compound was too flexible and elongated with -4.72 KCalmol−1 binding energy. Despite some unfavourable physico-chemical properties, the compound still provides reliable interactions that only require logical structure modifications by the addition of polar regions among others to increase interactions and ligand efficiency, which can consequently stand to be a better potential drug lead. For the first time, plant-based (9z,12z)-Octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid isolated from Eichhornia crassipes was shown to interact fairly well with β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase and proved to be a potential scaffold from which anti-tubercular drugs can be designed.","Mtewa, Andrew G.; Bvunzawabaya, Jonathan T.; Ngwira, Kennedy J.; Lampiao, Fanuel Maghembe Reuben Okella Hedmon weisheit Anke Tolo Casim U.; Ogwang, Patrick E.; Sesaazi, Duncan C.",Scientific African,312,24

In this regard, the designing and proper implementation of RL, in addition to increasing the level of customer satisfaction, reduces inventory and transportation costs. In this paper, in order to minimize the costs associated with fixed costs, material flow costs, and the costs of building potential centres, a complex integer linear programming model for an integrated direct logistics and RL network design is presented. Due to the outbreak of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020 and the consequent increase in medical waste, the need for an inverse logistics system to manage waste is strongly felt. Also, due to the worldwide vaccination in the near future, this waste will increase even more and careful management must be done in this regard. For this purpose, the proposed RL model in the field of COVID-19 waste management and especially vaccine waste has been designed. The network consists of three parts - factory, consumers' and recycling centres - each of which has different sub-parts. Finally, the proposed model is solved using the cuckoo optimization algorithm, which is one of the newest and most powerful meta-heuristic algorithms, and the computational results are presented along with its sensitivity analysis.","Shadkam, Elham",Waste Manag Res,312,10

Since then, collection of CCP from COVID-19-recovered patients has been implemented in donor centers nationwide. Children's Hospital Colorado rapidly put into practice a CCP collection protocol, necessitating development and implementation of assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in CCP units. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 87 units of CCP collected from 36 donors over two to four sequential donations using both antigen-binding assays for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and spike antigens and a live virus focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50 ). RESULTS: Our data show that the majority of donors (83%) had a FRNT50 titer of at least 80, and 61% had a titer of at least 160, which met the FDA's criteria for acceptable CCP units. Additionally, our data indicate that analysis of antibodies to a single SARS-CoV-2 antigen is likely to miss a percentage of seroconverters; however, these individuals tend to have neutralizing antibody titers of less than 80. There was considerable variability in the short-term, sustained antibody response, measured by neutralizing antibody titers, among our donor population. CONCLUSION: The correlation of neutralizing activity and antigen-binding assays is necessary to qualify CCP for therapeutic use. Since SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels decline in a percentage of donors, and such a decline is not detectable by current qualitative assays implemented in many laboratories, robust, quantitative assays are necessary to evaluate CCP units best suited for therapeutic infusion in COVID-19 patients.","Annen, Kyle; Morrison, Thomas E; DomBourian, Melkon G; McCarthy, Mary K; Huey, Leah; Merkel, Patricia A; Andersen, Gillian; Schwartz, Eileen; Knight, Vijaya",Transfusion,312,1

This article aims to clarify whether technology-mediated presence or telepresence in online Masses is real and acceptable to the Roman Catholic Church especially during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. It argues that due to the lack of updating of its sacramental theology, which is still based on scholastic philosophy, Catholic theology continues to view physical presence as the only valid way of fulfilling religious obligation despite the growing influence of telepresence in religious life. If seen from a more sociological and holistic perspective, this article contends that telepresence in digital Eucharistic celebrations is real and not “artificial,” as participants lose awareness of their immediate surroundings and become one with Christ in the virtual celebration. It further argues that the validity of telepresence in the reception of the Eucharist should not be judged solely on a theological framework that was appropriate only during the medieval and Tridentine eras. Applying the actor-network theory, it ultimately claims that technological and human networks are inseparable in today's digital culture. Thus, the digital Eucharist is as real as participating in a physical Eucharist. The Catholic Church must therefore update and redefine its sacramental theology to better respond to the needs of the times. © Common Ground Research Networks, Vivencio O.

One of the most used strategies that can be used to control the spread of COVID-19 is the 3T (test, trace, and treatment) strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the 3T strategy to control COVID-19 infection in a COVID-19 Referral Hospital in Depok, West Java, Indonesia. METHODS: this is a cross-sectional study conducted at the University of Indonesia Hospital. The study was conducted in June 2020 with 742 participants (staff members) using secondary data from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results. We presented data in the descriptive form and performed bivariate analysis using the chi-square/Fischer test for categorical data. RESULTS: the PCR test results were positive in 83 (11.1%) participants, with a case-per-tracing ratio of 1:24 and 1:2 in the first and third phases of tracing, respectively. The COVID-19 case graph for the participants decreased along with the implementation of the 3T strategy. The positivity rate in the first phase of tracing was 20% and decreased to 5% in the third phase of tracing. Staff with confirmed positive test results were advised to isolate themselves (hospital or self-isolation). Hospital isolation was found to be associated with the duration of PCR test conversion (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: the 3T strategy is effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. The strategy should be implemented simultaneously with other health precautions to reduce the risk of spreading infection.","Hidayat, Rakhmad; Aini, Nurul; Ilmi, Azizah Fitriana Nurul; Azzahroh, Faiza; Giantini, Astuti",Acta Med Indones,312,29

We calculated the Structure Efficiency Index (IEE) of the states' 92 municipalities and positioned them on the pandemic curve. It was possible to verify that the government of the State of Rio de Janeiro needs to start acting to suppress COVID-19, maintaining the policy of providing more hospital beds, and purchasing equipment. However, it is also necessary to consider the particularities and deficiencies of each region, as the policy to transfer patients to places with available beds can contribute to the spread of the disease.","Silva, Giuliano Alves Borges e; Saraiva, Ernani Viana; Ferreira, Guilherme José Santos Nunes; Peixoto Junior, Rogério de Mesquita; Ferreira, Luiz Felipe",Rev. adm. pública (Online),312,16

These are postulated to be related to the virus's use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently there is no firm evidence to suggest that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","Agarwal, Amol; Chen, Alan; Ravindran, Nishal; To, Chau; Thuluvath, Paul J.",J.

Operating rooms (OR) are high-risk areas for the transmission of any respiratory infection with multiple personnel involved, in close proximity. Of concern to neurosurgeons, is the high-risk of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) like transsphenoidal and endonasal surgery. Endonasal AGPs theoretically present a higher risk of viral exposure due to the longer duration of exposure and aggressive disruption of potentially virus-containing mucosa. Objective: The current review discusses potential strategies to neuro-surgeons to avoid transmission of COVID 19 during endo-nasal and trans-sphenoidal surgeries. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed using the search terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"" in combination with ""neurosurgery"", and identified 13 relevant articles. A pre-surgical risk assessment score is proposed based on the risk of transmission. A flow chart of patient selection and care has been formulated. Conclusion: In all emergency patients, it is preferable to consider transcranial surgery or a sub-labial approach avoiding exposure to mucosa. Due to laboratory constraints routine swabs is not always available. Therefore, routine preoperative screening computed tomography (CT) chest is performed in all patients. Based on risk of transmission of infection to others, we propose a classification of patients for skull-based surgery into low, high and very high risk groups and suggest suitable personal protective equipment. Additionally, we discuss avoiding use of powered drills in or any AGP. However, cold procedures involving shavers and microdebriders generate lesser amounts of aerosol. Post-operatively, the length of stay could be reduced with a multidisciplinary approach.","Panigrahi, Manas; Kakani, Nikhil; Vooturi, Sudhindra",Neurol India,312,1

Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain-a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice.

However, there have been no reports on this issue since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate patients' tendencies to utilize an AHHC medical service for fever or common cold symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the characteristics and disease severity of patients with fever or common cold symptoms utilizing an AHHC medical service offered by a single large company between the control period (December 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019) and the COVID-19 pandemic exposure period (December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020). We also assessed the proportion of these patients in relation to all patients calling the service for any reason. RESULTS: During the control and COVID-19 pandemic exposure periods, a total of 6462 and 10,003 patients consulted the AHHC medical service, respectively. Of these, 5335 (82.6%) and 7423 (74.2%) patients had fever and common cold symptoms, respectively, during the control and COVID-19 pandemic exposure periods (P < 0.001). The corresponding median (interquartile range) ages were 8 (3-11) and 10 (4-33) years, respectively. The distribution of disease severity differed between the groups. The proportions of patients with mild, moderate, and severe illness were 71.1, 28.7, and 0.2% in the control period and 42.3, 56.7, and 0.9% in the COVID-19 pandemic exposure period, respectively (P < 0.001).

This disease burden is linked to the pathogen's intrinsic antibiotic-resistance and protected intracellular localization in alveolar macrophages. Current treatment regimens require several antibiotics with multi-month oral and intravenous administrations that are difficult to implement in the developing world. Herein, we report that a macrophage-targeted polyciprofloxacin prodrug acts as a surprisingly effective pre-exposure prophylactic in highly lethal murine models of aerosolized human pulmonary melioidosis. A single dose of the polymeric prodrug maintained high lung drug levels and targeted an intracellular depot of ciprofloxacin to the alveolar macrophage compartment that was sustained over a period of 7â¯days above minimal inhibitory concentrations. This intracellular pharmacokinetic profile provided complete pre-exposure protection in a BSL-3 model with a drug-resistant, aerosolized clinical isolate of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Thailand. This total protection was achieved despite the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin and where an equivalent dose of pulmonary-administered ciprofloxacin was ineffective. For the first time, we demonstrate that targeting the intracellular macrophage compartment with extended antibiotic dosing can achieve pre-exposure prophylaxis in a model of pulmonary melioidosis. This fully synthetic and modular therapeutic platform could be an important therapeutic approach with new or re-purposed antibiotics for melioidosis prevention and treatment, especially as portable inhalation devices in high-risk, resource-poor settings.","Chavas, Thomas E J; Su, Fang-Yi; Srinivasan, Selvi; Roy, Debashish; Lee, Brian; Lovelace-Macon, Lara; Rerolle, Guilhem F; Limqueco, Elaine; Skerrett, Shawn J; Ratner, Daniel M; West, Timothy Eoin; Stayton, Patrick S",J. control. release,312,1

In this presented research, we have picked up the existing mathematical model of corona virus which has six ordinary differential equations involving fractional derivative with non-singular kernel and Mittag-Leffler law. Another new thing is that we study this model in a fuzzy environment. We will discuss why we need a fuzzy environment for this model. First of all, we find out the approximate value of ABC fractional derivative of simple polynomial function ( t - a ) n . By using this approximation we will derive and developed the Legendre operational matrix of fractional differentiation for the Mittag-Leffler kernel fractional derivative on a larger interval [ 0 , b ] , b â©¾ 1 , b &#8712; N . For the numerical investigation of the fuzzy mathematical model, we use the collocation method with the addition of this newly developed operational matrix. For the feasibility and validity of our method we pick up a particular case of our model and plot the graph between the exact and numerical solutions. We see that our results have good accuracy and our method is valid for the fuzzy system of fractional ODEs. We depict the dynamics of infected, susceptible, exposed, and asymptotically infected people for the different integer and fractional orders in a fuzzy environment. We show the effect of fractional order on the suspected, exposed, infected, and asymptotic carrier by plotting graphs.","Gómez-Aguilar, J F; Alderremy, A A; Aly, Shaban; Saad, Khaled M",Results Phys,312,13

The WHO declared on January 31 that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a public health emergency. SARS-Cov-2 is a member of highly pathogenic coronavirus group that also consists of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although respiratory tract lesions were regarded as main manifestation of SARS-Cov-2 infection, gastrointestinal lesions were also reported. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also observed. Common gastrointestinal symptoms of patients mainly included diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal lesions could be used as basis for early diagnosis of patients, and at the same time, controlling gastrointestinal lesions better facilitated to cut off the route of fecal-oral transmission. Hence, this review summarizes the characteristics and mechanism of gastrointestinal lesions caused by three highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it is expected to gain experience from gastrointestinal lesions caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections in order to be able to better relieve SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

Boron nitride nanosheets (BNS), which lack magnetic field and light responsiveness, were used as a model nonfunctional nanomaterial. Among various catechol derivatives tested (i.e., dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, gallic acid, and tannic acid), a coating of tannic acid-Fe3+ coordination complex provided the highest magnetic field relaxivity and near infrared (NIR) laser light responsiveness. An in vitro study showed that KB tumor cells treated with tannic acid-Fe3+ coordination complex adsorbed on BNS (TA-Fe/BNS) exhibited higher T1-weighted magnetic resonance contrast compared with plain BNS, and BNS coated with tannic acid or Fe alone. NIR irradiation at 808â¯nm caused a significant increase in KB tumor cell death after treatment with TA-Fe/BNS compared with other treatments. In vivo MRI imaging revealed tumor accumulation of intravenously administered TA-Fe/BNS. Guided by MRI information, application of focused laser irradiation onto tumor tissues resulted in complete tumor ablation. These results support the potential of TA-Fe/BNS for MRI theranostics. Moreover, this study suggests the wide applicability of TA-Fe noncovalent coating as biocompatible and facile tool for converting nonfunctional early-generation nanomaterials into functional new nanomaterials, opening new opportunities for their use in translational biomedical applications such as MRI theranostics.","Shim, Gayong; Ko, Seungbeom; Park, Joo Yeon; Suh, Ju Han; Le, Quoc-Viet; Kim, Dongyoon; Kim, Young Bong; Im, Geun Ho; Kim, Hun Nyun; Choe, Yearn Seong; Cho, Jihee; Kim, Sanghee; Oh, Yu-Kyoung",J. control. release,312,33

Strict restrictions in terms of visiting hours and the number of visitors have made it difficult to arrange in-person family conferences. Phone-based telehealth consultations may be a solution, but the lack of nonverbal cues may diminish the clinician-patient relationship. In this context, video-based, smartphone-enabled family conferences have become important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish a smartphone-enabled telehealth model for palliative care family conferences. Our model integrates principles from the concept of shared decision making (SDM) and the value, acknowledge, listen, understand, and elicit (VALUE) approach. METHODS: Family conferences comprised three phases designed according to telehealth implementation guidelines-the previsit, during-visit, and postvisit phases. We incorporated the following SDM elements into the model: ""team talk,"" ""option talk,"" and ""decision talk."" The model has been implemented at a national cancer treatment center in Taiwan since February 2020. RESULTS: From February to April 2020, 14 telehealth family conferences in the palliative care unit were analyzed. The patients' mean age was 73 (SD 10.1) years; 6 out of 14 patients (43%) were female and 12 (86%) were married. The primary caregiver joining the conference virtually comprised mostly of spouses and children (n=10, 71%). The majority of participants were terminally ill patients with cancer (n=13, 93%), with the exception of 1 patient with stroke. Consensus on care goals related to discharge planning and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments was reached in 93% (n=13) of cases during the family conferences. In total, 5 families rated the family conferences as good or very good (36%), whereas 9 were neutral (64%). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-enabled telehealth for palliative care family conferences with SDM and VALUE integration demonstrated high satisfaction for families. In most cases, it was effective in reaching consensus on care decisions. The model may be applied to other countries to promote quality in end-of-life care in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Yu-Rui; Chou, Tzu-Jung; Wang, Yi-Jen; Tsai, Jaw-Shiun; Cheng, Shao-Yi; Yao, Chien-An; Peng, Jen-Kuei; Hu, Wen-Yu; Chiu, Tai-Yuan; Huang, Hsien-Liang",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,312,1

This has been dubbed as the MH 'second wave'. In Australia, these impacts have been partly mitigated by institutional responses such as increased access to psychotherapy. Consultation Liaison (CL) psychiatry services provide MH care to acutely unwell patients in general hospitals. It was hypothesised that the number of referrals to the studied service had increased since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: From the Electronic medical records (eMRs), the authors collected daily referral numbers, over 3 consecutive years, to a large CL service in metropolitan Sydney. RESULTS: Referrals were significantly increased by 25%, 95% CI [1.14, 1.36], p < .001 since the start of the pandemic. This increase was delayed, and remained elevated despite a reduction in COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION: This study adds evidence to the existence of the MH 'second wave', highlights a key impact on healthcare workers' well-being and will assist in guiding resource allocation decisions in the near future.","Lele, Kiran; Cartoon, Jodi; Griffiths, Alison",Australas Psychiatry,312,16

While SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, clinical evidence indicates that cells from sensory organs, brain, and heart are also susceptible to infection. An understanding of factors critical for viral infection in these tissues may help identify novel therapeutics. To discover host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, we performed CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens targeting all 6000+ human membrane proteins in cells with and without overexpression of ACE2 using Spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses. We identified both novel as well as previously validated host factors. Notably, we used replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 to validate new viral-entry promoting genes, including potassium channel KCNA6, protease LGMN, and MHC-II component HLA-DPB1. We found that the overexpression of KCNA6 led to a marked increase in infection even in cells with undetectable levels of ACE2 expression. Our analysis of human olfactory neuroepithelium scRNA-seq data revealed that OLIG2+ cells--previously identified as sites of infection in COVID-19 autopsy studies--have high KCNA6 expression and minimal levels of ACE2, suggesting that the presence of KCNA6 may explain sensory/neuronal aspects of COVID-19 symptoms. Further, we demonstrate that FDA-approved compound dalfampridine, an inhibitor of KCNA-family potassium channels, suppresses viral entry in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, we identified common prescription drugs likely to modulate the top screen hits. We then performed a retrospective analysis of insurance claims of [~]8 million patients and found a clinical association between screen-identified drug classes, particularly those targeting potassium channels, and COVID-19 severity. We have thus identified the potassium channel KCNA6 as a SARS-CoV-2 host factor, expanded our understanding of potential viral tropism, and identified promising targets for drug repurposing and development.","Wang, Chengkun; Dinesh, Ravi; Qu, Yuanhao; Rustagi, Arjun; Cousins, Henry; Zengel, James; Guo, Yinglong; Hall, Taryn; Beck, Aimee; Tso, Luke; Erdemic, Elif; Tanudtanud, Kae; Ren, Sheng; Tzeng, Kathy Tzy-Hwa; Wilk, Aaron; Wang, Mengdi; Carette, Jan; Altman, Russ; Blish, Catherine; Cong, Le",,312,16

METHODS: A total of 63 laboratory confirmed patients treated in our hospital were selected as the COVID-19 group, including 28 severe patients and 35 non-severe patients. Another 50 healthy subjects undergoing physical examination simultaneously were selected as the healthy group. Here we performed a study on the laboratory characteristics and explored their efficacy for diagnosis of the disease. RESULTS: Compared with healthy people, the abnormal indicators of patients with COVID-19 are low levels of lymphocytes (LYM), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT), total protein (TP), and albumin (ALB), and high levels of monocytes (MON), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The level of MON and CRP in severe patients were significantly increased compared with non-severe pneumonia patients, and indicators such as LYM and ALB were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the combined detection of LYM, MON, RBC, HGB, PLT, TP, ALB, AST, GGT, and CRP was 97.7% and 91.7%, which was higher than the single item (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of combined detection of LYM, MON, ALB, and CRP to predict the severity of COVID-19 were 96.4% and 73.0%, which were higher than those of separate detections (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The index of LYM, MON, RBC, HGB, PLT, TP, ALB, AST, GGT, and CRP can be used for the diagnosis of new COVID-19, and the indicators of LYM, MON, ALB, and CRP may be predictors of severe pneumonia. The combined detection of the laboratory indexes can diagnose COVID-19 and predict the severity more effectively and accurately.","Liang, Ying; Wang, Qiwen; Zhao, Yuli; Niu, Xuedong; Chen, Yue; Chen, Xilu; Wang, Yali; Zhou, Xuwei; Xu, Zhuang; Wu, Shimin",Clin. lab,312,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 561 professionals (42.6% males, 26.9% &#8805; 50-year-old) compiled a specifically designed web questionnaire on characteristics of POC rapid tests. They were asked whether they would change daily practice and make clinical decisions according to POC tests. Multivariate odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of propensity towards the aforementioned behavioral outcomes were calculated through regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, only 51.9% knew the official recommendations of the Italian Health Authorities for POC tests, while 26.0% of respondents considered POC tests for COVID-19 highly reliable. Still, 40.3% of respondents would change daily practice because of such tests, and 38.5% would make clinical decisions based of their results. Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors. Conclusions. Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying. While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.","Riccò, Matteo; Ferraro, Pietro; Gualerzi, Giovanni; Ranzieri, Silvia; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Balzarini, Federica; Signorelli, Carlo",Acta Biomed,312,20

We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULTS: Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per 10 years), had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99-1.00] per kg/m 2), had more severe illness (e.g., severe sepsis, ARR: 1.16 [1.07-1.27]), had a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04-1.42]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15-1.47]). Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time (returned &#8804;1 day in March [54.2%, 461/850] vs. in April [85.2%, 628/737], P<.001) and empiric antibacterial use (ARR: 0.71 [0.63-0.81] April vs. March) decreased. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial co-infections was low. Despite this, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. Antibacterial use varied widely by hospital. Reducing COVID-19 test turnaround time and supporting stewardship could improve antibacterial use.","Vaughn, Valerie M; Gandhi, Tejal; Petty, Lindsay A; Patel, Payal K; Prescott, Hallie C; Malani, Anurag N; Ratz, David; McLaughlin, Elizabeth; Chopra, Vineet; Flanders, Scott A",Clin Infect Dis,312,6

METHODS: We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. DISCUSSION: In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.","Kivi, Marie; Hansson, Isabelle; Bjälkebring, Pär",,312,1

Eighty-four patients were used as training cohort and 40 patients as validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to develop and evaluate the prognostic prediction model.In the training cohort, the mean age was 63.4â±â1.5âyears, and male patients (48, 57%) were predominant. Forty-three (52%) recovered, and 41 (49%) progressed to critical.

On the other hand. it has revealed an issue of triage on admission to ICUs for patients with COVID-19. Methods: The critically ill patients' characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes data were recorded. All chest computed tomography (c-CT) images were reviewed by two experienced radiologists in chest imaging. Collected data were compared between the confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Moreover, some detected parameters were evaluated via c-CT findings among suspected COVID-19 cases. Results: The study population included 105 patients hospitalized in ICUs. Twenty-seven patients (25.7%) were confirmed COVID-19 through real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and 78 patients (74.3%) were suspected COVID-19. There was a significant difference between the confirmed COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19 patients in terms of PaO2/FiO(2) ratio, APACHE II scoring system, the number of comorbidities. Interestingly, in suspected cases, mean PaO2/FiO(2) ratio, APACHE II score, and the number of comorbidities were significantly higher in patients with typical c-CT findings for COVID-19 (P = 0.038, P = 0.034 and P = 0.020, respectively). Considering all three parameters, 33.3% of cases with typical CT findings could be reconsidered as highly probable COVID-19 infections. Moreover, 16.7% of the cases with atypical CT findings could be excluded and the unnecessary burden on ICUs could be reduced. Conclusion: In many contagious diseases such as COVID-19, for a new triage system, specific characteristics. selected general physiological findings, and typical laboratory parameters may be standardized in addition to RT-PCR testing and c-CT examination.","Yazar, M.

Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis. A number of antiviral therapies have been used. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their efficacy at this point.

METHODS: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected. Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored. RESULTS: Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.","Xing, Yu-Han; Ni, Wei; Wu, Qin; Li, Wen-Jie; Li, Guo-Ju; Wang, Wen-Di; Tong, Jian-Ning; Song, Xiu-Feng; Wing-Kin Wong, Gary; Xing, Quan-Sheng",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,312,1

Here, we perform a retrospective analysis of clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); moreover, kidney histopathology from six additional COVID-19 patients with post-mortem examinations was performed. We find that 27% (23/85) of patients exhibited AKI. The elderly patients and cases with comorbidities (hypertension and heart failure) are more prone to develop AKI. Haematoxylin & eosin staining shows that the kidneys from COVID-19 autopsies have moderate to severe tubular damage. In situ hybridization assays illustrate that viral RNA accumulates in tubules. Immunohistochemistry shows nucleocapsid and spike protein deposits in the tubules, and immunofluorescence double staining shows that both antigens are restricted to the angiotensin converting enzyme-II-positive tubules. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the expression of hypoxic damage-associated molecules, including DP2 and prostaglandin D synthase in infected tubules. Moreover, it enhances CD68+ macrophages infiltration into the tubulointerstitium, and complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules is also observed. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects human kidney to mediate tubular pathogenesis and AKI.","Diao, Bo; Wang, Chenhui; Wang, Rongshuai; Feng, Zeqing; Zhang, Ji; Yang, Han; Tan, Yingjun; Wang, Huiming; Wang, Changsong; Liu, Liang; Liu, Ying; Liu, Yueping; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Hou, Xiaotao; Ren, Liang; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Nat Commun,312,30

Identification of respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was a challenge during the pandemic owing to a large number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. METHODS: We report 5 patients with unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with radiopharmaceuticals targeting different tumor processes: 18F-FDG, 18F-choline (FCH), and 68Ga-PSMA. RESULTS: In all patients, PET/CT showed increased tracer uptake in the lungs corresponding to CT findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Quantitative assessment of tracer uptake showed more elevated values for the glucose analogue 18F-FDG (mean SUVmax 5.4) than for the other tracers (mean SUVmax 3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PET/CT is a sensitive modality to hypothesize SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients with cancer, even when asymptomatic. More data are needed to verify the correlation among immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical evolution, and PET results. Under the strict safety measures implemented at the PET center, the number of potentially SARS-CoV-2-positive patients undergoing PET/CT was very low (1.6%), and no staff member has been diagnosed with infection as of April 30, 2020.","Scarlattei, Maura; Baldari, Giorgio; Silva, Mario; Bola, Stefano; Sammartano, Antonino; Migliari, Silvia; Graziani, Tiziano; Cidda, Carla; Sverzellati, Nicola; Ruffini, Livia",Tumori,312,6

To ensure a fair comparison, we first use a K-means clustering method to group the 50 states into five clusters according to their population, area and population density. We then characterize daily transportation patterns of the residents of different states using the mean percentage of residents traveling and the number of trips per person. For each state, we study the correlations between travel patterns and infection rate for a 2-month period before and after the official states reopening dates. We observe that during the lock-down, Red and Blue states both displayed strong positive correlations between their travel patterns and infection rates. However, after states reopened we find that Red states had higher travel-infection correlations than Blue states in all five state clusters. We find that the residents of both Red and Blue states displayed similar travel patterns during the period post the reopening of states, leading us to conclude that, on average, the residents in Red states might be mobilizing less safely than the residents in Blue states. Furthermore, we use temperature data to attempt to explain the difference in the way residents travel and practice safety measures.","Vombatkere, Karan; Lyu, Hanjia; Luo, Jiebo",,312,14

However, close to half of Canadians older than 80 years report feeling socially isolated. Research has shown that social isolation leads to increased mortality and morbidity, and various interventions have been studied to alleviate loneliness among older adults. This proposal presents an evaluation of an intervention that provides one-on-one coaching, is intergenerational, provides both educational and socialization experiences, and increases technology literacy of older adults to overcome loneliness. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol of a randomized, mixed-methods study that will take place in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an intergenerational technology literacy program can reduce social isolation and depression in older adults via quantitative and qualitative outcome measures. METHODS: This study is a randomized, mixed-methods, feasibility trial with 2 conditions. Older adults in the intervention condition will receive 1 hour of weekly technological assistance to send an email to a family member, for 8 weeks, with the assistance of a volunteer. Participants in the control condition will not receive any intervention. The primary outcomes are loneliness, measured using the University of California, Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, and depression, measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, both of which are measured weekly. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, as assessed using the Older People's Quality of Life-Brief version, and technological literacy, evaluated using the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire-12, both of which will be administered before and after the intervention. Semistructured interviews will be completed before and after the intervention to assess participants' social connectedness, familiarity with technology, and their experience with the intervention. The study will be completed in a long-term care facility in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: This study was funded in April 2019 and ethical approval was obtained in August 2019. Recruitment for the study started in November 2019. The intervention began in February 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial will be restarted when safe. As of March 2020, 8 participants were recruited. CONCLUSIONS: Information and communication technology interventions have shown varying results in reducing loneliness and improving mental health among older adults. Few studies have examined the role of one-on-one coaching for older adults in addition to technology education in such interventions. Data from this study may have the potential to provide evidence for other groups to disseminate similar interventions in their respective communities.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) level and COVID-19 infection, its severity, and its clinical case characteristics. METHODS: This case-control study compared serum 25(OH)D levels and rates of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) between 80 healthy controls and 62 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Guangxi People's Hospital, China, 2/16/2020-3/16/2020. Cases were categorized into asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe/critical disease. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between 25(OH)D level, or VDD, and case status/severity of COVID-19 while controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A threshold level of vitamin D for conveying COVID-19 risk was estimated. RESULTS: Severe/critical COVID-19 cases were significantly older and had higher percentages of comorbidity (renal failure) compared to mild cases. The serum 25(OH)D concentration in COVID-19 patient was much lower than that in healthy control. And 25(OH)D level was the lowest in severe/critical cases, compared with mild cases. In further, significantly higher rates of VDD were found in COVID-19 cases (41.9%) compared to healthy controls (11.1%). And VDD was the greatest in severe/critical cases (80%), compared with mild cases (36%). These statistically significant associations remained even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A potential threshold of 25(OH)D (41.19 nmol/L) to protect against COVID-19 was identified. CONCLUSION: Elderly and people with comorbidities were susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection. VDD was a risk factor for COVID-19, especially for severe/critical cases. While further confirmation is needed, vitamin D supplementation may have prevention or treatment potential for COVID-19 disease.","Ye, Kun; Tang, Fen; Liao, Xin; Shaw, Benjamin A; Deng, Meiqiu; Huang, Guangyi; Qin, Zhiqiang; Peng, Xiaomei; Xiao, Hewei; Chen, Chunxia; Liu, Xiaochun; Ning, Leping; Wang, Bangqin; Tang, Ningning; Li, Min; Xu, Fan; Lin, Shao; Yang, Jianrong",J Am Coll Nutr,312,24

Sequenced Swedish CRCoV isolates were highly similar despite being detected in dogs living in geographically distant locations and sampled across 3 years (2013-2015). This is due to a single introduction into Swedish dogs in approximately 2010, as inferred by time structured phylogeny. Unlike other CRCoVs, there was no evidence of recombination in Swedish CRCoV viruses, further supporting a single introduction. Finally, there were low levels of polymorphisms, in the spike genes. Overall, we demonstrate that there is little diversity of CRCoV which is endemic in Swedish dogs.","Wille, Michelle; Wensman, Jonas Johansson; Larsson, Simon; van Damme, Renaud; Theelke, Anna-Karin; Hayer, Juliette; Malmberg, Maja",Infect Genet Evol,312,10

Compared with White men, Black and other race men reported receiving less communications from some doctors recommending PSA screening (ORblack: 0.16, 95% CIblack: 0.07-0.38; ORother: 0.10, 95% CIother: 0.04-0.25), and that no one is sure PSA testing saves lives (ORblack: 0.49, 95% CIblack: 0.04-6.91; ORother: 0.17, 95% CIother: 0.06-0.48). Minority men, while more likely to have had a PSA, were less likely to be told of the harms and benefits of PSA testing, compared with White men. Increasing communication surrounding screening advantages and disadvantages between providers and patients can increase awareness and knowledge among younger men. In a post-COVID-19 environment, communication regarding the return to preventative screenings within vulnerable populations is an important message to convey. Research shows preventive screenings have dropped across all population groups due to the pandemic yet the decline disproportionately affects Black and other minority men.","Miller, David B; Markt, Sarah C; Nguyen, Carvell T; Coleman, Oita C",J. cancer educ,312,16

Here we propose a simple statistical model that could be used to predict the epidemiological extent of community spread of COVID-19from the explicit data based on optimal ARIMA model estimators. METHODS: Raw data was retrieved on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted based on cumulative daily figures of confirmed cases aggregated globally for ten major countries to predict their incidence trend. Statistical analysis was completed by using R 3.5.3 software. RESULTS: The optimal ARIMA model having the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value for US (0,2,0); Spain (1,2,0); France (0,2,1); Germany (3,2,2); Iran (1,2,1); China (0,2,1); Russia (3,2,1); India (2,2,2); Australia (1,2,0) and South Africa (0,2,2) imparted the nowcasting of trends for the upcoming weeks. These parameters are (p, d, q) where p refers to number of autoregressive terms, d refers to number of times the series has to be differenced before it becomes stationary, and q refers to number of moving average terms. Results obtained from ARIMA model showed significant decrease cases in Australia; stable case for China and rising cases has been observed in other countries. CONCLUSION: This study tried their best at predicting the possible proliferate of COVID-19, although spreading significantly depends upon the various control and measurement policy taken by each country.","Sandhir, Venuka; Kumar, Vinod; Kumar, Vikash",,312,17

One of the emerging AOP methods gaining increased attention is bio-electro-Fenton (BEF) which can generate hydroxyl radical in-situ in the cathode chamber using the energy harvested by exoelectrogenic bacteria in the anode. In this study, the feasibility of BEF technology for the removal of metoprolol, a typical micropollutant widely found in the water environment, was for the first time investigated. It was found that applied voltage and working pH had a significant effect on removal efficiency while Fe2+ dosage as catalyst showed a little effect. Besides removal by hydroxyl radical, metoprolol might be adsorbed on the surface of the reactor, electrode, and precipitated with iron sludge, especially at neutral pH. In a batch experiment with a supplied voltage of 0.2 V, pH 3, and a Fe2+ dose of 0.2 mM, the removal rate of metoprolol in the BEF for the synthetic wastewater and the real effluent from the secondary sediment tank was 66% and 55% within 12 h, respectively. A possible degradation pathway was proposed. Then the removal of metoprolol in a continuous flow BEF system was further studied at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 2, 4, and 6 h, about 77%, 92%, and 95% removal was observed. A toxicity test (less than 20% inhibition on bioluminescence) during treatment and energy cost analysis (5.269 × 10-3 kWh/order/m3) in treating 10 µg/L of metoprolol containing wastewater effluent at continuous flow mode implied that the proposed BEF has a potential for wastewater treatment.","Yang, Xiaoyong; Zou, Rusen; Tang, Kai; Andersen, Henrik Rasmus; Angelidaki, Irini; Zhang, Yifeng",Sci Total Environ,312,26

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis following a prospective observational study performed at Mayo Clinic Cancer Center. Adult patients receiving cancer-directed therapy or in recent remission on active surveillance with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 18 and July 31, 2020, were included. RPM was composed of in-home technology to assess symptoms and physiologic data with centralized nursing and physician oversight. RESULTS: During the study timeframe, 224 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 187 patients (83%) initially managed in the outpatient setting, those who did not receive RPM were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization than those receiving RPM. Following balancing of patient characteristics by inverse propensity score weighting, rates of hospitalization for RPM and non-RPM patients were 2.8% and 13%, respectively, implying that the use of RPM was associated with a 78% relative risk reduction in hospital admission rate (95% CI, 54 to 102; P = .002). Furthermore, when hospitalized, these patients experienced a shorter length of stay and fewer prolonged hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths, although these trends did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The use of RPM and a centralized virtual care team was associated with a reduction in hospital admission rate and lower overall acute care resource utilization among cancer patients with COVID-19.","Pritchett, Joshua C; Borah, Bijan J; Desai, Aakash P; Xie, Zhuoer; Saliba, Antoine N; Leventakos, Konstantinos; Coffey, Jordan D; Pearson, Kristina K; Speicher, Leigh L; Orenstein, Robert; Virk, Abinash; Ganesh, Ravindra; Paludo, Jonas; Halfdanarson, Thorvardur R; Haddad, Tufia C",JCO Oncol Pract,312,16

The United States of America have the highest numbers of a patient infected by this disease followed by Brazil, Russia, India and many other countries. Moreover, lots of research is going on to find out effective vaccines or medicine, but still, no potent vaccine or drug is discovered to cure COVID-19. As a consequence, many types of research have designated that computer-based studies, such as protein-ligand interactions, structural dynamics, and chembio modeling are the finest choice due to its low cost and time-saving features. Here, oxindole derivatives have been chosen for docking because of their immense pharmacological applications like antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and so on. Molecular docking of 30 oxindole derivatives done on the crystallized structure of the protein (COVID-19 Mpro). METHODS: The process of docking, interaction, and binding the structure of ligand with protein has executed using Molegro Virtual Docker v.7.0.0 (MVD) and visualized the usage by Molegro Molecular Viewer v.7.0.0 (MMV). RESULTS: Among the 30 derivatives, the outcomes depicted better steric interaction and hydrogen bonding amongst OD-22 ligand, OD-16 ligand, OD-4 ligand, and OD-9 ligand (oxindole derivatives) with COVID-19. In addition to this, the comparative study of these four compounds with existing drugs that are under clinical trials shows comparatively good results in terms of its MolDock scores, H-bonding and steric interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, It is proposed that these four oxindole derivatives have good potential as a new drug against coronavirus as possible therapeutic agents.","Shah, Vraj R; Bhaliya, Jaydip D; Patel, Gautam M",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,312,2

The goal of our study was to analyze, in a retrospective cohort study, the results of gynecological cancer surgery and evaluate postoperative complications in a single center in one of the most affected areas in Europe. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who were referred between March 2020 and May 2020 for primary surgical treatment of breast, endometrial, ovarian, cervical, or vulvar cancer. RESULTS: The study included a total of 126 patients. Median age was 60 years (range 29-89). Patients were referred with breast (76/126, 60.3%), endometrial (29/126, 23%), ovarian (14/126, 11.1%), cervical (5/126, 4%), or vulvar cancer (2/126, 1.6%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was only conducted in 50% of cases due to the low availability of tests during the first phase of our study, and was indicated only in suspected cases according to the healthcare authorities' protocol.

Typically, blur causes edge extension, which brings shape changes in infection regions. Tchebichef moments (TM) have been verified efficiently in shape representation. Intuitively, disease progression of same patient over time during the treatment is represented as different blur degrees of infection regions, since different blur degrees cause the magnitudes change of TM on infection regions image, blur of infection regions can be captured by TM. With the above observation, a longitudinal objective quantitative evaluation method for COVID-19 disease progression based on TM is proposed. COVID-19 disease progression CT image database (COVID-19 DPID) is built to employ radiologist subjective ratings and manual contouring, which can test and compare disease progression on the CT images acquired from the same patient over time. Then the images are preprocessed, including lung automatic segmentation, longitudinal registration, slice fusion, and a fused slice image with region of interest (ROI) is obtained. Next, the gradient of a fused ROI image is calculated to represent the shape. The gradient image of fused ROI is separated into same size blocks, a block energy is calculated as quadratic sum of non-direct current moment values. Finally, the objective assessment score is obtained by TM energy-normalized applying block variances.

We utilized a descriptive and multivariate analysis to investigate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We collected 567 questionnaires, 18% of the people interviewed were hesitant toward vaccination and 16% were against mandatory vaccination. In the multivariate analysis a poor level of information, being younger than 60 years and being against compulsory vaccination were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Regarding information about vaccines, 76.5% of the people relied on physicians, and/or 49% navigated the internet, while social media are used by 16% of the study population. Though 41.5% searched information on official sites, only 14% knew the website VaccinarSì and 4.7% had visited it. DISCUSSION: Compared to a previous study conducted in all of Italy except Trentino Alto Adige, the level of vaccination hesitancy was higher. It is important to utilize health professionals, the internet and especially social media to spread scientific information about vaccination.","Melot, Bénédicte; Bordin, Paola; Bertoni, Caterina; Tralli, Valentina; Zuccali, Mariagrazia; Grignolio, Andrea; Majori, Silvia; Ferro, Antonio",Hum Vaccin Immunother,312,16

We included 28 recovered COVID-19 patients and 27 healthy controls between April 2020 and June 2020. Demographic data, the mental health scores, diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data, and plasma metabolomics were collected and compared between the two groups. Tract-based spatial statistics and graph theory approaches were used for DTI data analysis. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the plasma was performed. Correlation analyses were performed between these characteristics. Recovered COVID-19 patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity values in widespread brain regions, and significantly lower global efficiency, longer shortest path length, and less nodal local efficiency in superior occipital gyrus (all, P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Our results also demonstrated significantly different plasma metabolic profiling in recovered COVID-19 patients even at 3 months after their hospital discharge, which was mainly related to purine pathways, amino acids, lipids, and amine metabolism. Certain regions with cerebral WM alterations in the recovered patients showed significant correlations with different metabolites and the mental health scores. We observed multiple alterations in both WM integrity and plasma metabolomics that may explain the deteriorated mental health of recovered COVID-19 patients. These findings may provide potential biomarkers for the mental health evaluation for the recovered COVID-19 patients and potential targets for novel therapeutics.","Yang, Lian; Zhou, Mei; Li, Lingli; Luo, Ping; Fan, Wenliang; Xu, Juanjuan; Chen, Qing; Pan, Feng; Lei, Ping; Zheng, Chuansheng; Jin, Yang",Transl Psychiatry,312,26

According to data on June 11, 2020, the number of infected people in Indonesia has reached 35,295 people. With these consequences, it is considered very important to immediately identify infection in order to stop or minimize the spread of the disease. There have been several ways to detect and diagnose COVID-19, one of which is using X-ray images. This paper examines the use of in-depth features and methods to process two-dimensional data from patients' X-ray images. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a development of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is specifically designed to process two-dimensional data or image data. The deep features of the fully connected layer CNN model are extracted and can be immediately classified without the need for any additional techniques. CNN method is used because of its good performance for large datasets that will be used for training and testing. In the classification process, the dataset contains 160 x-ray images and consists of two categories, COVID-19 and normal, that represents a positive or negative classification of Covid-19 infection to a patient. To get the best accuracy of the classification model, the author changed several parameters on CNN, such as the distribution of the dataset and the number of epochs. From the nine models tested, model number 5 and 8 with a dataset ratio of 70:30 and epoch number 30 and 40 respectively, resulted in the best accuracy of 97.91%.","James, R. M.; Kusrini, Arief M.

Vaccinations aim to stimulate these responses against pathogens. Several studies have evaluated the impact of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on immune response to vaccines. Findings from these studies have important implications for people with multiple sclerosis who require vaccination and are using disease-modifying therapies. METHODS: Searches using PubMed and other engines were conducted in May 2020 to collect studies evaluating the impact of various disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to vaccination. RESULTS: Several studies demonstrated preserved immune responses in people treated with beta-interferons to multiple vaccine types. Limited data suggest vaccine responses to be preserved with dimethyl fumarate treatment, as well. Vaccine responses were reduced to varying degrees in those treated with glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, and natalizumab. The timing of vaccination played an important role in those treated with alemtuzumab. Humoral vaccine responses were significantly impaired by B cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, particularly to a neoantigen. Data are lacking on vaccine responses in patients with multiple sclerosis taking cladribine and high-dose corticosteroids. Notably, the majority of these studies have focused on humoral responses, with few examining cellular immune responses to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Prior investigations into the effects of individual disease-modifying therapies on immune responses to existing vaccines can serve as a guide to expected responses to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Responses to any vaccination depend on the vaccine type, the type of response (recall versus response to a novel antigen), and the impact of the individual disease-modifying therapy on humoral and cellular immunity in response to that vaccine type. When considering a given therapy, clinicians should weigh its efficacy against MS for the individual patient versus potential impact on responses to vaccinations that may be needed in the future.","Ciotti, John Robert; Valtcheva, Manouela V; Cross, Anne Haney",Mult Scler Relat Disord,312,16

We estimated the potential impact of adding linked, opt-out HIV testing alongside SARS-CoV-2 testing on HIV incidence and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in six US cities. METHODS: Using a previously-calibrated dynamic HIV transmission model, we constructed three sets of scenarios for each city: (1) sustained current levels of HIV-related treatment and prevention services (status quo); (2) temporary disruptions in health services and changes in sexual and injection risk behaviours at discrete levels between 0%-50%; and (3) linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing offered to 10%-90% of the adult population in addition to scenario (2). We estimated cumulative HIV infections between 2020-2025 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of linked HIV testing over 20 years. RESULTS: In the absence of linked, opt-out HIV testing, we estimated a total of 16.5% decrease in HIV infections between 2020-2025 in the best-case scenario (50% reduction in risk behaviours and no service disruptions), and 9.0% increase in the worst-case scenario (no behavioural change and 50% reduction in service access). We estimated that HIV testing (offered at 10%-90% levels) could avert a total of 576-7,225 (1.6%-17.2%) new infections. The intervention would require an initial investment of $20.6M-$220.7M across cities; however, the intervention would ultimately result in savings in health care costs in each city. CONCLUSIONS: A campaign in which HIV testing is linked with SARS-CoV-2 testing could substantially reduce HIV incidence and reduce direct and indirect health care costs attributable to HIV.","Zang, Xiao; Krebs, Emanuel; Chen, Siyuan; Piske, Micah; Armstrong, Wendy S; Behrends, Czarina N; Del Rio, Carlos; Feaster, Daniel J; Marshall, Brandon D L; Mehta, Shruti H; Mermin, Jonathan; Metsch, Lisa R; Schackman, Bruce R; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Nosyk, Bohdan",Clin. infect. dis,312,1

Preferences were assessed in relation to: (i) specific forms of tobacco cessation support (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and various counseling formats); (ii) information sources (eg, government officials, doctors); and (iii) channels via which to receive relevant information (eg, television, social media). METHODS: An online survey was administered to adults who smoke tobacco in Australia (nâ=â604) and the UK (nâ=â600). Descriptive analyses were conducted to identify levels of interest in cessation support and information provision. Differences in responses according to demographic characteristics and smoking history were assessed. RESULTS: Around half of the respondents were interested in receiving personal counseling and/or participating in a text support program over the next month. By far the most popular delivery mechanism for personal counseling was email. Three-quarters of the sample expressed an interest in receiving free, home-delivered NRT. The most popular information sources nominated by respondents seeking more information about smokers' Covid-related risks were government departments and their doctor/general practitioner. Television and online news sources were the most preferred information dissemination channels. CONCLUSIONS: The substantial levels of interest expressed in accessing various forms of cessation assistance within the next month suggest that Covid-19 may be increasing receptiveness to quitting. The strong interest in free, home-delivered NRT indicates that this may be a useful mechanism for facilitating quit attempts during the pandemic.","Pettigrew, Simone; Jun, Min; Roberts, Ian; Bullen, Chris; Nallaiah, Kellie; Rodgers, Anthony",J Addict Med,312,23

In the leadup to widespread vaccine deployment, testing and surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible routes of transmission. Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure to control COVID-19 in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web app to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A 6-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The study participants, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, were asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web app during the course of the study period. Paradata were collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web app. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: During the pilot period, 45 users enrolled in MyCOVIDKey. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective; however, participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the midpoint of the study were less effective. App use paralleled the number of users, indicating that incentives were useful for recruiting new users to sign up but did not result in users attempting to artificially inflate their use as a result of prize offers. Times to completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the app could be used quickly. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a postpilot survey, with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey app was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web app framework with a native app format or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could be readily deployed and easily adapted to other settings across the country. The need for digital contact tracing tools is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly as COVID-19 case numbers continue to increase while more businesses begin to reopen.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Moore, Carson Paige; Hardcastle, Austin; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Public Health Surveill,312,20

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all consecutive admissions to ED from 1 January to 9 April in both 2019 and 2020. According to the ED discharge ICD-9-CM code, patients were grouped in urological and respiratory patients. We evaluated the type of access (self-presented/ambulance), discharge priority code, ED discharge (hospitalization, home), need for urological consultation or urgent surgery. RESULTS: The number of urological diagnoses in ED was inversely associated to COVID-19 diagnoses (95% confidence interval -0.41/-0.19; Beta = -0.8; P < .0001). The average access per day was significantly lower after 10 March 2020 (1.5 ± 1.1 vs 6.5 ± 2.6; P < .0001), compared to reference period. From 11 March 2020, the inappropriate admissions to ED were reduced (10/45 vs 96/195; P = .001). Consequently, the patients admitted were generally more demanding, requiring a higher rate of urgent surgeries (4/45 vs 4/195; P = .02). This reflected in an increase of the hospitalization rate from 12.7% to 17.8% (Beta = 0.88; P < .0001) during 2020. CONCLUSION: Urological admissions to ED during lockdown differed from the same period of 2019 both qualitatively and quantitatively. The spectrum of patients seems to be relatively more critical, often requiring an urgent management. These patients may represent a challenge due to the difficult circumstances caused by the pandemic.","Gallioli, Andrea; Albo, Giancarlo; Lievore, Elena; Boeri, Luca; Longo, Fabrizio; Spinelli, Matteo Giulio; Costantino, Giorgio; Montanari, Emanuele; De Lorenzis, Elisa",Urology,312,4

Along with analysing CSOs' management dynamics at a general level, it also offers specific insights into their management strategies in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a qualitative research design, where in-depth case studies are undertaken with four CSOs operating in post-conflict volatile Sub-Saharan African economies of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Findings Findings revealed that multiple stakeholder management plays an important role in social value creation by CSOs. The findings further state that, in volatile contexts, CSOs appear to have more legitimacy than state functionaries due to their capabilities in dealing with political pressures and conflict sensitivities. The findings also revealed that case CSOs operating in Liberia and Sierra Leone were quick to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting their working routines accordingly by switching to online working where possible and repurposing their management strategies. This repurposing of management strategies focussed on minimising economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 and continuing to create social value by helping youth and farmers particularly. Originality/value This paper contributes to the extant literature by being one of the first studies, highlighting the specificities of CSO management in volatile (especially Sub-Saharan African post-conflict) contexts and contributes to the literature streams on multiple stakeholder management and social value creation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current paper is also one the first study to address the management strategies of case CSOs in response to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone.","Arslan, A.; Kamara, S.; Golgeci, I.; Tarba, S.

Upon PAMP detection, diverse defensive responses are induced by the host, including those that promote inflammation and cell-intrinsic antimicrobial activities. Host-encoded molecules released from dying or damaged cells, known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), also induce defensive responses. Both DAMPs and PAMPs are recognized for their inflammatory potential, but only the latter are well established to stimulate cell-intrinsic host defense. Here, we report a class of DAMPs that engender an antiviral state in human epithelial cells. These DAMPs include oxPAPC (oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), PGPC (1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl phosphatidylcholine), and POVPC [1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine], oxidized lipids that are naturally released from dead or dying cells. Exposing cells to these DAMPs prior to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection limits viral replication. Mechanistically, these DAMPs prevent viral entry, thereby limiting the percentage of cells that are productively infected and consequently restricting viral load. We found that the antiviral actions of oxidized lipids are distinct from those mediated by the PAMP Poly I:C, in that the former induces a more rapid antiviral response without the induction of the interferon response. These data support a model whereby interferon-independent defensive activities can be induced by DAMPs, which may limit viral replication before PAMP-mediated interferon responses are induced. This antiviral activity may impact viruses that disrupt interferon responses in the oxygenated environment of the lung, such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE In this work, we explored how a class of oxidized lipids, spontaneously created during tissue damage and unprogrammed cell lysis, block the earliest events in RNA virus infection in the human epithelium. This gives us novel insight into the ways that we view infection models, unveiling a built-in mechanism to slow viral growth that neither engages the interferon response nor is subject to known viral antagonism. These oxidized phospholipids act prior to infection, allowing time for other, better-known innate immune mechanisms to take effect. This discovery broadens our understanding of host defenses, introducing a soluble factor that alters the cellular environment to protect from RNA virus infection.","Ernandes, Michael J; Kagan, Jonathan C",mBio (Online),312,26

This lockdown has strictly controlled human activities in the entire India. Although this long lockdown has had a serious impact on the social and economic fronts, it has many positive impacts on environment. During this lockdown phase, a drastic fall in emissions of major pollutants has been observed throughout all the parts of India. Therefore, in this research study we have tried to establish a relationship among the fall in emission of pollutants and their impact on reducing regional temperature. This analysis was tested through the application of Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope statistical index with air quality index and temperature data for several stations across the country, during the lockdown period. After the analysis, it has been observed that daily emissions of pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2 and NH3) decreased by - 1- - 2%, allowing to reduce the average daily temperature by 0.3 °C compared with the year of 2019. Moreover, this lockdown period reduces overall emissions of pollutants by - 51- - 72% on an average and hence decreases the average monthly temperature by 2 °C. The same findings have been found in the four megacities in India, i.e., Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai; the rate of temperature fall in the aforementioned megacities is close to 3 °C, 2.5 °C, 2 °C and 2 °C, respectively. It is a clear indicator that a major change occurs in air quality, and as a result it reduced lower atmospheric temperature due to the effect of lockdown. It is also a clear indicator that a major change in air quality and favorable temperature can be expected if the strict implementations of several pollution management measures have been implemented by the concern authority in the coming years.","Pal, Subodh Chandra; Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Saha, Asish; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Roy, Paramita; Ghosh, Manoranjan; Shit, Manisa",Environ Dev Sustain,312,10

Background: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus known to infect lung epithelial cells, yet data about SARS-CoV-2 neuropathology in human brain autopsies is limited. Design/Methods: Brain tissue specimens were sampled from 18 subjects (10 standard areas), fixed in formalin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analysis. SARSCoV-2 immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were performed on 10 brain sections from 2 subjects and 2 sections (medulla and frontal lobe with olfactory nerve) from the remaining 16 subjects. Results: Median age was 62 years (interquartile range, 53 to 75), and 14 patients (78%) were men. Presenting neurologic symptoms were myalgia (n=3), headache (n=2), and decreased taste (n=1);11 received mechanical ventilation. Acute hypoxic injury was detected in cerebrum, hippocampus, and cerebellum in all patients;rare foci of perivascular lymphocytes (n=2) or focal leptomeningeal inflammation (n=1) were also detected. RT-qPCR showed limited evidence of viral RNA. In 10 unique specimens from two subjects, results were equivocal (viral load <5.0 copies/mm3) in 4 and 5 sections, respectively. In the remaining 16 patients, 3 medulla sections and 3 frontal lobe and olfactory sections were positive (5.0 to 59.4 copies/mm3) while the rest were equivocal or negative. SARS-CoV-2 viral load did not correlate with the interval between the onset of symptoms and death or histopathological findings. Immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was negative in neurons, glia, endothelium, and immune cells. Conclusions: Histopathology of brain specimens revealed hypoxia with limited evidence of direct viral damage, including no viral protein. Concordantly, although SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-qPCR in some sections, viral load was low and did not correlate with other pathological features.","Normandin, E.; Bhattacharyya, S.; Mukerji, S.; Keller, K.; Ali, A.; Adams, G.; Hornick, J.; Padera, R.; Sabeti, P.; Solomon, I.

Our institution implemented an emergency medicine telehealth system that sought to expedite care of stable patients, decrease provider exposure to COVID-19, decrease overall usage rate of personal protective equipment, and provide a platform so that infected or quarantined physicians could continue to work. This effort was among the first to use telehealth to practice emergency medicine in the setting of a pandemic in the United States. DISCUSSION: Outside the main emergency departments at each of 2 sites of our academic institution, disaster tents were erected with patient care equipment and medications, as well as technology to allow for telehealth visits. The triage system was modified to appropriately select low-risk patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 who could be seen in these disaster tents. Despite some issues that needed to be addressed, such as provider discomfort, limited medication availability, and connectivity problems, the model was successful overall. CONCLUSIONS: Other emergency departments might find this proof of concept article useful. Telehealth will likely be used more broadly in the future, including emergency care. It is imperative that the health care system continues to adapt to respond appropriately to challenges such as pandemics.","Tresenriter, Megan; Holdaway, Jessica; Killeen, James; Chan, Ted; Dameff, Christian",J. emerg. med,312,1

METHOD: For 17 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, dynamic dual-source DECT acquisitions were performed at 80kVp/Sn140kVp every 1.5 s over 51 s. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) were reconstructed for photon energies between 40 keV and 150 keV (5 keV steps). Using the maximum-slope model, perfusion maps of blood flow were calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images and compared quantitatively with regard to blood flow measured in regions of interest in healthy tissue and carcinoma, standard deviation (SD), and absolute-difference-to-standard-deviation ratio (ADSDR) of measurements. RESULTS: On average, blood flow calculated from VMIs increased with increasing energy levels from 114.3 ± 37.2 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 45.6 ± 25.3 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 40 keV to 128.6 ± 58.9 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 75.5 ± 49.8 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for 150 keV, compared to 114.2 ± 37.4 mL/100 mL/min (healthy tissue) and 46.5 ± 26.6 mL/100 mL/min (carcinoma) for polyenergetic 80kVp. Differences in blood flow between tissue types were significant for all energies. Differences between perfusion maps calculated from VMIs and 80kVp images were not significant below 110 keV. SD and ADSDR were significantly better for perfusion maps calculated from VMIs at energies between 40 keV and 55 keV than for those calculated from 80kVp images. Compared to effective dose of dynamic 80kVp acquisitions (4.6 ± 2.2mSv), dose of dynamic DECT/VMI acquisitions (8.0 ± 3.7mSv) was higher. CONCLUSIONS: Perfusion maps of blood flow based on low-energy VMIs between 40 keV and 55 keV offer improved robustness and quality of quantitative measurements over those calculated from 80kVp image data (reference standard), albeit at increased patient radiation exposure.","Skornitzke, Stephan; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Stiller, Wolfram",Eur J Radiol,312,16

The antiviral activity of Pba was subsequently shown for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and its mechanism of action was further assessed, showing that Pba is an inhibitor of coronavirus entry by directly targeting the viral particle. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of Pba depends on light exposure, and Pba was shown to inhibit virus-cell fusion by stiffening the viral membrane as demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy. Moreover, Pba was shown to be broadly active against several other enveloped viruses, and reduced SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Pba is the first described natural antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 with direct photosensitive virucidal activity that holds potential for COVID-19 therapy or disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces.","Bordage, Simon; Bamba, Moussa; Decossas, Marion; Bi, Fezan H.

These strains seem to be more easily transmissible than other variants, which may lead to more cases and more deaths. Currently, there are many vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 available in the market but without full clinical data beside. Despite the existence of these vaccines, the numbers of outpatients are still increasing in many countries around the world, and the reliability of these vaccines still remains elusive. It is well known that trace element deficiencies increase the individual susceptibility to immune dysfunction and lead to global health problem. In this context, improving the immune defense system to combats this pandemic is absolutely necessary. The purpose of this review is to establish the probable relation between trace elements supplementation and COVID-19. Main body: Several clinical studies confirmed that Cu, Se, and Zn insufficiencies alter the immune system and increase the vulnerability to viral infections. Based on antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of these micronutrients, it seems logical that dietary supplementations of these components might enhance human immune system and lower the graveness of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Based on available data, we hypothesize that the clinical use of some essential trace element supplementations such as copper, selenium, and zinc might be a preventive and promising option to enhance human immunity against the new pandemic COVID-19 and its new strains.

To examine the evolution of symptoms and the extent of under-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children. DesignProspective cohort study of randomly selected schools and classes. SettingSchools remained open for physical attendance in Switzerland from May 2020 to the end of 2020/2021 school year. Lower school level (age range 7-10 years) and middle school level (8-13 years) children in primary schools, and upper school level (12-17 years) children in secondary schools were invited for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing in the Ciao Corona study in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Three testing rounds were completed in June-July 2020 (T1; after the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections), October-November 2020 (T2; during the peak of the second wave), and March-April 2021 (T3; after the second wave and with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern becoming dominant). Parents completed questionnaires on sociodemographic information and symptoms. Participants2487 children (median age 12 years, age range 7-17 years) recruited from 275 classes in 55 schools participated in the testing in March-April 2021; total of 2974 children participated in at least one of the 3 testing rounds. Main outcome measuresSARS-CoV-2 serology results; clustering of seropositive children within classes; reported symptoms. ResultsThe proportion of children who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive increased from 1.5% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.6% to 2.6%) in June-July 2020, to 6.6% (95% CrI 4.0% to 8.9%) in October-November, and to 16.4% (95% CrI 12.1% to 19.5%) in March-April 2021. By March-April 2021, children in upper school level (12.4%; 95% CrI 7.3% to 16.7%) were less likely to be seropositive than those in middle (19.5%; 95% CrI 14.2% to 24.4%) or lower school levels (16.0%; 95% CrI 11.0% to 20.4%). Children in the upper school level had a 5.1% (95% CI -9.4% to -0.7%) lower than expected seroprevalence by March-April 2021 than those in middle school level, based on difference-in-differences analysis. The ratio of PCR-diagnosed to all seropositive children changed from 1 to 21.7 (by June-July 2020) to 1 to 3.5 (by March-April 2021). Symptoms were reported by 37% of newly seropositive and 16% seronegative children. Potential clusters of 3 or more newly seropositive children were detected in 24 of 119 (20%) classes with a high participation rate, from which a median of 17 clusters could be expected due to random distribution of seropositive children within the classes. Clustering was lowest in middle and upper school levels. Retention rate in the cohort was high (84% of T1 participants attended T3). Among participants, supporting society and research were reported more commonly for participation than personal reasons. Fear of blood sampling was the most frequently reported reason for non-participation, reported for 64% of children. ConclusionsBy March-April 2021, 16.4% of children and adolescents were seropositive in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland.

The disease has caused a pandemic and is threatening global health. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus can potentially infect lower respiratory tract cells and can go on to cause severe acute respiratory tract syndrome, followed by pneumonia and even death in many nations. The molecular mechanism of the disease has not yet been evaluated until now. We analyzed the GSE1739 microarray dataset including 10 SARS-positive PBMC and four normal PBMC. Co-expression network analysis by WGCNA suggested that highly preserved 833 turquoise module with genes were significantly related to SARS-CoV infection. ELANE, ORM2, RETN, BPI, ARG1, DEFA4, CXCL1, and CAMP were the most important genes involved in this disease according to GEO2R analysis as well. The GO analysis demonstrated that neutrophil activation and neutrophil degranulation are the most activated biological processes in the SARS infection as well as the neutrophilia, basophilia, and lymphopenia predicted by deconvolution analysis of samples. Thus, using Serpins and Arginase inhibitors during SARS-CoV infection may be beneficial for increasing the survival of SARS-positive patients. Regarding the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, the use of such inhibitors might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.","Hemmat, Nima; Derakhshani, Afshin; Bannazadeh Baghi, Hossein; Silvestris, Nicola; Baradaran, Behzad; De Summa, Simona",Front.

Using three well-established models of cervical cancer natural history adapted to simulate screening across four countries, we compared the impact of a range of standardised screening disruption scenarios in four countries that vary in their cervical cancer prevention programs. All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50â¯years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests. These findings can inform future prioritisation strategies for catch-up that balance potential constraints on resourcing with clinical need.","Smith, Megan A; Burger, Emily A; Castanon, Alejandra; de Kok, Inge M C M; Hanley, Sharon; Rebolj, Matejka; Hall, Michaela T; Jansen, Erik E L; Killen, James; O039,; Farrell, Xavier; Kim, Jane J; Canfell, Karen",Prev Med,312,14

Some environmental factors, such as time spent outdoors, doing near work, and using digital devices, influence the development of myopia in children. Home confinement in Spain has increased these risk factors, so this study aims to investigate the impact of home confinement during the COVID-19 outbreak in the vision of school-aged children; Methods: A cross-sectional study in children between 5 and 7 years old that completed a visual screening and a questionnaire about their lifestyles at opticians in Spain in September and October of 2019 and 2020. Statistical analysis to compare lifestyles pre and post confinement, and vision in 2020 versus a similar cohort examined at the same opticians in 2019, was conducted; Results: Spanish children spent less time outdoors and more time doing near work in 2020 than in 2019 (p &#8804; 0.001). There was a significant decrease of the spherical equivalent (mean ± standard deviation; 0.66 ± 2.03 D in 2019 vs. 0.48 ± 1.81 D in 2020; p &#8804; 0.001); Conclusions: Lifestyles of Spanish children changed during the home confinement at the beginning of 2020. Together with changes in their lifestyles, spherical equivalents have decreased, which implies higher figures of myopia for children aged between 5 and 7.","Alvarez-Peregrina, Cristina; Martinez-Perez, Clara; Villa-Collar, Cesar; Andreu-Vázquez, Cristina; Ruiz-Pomeda, Alicia; Sánchez-Tena, Miguel Ángel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),312,20

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 - 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","Roosa, K.; Lee, Y.; Luo, R.; Kirpich, A.; Rothenberg, R.; Hyman, J.

One of them is to create applications dedicated to educational purposes, which students can use on their mobile phones any time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of mobile learning of dentistry students during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The prospective study involved 56 students from two medical faculties in the Balkans, who continued to study online after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Online teaching was based on material in the form of PowerPoint presentations. In order to provide an additional educational tool, a step-by-step mobile application for managing traumatic dental injuries was developed. After one week of using that mobile application, all students completed a questionnaire in electronic form concerning teaching satisfaction. Results Over 90% of the respondents stated that the application facilitated a learning process, improved their understanding of the teaching unit, and provided a great convenience in terms of access to information. Median value of the total score concerning clinical protocol by the use of application was 20 (16-20), which was significantly higher than the neutral value (p &lt; 0.001). Median value of the total score concerning the use of conventional PowerPoint presentations did not differ significantly from the neutral value (p = 0.284).

The unpredictable nature of transmission of COVID-19 requires a meticulous understanding of guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) as published by WHO and Public Health England (PHE). AIM: To assess perceived confidence and knowledge of PHE guidance relating to PPE by nursing staff. METHODS: A nationwide survey was disseminated between May and June 2020 through social media platforms as well as internal mail via regulatory bodies and individual hospital trusts. RESULTS: Data were collated from 339 nurses. Perceived confidence as measured on a Likert scale was a mode score of 3/5, with the average score for knowledge-based questions being 5/10. Of the respondents, 47% cited insufficient training on PPE guidance, and 84% advocated further training. Conclusions: Unifying published PPE guidance and ensuring consistency in training can improve awareness, confidence, and knowledge among nursing staff.","Bhamra, Navdeep; Gupta, Keshav; Lee, Jonathan; Al-Hity, Shams; Jolly, Karan; Darr, Adnan",Br J Nurs,312,32

Clinical drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Traditional de novo drug discovery needs more than 10 years, so drug repurposing seems the best option currently to find potential drugs for treating COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with traditional non-covalent drugs, covalent drugs have attracted escalating attention recent years due to their advantages in potential specificity upon careful design, efficiency and patient burden. We recently developed a computational protocol named as SCAR (steric-clashes alleviating receptors) for discovering covalent drugs. In this work, we used the SCAR protocol to identify possible covalent drugs (approved or clinically tested) targeting the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. We identified 11 potential hits, among which at least six hits were exclusively enriched by the SCAR protocol. Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19.

The lens-expressed long noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in lens epithelial cells from patients with cataracts, suggesting its pathogenic role in cataracts. We investigated the regulatory role of OIP5-AS1 in the development of cataracts as well as potential RNA binding proteins, downstream target genes, and upstream transcription factors. Methods: Clinical capsules and ex vivo and in vitro cataract models were used to test OIP5-AS1 expression. Cell apoptosis was detected using Western blots, JC-1 staining, and flow cytometry. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation-qPCR was performed to confirm the interaction of OIP5-AS1 and POLG. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR was used to determine the binding of TFAP2A and the OIP5-AS1 promoter region. Results: OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in cataract lenses and B3 cells under oxidative stress. OIP5-AS1 knockdown protected B3 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and alleviated lens opacity in the ex vivo cataract model. HuR functioned as a scaffold carrying OIP5-AS1 and POLG mRNA and mediated the decay of POLG mRNA. POLG was downregulated in the cataract lens and oxidative-stressed B3 cells, and POLG depletion decreased the mtDNA copy number and MMP, increased reactive oxygen species production, and sensitized B3 cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. POLG overexpression reversed these effects. TFAP2A bound the OIP5-AS1 promoter and contributed to OIP5-AS1 expression. Conclusions: We demonstrated that OIP5-AS1, activated by TFAP2A, contributed to cataract formation by inhibiting POLG expression mediated by HuR, thus leading to increased apoptosis of lens epithelial cells and aggravated lens opacity, suggesting that OIP5-AS1 is a potential target for cataract treatment.","Jing, Ruihua; Ma, Bo; Qi, Tiantian; Hu, Conghui; Liao, Chongbing; Wen, Chan; Shao, Yongping; Pei, Cheng",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,312,16

Mortality from COVID-19 is much greater in elderly men, many of whom succumb to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by the viral infection. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19, new strategies are urgently needed. Selenium is an essential trace element with antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Poor nutritional status increases the pathogenicity of viruses and low selenium in particular can be a determinant of viral virulence. In the past decade, selenium pharmaconutrition studies have demonstrated some reduction in overall mortality, including how reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and infectious complications such as ARDS in the critically ill. Consequently, we postulate that intravenous selenium therapy, could be part of the therapeutic fight against COVID-19 in intensive care unit patients with ARDS and that outcomes could be affected by age, sex, and body weight. Our working hypothesis addresses the question: Could high-dose selenite pharmaconutrition, as an early pharmacologic intervention, be effective at reducing the incidence and the progression from type 1 respiratory failure (non-ARDS) to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, and new infectious complications in patients with COVID-19 patients?","Manzanares, William; Moreira, Eduardo; Hardy, Gil",Nutrition,312,6

Our model is a time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks two time series: (i) the transmission rate at time $t$ and (ii) the recovering rate at time $t$. Our time-dependent SIR method is better than the traditional static SIR model as it can adapt to the change of contagious disease control policies such as city lockdowns. Moreover, it is also more robust than the direct estimation of the number of confirmed cases, as a sudden change of the definition of the number of confirmed cases might result in a spike of the number of new cases. Using the data set provided by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) [2], we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are less than $3\%$ except the day when the definition of the number of confirmed cases is changed. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate, is predicted to be Feb. 17, 2020. After that day, the basic reproduction number, known as the $R_0(t)$ value, is less than $1$ if the current contagious disease control policies are maintained in China. In that case, the total number of confirmed cases is predicted to be less than $80,000$ cases in China under our deterministic model.","Chen, Yi-Cheng; Lu, Ping-En; Chang, Cheng-Shang",,312,24

First, I show that the model is poorly identified from the observed number of deaths and confirmed cases. There are many sets of parameters that are observationally equivalent in the short run but lead to markedly different long run forecasts. Second, I show that the basic reproduction number R 0 can be identified from the data, conditional on epidemiologic parameters, and propose several nonlinear SUR approaches to estimate R 0 . I examine the performance of these methods using Monte Carlo studies and demonstrate that they yield fairly accurate estimates of R 0 . Next, I apply these methods to estimate R 0 for the US, California, and Japan, and document heterogeneity in the value of R 0 across regions. My estimation approach accounts for possible underreporting of the number of cases. I demonstrate that if one fails to take underreporting into account and estimates R 0 from the reported cases data, the resulting estimate of R 0 may be biased downward and the resulting forecasts may exaggerate the long run number of deaths. Finally, I discuss how auxiliary information from random tests can be used to calibrate the initial parameters of the model and narrow down the range of possible forecasts of the future number of deaths.","Korolev, Ivan",Journal of econometrics,312,20

The massive spread of the pandemic has led state authorities to introduce restrictions on society and public behavior unprecedented in modern times. First, we describe the Danish effort regarding standard precautions, personal protective equipment, and disinfection in the healthcare setting with Denmark as an example. As regards, the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related hospital submissions, deaths, and infected healthcare workers in Denmark is not the hardest hit country compared with others. This cannot be explained by the hardness of the restrictions alone. Several aspects concerning the person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood and require more experimental studies. The dogma is that virus transmission happens through either respiratory droplets or contact routes. However, it is likely not the whole truth, as we describe scenarios where droplets and/or direct contact cannot alone explain how all patients were infected. Aspects of the physiology of airborne transmission are considered, as several parameters are in play beyond particle size and respiratory rate. These are ozone concentration, ambient temperature, and humidity. In a hospital environment, these factors are not necessarily all controllable, making infection prevention and control a challenge.","Calum, Henrik Pierre; Sode, Louise Palasin; Pedersen, Michael",APMIS,312,1

Physiological substances (neurotransmitters, hormones, etc.) in the body fluctuate significantly before and after sexual maturation. Therefore, the effect of chemical exposure on the central nervous system often differs depending on the developmental stage and sex. We aimed to compare the behavioural effects that emerged from the administration of chemicals to mice of different life stages (immature or mature) and different sex (male or female). We administered mice with domoic acid (DA), a marine poison, and ibotenic acid (IA), found in poisonous mushrooms. These excitatory amino acids act as agonists for glutamate and are potent neurotoxins. Interestingly, the behavioural effects of these chemicals were completely different. Following DA administration, we observed memory deficits only in groups of male mice treated at maturity. Following IA administration, we observed deviations in emotional behaviour in groups of male mice treated at both immaturity and maturity. In contrast, few characteristic changes were detected in all groups of females. Our results support the theory that the behavioural effects of chemical administration vary considerably with developmental stages and sex. In conclusion, our findings promote better understanding of individual differences in excitatory chemical-induced neurotoxicity and provide evidence for future risk strategies and treatments.","Sasaki, Takahiro; Saito, Hirokatsu; Hiradate, Yuuki; Hara, Kenshiro; Tanemura, Kentaro",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,312,5

Flooding is also the costliest natural disaster, with yearly estimated losses of $36.3 billion. In order to counter these challenges, the flood risk management (FRM) narrative is evolving towards integration of blue/green infrastructure (BGI), using projects that harness nature and mimic natural processes. However, there is very little research into how BGI-related innovations will be mainstreamed, nor, particularly, how they will be funded. In order to reflect upon this situation, this paper analyses current academic literature and international best practice in BGI and Land Value Capture (LVC) instruments - to form a novel conceptual framework that is designed to act as a staging post for new research into BGI and its practical delivery. Specifically, this analysis focuses on the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) instrument, which has enabled some planning authorities to successfully push forward their environmental agendas, through land conservation, including in flood prone areas. This gap in knowledge has multiple significance. Firstly, land management decisions related to BGI can have deep distributive-justice implications that need to be addressed. Secondly, there is an immediate need to pay for such FRM measures across the world. Thirdly, this financial imperative takes place against an international backdrop of reduced government funding in a time of deep structural change and Covid-19 pressure. Findings in this paper suggest that TDR has the potential to be a successful conduit for managing all three conditions. Yet, the success of TDR is closely linked to the specific legal, market and urban development contexts, which further research should explore within the framework of BGI implementation.","Dyca, Besmira; Muldoon-Smith, Kevin; Greenhalgh, Paul",Environ.

The aim of this article is to describe the experience with telephone consultations in a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of children with confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19 attended by telephone consultations in Hospital La Paz (Madrid) between March and June 2020. Patients were referred from the Emergency Department after being discharged from the hospital. Telephone consultations were made every 48hours until symptoms resolved, then weekly until completing 14 days without symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 72 children were included, with median age of 83.5 months (IQR=16.3-157.5). Of those 46 (63.9%) were male, and 14 (19.4%) had comorbidities. There were 32 (44.4%) hospital admissions. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 33 children by RT-PCR, and in 7 by serology tests. The seroconversion rate was 67.7% in those patients with a positive RT-PCR. Other infections were found in 7 patients (5 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1 parvovirus, and 1 cytomegalovirus). Median symptom duration was 25.5 days (IQR=13.8-37), while median follow-up duration was 28 days (IQR=21-39). The median number of telephone consultations per patient was 6 (IQR=4-8). Clinical worsening was reported in 19 (26.4%) during follow-up, and 14 (19.4%) were re-evaluated in the Emergency Department. One patient required hospital admission, but he had a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection should be followed-up due to prolonged duration of symptoms, and the risk of clinical deterioration. Telephone consultations are a useful and safe alternative for the follow-up of patients with mild symptoms, and for children discharged from the hospital.","Nogueira López, Javier; Grasa Lozano, Carlos; Ots Ruiz, Cristina; Alonso García, Luis; Falces-Romero, Iker; Calvo, Cristina; García-López Hortelano, Milagros",An. pediatr.

Our objective was to precisely quantify the effects modified or mediated by PA and SB using the recently developed four-way effect decomposition. METHODS: Our analysis included 22,117 adults (aged&#8805;20 years) participating in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Moderate recreational activity (MRA), moderate work activity (MWA), and walk or bicycle for transportation, were measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). A four-way decomposition was applied with PA and SB as mediator to decompose the total effects of CVDs on depression into four components: controlled direct effect (CDE), pure indirect effect (PIE), reference interaction (INTref), and mediated interaction effect (INTmed). RESULTS: There were statistically significant associations between CVDs, MRA, and depression, with the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of being 1.73 (1.42~2.30), 1.81 (1.42~2.30), respectively. With MRA as a mediator, there were interaction and mediation effects in the associations between CVDs and depression, and the proportions attributable of INTref, INTmed, and PIE were 94.08% (P<0.001), 3.92% (P = 0.007), and 1.68% (P = 0.006), respectively. Furthermore, the mediation effect was statistically significant in females rather than males. CONCLUSIONS: MRA strongly modified and mediated the effects of CVDs on depression, especially in females. Our results suggested that sufficient MRA (at least 150 min per week) was considered as requirement for preventing depression in CVDs patients in females.","Xu, Huafu; Deng, Kaisheng; Lin, Ziqiang; Huang, Zhenhui; Gong, Xiao; Tan, Jianyi; Huang, Baoying; Gao, Yanhui",J Affect Disord,312,2

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with mortality in a large patient population in the USA. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: 6493 patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with clinical outcomes between March 13 and April 17, 2020, who were seen in one of the 8 hospitals and/or over 400 ambulatory practices in the New York City metropolitan area MAIN MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality. KEY RESULTS: A total of 858 of 6493 (13.2%) patients in our total cohort died: 52/2785 (1.9%) ambulatory patients and 806/3708 (21.7%) hospitalized patients. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling showed an increased risk of in-hospital mortality associated with age older than 50 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.34, CI 1.47-3.71), systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg (HR 1.38, CI 1.06-1.80), a respiratory rate greater than 24 per min (HR 1.43, CI 1.13-1.83), peripheral oxygen saturation less than 92% (HR 2.12, CI 1.56-2.88), estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (HR 1.80, CI 1.60-2.02), IL-6 greater than 100 pg/mL (HR 1.50, CI 1.12-2.03), D-dimer greater than 2 mcg/mL (HR 1.19, CI 1.02-1.39), and troponin greater than 0.03 ng/mL (HR 1.40, CI 1.23-1.62).

Here, we describe the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) regularly followed at a reference center in Northern Italy. The study period started from COVID-19 outbreak (February 22, 2020) until the time of writing. Moreover, we provide a review of the literature, showing that most cases reported so far are AIC developed during or secondary to COVID-19 infection. At variance, data about AIC pre-existing to COVID infection are scanty. The 4 patients here described (2 autoimmune hemolytic anemias, AIHA, 1 Evans syndrome, and 1 immune thrombocytopenia) with COVID-19 pneumonia belong to a large cohort of 500 AIC patients, making this study nearly population-based. The observed frequency (4/501; 0.7%) is only slightly superior to that of the general population admitted to hospital/intensive care unit (0.28/0.03%, respectively) in Lombardy in the same period of observation. All cases occurred between March 21 and 25, whilst no more AIC were recorded later on. Although different in intensity of care needed, all patients recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, with apparently no detrimental effect of previous/current immunomodulatory treatments. AIHA relapse occurred in two patients, but promptly responded to therapy. With limitations due to sample size, these results suggest a favorable outcome and a lower-than-expected incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with previously diagnosed AIC, and allow speculating that immunomodulatory drugs used for AIC may play a beneficial rather than a harmful effect on COVID-19 infection.","Barcellini, Wilma; Giannotta, Juri Alessandro; Fattizzo, Bruno",Front Immunol,312,12

DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional study. SETTING: Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted among 633 participants living in Gurage Zone from 1 February to 28 February 2020. 618 completed the questionnaire. A multistage sampling technique was employed to obtain study participants. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted by 20 experienced and trained data collectors using a pretested structured questionnaire. To assess knowledge, 10 questions were adopted from the WHO questionnaire, which is a standardised and structured questionnaire used internationally. Data were entered into EpiData V.3.1 and exported to SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) V.24 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed and the findings were presented in text, figures and tables. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between each independent variable and the outcome variable. All variables with p<0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model and statistical significance was declared at p<0.05. Voluntary consent was taken from all participants. RESULTS: A total of 618 participants were included in the study, with a response rate of 97.6%. Of the participants, 40.7% had good knowledge (95% CI 36.3 to 44.2). Urban residence (adjusted OR=6.135, 95% CI 4.429 to 9.238) and a primary and above educational level (adjusted OR=4.294, 95% CI 1.875 to 9.831) were some independent predictors of husbands' knowledge status. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of neonatal danger signs in this study was low. Urban residence, primary and above educational level, the husband's wife undergoing instrumental delivery and accompanying the wife during antenatal care visits were independent predictors of knowledge. Thus, strong multisectoral collaboration should target reducing the knowledge gap by improving husbands' attitude with regard to accompanying their wives during antenatal care and postnatal care visits, or create a strategy to increase husbands' participation in access to maternal and child health service since husbands are considered decision-makers when it comes to healthcare-seeking in the family. The government should come up with policies that will help promote formal education in the community and increase their media access.","Shitu, Solomon; Abebe, Haimanot; Adane, Daniel; Wassie, Abebaw; Mose, Ayenew; Yeshaneh, Alex",BMJ Open,312,29

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe direct support professionals' experiences assisting adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in accessing virtual and in-person health care during COVID-19. METHODS: A content analysis was conducted on responses obtained from an online questionnaire distributed to 942 direct support professionals in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to report the type of visits that occurred and open text responses describing these visits were coded. RESULTS: Twenty four percent of direct support professionals reported supporting someone at an in-person medical appointment, 22% reported attending at least one video-based virtual appointment and 58% reported supporting at least one phone based virtual appointment in the first 5 months of the pandemic. They identified several barriers and facilitators with each type of visit which suggests there is no ""single way"" to provide health care to this group, but that optimal care depends on maximizing the fit between the person's abilities, the skill set of direct support professionals and health care providers, and the presenting health care issue.

Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and clinical outcome of respiratory viruses in hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, include patients aged between 0 and 18 who fulfilled Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for HAP. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, and a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was taken for the detection of respiratory viruses. All included patients were monitored until discharge to collect data on the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. All-cause 30-day mortality was also ascertained. Results: Four thousand three hundred twenty-seven patients were followed for 42,658 patient-days and 5,150 ventilator-days. Eighty-eight patients (2.03%) met the CDC criteria for HAP, 63 patients were included, and clinical and epidemiological characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between patients with virus associated healthcare-associated pneumonia (VAHAP) and those with non-viral healthcare-associated pneumonia (NVHAP). At least one respiratory virus was detected in 65% [95% CI (53–77)] of episodes of HAP, with a single viral pathogen observed in 53.9% and coinfection with 2 viruses in 11.1% of cases. The outcome in terms of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and the 30-day mortality did not show a significant difference between groups. Conclusions: In two-thirds of the patients a respiratory virus was identified. There was no difference in mortality or the rest of the clinical outcome variables. About half of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 10% died, which emphasizes the importance of considering these pathogens in nosocomial infections, since their identification can influence the decrease in hospital costs and be taken into account in infection control policies.","Torres-García, Margarita; Pérez Méndez, Brenda Berenice; Sánchez Huerta, José Luis; Villa Guillén, Mónica; Rementería Vazquez, Virydiana; Castro Diaz, Arturo Daniel; López Martinez, Briceida; Laris González, Almudena; Jiménez-Juárez, Rodolfo Norberto; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela",Front Pediatr,312,17

However, elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases often suffer from abnormal immune function and take multiple medications, which may complicate the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. Currently, there is no expert consensus on whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are suitable for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. AREAS COVERED: We searched Pubmed to conduct a systematic review of published studies, case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and expert guidelines on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegenerative diseases and the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccines. We also summarized the interaction between vaccines and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The compatibility of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with neurodegenerative diseases is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Vaccines enable the body to produce immunity by activating the body’s immune response. The pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is complex, and these diseases often involve abnormal immune function, which can substantially affect the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In short, this article provides recommendations for the use of vaccine candidates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.","Shi, Yan; Guo, Minna; Yang, Wenjing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhu, Bin; Yang, Ling; Yang, Chun; Liu, Cunming",Expert review of vaccines,312,16

This article examines changes in the legal protection of animals during this time and the impact this will have on research and scholarship in the law relating to animals. We examine whether the overall international treatment of animals has improved and how far the approach to the Animal Law curriculum should be influenced by the growth in concerns around climate change. In this context, we examine the development of the law of ecocide and the extent to which it addresses concerns around animal welfare across the globe. We suggest that those involved in the development of Animal Law, ethics and policy might usefully engage in a new vision of ecocide, which incorporates a clearer notion of ‘animal ecocide’. This new approach would enhance the international and national focus on animals in their own right, would recognise increasing knowledge of animal sentience and would move our responsibilities to them beyond anthropocentric approaches to environmental protection. We argue that the inclusion of a more specific reference to animal ecocide would contribute to the development of Animal Law and would lead to an enhanced relationship between Animal Law and attempts to protect the environment.","Legge, Debbie; Brooman, Simon",Liverp Law Rev,312,16

In this study, we identified factors that increase the risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL)- a diverse area that experienced some of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, during the first COVID-19 wave, in the UK. Methods We used multivariate logistic regression analysis on a linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older (registered with a GP practice in inner NEL) with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 February 2020 and 30 June 2020. We determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. Findings Over the study period 1,781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1,195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation while obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU and underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Importantly, we identified that having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR=4.75, 95%CI=(1.91,11.84), p=0.001). Additionally, having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR=2.34,95%CI=(1.55,3.54),p<0.001 and OR=2.40, 95%CI=(1.55,3.73), p<0.001 respec-tively) and death (OR=2.61, 95%CI=(1.59,4.28), p<0.001 and OR=4.07, 95% CI= (2.48,6.69), p<0.001 respectively). Interpretation Our findings confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected in the current and subsequent COVID-19 waves, including people with learning disabilities and multi-morbidity.","Cummings, L.; Ebyarimpa, I.; Cheetham, N.; Tzortziou Brown, V.; Brennan, K.; Panovska-Griffiths, J.",,312,16

METHODS: An Individual Space-Time Activity-based Model (ISTAM) was applied to simulate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures including: (1) refraining from social activities, (2) school closure and (3) household quarantine, for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in an urban area. RESULTS: Amongst the set of control measures tested, refraining from social activities with various compliance levels was relatively ineffective. Household quarantine was very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to 17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635-5403, that is, 63.7%-94.7% of the baseline value. When coupling control measures, household quarantine together with school closure was the most effective strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB) suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier implementation of control measures leads to greater efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic reproduction number, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Simulated results showed that household quarantine was the most effective control measure, while school closure and household quarantine implemented together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings given sufficient information about the given case and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale.","Yang, Yong; Atkinson, Peter M; Ettema, Dick",BMC Infect Dis,312,16

Many studies have introduced computational models to treat DTI prediction as a regression task, which directly predict the binding affinity of drug-target pairs. However, existing studies (i) ignore the essential correlations between atoms when encoding drug compounds and (ii) model the interaction of drug-target pairs simply by concatenation. Based on those observations, in this study, we propose an end-to-end model with multiple attention blocks to predict the binding affinity scores of drug-target pairs. Our proposed model offers the abilities to (i) encode the correlations between atoms by a relation-aware self-attention block and (ii) model the interaction of drug representations and target representations by the multi-head attention block. Experimental results of DTI prediction on two benchmark datasets show our approach outperforms existing methods, which are benefit from the correlation information encoded by the relation-aware self-attention block and the interaction information extracted by the multi-head attention block. Moreover, we conduct the experiments on the effects of max relative position length and find out the best max relative position length value [Formula: see text].

Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100°C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.","Sturman, Lawrence S.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Advances in Virus Research,312,16

The introduction of the increased tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), popularly called sugar tax (ST), and a mandatory programme of vaccinations are the strategies inciting the most vivid discussions in Polish society. The study was intended to assess the determinants of the attitudes of Polish society regarding the ST and to vaccinations. Methods: For the analysis, the data originating from the survey of a representative adult sample of Polish society (n = 1000) was used. The survey was based on computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). The assessment of the relationships between the selected variables and the opinions about the introduction of the ST and the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations were carried out using the chi(2) test and univariate logistic regression models. Results: The acceptance of the ST and vaccination showed a significant relationship to the level of health literacy (HL) but not to eHealth literacy (eHL). Respondents having a higher rather than lower HL; older rather than younger; married rather than singles; retired, or on a disability pension, rather than vocationally active and nonusers of the Internet rather than users were more likely to show an acceptance for both interventions. Those more frequently using health care services and those with chronic diseases showed a greater belief in the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. Conclusions: The relationship between the opinions of the two public health interventions analysed and the sociodemographic variables demonstrated similar patterns. Interestingly, the opinions were associated only with HL and not with eHL and users of the Internet were more sceptical about the interventions.","Duplaga, Mariusz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,312,16

The clock is part of the Health Portfolio’s celebration activities in 2019 of “100 Years of Health”, as the Department of Health was established in Canada in 1919. INTERVENTION: The intervention was the development of a clock on the Government of Canada website with linkage to calculators as a health promotion tool. The clock was built on the concept of the 2004 Chronic Disease Clock, which shows the number of deaths so far today, and so far this year. The clock was developed using a consultative approach, following a review of the original clock. OUTCOMES: The 2020 clock incorporates new data visualization concepts. New features, facilitated by improved technology, include: expansion to all causes of death; blinking red dots to enhance visual impact; and three clock versions (analogue, featuring a moving circle; digital, table format; and graphical, bar chart format). The clock also provides links to a number of health calculators, to allow people to seek personalized information to improve their health. IMPLICATIONS: The online health clock and health calculators are good examples of innovation in health risk communication tools for effective knowledge translation and dissemination. They inform people about health statistics (clock) and their health (calculators). The clock engages people in the context of the Canadian population, whereas the calculators provide personalized information about improving an individual’s future health.","Choi, Bernard C.

Although the infection is mild in most of the affected individuals, it may cause severe clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or cytokine storm leading to death. Children are affected less, and most experience a milder disease. As rheumatologists, we deal with the uncontrolled response of the immune system, and most of the drugs we use are either immune modulators or immunosuppressants. Thus, the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, our patients with rheumatic diseases constitute a vulnerable group in this pandemic. In this review, a systematic literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases, and 231 COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases have been identified.

As drugs and vaccines of COVID-19 remain in development, accurate virus detection plays a crucial role in the current public health crisis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) kits have been reliably used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas isothermal nucleic acid amplification-based point-of-care automated kits have also been considered as a simpler and rapid alternative. However, as these kits have only been developed and applied clinically within a short timeframe, their clinical performance has not been adequately evaluated to date. We describe a comparative study between a newly developed cross-priming isothermal amplification (CPA) kit (Kit A) and five RT-qPCR kits (Kits B–F) to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy. METHODS: Fifty-two clinical samples were used including throat swabs (n = 30), nasal swabs (n = 7), nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 7) and sputum specimens (n = 8), comprising confirmed (n = 26) and negative cases (n = 26). SARS-CoV-2 detection was simultaneously performed on each sample using six nucleic acid amplification kits. The sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) and the accuracy for each kit were assessed using clinical manifestation and molecular diagnoses as the reference standard. Reproducibility for RT-qPCR kits was evaluated in triplicate by three different operators using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive sample. On the basis of the six kits’ evaluation results, CPA kit (Kit A) and two RT-qPCR Kits (Kit B and F) were applied to the SARS-CoV-2 detection in close-contacts of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: For Kit A, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV/NPV and accuracy were 100%. Among the five RT-qPCR kits, Kits B, C and F had good agreement with the clinical diagnostic reports (Kappa ≥ 0.75); Kits D and E were less congruent (0.4 ≤ Kappa < 0.75). Differences between all kits were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The reproducibility of RT-qPCR kits was determined using a coefficients of variation (CV) between 0.95% and 2.57%, indicating good reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comparative study to evaluate CPA and RT-qPCR kits’ specificity and sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could serve as a reference for clinical laboratories, thus informing testing protocols amid the rapidly progressing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Shuang; Shi, Xiaolu; Chen, Qiongcheng; Jiang, Yixiang; Zuo, Le; Wang, Lei; Jiang, Min; Lin, Yiman; Fang, Shisong; Peng, Bo; Wu, Weihua; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Renli; Kwan, Patrick S.

The association of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to liposomes potentially enhances the immunogenic effect of vaccine antigens by increasing their surface concentration. Furthermore, the introduction of a universal immunoglobulin-binding domain can make liposomes targetable to virtually any desired receptor for which antibodies exist. METHODS: We developed a system for the production of recombinant proteins with GPI anchors and histidine tags and Strep-tags for simplified purification from cells. This system was applied to i) the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, ii) the promising Plasmodium falciparum vaccine antigen PfRH5 and iii) a doubled immunoglobulin Fc-binding domain termed ZZ from protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. As the GPI-attachment domain, the C-terminus of murine CD14 was used. After the recovery of these three recombinant proteins from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and association with liposomes, their vaccine potential and ability to target the CD4 receptor on lymphocytes in ex vivo conditions were tested. RESULTS: Upon immunization in mice, the PfRH5-GPI-loaded liposomes generated antibody titers of 10(3) to 10(4), and showed a 45% inhibitory effect on in vitro growth at an IgG concentration of 600 µg/mL in P. falciparum cultures. Using GPI-anchored ZZ to couple anti-CD4 antibodies to liposomes, we created immunoliposomes with a binding efficiency of 75% to CD4(+) cells in splenocytes and minimal off-target binding. CONCLUSIONS: Proteins are very effectively associated with liposomes via a GPI-anchor to form proteoliposome particles and these are useful for a variety of applications including vaccines and antibody-mediated targeting of liposomes. Importantly, the CHO-cell and GPI-tagged produced PfRH5 elicited invasion-blocking antibodies qualitatively comparable to other approaches.","Fotoran, Wesley L.; Kleiber, Nicole; Müntefering, Thomas; Liebau, Eva; Wunderlich, Gerhard",The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,312,1

Many medicinal plants have antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, wound healing etc. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to screen for potent inhibitors of N-terminal domain (NTD) of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of NTD of RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS coronavirus 2 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB 6VYO) and the structures of 100 different phytocompounds were retrieved from Pubchem. The receptor protein and ligands were prepared using Schrodinger’s Protein Preparation Wizard. Molecular docking was done by using the Schrodinger’s maestro 12.0 software. Drug likeness and toxicity of active phytocompounds was predicted by using Swiss adme, admetSAR and protox II online servers. Molecular dynamic simulation of the best three protein- ligand complexes (alizarin, aloe-emodin and anthrarufin) was performed to study the interaction stability. We have identified three potential active sites (named as A, B, C) on receptor protein for efficient binding of the phytocompounds.

Although investment in research has led to advances in improvements in outcomes, a lot still remains to be done to build research capacity in health. Like many other regions in the world, Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from a critical shortage of biostatisticians and clinical trial methodologists. METHODS: Funded through a Fogarty Global Health Training Program grant, the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa established a new Masters Program in Biostatistics which was launched in January 2017. In this paper, we describe the development of a biostatistical and clinical trials collaboration Module, adapted from a similar course offered in the Health Research Methodology program at McMaster University. DISCUSSION: Guided by three core principles (experiential learning; multi-/inter-disciplinary approach; and formal mentorship), the Module aims to advance biostatistical collaboration skills of the trainees by facilitating learning in how to systematically apply fundamental statistical and trial methodological knowledge in practice while strengthening some soft skills which are necessary for effective collaborations with other healthcare researchers to solve health problems. We also share some preliminary findings from the first four cohorts that took the Module in January–November 2018 to 2021. We expect that this Module can provide an example of how to improve biostatistical and clinical trial collaborations and accelerate research capacity building in low-resource settings.

METHODS: We report five cases of oropharyngeal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation requiring evaluation by otolaryngologists at George Washington University Hospital (GWUH) and Boston Medical Center (BMC) from March to April 2020. Institutional Review Board at both institutions exempted this study from informed consent because there were no identifiable patient characteristics, photographs, or imaging studies included. RESULTS: All five patients were managed conservatively; four required packing with Kerlix gauze by an otolaryngologist. Two patients had the additional requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and associated anticoagulation. Three patients improved with oropharyngeal packing; two had persistent bleeding. Three patients expired. Endotracheal tubes were repositioned less frequently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Intubated patients with COVID-19 may have an increased risk of oropharyngeal hemorrhage. This may be due to anticoagulation, prolonged intubation, or decreased frequency of endotracheal tube repositioning. Otolaryngologists should wear appropriate PPE when managing this hemorrhagic complication.","Mulcahy, Collin F.; Ghulam-Smith, Melissa; Mamidi, Ishwarya S.; Thakkar, Punam G.; Edwards, Heather; Tummala, Neelima; Tracy, Lauren F.",Am J Otolaryngol,312,26

In order to gain knowledge of their in vivo biodistribution it is important to develop imaging tools that allow us to track EVs over time and at the whole-body level. Radionuclide-based imaging (PET and SPECT) have properties that allow us to do so efficiently, mostly due to their high sensitivity, imaging signal tissue penetration, and accurate quantification. Furthermore, they can be easily translated from animals to humans. In this review, we summarise and discuss the different studies that have used PET or SPECT to study the behaviour of EVs in vivo. With a focus on the different radiolabelling methods used, we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each one, and the challenges of imaging EVs due to their variable stability and heterogeneity.","Khan, Azalea A.; T.

The use of PP in awake spontaneous breathing patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 was reported to improve oxygenation in few retrospective trials with small sample size. High-level evidence of awake PP for hypoxaemic patients with COVID-19 patients is still lacking. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol of this meta-trial is a prospective collaborative individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled open label superiority trials. This design is particularly adapted to a rapid scientific response in the pandemic setting. It will take place in multiple sites, among others in USA, Canada, Ireland, France and Spain. Patients will be followed up for 28 days. Patients will be randomised to receive whether awake PP and nasal high flow therapy or standard medical treatment and nasal high flow therapy. Primary outcome is defined as the occurrence rate of tracheal intubation or death up to day 28. An interim analysis plan has been set up on aggregated data from the participating research groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals were obtained in all participating countries. Results of the meta-trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Evaluation of such courses has thus far been on a small scale at single institutions. Further, systematic appraisal of the large volume of qualitative feedback generated by massive online e-learning courses manually is time consuming. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an e-learning course targeting medical students collaborating in an international cohort study, with semi-automated analysis of feedback using text mining and machine learning methods. METHOD: This study was based on a multi-centre cohort study exploring gastrointestinal recovery following elective colorectal surgery. Collaborators were invited to complete a series of e-learning modules on key aspects of the study and complete a feedback questionnaire on the modules. Quantitative data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed using text mining with most frequent words, sentiment analysis with the AFINN-111 and syuzhet lexicons and topic modelling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and eleventh collaborators from 24 countries completed the e-learning course; 1396 (86.7%) were medical students; 1067 (66.2%) entered feedback. 1031 (96.6%) rated the quality of the course a 4/5 or higher (mean 4.56; SD 0.58). The mean sentiment score using the AFINN was + 1.54/5 (5: most positive; SD 1.19) and + 0.287/1 (1: most positive; SD 0.390) using syuzhet. LDA generated topics consolidated into the themes: (1) ease of use, (2) conciseness and (3) interactivity. CONCLUSIONS: E-learning can have high user satisfaction for training investigators of clinical studies and medical students. Natural language processing may be beneficial in analysis of large scale educational courses.

To quantitatively assess these mitigation methods, we formulate an agent-based model of customer movement in a supermarket (which we represent by a network) with a simple virus transmission model based on the amount of time a customer spends in close proximity to infectious customers (which we call the exposure time). We apply our model to synthetic store and shopping data to show how one can use our model to estimate exposure time and thereby the number of infections due to human-to-human contact in stores and how to model different store interventions. The source code is openly available under https://github.com/fabianying/covid19-supermarket-abm.

Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses. Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone- and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity. Compounds 6, 8, 16 and 17, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (25) and 5-hydrazone (22) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold. These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin. The molecular docking analysis explained the SAR of these compounds around their binding mode to the target RSV F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment. The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.","Francesconi, Valeria; Cichero, Elena; Schenone, Silvia; Naesens, Lieve; Tonelli, Michele",Molecules,312,1

This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications. Results: We identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons. Conclusion: The Bayesian NMA identified superiority of several COVID-19 treatments over SOC in terms of mortality, requirement of MV, hospital discharge and viral clearance. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of current COVID-19 treatments and shed new light on further research and discovery of potential COVID-19 treatments.","Zhang, C.; Jin, H.; Wen, Y.; Yin, G.",,312,24

PARTICIPANTS: 7 124 HCWs aged 21–60 years. RESULTS: The COVID-19 response-involved HCWs had higher anxiety likelihood (OR (95% CI)=4.41 (3.53 to 5.51)), higher depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=3.31 (2.71 to 4.05)) and lower HRQoL score (coefficient, b(95% CI)=−2.14 (−2.89 to −1.38)), compared with uninvolved HCWs. Overall, HCWs who smoked or drank at unchanged/increased levels had higher likelihood of anxiety, depression and lower HRQoL scores; those with unchanged/healthier eating, unchanged/more physical activity and higher HL scores had lower likelihood of anxiety, depression and higher HRQoL scores. In comparison to uninvolved HCWs who smoked or drank at never/stopped/reduced levels, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased smoking or drinking had lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.34 (0.14 to 0.83)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.26 (0.11 to 0.60)), and lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.33 (0.15 to 0.74)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.24 (0.11 to 0.53)), respectively. In comparison with uninvolved HCWs who exercised at never/stopped/reduced levels, or with those in the lowest HL quartile, involved HCWs with unchanged/increased exercise or with one-quartile HL increment reported lower anxiety likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.50 (0.31 to 0.81)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.57 (0.45 to 0.71)), lower depression likelihood (OR(95% CI)=0.40 (0.27 to 0.61)) or (OR(95% CI)=0.63 (0.52 to 0.76)), and higher HRQoL scores (b(95% CI)=2.08 (0.58 to 3.58)), or (b(95% CI)=1.10 (0.42 to 1.78)), respectively.

Although rather low, such rates could have importance due to the uncommon fact that a large majority of the world population will be subjected to vaccination with the aforementioned vaccines in the following months and vaccination will most likely be necessary every season as for influenza vaccines. Health regulators have advised that any subject with a previous history of allergy to drugs or any component of the vaccines should not be vaccinated, however, certain misunderstanding exists since allergy to specific excipients in drugs and vaccines are in occasions misdiagnosed due to an absence of suspicion to specific excipients as allergenic triggers or due to inaccurate labeling or nomenclature.

Among the subgroup who had vaccine-related side effects, 66.7 % were females, 90.9 % were 55 or younger, 63.6 % were on polytherapy, 74 % had side effects for one day or less, and 95% were symptoms free by the end of the first-week post-vaccination. Symptoms were mild in 68% of the patients and moderate in 29.3 %. Most patients (93.9 %) did not report seizure worsening after vaccination. The relative risk of seizure worsening after the first and second doses of BNT162b2 and the first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccines was 1.027 (9 5% CI 0.891-1.183), 1.019 (95 % CI 0.928-1.119), and 1.026 (95% CI 0.929-1.134) respectively. After the first dose of BNT162b2, one patient reported the development of status epilepticus. Among the non-vaccinated group, 34.9 % were still indecisive, while 37.9% rejected the vaccination. Fear of adverse effects (42.9 %) and fear of epilepsy worsening (23.8 %) were the main reasons for vaccine hesitation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the two vaccines under consideration (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19) have a good safety profile and a low risk of epilepsy worsening among a cohort of PwE in Kuwait.","Massoud, Fathi; Ahmad, Samar Farouk; Hassan, Ahmed Medhat; Alexander, K.J; Al–Hashel, Jasem; Arabi, Maher",Seizure,312,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FMDV types O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012 were propagated in baby hamster kidney 21 (BHK21) and titrated then divided into five parts; the first part inactivated with heat, the second part inactivated with gamma radiation, the third part inactivated with UV light, the fourth part inactivated with binary ethylamine, and the last part inactivated with combination of binary ethylamine and formaldehyde (BEI+FA). Evaluate the method of inactivation via inoculation in BHK21, inoculation in suckling baby mice and complement fixation test then formulate vaccine using different methods of inactivation then applying the quality control tests to evaluate each formulated vaccine. RESULTS: The effect of heat, gamma radiation, and UV on the ability of replication of FMDV “O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012” was determined through BHK cell line passage. Each of the 9 virus aliquots titer 10(8) TCID(50) (3 for each strain) were exposed to 37, 57, and 77°C for 15, 30, and 45 min. Similarly, another 15 aliquots (5 for each strain) contain 1 mm depth of the exposed samples in petri-dish was exposed to UV light (252.7 nm wavelength: One foot distance) for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. Different doses of gamma radiation (10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 KGy) were applied in a dose rate 0.551 Gy/s for each strain and repeated 6 times for each dose. FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) were inactivated when exposed to heat ≥57°C for 15 min. The UV inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2) was obtained within 60 min and 65 min for type A/Iran05. The ideal dose for inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) with gamma radiation were 55-60 and 45 kGy, respectively. Inactivation of FMDV with binary was 20, 24 and 16 hr for O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively while inactivation by (BEI+FA) was determined after 18, 19 and 11 hr for O/pan-Asia, A/Iran 05, and SAT-2/2012, respectively. The antigenicity of control virus before inactivation was 1/32, it was not changed after inactivation in case of gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) and slightly decrease to 1/16 in case of binary and declined to 1/2, 1/4 in case of heat and UV inactivation, respectively. The immune response induced by inactivated FMD vaccines by gamma radiation and (BEI+FA) lasted to 9 months post-vaccination, while the binary only still up to 8 months post-vaccination but heat and UV-inactivated vaccines were not effective. CONCLUSION: Gamma radiation could be considered a good new inactivator inducing the same results of inactivated vaccine by binary with formaldehyde (BEI+FA).","Mahdy, Safy El din; Hassanin, Amr Ismail; Gamal El-Din, Wael Mossad; Ibrahim, Ehab El-Sayed; Fakhry, Hiam Mohamed",Vet World,312,32

Binding of the virus to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important step in the infection mechanism. However, it is unknown if ACE2 expression in patients with chronic lung diseases (CLDs), such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), or pulmonary fibrosis (PF), is changed as compared to controls. We used lung samples from patients with COPD (n = 28), IPAH (n = 10), and PF (n = 10) as well as healthy control donor (n = 10) tissue samples to investigate the expression of ACE2 and related cofactors that might influence the course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Expression levels of the ACE2 receptor, the putative receptor CD147/BSG, and the viral entry cofactors TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), EZR, and FURIN were determined by quantitative PCR and in open‐access RNA sequencing datasets. Immunohistochemical and single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analyses were used for localization and coexpression, respectively. Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) plasma levels were analyzed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. In COPD as compared to donor, IPAH, and PF lung tissue, gene expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and EZR was significantly elevated, but circulating sACE2 levels were significantly reduced in COPD and PF plasma compared to healthy control and IPAH plasma samples. Lung tissue expressions of FURIN and CD147/BSG were downregulated in COPD. None of these changes were associated with changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. Histological analysis revealed coexpression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Ezrin in bronchial regions and epithelial cells. This was confirmed by scRNAseq analysis. There were no significant expression changes of the analyzed molecules in the lung tissue of IPAH and idiopathic PF as compared to control. In conclusion, we reveal increased ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in lung tissue with a concomitant decrease of protective sACE2 in COPD patients. These changes represent the possible risk factors for an increased susceptibility of COPD patients to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Fließer, Elisabeth; Birnhuber, Anna; Marsh, Leigh M; Gschwandtner, Elisabeth; Klepetko, Walter; Olschewski, Horst; Kwapiszewska, Grazyna",J Pathol Clin Res,312,11

The objective of this review is to quantify the risk of COVID-19 among surgeons, and explore whether facemask can minimise the risk of COVID-19 among surgeons. A systematised review was carried out by searching MEDLINE to locate items on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or COVID-19 in relation to health care workers (HCWs) especially those work in surgical specialities including surgical nurses and intensivists. Additionally, systematic reviews that assessed the effectiveness of facemask against viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, among HCWs were identified. Data from identified articles were abstracted, synthesised and summarised. Fourteen primary studies that provided data on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or experience among surgeons and 11 systematic reviews that provided evidence of the effectiveness of facemask (and other personal protective equipment) were summarised. Although the risk of COVID-19 could not be quantified precisely among surgeons, about 14% of HCWs including surgeons had COVID-19, there could be variations depending on settings. Facemask was found to be somewhat protective against COVID-19, but the HCWs’ compliance was highly variable ranging from zero to 100%. Echoing surgical societies’ guidelines we continue to recommend facemask use among surgeons to prevent COVID-19.","Khalil, Mohammad Ibrahim; Banik, Gouri Rani; Mansoor, Sarab; Alqahtani, Amani S; Rashid, Harunor",World J Clin Cases,312,1

Patients with severe disease show hyperactivation of the immune system, which can affect multiple organs besides the lungs. Here, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a process known as immunothrombosis, in which activated neutrophils and monocytes interact with platelets and the coagulation cascade, leading to intravascular clot formation in small and larger vessels. Microthrombotic complications may contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other organ dysfunctions. Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing immunothrombosis may therefore be useful. Several antithrombotic and immunomodulating drugs have been proposed as candidates to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection pathogenesis and how it contributes to critical illness and its complications may help to improve risk stratification and develop targeted therapies to reduce the acute and long-term consequences of this disease.","Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchié, Alessandra; Dagna, Lorenzo; Martinod, Kimberly; Dixon, Dave L.; Van Tassell, Benjamin W.; Dentali, Francesco; Montecucco, Fabrizio; Massberg, Steffen; Levi, Marcel; Abbate, Antonio",Nat Rev Immunol,312,1

In this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and São Paulo state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemics. In both cases we see strong evidence that the adoption of social distancing measures contributed to a slower increase in the number of deceased individuals when compared to the baseline of no reduction in the infection rate. Both for Lombardy and São Paulo we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic.","Neves, Armando G.M.; Guerrero, Gustavo",Physica D,312,1

However, nursing and care staff we contacted expressed infection control concerns. Little related research has been published. We assessed (i) how microbiologically contaminated robot animals become during use by older people within a care home and (ii) efficacy of a cleaning procedure. METHODS: This study had two stages. In stage one we assessed microbial load on eight robot animals after interaction with four care home residents, and again following cleaning by a researcher. Robot animals provided a range of shell-types, including fur, soft plastic, and solid plastic. Stage two involved a similar process with two robot animals, but a care staff member conducted cleaning. The cleaning process involved spraying with anti-bacterial product, brushing fur-type shells, followed by vigorous top-to-tail cleaning with anti-bacterial wipes on all shell types. Two samples were taken from each of eight robots in stage one and two robots in stage two (20 samples total). Samples were collected using contact plate stamping and evaluated using aerobic colony count and identification (gram stain, colony morphology, coagulase agglutination). Colony counts were measured by colony forming units per square centimetre (CFU/cm(2)). RESULTS: Most robots acquired microbial loads well above an acceptable threshold of 2.5 CFU/cm(2) following use. The bacteria identified were micrococcus species, coagulase negative staphylococcus, diptheriods, aerobic spore bearers, and staphylococcus aureus, all of which carry risk for human health. For all devices the CFU/cm(2) reduced to well within accepted limits following cleaning by both researcher and care staff member. CONCLUSIONS: Companion robots will acquire significant levels of bacteria during normal use. The simple cleaning procedure detailed in this study reduced microbial load to acceptable levels in controlled experiments. Further work is needed in the field and to check the impact on the transmission of viruses.","Bradwell, Hannah Louise; Johnson, Christopher W.; Lee, John; Winnington, Rhona; Thill, Serge; Jones, Ray B.",PLoS One,312,28

Results Fourteen surgeons (8 male, 6 female) were interviewed. The majority (n=11, 78.6%) were NCHDs. Significant themes determined included ‘impacts’ on a variety of constructs such as performance, self-reported fatigue and wellbeing. Training themes elucidated included the effects of the cancellation of elective admissions on reduced operative exposure for trainees. Senior surgical staff were particularly focused on increased complexity in patient management. New policy requirements such as personal protective equipment use and novel rotas have had implications for aspects of work engagement. The pandemic and subsequent national restrictions imposed has afforded opportunities for improved well-being but also resulted in greater solitude in surgeons. Conclusions Rhetoric surrounding fatigue management and virus control dominates the conversation on the relationship between COVID-19 and surgery. Tipping the balance back to parity of fatigue management with service delivery in surgery will be key for sustainability of the surgical workforce.","Whelehan, Dale F.; Connelly, Tara M.; Ridgway, Paul F.",Surgeon,312,16

A cohort of Red Angus calves (n = 74) were followed from birth to weaning at an altitude of 975 m. Calves were weaned at 172 ± 14 d when their mPAP was measured and whole blood collected. Thirty calves that had been treated for BRD (34 to 45 d prior) and 30 calves that had not required treatment for BRD were sampled. Treatment for BRD had no effect on mPAP (P = 0.37). Mean mPAP was 48 ± 8 mm Hg (± SD) with a minimum of 34 mm Hg and a maximum at 69 mm Hg. Weaning weight and sex tended to be associated with mPAP, but they explained just 5% of the variation in mPAP (P = 0.08; Adj. r(2) = 0.05). Fibrinogen (P = 0.008) and absolute lymphocyte count (P = 0.06) were negatively associated with mPAP, whereas absolute monocyte count was positively associated with mPAP (P = 0.01). The findings of this study suggest that pre-weaning treatment for BRD does not increase a calves’ post-weaning risk of congestive right heart failure.

The aim of this study was to determine the analgesic and sensorial benefits of two different amylmetacresol/2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenge formulation variants, AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, compared with an unflavoured, non-medicated placebo lozenge in the relief of acute sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, single-dose study, 225 adult patients with acute sore throat were randomly assigned to receive either one AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (n = 77), one AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge (n = 74) or one unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge (matched for size, shape and demulcency; n = 74). After baseline assessments, patients received their assigned lozenge and completed four rating assessments at 11 timepoints from 1 to 120 minutes post dose. Analgesic properties were assessed by comparing severity of throat soreness and sore throat relief ratings. Difficulty in swallowing, throat numbness, functional, sensorial and emotional benefits were also assessed. RESULTS: Both the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge induced significant analgesic, functional, sensorial and emotional effects compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. Sore throat relief, improvements in throat soreness and difficulty in swallowing, and throat numbness were observed as early as 1-5 minutes, and lasted up to 2 hours post dose. Sensorial benefits of warming and cooling associated with the AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, respectively, were experienced soon after first dose, and in the case of the latter, it lasted long after the lozenge had dissolved. Emotional benefits of feeling better, happier, less distracted and less frustrated were reported in those taking either of the AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants, with no differences in adverse events compared with the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. CONCLUSIONS: AMC/DCBA Warm and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenges are well-tolerated and effective OTC treatment options, offering functional, sensorial and emotional benefits to patients with acute sore throat, over and above that of the rapid efficacy effects provided.

The meeting brought together academics, industry representatives, research sponsors, regulators, government advisors and representatives of international public health agencies from a broad geographical background. Discussions were held under Chatham House rules. High-throughput screening of new vaccine antigens and candidates was seen as a driving force for vaccine discovery. Multi-stakeholder, small-scale manufacturing facilities capable of rapid production of clinical grade vaccines are currently too few and need to be expanded. In both the human and veterinary areas, there is a need for tiered regulatory standards, differentially tailored for experimental and commercial vaccines, to allow accelerated vaccine efficacy testing. Improved cross-fertilization of knowledge between industry and academia, and between human and veterinary vaccine developers, could lead to more rapid application of promising approaches and technologies to new product development. Identification of best-practices and development of checklists for product development plans and implementation programmes were seen as low-cost opportunities to shorten the timeline for vaccine progression from the laboratory bench to the people who need it.","Bregu, Migena; Draper, Simon J.; Hill, Adrian V.

It is mainly epidemic in Asia with an estimated 69,000 cases occurring per year. However, no approved agents are available for the treatment of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of existing drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new antiviral agents. Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV infection and using these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing for JEV infection. In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV infection and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 286 genes that participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems biology methods. The enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes identified by our methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways and immune response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target these genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, we evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in mice, alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains caused by JEV infection. This work provides an agent with new indication to treat JEV infection.","Lv, Bo-Min; Tong, Xin-Yu; Quan, Yuan; Liu, Meng-Yuan; Zhang, Qing-Ye; Song, Yun-Feng; Zhang, Hong-Yu",Molecules,312,1

One particular sialic acid called N‐glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is widely expressed on most mammalian tissues, but is not easily detectable on human cells. In fact, it provokes an immune response in adult humans. The human deficiency of Neu5Gc is explained by an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding CMP‐N‐acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, the rate‐limiting enzyme in generating Neu5Gc in cells of other mammals. This deficiency also results in an excess of the precursor sialic acid N‐acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in humans. This mutation appears universal to modern humans, occurred sometime after our last common ancestor with the great apes, and happens to be one of the first known human‐great ape genetic differences with an obvious biochemical readout. While the original selection mechanisms and major biological consequences of this human‐specific mutation remain uncertain, several interesting clues are currently being pursued. First, there is evidence that the human condition can explain differences in susceptibility or resistance to certain microbial pathogens. Second, the functions of some endogenous receptors for sialic acids in the immune system may be altered by this difference. Third, despite the lack of any obvious alternate pathway for synthesis, Neu5Gc has been reported in human tumors and possibly in human fetal tissues, and traces have even been detected in normal human tissues. One possible explanation is that this represents accumulation of Neu5Gc from dietary sources of animal origin. Finally, a markedly reduced expression of hydroxylase in the brains of other mammals raises the possibility that the human‐specific mutation of this enzyme could have played a role in human brain evolution.

Physical decontamination methods like Ultraviolet radiation has shown to be promising. Here, we describe a novel device emitting ultraviolet C radiation (UVC), called NuvaWave, to rapidly and efficiently inactivate SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was dried on a chambered glass slides and introduced in a NuvaWave robotic testing unit. The robot simulated waving NuvaWave over the virus at a pre-determined UVC radiation dose of 1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds. Post-UVC exposure, virus was recovered and titered by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. We observed that relative control (no UVC exposure), exposure of the virus to UVC for one or two seconds resulted in a >2.9 and 3.8 log10 reduction in viral titers, respectively. Exposure of the virus to UVC for four or eight seconds resulted in a reduction of greater than 4.7-log10 reduction in viral titers. The NuvaWave device inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces to below the limit of detection within one to four seconds of UVC irradiation. This device can be deployed to rapidly disinfect surfaces from SARS-CoV-2, and to assist in mitigating its spread in a variety of settings.","Dwivedi, Varun; Park, Jun-Gyu; Grenon, Stephen; Medendorp, Nicholas; Hallam, Cory; Torrelles, Jordi B.; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Kulkarni, Viraj",bioRxiv,312,1

Eosinophils have been studied as biomarkers of bacterial infection and prognostic factors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and AECOPD. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether eosinophils could be used to determine bacterial infection in AECOPD events. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients admitted to Korea University Guro Hospital for AECOPD between January 2011 and May 2017. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, results of previous pulmonary function tests, treatment information during the admission period, and history of pulmonary treatment were collected before admission. Results: A total of 736 AECOPD events were eligible for inclusion and were divided into two groups based on the eosinophil count: those involving eosinophil counts of less than 2% (546 events) and those involving counts of 2% or more (190 events). In univariate analysis, the only bacterial pathogen identification events and bacterial-viral pathogen co-identification events were significantly more frequent in the group with eosinophil counts of less than 2% (P=0.010 and P=0.001, respectively). In logistic regression analysis, the rates of only bacterial pathogen identification [odds ratios =1.744; 95% confidence interval, 1.107–2.749; P=0.017] and bacterial-viral pathogen co-identification [odds ratios=2.075; 95% confidence interval, 1.081–3.984; P=0.028] were higher in the group with eosinophil count less than 2%. Conclusion: In conclusion, eosinophil counts of less than 2% are potential indicators of a bacterial infection in AECOPD events. Eosinophils could thus serve as a reference for the use of antibiotics in AECOPD treatment.","Choi, Juwhan; Oh, Jee Youn; Lee, Young Seok; Hur, Gyu Young; Lee, Sung Yong; Shim, Jae Jeong; Kang, Kyung Ho; Min, Kyung Hoon",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,312,1

Because of its extremely fast spreading, the attention of the global scientific community is now focusing on slowing down, containing and finally stopping the spread of this disease. This requires the concerted action of researchers and practitioners of many related fields, raising, as always in such situations the question, of what kind of research has to be conducted, what are the priorities, how has research to be coordinated and who needs to be involved. In other words, what are the characteristics of the response of the global research community on the challenge? In the present paper, we attempt to characterise, quantify and measure the response of academia to international public health emergencies in a comparative bibliometric study of multiple outbreaks. In addition, we provide a preliminary review of the global research effort regarding the defeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. From our analysis of six infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including COVID-19, we find that academia always responded quickly to public health emergencies with a sharp increase in the number of publications immediately following the declaration of an outbreak by the WHO. In general, countries/regions place emphasis on epidemics in their own region, but Europe and North America are also concerned with outbreaks in other, developed and less developed areas through conducting intensive collaborative research with the core countries/regions of the outbreak, such as in the case of Ebola in Africa. Researches in the fields of virology, infectious diseases and immunology are the most active, and we identified two characteristic patterns in global science distinguishing research in Europe and America that is more focused on public health from that conducted in China and Japan with more emphasis on biomedical research and clinical pharmacy, respectively. Universities contribute slightly less than half to the global research output, and the vast majority of research funding originates from the public sector. Our findings on how academia responds to emergencies could be beneficial to decision-makers in research and health policy in creating and adjusting anti-epidemic/-pandemic strategies.","Zhang, Lin; Zhao, Wenjing; Sun, Beibei; Huang, Ying; Glänzel, Wolfgang",Scientometrics,312,28

The gym is an environment rich in microorganisms, and careful hygiene is a necessity to keep infections at bay. Exercise centers strive for better hygiene compliance among their members. This effort has become essential in light of the current pandemic. Several experimental studies show that others’ physical presence, or the “illusion” of being watched, may alter behavior. This article reports on a natural field experiment testing one specific social nudge intended to increase gym members’ hygienic behavior. The study was conducted before the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. A picture of “observing eyes” was attached to paper dispensers and cleanser spray bottles at two different gyms in Norway. A reversal design, also called an ABA design, with and without the nudge’s presence, was used to investigate the impact on gym members’ hygienic behavior. A follow-up study was conducted in one of the centers to investigate whether the nudge stimuli would function over time. The study included 254 individual choice situations during nine observation sessions conducted over 9 weeks. The results from both centers provide evidence of a strong effect of the nudge. However, the effect decreased during the follow-up study. These findings support previous research indicating that human behavior is influenced by the presence of implicit observation cues – in this case – observing eyes. However, insights into the long-term effect of implicit observation cues are still needed since the salience of the stimuli faded over time.","Mobekk, Hilde; Hessen, Dag Olav; Fagerstrøm, Asle; Jacobsen, Hanne",Front Psychol,312,1

We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions. Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts. The chi-square test, Student’s t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups. Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression. Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram. RESULTS: Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different. Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1–3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027). Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417). Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000). The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. • A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.

Doctors, researchers, and experts are focusing on alternative ways for the rapid detection of COVID-19, such as the development of automatic COVID-19 detection systems. In this paper, an automated detection scheme named EMCNet was proposed to identify COVID-19 patients by evaluating chest X-ray images. A convolutional neural network was developed focusing on the simplicity of the model to extract deep and high-level features from X-ray images of patients infected with COVID-19. With the extracted features, binary machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine, decision tree, and AdaBoost) were developed for the detection of COVID-19. Finally, these classifiers’ outputs were combined to develop an ensemble of classifiers, which ensures better results for the dataset of various sizes and resolutions. In comparison with other recent deep learning-based systems, EMCNet showed better performance with 98.91% accuracy, 100% precision, 97.82% recall, and 98.89% F1-score. The system could maintain its great importance on the automatic detection of COVID-19 through instant detection and low false negative rate.","Saha, Prottoy; Sadi, Muhammad Sheikh; Islam, Md Milon",Inform Med Unlocked,312,20

Unbeknownst to the user, the dose of active ingredients in substances of abuse can vary substantially between different products because of manufacturing practices or improper storage. Even naturally occurring substances of abuse can have extensive dosage variability because of effects of the growing season and conditions, or differences in harvesting, storage, or manufacture of the finished products. Many illicit substances are adulterated, to make up for intentional underdosing or to enhance the effect of the intended active ingredient. These adulterants can be dangerous and produce direct cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic, or dermatologic reactions or obscure adverse effects. Finally, an illicit substance can be contaminated or substituted for another one during its manufacture, leading to differences in adverse events, adverse event severity, or the drug interaction profile. Substances can be contaminated with microbes that induce infections or heavy metals that can damage organs or cause cancer. This milieu of undisclosed substances can also induce drug interactions. For reasons that are discussed, individuals who use substances of abuse are at increased risk of morbidity or mortality if they develop coronavirus disease 2019. Health professionals who treat patients with acute, urgent events associated with substances of abuse, or those treating the chronic manifestations of addiction, need to appreciate the complex and variable composition of substances of abuse and their potential health effects.","White, C Michael; Browne, Thom; Nafziger, Anne N",J Clin Pharmacol,312,24

Dromedary camels have been implicated due to reports that some confirmed cases were exposed to camels. Risk factors for MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections in humans are incompletely understood. This study aimed to describe the demographic characteristics, mortality rate, clinical manifestations and comorbidities with confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. METHODS: Retrospective chart review were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia who reported to the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Saudi Arabia and WHO between April 23, 2014 and August 31, 2015. Patients’ charts were also reviewed for demographic information, mortality, comorbidities, clinical presentations, health care facility and presented with descriptive and comparative statistics using non parametric binomial test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Confirmed cases of male patients (61.1%) exceeded those of female patients (38.9%). Infections among Saudi patients (62.6%) exceeded those among non-Saudi patients (37.4%; P = 0.001). The majority of the patients were aged 21–40 years (37.4%) or 41–60 years (35.8%); 43 (22.6%) were aged >61 years, and (8) 4.2% were aged 0–20 years. There was a difference in mortality between confirmed MERS-CoV cases (63.7% alive versus 36.3% dead cases, respectively). Furthermore, fever with cough and shortness of breath (SOB) (n = 39; 20.5%), fever with cough (n = 29; 15.3%), fever (n = 18; 9.5%), and fever with SOB (n = 13; 6.8%), were the most common clinical manifestations associated with confirmed MERS-CoV cases. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV is considered an epidemic in Saudi Arabia. The results of the present study showed that the frequency of cases is higher among men than women, in Saudi patients than non-Saudi, and those between 21 to 60 years are most affected. Further studies are required to improve the surveillance associated with MERS-CoV to get definite and clear answers and better understanding of the MERS-CoV outbreak as well the source, and route of infection transmission in Saudi Arabia.","Aleanizy, Fadilah Sfouq; Mohmed, Nahla; Alqahtani, Fulwah Y.; El Hadi Mohamed, Rania Ali",BMC Infect Dis,312,7

We aimed at assessing tidal volume (V(T)) delivery and air recirculation during expiration when one ventilator is divided into 2 test-lungs. The study was performed in a research laboratory in a medical ICU of a University hospital. An ICU (V500) and a lower-level ventilator (Elisée 350) were attached to two test-lungs (QuickLung) through a dedicated flow-splitter. A 50 mL/cmH(2)O Compliance (C) and 5 cmH(2)O/L/s Resistance (R) were set in both A and B test-lungs (A C50R5 / B C50R5, step1), A C50-R20 / B C20-R20 (step 2), A C20-R20 / B C10-R20 (step 3), and A C50-R20 / B C20-R5 (step 4). Each ventilator was set in volume and pressure control mode to deliver 800mL V(T). We assessed V(T) from a pneumotachograph placed immediately before each lung, pendelluft air, and expiratory resistance (circuit and valve). Values are median (1(st)-3(rd) quartiles) and compared between ventilators by non-parametric tests. Between Elisée 350 and V500 in volume control V(T) in A/B test- lungs were 381/387 vs. 412/433 mL in step 1, 501/270 vs. 492/370 mL in step 2, 509/237 vs. 496/332 mL in step 3, and 496/281 vs. 480/329 mL in step 4. In pressure control the corresponding values were 373/336 vs. 430/414 mL, 416/185 vs. 322/234 mL, 193/108 vs. 176/ 92 mL and 422/201 vs. 481/329mL, respectively (P<0.001 between ventilators at each step for each volume). Pendelluft air volume ranged between 0.7 to 37.8 ml and negatively correlated with expiratory resistance in steps 2 and 3. The lower-level ventilator performed closely to the ICU ventilator. In the clinical setting, these findings suggest that, due to dependence of V(T) to C, pressure control should be preferred to maintain adequate V(T) at least in one patient when C and/or R changes abruptly and monitoring of V(T) should be done carefully. Increasing expiratory resistance should reduce pendelluft volume.","Guérin, Claude; Cour, Martin; Stevic, Neven; Degivry, Florian; L’Her, Erwan; Louis, Bruno; Argaud, Laurent",PLoS One,312,29

In the context of Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines integrating quantitative recommendations for sleep, SB, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), this study aimed to examine the associations between meeting guidelines and mental health among college students. The study used a cross-sectional sample of 1846 Chinese college students surveyed online in August 2020. Through network analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance, the individual and combined associations between meeting 24-hour movement guidelines and the levels of depression and anxiety after adjusting sociodemographic factors were analyzed. Results indicated that meeting the sleep guideline had stronger associations with depression and anxiety than meeting the SB or MVPA guideline. Specifically, compared to meeting no guidelines, meeting the sleep guideline (alone or in combination with other guidelines) was associated with significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety; meeting both SB and MVPA guidelines was also associated with a significantly lower level of depression. Hence, meeting more guidelines, especially adhering to a healthy sleep routine, may play an important role in promoting the mental health of young adults.","Liang, Kaixin; de Lucena Martins, Clarice Maria; Chen, Si-Tong; Clark, Cain Craig Truman; Duncan, Michael Joseph; Bu, He; Huang, Liuyue; Chi, Xinli",Healthcare (Basel),312,20

While research has focused on the effectiveness of, and adherence to, these interventions, less attention has been paid to their implementation in practice and what aspects of the therapist role support success. An understanding of the key factors related to the therapist role and intervention delivery is required if these iCBTs are to be applied in routine clinical care and outcomes optimized. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is greater emphasis on allowing patients access to remote therapies. We report the experiences and reflections of 4 therapists and their 2 supervisors in delivering an online, therapist-supported intervention in a randomized controlled trial for children and young people with tic disorders (the Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics [ORBIT] trial). Themes discussed include the importance of training, supervision, creating support documents/manuals, and record keeping. Alongside this are communication strategies used by therapists to encourage patient adherence and treatment effectiveness. These include rapport building, treatment personalization, and suggestions for overcoming non-engagement. These reflections offer important considerations for the delivery of iCBTs as well as implications associated with the implementation of these interventions in existing services and future research studies. We share thoughts on where iCBTs may sit in a stepped care model, how services may deal with comorbid conditions, and the potential role of iCBTs in collecting clinical data.","Chamberlain, Liam R; Hall, Charlotte L; Andrén, Per; Davies, E Bethan; Kilgariff, Joseph; Kouzoupi, Natalia; Murphy, Tara; Hollis, Chris",JMIR Ment Health,312,5

Previous studies revealed the binding potential of several FDA-approved drugs towards specific targets of SARS-CoV-2; however, limited studies are focused on the structural and molecular basis of interaction of these drugs towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present study aimed to predict the binding potential of six FDA drugs towards fifteen protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 and propose the structural and molecular basis of the interaction by molecular docking and dynamic simulation. Based on the literature survey, fifteen potential targets of SARS-CoV-2, and six FDA drugs (Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, and Ritonavir) were selected. The binding potential of individual drug towards the selected targets was predicted by molecular docking in comparison with the binding of the same drugs with their usual targets. The stabilities of the best-docked conformations were confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and energy calculations. Among the selected drugs, Ritonavir and Lopinavir showed better binding towards the prioritized targets with minimum binding energy (kcal/mol), cluster-RMS, number of interacting residues, and stabilizing forces when compared with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, later drugs demonstrated better binding when compared to the binding with their usual targets. Remdesvir showed better binding to the prioritized targets in comparison with the binding of Chloroquine, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine, but showed lesser binding potential when compared to the interaction between Ritonavir and Lopinavir and the prioritized targets. The structural and molecular basis of interactions suggest that the FDA drugs can be repurposed towards multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2, and the present computational models provide insights on the scope of repurposed drugs against COVID-19.","Skariyachan, Sinosh; Gopal, Dharshini; Chakrabarti, Shweta; Kempanna, Priya; Uttarkar, Akshay; Muddebihalkar, Aditi G.; Niranjan, Vidya",Comput Biol Med,312,1

When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. METHODS: Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, P-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. RESULTS: Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; P = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","Sarfraz, Azza; Sarfraz, Zouina; Barrios, Alanna; Agadi, Kuchalambal; Thevuthasan, Sindhu; Pandav, Krunal; KC, Manish; Sarfraz, Muzna; Rad, Pedram; Michel, George",J Prim Care Community Health,312,1

Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) are crucial to the practise of dentistry; it is imperative to understand the inherent risks of viral dispersion associated with AGPs and the efficacy of available mitigation strategies. In a dental surgery setting, crown preparation and root canal access procedures were performed with an air turbine or electric speed-controlled hand-piece, with mitigation via rubber dam or high-volume aspiration and a no mitigation control. A phantom head was used with a 1.5 mL flow of artificial saliva infected with {Phi}6 bacteriophage (a surrogate virus for SARS-CoV-2) at ~108 plaque forming units mL-1, reflecting the upper limits of reported salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels. Bioaerosol dispersal was measured using agar settle plates lawned with the bacteriophage's host, Pseudomonas syringae. Viral air concentrations were assessed using MicroBio MB2 air sampling, and particle quantities using Kanomax 3889 GEO particle counters. Compared to an air turbine, the electric hand-piece reduced settled bioaerosols by 99.72%, 100.00% and 100.00% for no mitigation, aspiration and rubber dam, respectively. Bacteriophage concentrations in the air were reduced by 99.98%, 100.00% and 100.00%, with the same mitigation strategies. Use of the electric hand-piece with high-volume aspiration, resulted in no detectable bacteriophage, both on settle plates and in air samples taken 6-10-minutes post-procedure. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the aerosolization of active virus as a marker for risk determination in the dental setting. Whilst this model represents a worst-case scenario for possible SARS-CoV-2 dispersal, these data showed that the use of electric hand-pieces can vastly reduce the risk of viral aerosolization, and therefore remove the need for clinic fallow time. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the use of particle analysis alone cannot provide sufficient insight to understand bioaerosol infection risk.","Vernon, J. J.; Black, E. V.

Ranking of top three illness presentations changed across the pandemic weeks. Breathing difficulty dropped from first (300, 25%) to second (117, 21%) to third (59, 11%) (p<0.001). Abdominal pain rose from the third pre-lockdown (87, 7%) and lockdown weeks 1–3 (37, 7%) to second in weeks 4–6 (62, 12%; p=0.004). Fever ranked second (235, 19%) in pre-lockdown and first in weeks 1–3 (134, 24%) and weeks 4–6 (94, 18%; p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a 50% reduction, there was no significant change in acuity of illness. Rank of illness presentations changed, with abdominal pain ranking second and fever first, an important change from previous, which should prompt further research into causes. CYP-specific public health messaging and guidance for primary care are required in this second wave to ensure access to appropriate emergency services.","Shanmugavadivel, Dhurgshaarna; Liu, Jo-Fen; Gilhooley, Colin; Elsaadany, Loai; Wood, Damian",BMJ Paediatr Open,312,26

Serial changes can help in monitoring the patients in conjunction with the clinical status of these patients in a hospital setting. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the patterns of radiological findings on chest radiograph (CXR) for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients on initial presentation to the emergency medical services (EMS) on admission and to assess the progression and resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, patients who presented to EMS of a multispeciality hospital as suspected or confirmed Covid-19 on consecutive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CXR was examined for findings of haziness, patterns and distribution of opacities. Progression and regression of findings in serial CXR were studied and evaluated with the clinical and laboratory parameters. High resolution CT (HRCT) chest was performed initially for some patients. RESULTS: 756 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in our study who had initial CXR. 510 (67.46%) of our patients with positive initial RT-PCR showed abnormal baseline CXR. The abnormal findings were described as haziness akin to ground glass opacities (GGO) on CT, peripheral opacities, patchy parenchymal opacities and consolidation. Peripheral opacities and lower zone distribution were the commonest pattern of CXR abnormalities with bilateral involvement. The severity of findings on serial CXR and radiographic regression was studied along with follow-up to assess response to treatment. Forty-six patients showed features of acute lung injury (ALI). Complications and new CXR findings were reported for patients who were given ventilator support. CONCLUSION: CXR is a valuable baseline radiological investigation on hospital admission in symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 presenting to the EMS as it helps to monitor the progress and regression of the disease in conjunction with clinical findings.","Kohli, Anirudh; Hande, Pradipta C; Chugh, Shivam",Indian J Radiol Imaging,312,29

To support this alternative living which can be in contrast to various other types of assisted living options, modes of monitoring technology need to be explored and studied in order to determine a balance between the preservation of privacy and adequacy of sensed information for better estimation and visualization of movements and activities. In this paper, we explore such monitoring paradigm on how a network of RGB-D sensors can be utilized for this purpose. This type of sensor offers both visual and depth sensing modalities from the scene where the information can be fused and coded for better protection of privacy. For this purpose, we introduce the novel notion of passive observer. This observer is only triggered by detecting the absence of movements of older adults in the scene. This is accomplished by classifying and localizing objects in the monitoring scene from both before and after the detection of movements. A deep learning tool is utilized for visual classification of known objects in the physical scene followed by virtual reality reconstructing of the scene where the shape and location of objects are recreated. Such reconstruction can be used as a visual summary in order to identify objects which were handled by an older adult in-between observation. The simplified virtual scene can be used, for example, by caregivers or monitoring personnel in order to assist in detecting any anomalies. This virtual visualization can offer a high level of privacy protection without having any direct visual access to the monitoring scene. In addition, using the scene graph representation, an automatic decision-making tool is proposed where spatial relationships between the objects can be used to estimate the expected activities. The results of this paper are demonstrated through two case studies.","Payandeh, Shahram; Park, Jim",Int J Telemed Appl,312,33

This study aimed to evaluate the comparative in vitro efficacy and rate of onset of action of a range of formulations of PVP-I and other commonly used antiseptics. Methods: The antimicrobial efficacy of a range of antiseptics and antimicrobial agents used for skin, wound, vagina and oral antisepsis was evaluated according to the EU Standards DIN EN1276 and EN14476. The panel of organisms tested included bacterial and fungal pathogens and two enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus A16 [CA16] and Enterovirus 71 [EV71]). Results: All PVP-I products tested were highly efficacious in vitro (>99.99% kill rate) against a range of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal pathogens with rapid onset of action (30–60 seconds), at both high and low concentrations. By comparison, the efficacy of other antiseptics tested was generally reduced upon dilution. PVP-I products used in wound and oral care were found to be more effective in vitro against CA16 and EV71, and had a faster onset of action than most other agents tested. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the in vitro efficacy of a range of commonly used antiseptics and may help inform the selection of appropriate antiseptics by healthcare professionals.","Tan, Eng Lee; Johari, Nur Humaira",GMS Hyg Infect Control,312,11

These blood samples were examined by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Out of 93 serum samples examined, 65 (69.9 %) were positive for PRV, 22 (23.7 %) were positive for ADV, 5 (5.4 %) were positive for BVDV, 4 (4.3 %) were positive for PPV and 2 (2.2 %) were positive for PRRSV. All sera were negative for ASFV, SVDV, HEV, SIV, PRCV, TGEV and CSFV. The results, recorded for the first time in Turkey, supported the hypothesis that wild boar act as a potential reservoir of selected viruses and thus have a role in the epidemiology of these diseases.","Albayrak, Harun; Ozan, Emre; Cavunt, Abdullah",Eur,312,16

METHODS: Case-notes at 3 hemodialysis units were screened: patients with ≥20% 1-year mortality risk were included. Patients and their health care professionals (HCPs) were invited to complete a structured interview or mixed-methods questionnaire. Four hundred eleven patient notes were screened. Seventy-seven eligible patients were approached and 51 were included. RESULTS: Patients predicted significantly higher life expectancies than HCPs (P < 0.0001). Documented cognitive impairment, gender, or increasing age did not affect 1- or 5-year PLE. PLE influenced priorities of care: one-fifth of patients who estimated themselves to have >95% 1-year survival preferred “care focusing on relieving pain and discomfort,” compared with nearly three-quarters of those reporting a ≤50% chance of 1-year survival. Twenty of 51 (39%) patients believed transplantation was an option for them, despite only 4 being waitlisted at the time of the interview. Patients who thought they were transplant candidates were significantly more confident they would be alive at 1 and 5 years and to want resuscitation attempted. Cognitive impairment had no effect on perceived transplant candidacy. A high symptom burden was present and underrecognized by HCPs. High symptom burden was associated with significantly lower PLE at both 1 and 5 years, increased anxiety/depression scores, and treatment choices more likely to prioritize relief of suffering. CONCLUSION: There is a disparity between patient PLE and those of their HCPs. Severity of symptom burden and beliefs regarding PLE or transplant candidacy affect patient treatment preferences.","Beckwith, Hannah K.S.; Adwaney, Anamika; Appelbe, Maura; Gaffney, Helen T.; Hill, Peter; Moabi, Dihlabelo; Prout, Virginia L.; Salisbury, Emma; Webster, Phil; Tomlinson, James A.P.; Brown, Edwina A.",Kidney Int Rep,312,16

An adaptive blended learning method was developed in response to the requirements necessitated by the Covid‐19 pandemic. This model combined pedagogical needs with digital technology using online learning activities to implement student learning in a medical neuroscience course for year one medical students. This approach provided medical students with an individually customized learning opportunity in medical neuroscience. The students had the complete choice to engage the learning system synchronously or asynchronously and learn neuroscience materials at different locations and times in response to the demands required to deal with the pandemic. Students’ performance in summative and formative examinations of the adaptive blended learning activities were compared with the previous performance obtained the previous year when the contents of the medical neuroscience course were implemented using the conventional “face‐to‐face” learning approach. While the cohort of our students in 2019 and 2020 changed, the contents, sessions, volume of material and assessment were constant. This enabled us to compare the results of the 2019 and 2020 classes. Overall, students’ performance was not significantly different between the adaptive blended learning and the in‐person approach. More students scored between 70‐79% during the adaptive blended learning compared with in‐class teaching, while more students scored between 80‐89% during the in‐person learning than during the adaptive blended learning. Finally, the percentage of students that scored >90% was not significantly different for both Years 2019 and 2020. The adaptive blended learning approach was effective in enhancing academic performance for high performing medical students. It also permitted the early identification of underachieving students, thereby serving as an early warning sign to permit timely intervention.","I Nathaniel, Thomas; Goodwin, Richard L.; Fowler, Lauren; Mcphail, Brooks; Black, Asa C.",Anat Sci Educ,312,1

To meet these challenges, certain coping measures are adopted to offset negative effects in the short term. These measures indicate the government’s pivotal role in stabilising the supply chain and striking a balance between control requirements and efficiency required in trading activities, as well as the importance to find alternative markets to mitigate risks brought by the delayed supply and the plummeting consumption market.

Clinical trials have found that one group, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has demonstrated clinical benefits across various cancers. However, research focused on the experiences of people affected by cancer who have undergone this treatment using qualitative methodology is currently limited. Moreover, little is known about the experiences and education needs of the healthcare staff supporting the people receiving these immunotherapies. This study therefore seeks to explore the experiences of using ICIs by both the people affected by cancer and the healthcare professionals who support those people, and use the findings to make recommendations for ICI supportive care guidance development, cancer immunotherapy education materials for healthcare professionals, cancer policy and further research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patient participants (n=up to 30) will be recruited within the UK. The sample will incorporate a range of perspectives, sociodemographic factors, diagnoses and ICI treatments, yet share some common experiences. Healthcare professionals (n=up to 15) involved in supporting people receiving immunotherapy will also be recruited from across the UK. Data will be generated through in-depth, semistructured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis will be used to obtain thorough understanding of individual’s perspectives on, and experiences of, immunotherapy. Study dates are as follows: December 2019–March 2022. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research will be performed in accordance with the UK Policy for Health and Social Care Research and Cardiff University’s Research Integrity and Governance Code of Practice (2018). The study received ethical approval from the West Midlands and Black Country Research Ethics Committee in October 2019. Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approvals were confirmed in December 2019. All participants will provide informed consent. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, non-academic platforms, the Macmillan Cancer Support website, disseminated at relevant national and international conferences and presented via a webinar.

The current management of acute appendicitis is increasingly controversial as non-operative management gains favor. Although rare, appendiceal neoplasms are often found as an incidental finding in the setting of appendectomy. Criteria and screening for appendiceal neoplasms are not standardized among surgical societies. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent appendectomy over a 9-year period (2010–2018). Over the same time period, patients who underwent appendectomy in two municipal hospitals in The Bronx, New York City, USA were reviewed. RESULTS: We found a 1.7% incidence of appendiceal neoplasms locally and a 0.53% incidence of appendiceal tumors in a national population sample. Both groups demonstrated an increased incidence of appendiceal carcinoma by age. This finding was most pronounced after the age of 40 in both local and national populations. In our study, the incidence of appendiceal tumors increased with each decade interval up to the age of 80 and peaked at 2.1% in patients between 70 and 79 years. CONCLUSIONS: Appendiceal adenocarcinomas were identified in patients with acute appendicitis that seem to be associated with increasing age. The presence of an appendiceal malignancy should be considered in the management of older patients with acute appendicitis before a decision to embark on non-operative therapy.","Skendelas, John P.; Alemany, Victor S.; Au, Vincent; Rao, Devika; McNelis, John; Kim, Peter K.",BMC Surg,312,1

We review the current treatments for obesity and provide potential provider and system-level strategies for integrating weight management and improving longer term obesity care within PC settings. RECENT FINDINGS: We now understand that the body develops multiple mechanisms to resist weight loss and promote weight regain, making both weight loss and weight loss maintenance challenging. Therefore, weight management often requires medically supervised interventions and should be treated on a long-term basis. However, there are multiple barriers to improving obesity care within PC settings. SUMMARY: Clinically, utilizing strategies such as a shared decision-making approach and the 5As to discuss treatment options can facilitate formulating an obesity treatment plan. Utilizing telehealth, a team-based approach, and community partnering can increase patient access to intensive behavioral interventions. Future studies should evaluate other cost-effective methods to implement obesity care into the PC setting.","Tucker, Shanna; Bramante, Carolyn; Conroy, Molly; Fitch, Angela; Gilden, Adam; Wittleder, Sandra; Jay, Melanie",Curr Obes Rep,312,22

Several vaccine candidate already provided promising effectiveness data, but it is crucial for an effective vaccination campaign that people are willing and able to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Taking Germany as an example, we provide insights of using a mathematical approach for the planning and location of vaccination sites to optimally administer vaccines against Covid-19. Methods: We used mathematical programming for computing an optimal selection of vaccination sites out of a given set (i.e., university hospitals, health department related locations and general practices). Different patient-to-facility assignments and doctor-to-facility assignments and different constraints on the number of vaccinees per site or maximum travel time are used. Results: In order to minimize the barriers for people to get vaccinated, i.e., limit the one-way travel journey (airline distance) by around 35km for 75% of the population (with a maximum of 70km), around 80 well-positioned facilities can be enough. If only the 38 university hospitals are being used, the 75% distance increases to around 50km (with a maximum of 145km). Using all 400 health departments or all 56,000 general practices can decrease the journey length significantly, but comes at the price of more required staff and possibly wastage of only partially used vaccine containers. Conclusions: In the case of free assignments, the number of required physicians can in most scenarios be limited to 2,000, which is also the minimum with our assumptions. However, when travel distances for the patients are to be minimized, capacities of the facilities must be respected, or administrative assignments are prespecified, an increased number of physicians is unavoidable.","Leithaeuser, N.; Schneider, J.; Johann, S.; Krumke, S.; Streicher, M.; Schmidt, E.; Scholz, S.",,312,1

End-point selection of the most potential B-cell epitope was based on highly essential physicochemical attributes. NetCTL-I and NetMHC-II algorithms were used to predict probable MHC-I and II T-cell epitopes for globally frequent HLA-A*O2:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:02 molecules. Highly probable T-cell epitopes were selected based on their high propensities for C-terminal cleavage, transport protein (TAP) processing and MHC-I/II binding. RESULTS: Preferential epitope binding sites were further identified on the HLA molecules using a blind peptide-docking method. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relativity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S-protein. LALHRSYLTPGDSSSGWTAGAA(242→263) was the most probable B-cell epitope with optimal physicochemical attributes. MHC-I antigenic presentation pathway was highly favourable for YLQPRTFLL(269-277) (HLA-A*02:01), LPPAYTNSF(24-32) (HLA-B*35:01) and IPTNFTISV7(14-721) (HLA-B*51:01). Also, LTDEMIAQYTSALLA(865-881) exhibited the highest binding affinity to HLA-DR B1*15:01 with core interactions mediated by IAQYTSALL(870-878). COVID-19 YLQPRTFLL(269-277) was preferentially bound to a previously undefined site on HLA-A*02:01 suggestive of a novel site for MHC-I-mediated T-cell stimulation. CONCLUSION: This study implemented combinatorial immunoinformatics methods to model B- and T-cell epitopes with high potentials to trigger immunogenic responses to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2.","Sarma, Vyshnavie R.; Olotu, Fisayo A.; Soliman, Mahmoud E.S.",Biomed J,312,10

We estimated the incidence of outpatient illness due to 12 different viruses during November 2018 through April 2019 in a fully enumerated population. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for ambulatory care visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA). Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group. RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000). RSV was the most common cause of medically attended ARI among children aged 1-4 years; coronaviruses were the most common among adults aged ≥65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other studies focused on single viruses, we found that influenza and RSV were major causes of acute respiratory illness in persons of all ages. In comparison, coronaviruses and rhinovirus were also important pathogens. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses were the second-most common cause of medically attended ARI during the 2018/19 influenza season.","Jackson, Michael L; Starita, Lea; Kiniry, Erika; Phillips, C Hallie; Wellwood, Stacie; Cho, Shari; Kiavand, Anahita; Truong, Melissa; Han, Peter; Richardson, Matthew; Wolf, Caitlin R; Heimonen, Jessica; Nickerson, Deborah A; Chu, Helen Y",Clin Infect Dis,312,29

We develop a model of learning by deregulation, which predicts that lifting stay‐at‐home orders can signal that going out has become safer. Using restaurant activity data, we find that the implementation of stay‐at‐home orders initially had a limited impact, but that activity rose quickly after states' reopenings. The results suggest that consumers inferred from reopening that it was safer to eat out. The rational, but mistaken inference that occurs in our model may explain why a sharp rise of COVID‐19 cases followed reopening in some states.","Glaeser, Edward L.; Jin, Ginger Z.; Leyden, Benjamin T.; Luca, Michael",J Reg Sci,312,21

Evolving from percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), thermal ablation utilizing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) have become the standard approach in the treatment of isolated lesions that fit within the size criteria for curative intent therapy (typically 3-4cm). With the evolution of more intense thermal ablation, such as MWA, the dramatic increase in both the size of ablation zone and intensity of heat generation have extended the limits of this technique. As a result of these innovations, intra-procedural and post-procedural pain have also significantly increased, requiring either higher levels of intravenous sedation or, in some institutions, general anesthesia. In addition to the increase in therapeutic intensity, the use of intravenous sedation during aggressive ablation procedures carries the risk of over-sedation when the noxious insult (i.e. the ablation) is removed, adding further difficulty to post-procedural recovery and management. Furthermore, high subdiaphragmatic lesions become challenging in this setting due to issues relating to sedation and compliance with breath hold/breathing instructions. Although general anesthesia may mitigate these complications, the added resources associated with providing general anesthesia during ablation is not cost effective and may result in substantial delays in treatment. The reduction of Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP), such as intubation due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, must also be taken into consideration. Due to the potential increased risk of infection transmission, alternatives to general anesthesia should be considered when safe and possible. Upper abdominal regional nerve block techniques have been used to manage pain related to trauma, surgery, and cancer; however, blocks of this nature are not well described in the interventional radiology literature. The McGill University group has developed experience in using such blocks as splanchnic, celiac and hepatic hilar nerve blocks to provide peri-procedural pain control [1]. Since incorporating these techniques (along with hydrodissection with tumescent anesthesia), we have also observed in our high volume ablation center a dramatic decrease in the amount of sedatives administered during the procedure, a decrease in patient discomfort during localization and ablation, as well as decreased pain post-procedure. Faster time to discharge and overall reduction in room procedural time serve as added benefits. The purpose of this publication is to outline and illustrate the practical application and use of nerve block/regional anesthesia techniques with respect to percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation.","Liu, D.

Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression can provide potential novel targets for its prevention and/or treatment. Virus microbiota reciprocal interactions have been studied in a variety of viral infections. For example, the integrity of Coronavirus particles can be disrupted by surfactin, a bacterial surface molecule that targets other viruses, including that of influenza A. In this light, intestinal microbiota likely influences COVID-19 virulence, while from its side SARS-CoV-2 may affect the intestinal microbiome promoting dysbiosis and other deleterious consequences. Hence, the microbiota pre-existing health status and its alterations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are likely to play an important, still underscored role in determining individual susceptibility and resilience to COVID-19. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 worst clinical conditions and fatalities develop in subjects with specific risk factors such as aging and the presence of one or more comorbidities, which are intriguingly characterized also by unhealthy microbiome status. Moreover, these comorbidities require complex pharmacological regimens known as “polypharmacy” that may further affect microbiota integrity and worsen the resilience to viral infections. This complex situation may represent a further and underestimated risk with regard to COVID-19 clinical burden for the elderly and comorbid people. Here, we discuss the possible biological, physiopathological, and clinical implications of gut microbiota in COVID-19 and the strategies to improve/maintain its healthy status as a simple and adjunctive strategy to reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden.","Donati Zeppa, Sabrina; Agostini, Deborah; Piccoli, Giovanni; Stocchi, Vilberto; Sestili, Piero",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,312,5

The enveloped virus has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 28 kilo-bases, which has a 5′ cap structure and 3′ polyadenylation tract. The complete genome sequence of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Beijing isolate, was determined by cloning sequencing and primer walking. The whole genome is 27733 nucleotides in length, has ten open reading frames: 5′ -orf1a-orf1ab-s-3a-3b-e-m-6a-6b-n-3′. Alignments of the genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate with those of two AIBV strains and one SARS coronavirus were performed respectively. The genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate compared with that of the IBV strain LX4 (uncompleted, 19440 bp in size) was 91.2% similarity. However, the full-length genome sequence of IBV Beijing isolate was 85.2% identity to that of IBV Strain Beaudette, and was only 50.8% homology to that of SARS coronavirus. The results showed that the genome of IBV has remarkable variation. And IBV Beijing isolate is not closely related to SARS coronavirus. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome sequence, S protein, M protein and N protein, also showed that AIBV Beijing isolate is lone virus in group III and is distant from SARS coronavirus. In conclusion, this study will contribute to the studies of diagnosis and diseases control on IBV in China.","Jin, Weiwu; Chen, Chen; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Yiqiang; Feng, Jidong; Chen, Fuyong; Wu, Qingming; Yang, Hanchun; Wang, Ming; Yu, Jialin; Li, Ning; Gong, Yuanshi; Sun, Qixin; Chen, Zhangliang",Chin Sci Bull,312,33

METHODS: Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. RESULTS: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (ρ = −0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.

Two large series with limited follow-up have reported outcomes for pts with CLL and COVID-19 (Scarfò, et al. Leukemia 2020; Mato, et al. Blood 2020). To provide maximal clarity on outcomes for pts with CLL and COVID-19, we partnered in a worldwide effort to describe the clinical experience and validate predictors of survival, including potential treatment effects. Methods: This international collaboration represents a partnership between investigators at 141 centers. Data are presented in two cohorts. Cohort 1 (Co1) includes pts captured through efforts by European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC), Italian CAMPUS CLL Program, and Grupo Español de Leucemia Linfática Crónica. The validation cohort, Cohort 2 (Co2), includes pts from US (66%), UK (23%), EU (7%), and other countries (4%). There is no overlap in cases between cohorts. CLL pts were included if COVID-19 was diagnosed by PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 and they required inpatient hospitalization. Data were collected retrospectively 2/2020 - 5/2020 using standardized case report forms. Baseline characteristics, preexisting comorbidities (including cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score ≥6 vs. <6), CLL treatment history, details regarding COVID-19 course, management, and therapy, and vital status were collected. The primary endpoint of this study was to estimate the case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the proportion of pts who died among all pts hospitalized with COVID-19. Chi-squared test was used to compare frequencies; univariable and multivariable analyses utilized Cox regression. Predictors of inferior OS in both Co1 and Co2 were included in multivariable analyses. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) from time of COVID-19 diagnosis (dx). Results: 411 hospitalized, COVID-19 positive CLL pts were analyzed (Co1 n=281, Co2 n=130). Table 1 describes baseline characteristics. At COVID-19 dx, median age was 72 in Co1 (range 37-94) and 68 in Co2 (range 41-98); 31% (Co1) and 45% (Co2) had CIRS ≥6. In Co1, 48% were treatment-naïve and 26% were receiving CLL-directed therapy at COVID-19 dx (66% BTKi ± anti-CD20, 19% Venetoclax ± anti-CD20, 9.6% chemo/chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), 1.4% PI3Ki, 4% other). In Co2, 36% were never treated and 49% were receiving CLL-directed therapy (65% BTKi ± anti-CD20, 19% Venetoclax ± anti-CD20, 9.4% multi-novel agent combinations, 1.6% CIT, 1.6% PI3Ki, 1.6% anti-CD20 monotherapy, 1.6% other). Most pts receiving CLL-directed therapy had it held at COVID-19 diagnosis (93% in Co1 and 81% in Co2). Frequency of most COVID-19 symptoms/laboratory abnormalities were similar in the two cohorts including fever (88% in both), lymphocytosis (ALC ≥30 x 109/L; 27% vs. 21%), and lymphocytopenia (ALC < 1.0 x 109/L; 18% vs. 28%), while others varied between Co1 and Co2 (p<0.0001), including cough (61% vs. 93%), dyspnea (60% vs. 84%), fatigue (13% vs. 77%). Median follow-up was 24 days (range 2-86) in Co1 and 17 days (1-43) in Co2. CFRs were similar in Co1 and Co2, 30% and 34% (p=0.45). 54% and 43% were discharged while 16% and 23% remained admitted at last follow-up in Co1 and Co2, respectively. The proportion of pts requiring supplemental oxygen was similar (89% vs. 92%) while rate of ICU admission was higher in Co2 (20% vs. 48%, p<0.0001). Figure 1 depicts OS in each cohort. Univariable analyses demonstrated that age and CIRS ≥6 significantly predicted inferior OS in both cohorts, while only age remained an independent predictor of inferior OS in multivariable analyses (Table 2). Prior treatment for CLL (vs. observation) predicted inferior OS in Co1 but not Co2. Conclusions : In the largest cancer dx-specific cohort reported, pts with CLL hospitalized for COVID-19 had a CFR of 30-34%. Advanced patient age at COVID-19 diagnosis was an independent predictor of OS in two large cohorts. This CFR will serve as a benchmark for mortality for future outcomes studies, including therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 in this population. The effect of CLL treatment on OS was inconsistent across cohorts; COVID-19 may be severe regardless of treatment status. While there were no significant differences in distribution of current lines of therapy between cohorts, prior chemo exposure was more common in Co1 vs. Co2, which may account for difference in OS. Extended follow-up will be presented.

We sought to identify factors associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with SCD.We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on patients with SCD and COVID-19 illness. We used multivariable logistic models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities on hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during COVID-19 illness. As of 23 March 2021, 750 COVID-19 illness cases in patients with SCD were reported to the registry. We identified history of pain (relative risk [RR], 2.15; P < .0001) and SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.61; P = .0001) as risk factors for hospitalization in children. History of pain (RR, 1.78; P = .002) was also a risk factor for hospitalization in adults. Children with history of pain (RR, 3.09; P = .009), SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76; P = .03), and SCD renal comorbidities (RR, 3.67; P < .0001) and adults with history of pain (RR 1.94, P = .02) were at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. History of pain and SCD renal comorbidities also increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in children; history of pain, SCD heart/lung comorbidities, and female sex increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in adults. Hydroxyurea showed no effect on hospitalization and COVID-19 severity, but it lowered the risk of presenting with pain in adults during COVID-19.","Mucalo, Lana; Brandow, Amanda M.; Dasgupta, Mahua; Mason, Sadie F.; Simpson, Pippa M.; Singh, Ashima; Taylor, Bradley W.; Woods, Katherine J.; Yusuf, Fouza I.; Panepinto, Julie A.",Blood Adv,312,16

In the acute setting, patients can present with severe ischemia of either the upper or lower limb, and urgent surgical intervention is often required to avoid severe debilitation and limb loss. PATIENTS: Our case series comprised three patients who presented with upper and lower limb ischemia and were found to have concomitant malignancy. All three patients were female, with a median age of 54.3 years, and none of the patients was on active chemotherapy. One presented with stage IIb uterine carcinoma, one with stage IIIb ovarian carcinoma, and the other with stage IIIb cervical carcinoma. These patients were referred for vascular management, with two being acute and the other acute on chronic. RESULTS: Of the three patients, two presented with acute limb ischemia and underwent arterial thrombectomy, one of the upper and the other the lower limb. The third patient, with acute-on-chronic upper limb ischemia, was treated conservatively with intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. All three had limb salvage and survival outcome at 1 year post-treatment. CONCLUSION: In this small series, surgical intervention in two patients and conservative management in the other patient led to limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life. Even though the long-term survival for patients with malignant disease is generally poor, surgical intervention can achieve limb salvage with a reasonably good quality of life.","Harnarayan, Patrick; Islam, Shariful; Naraynsingh, Vijay",Ther Clin Risk Manag,312,20

This study aimed to determine the effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic on MIS in urology practice at national level. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 urologists in Turkey participated in an online survey between August 22 and September 23, 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine the participants’ demographic characteristics and responses to multiple‐choice questions. RESULTS: While 54% of urologists stated that they were concerned about the possibility that the patients planned to undergo MIS were carrying COVID‐19 or false‐negative for the virus, 51% considered that open surgery was safer than MIS in this regard. The pandemic led to a difference in the preferences of 40% of the urologists in relation to open or MIS methods, and during the pandemic, 39% of the urologists always directed their patients to open surgery. It was determined that during the pandemic, there was a statistical decrease in the intensity and weekly application of MIS methods among all surgical procedures compared to the pre‐pandemic (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). MIS was preferred for oncological operations by 97.3% of the urologists during the pandemic, with the most performed operation being radical nephrectomy (90.7%). Among oncological operations, radical prostatectomy was most frequently postponed. To prevent virus transmission during MIS, 44% of the urologists reported that they always used an additional evacuation system and 52% took additional precautions. There were a total of 27 healthcare workers who took part in MIS and tested positive for COVID‐19 after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of operations has decreased during the ongoing pandemic, MIS is a method that can be preferred due to its limited contamination and mortality in urology practice provided that safety measures are taken and guideline recommendations are followed.","Danacioglu, Yavuz Onur; Soytas, Mustafa; Polat, Salih; Ozdemir, Osman; Arikan, Ozgur; Yenice, Mustafa Gurkan; Atis, Ramazan Gokhan; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",Int J Clin Pract,312,30
687906,687906,687906,The prospective of Artificial Intelligence in COVID-19 Pandemic,18.216518,2.765032,2021-09-28,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: COVID-19 is one of the most important pandemics in recent history. It is an emerging infectious disease, probably of animal origin. Several domesticated and non-domesticated animals are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including Mustelidae, of which mink is the first species identified to suffer from this infection. We report herein the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lymph node tissue from two feral American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the wild in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain) during invasive species trapping campaigns. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, is considered a pathogen of animal origin that is mainly transmitted from human to human. Several animal species can be naturally or experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, with compelling evidence that mink is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human-to-mink infection cases have been reported and there are also suggestions that mink-to-human infection occurs. Mink infections have been reported to date only on fur farms, except for one infected free- ranging wild mink near a Utah (USA) fur farm, which suggests a transmission pathway from farms to wild mink. We now report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 of 13 feral dark brown American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain), during an invasive species trapping campaign. They were trapped in riverbeds in sparsely inhabited rural areas known to harbor self-sustained feral mink populations. The closest fur farm is about 20 km away. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by two-step RT-PCR in these animals’ mesenteric lymph nodes and was confirmed by sequencing a 397-nucleotide amplified region of the S gene, yielding identical sequences in both animals. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was run on this sequence, which was found to correspond to the consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. Our findings appear to represent the first example of SARS-CoV-2 acquired in the wild by feral mink in self-sustained populations.","Aguiló-Gisbert, Jordi; Padilla-Blanco, Miguel; Lizana, Victor; Maiques, Elisa; Muñoz-Baquero, Marta; Chillida-Martínez, Eva; Cardells, Jesús; Rubio-Guerri, Consuelo",Animals (Basel),312,30

Recently, new effective vaccines against COVID-19 have begun to be administered to healthcare workers in several countries, including Italy. PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a population of nursing students, identifying factors associated with the intentions. METHOD: We conducted an anonymous online survey among 728 nursing students. The questionnaire collected data on demographic and academic characteristics, health status, vaccine attitudes, and specific reasons regarding the intention to get or not get the COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 422 nursing students completed the survey. Almost 81% of participants wanted to take the vaccine against coronavirus. The intention to adhere to the vaccination program was associated with male gender, a previous flu vaccine uptake, and high school education. The main reason in favor of taking the vaccine was to protect family and friends. The main reason for opposition was the fear of adverse events. CONCLUSION: It is fundamental to consider vaccine hesitancy in healthcare students and face it properly, since these are the healthcare workers of the future who will have to provide recommendations to patients and promote adherence to vaccination programs.","Belingheri, Michael; Ausili, Davide; Paladino, Maria Emilia; Luciani, Michela; Di Mauro, Stefania; Riva, Michele A.",J Prof Nurs,312,1

Attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in the US are changing frequently, especially since the launch of the vaccines and as the US faces a third wave of the pandemic. Our primary objective was to determine the relative influence of sociodemographic predictors on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The secondary objectives were to understand the reasons behind vaccine refusal and compare COVID-19 vaccine acceptance with influenza vaccine uptake. Study design A nationwide US-based survey study. Methods A Redcap survey link was distributed using various online platforms. The primary study outcome was COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (yes/no). Sociodemographic factors, such as age, ethnicity, gender, education, family income, healthcare worker profession, residence regions, local healthcare facility and 'vaccine launch' period (pre vs. post), were included as potential predictors. The differences in vaccine acceptance rates among sociodemographic subgroups were estimated by Chi-square tests, while logistic regression and neural networks computed the prediction models and determined the predictors of relative significance. Results Among 2978 eligible respondents, 81.1% of participants were likely to receive the vaccine. All the predictors demonstrated significant associations with vaccine acceptance, except vaccine-launch period. Regression analyses eliminated gender and vaccine-launch period from the model, and the machine-learning model reproduced the regression result. Both models precisely predicted individual vaccine acceptance and recognised education, ethnicity and age as the most important predictors. Fear of adverse effects and concern with efficacy were the principal reasons for vaccine refusal. Conclusions Sociodemographic predictors, such as education, ethnicity and age, significantly influenced COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, and concerns of side effects and efficacy led to increased vaccine hesitancy.","Mondal, Pritish; Sinharoy, Ankita; Su, Lilly",Public Health,312,1

It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: “NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID” and “mHealth OR eHealth OR text”. Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological distress. Digital tools that are commercially available may be useful for at-risk individuals or individuals with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms.","Zhang, Melvyn; Smith, Helen Elizabeth",J Med Internet Res,312,18

However, the impact on college students in the United States has not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales—the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7—for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.","Wang, Xiaomei; Hegde, Sudeep; Son, Changwon; Keller, Bruce; Smith, Alec; Sasangohar, Farzan",J Med Internet Res,312,10

Methods: Prospective study, evaluating the longitudinal profile of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in a random sample of 331 seropositive healthcare workers (HCW) of Spanish Hospitals Group. Serial measurements of serum IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 were obtained at baseline (April-May,2020), and in 2 follow-up visits. Linear mixed models were used to investigate antibody kinetics and associated factors. Results: A total of 306 seropositive subjects (median age: 44.7years;69.9 % female) were included in the final analysis. After a median follow-up of 274 days between baseline and final measurement, 235(76.8%) maintained seropositivity. Antibody titers decreased in 82.0%, while remained stable in 13.1%. Factors associated with stability of antibodies over time included age≥45 years, higher baseline titers, severe/moderate infection and high-grade exposure to COVID-19 patients. In declining profile, estimated mean antibody half-life was 146.3 days(95%CI:138.6-154.9) from baseline. Multivariate models show independent longer durability of antibodies in HCW with high-risk exposure to COVID-19 patients (+14.1 days;95%CI:0.6-40.2) and with symptomatic COVID-19 (+14.1 days;95%CI:0.9-43.0). The estimated mean time to loss antibodies was 375(95% CI:342-408) days from baseline. Conclusions: We present the first study measuring the kinetics of antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in HCW beyond 6 months. Most participants remained seropositive after 9 months but presented a significant decline in antibody-titers. Two distinct antibody dynamic profiles were observed (declining vs. stable). Independent factors associated with longer durability of antibodies were symptomatic infection and higher exposure to COVID-19 patients.","Varona, Jose Felipe; Madurga, Rodrigo; Peñalver, Francisco; Abarca, Elena; Almirall, Cristina; Cruz, Marta; Ramos, Enrique; Castellano, Jose María",Eur J Intern Med,312,1
