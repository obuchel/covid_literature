2460,2460,2460,Prevalence and Clinicopathological Features of Triaditis in a Prospective Case Series of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Cats,19.62028,9.2591095,2016-06-14,"BACKGROUND: The term triaditis designates the concurrent presence of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cholangitis, and pancreatitis in cats. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The histopathology of concurrent, but often subclinical, inflammatory processes in the small intestine, liver, and pancreas of cats is poorly described. We aimed to investigate the frequency of enteritis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or some combination of these in symptomatic and asymptomatic cats, compare clinicopathological features, and correlate histopathological with laboratory findings. ANIMALS: Domestic cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic, and 8 normal). METHODS: Prospective study. Physical examination, laboratory variables (CBC, serum biochemistry profile, serum thyroxine concentration, serum feline trypsin‐like immunoreactivity [fTLI], feline lipase immunoreactivity [fPLI, as measured by Spec fPL (®)], urinalysis, and fecal analysis), imaging, and histopathological examinations were conducted. Feline liver, pancreas, and small intestine were biopsied during laparotomy. RESULTS: Inflammatory lesions were detected in 47 cats (27 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic). In total, 20 cats had histopathologic lesions of IBD (13/47, 27.7%), cholangitis (6/47, 12.8%), or pancreatitis (1/47, 2.1%) alone, or inflammation involving >1 organ (27/47, 57.4%). More specifically, 16/47 cats (34.0%) had concurrent lesions of IBD and cholangitis, 3/47 (6.4%) of IBD and pancreatitis, and 8/47 cats (17%) of triaditis. Triaditis was identified only in symptomatic cats (8/27, 29.6%). A mild, positive correlation was detected between the severity (score) of IBD lesions and the number of comorbidities (rho = +0.367, P = .022). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Histopathological evidence of IBD or IBD with comorbidities was detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cats. The possibility of triaditis should be considered in symptomatic cats with severe IBD.","Fragkou, F.C.; Adamama‐Moraitou, K.K.; Poutahidis, T.; Prassinos, N.N.; Kritsepi‐Konstantinou, M.; Xenoulis, P.G.; Steiner, J.M.; Lidbury, J.A.; Suchodolski, J.S.; Rallis, T.S.",J Vet Intern Med,357,33

The effect of specific anti‐diarrheal probiotic pastes (ADPPs) in the management of acute, uncomplicated diarrhea in dogs is unknown. HYPOTHESIS: Administration of an ADPP containing Enterococcus faecium 4b1707 will improve the clinical outcome of acute, uncomplicated diarrhea in dogs compared to placebo. ANIMALS: One hundred forty‐eight client‐owned dogs with acute diarrhea as the main clinical sign. METHODS: Double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled, randomized, blocked, multicenter clinical field study conducted at 14 primary care veterinary practices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. RESULTS: The ADPP was associated with better clinical outcome compared to placebo in dogs with acute, uncomplicated diarrhea. Dogs in the ADPP group had a significantly shorter duration of diarrhea (ADPP: median, 32 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2‐118; n = 51; Placebo: median, 47 hours; 95% CI, 4‐167; n = 58; P = .008) and the rate of resolution of diarrhea was 1.60 times faster in the ADPP group than in the Placebo group (ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.08‐2.44; P = .02). Fewer dogs required additional medical intervention (AMI) for non‐improvement or worsening in the ADPP group compared to the Placebo group (3.5% of dogs and 14.8% of dogs, respectively), with a relative risk of 0.88 (P = .04; AMI, ADPP, 3.5%, 2/57 dogs; Placebo, 14.8%, 9/61 dogs; relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77‐0.99). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The ADPP may accelerate resolution of acute diarrhea in dogs and decrease the requirement for AMI.","Nixon, Sophie L.; Rose, Lindsay; Muller, Annika T.",J Vet Intern Med,357,22

Several approaches and tools, such as multi-criteria decision analysis, health technology assessments and evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks, have been proposed to guide decision-makers in selecting the criteria most relevant and appropriate for a transparent decision-making process. This study forms part of the development of the WHO-INTEGRATE EtD framework, a framework rooted in global health norms and values as reflected in key documents of the World Health Organization and the United Nations system. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of criteria used in or proposed for real-world decision-making processes, including guideline development, health technology assessment, resource allocation and others. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews through a combination of systematic literature searches and extensive reference searches. Systematic reviews reporting criteria used for real-world health decision-making by governmental or non-governmental organization on a supranational, national, or programme level were included and their quality assessed through a bespoke critical appraisal tool. The criteria reported in the reviews were extracted, de-duplicated and sorted into first-level (i.e. criteria), second-level (i.e. sub-criteria) and third-level (i.e. decision aspects) categories. First-level categories were developed a priori using a normative approach; second- and third-level categories were developed inductively. RESULTS: We included 36 systematic reviews providing criteria, of which one met all and another eleven met at least five of the items of our critical appraisal tool. The criteria were subsumed into 8 criteria, 45 sub-criteria and 200 decision aspects. The first-level of the category system comprised the following seven substantive criteria: “Health-related balance of benefits and harms”; “Human and individual rights”; “Acceptability considerations”; “Societal considerations”; “Considerations of equity, equality and fairness”; “Cost and financial considerations”; and “Feasibility and health system considerations”. In addition, we identified an eight criterion “Evidence”. CONCLUSION: This overview of systematic reviews provides a comprehensive overview of criteria used or suggested for real-world health decision-making. It also discusses key challenges in the selection of the most appropriate criteria and in seeking to implement a fair decision-making process.","Stratil, J.

The main goal of this study was to determine whether the local cell-mediated Gr pathway is activated during severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in children. Tracheal aspirates (TA) from 23 children with RSV-LRTI and 12 controls without pulmonary disease were analyzed for Gr A and B. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from seven children with RSV-LRTI were analyzed for cellular expression of GrB. Levels of GrA and GrB in TA were significantly increased in RSV patients compared with controls and both Grs showed preserved activity. Gr levels correlated with the total leukocyte counts and IL-8 levels in the airways at several time points. However, no correlation between Gr levels and release of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 was found. There was evidence for marked expression of GrB by both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and natural killer cells in the respiratory tract. These findings suggest activation of the cell-mediated Gr pathway during severe RSV-LRTI in children.","Bem, Reinout A; Bos, Albert P; Bots, Michael; Wolbink, Angela M; van Ham, S Marieke; Medema, Jan Paul; Lutter, Rene; van Woensel, Job B M",Pediatr Res,357,12

Anemia and thrombocytopenia are the main secondary effects. However, there are case reports of rare but serious adverse events following drug withdrawal. We present a case of a 76-year-old man diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis who presented with constitutional symptoms and symptomatic splenomegaly. Ruxolitinib was started (15 mg twice daily) and his disease-related symptoms disappeared. Six weeks later, he developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia and grade 3 anemia. Ruxolitinib was stopped and corticosteroid treatment (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) was started to avoid a cytokine-rebound reaction. The patient then developed fever, chills, a biological inflammatory syndrome, and an acute respiratory disease syndrome. Full workup excluded an infection and we concluded that ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome was the likely cause. Continued treatment with corticosteroids, as well as oxygen supply and continuous positive airway pressure, allowed an alleviation of his symptoms. This case report describes acute respiratory distress syndrome as another potential complication of ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome.","Beauverd, Yan; Samii, Kaveh",Int J Hematol,357,12

Body mass index was 26 (24–35), 24% were overweight and 29% obese. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1 (0–2) and all but one patient had comorbid conditions. The median time between onset of the first symptom and admission to the ICU was 5 days (range 0–14). None of the patients had received vaccination against H1N1v. Nine patients received oseltamivir, only two of them within 48 hours of symptom onset. All patients developed severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)-Ratio 60 (55–92); lung injury score 3.8 (3.3–4.0)), were mechanically ventilated and on vasopressor support. Fourteen patients received corticosteroids, 7 patients underwent hemofiltration, and 10 patients needed extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO; 8 patients veno-venous, 2 patients veno-arterial), three patients Interventional Lung Assist (ILA) and two patients pump driven extracorporeal low-flow CO(2)-elimination (ECCO(2)–R). Seven of 17 patients (41%) died in the ICU (4 patients due to bleeding, 3 patients due to multi-organ failure), while all other patients survived the hospital (59%). ECMO mortality was 50%. The median ICU length-of-stay was 26 (19–44) vs. 21 (17–25) days (survivors vs. nonsurvivors), days on the ventilator were 18 (14–35) vs. 20 (17–24), and ECMO duration was 10 (8–25) vs. 13 (11–16) days, respectively (all p = n.s.). Compared to a control group of 241 adult intensive care unit patients without H1N1v, length of stay in the ICU, rate of mechanical ventilation, days on the ventilator, and TISS 28 scores were significantly higher in patients with H1N1v. The ICU survival tended to be higher in control patients (79 vs. 59%; p = 0.06). Patients with H1N1v admitted to either of our ICUs were young, overproportionally obese and almost all with existing comorbidities. All patients developed severe ARDS, which could only be treated with extracorporeal gas exchange in an unexpectedly high proportion. Patients with H1N1v had more complicated courses compared to control patients.","Schellongowski, Peter; Ullrich, Roman; Hieber, Cornelia; Hetz, Hubert; Losert, Heidrun; Hermann, Maria; Hermann, Alexander; Gattringer, Klaus-Bernhard; Siersch, Viktoria; Rabitsch, Werner; Fuhrmann, Valentin; Bojic, Andja; Robak, Oliver; Sperr, Wolfgang R.; Laczika, Klaus; Locker, Gottfried J.; Staudinger, Thomas",Wien Klin Wochenschr,357,22

It is fundamentally different from necrosis. It is a genetically controlled, energy-dependent method of cellular deletion without inflammation. In the cardiovascular system, apoptosis occurs as a primary and secondary event in disease pathogenesis. This review addresses our current understanding of the initiation, propagation and significance of apoptosis in the cardiovascular system, as well as assessing therapeutic potentials arising therefrom. METHODS: A Medline search was performed and relevant publications reviewed. Further articles were obtained from the references of these publications. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Apoptotic cell death is a key element in the pathogenesis and progression of ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and the clinical syndromes which these situations produce. Our increased understanding of the role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease offers potential to develop new therapeutic strategies.","McLaughlin, R.; Kelly, C.

A database containing data on the distribution of stomata on the leaves of 469 British plant species was used to look for relationships between stomatal distribution (including both location on the leaf and density) and both habitat and morphological variables. Statistical models were applied to the data that minimized any effects that phylogenetic constraints may have had on the data. Hypostomaty is common in woody species, species which typically occur in shaded habitats and species with large or glabrous leaves. Amphistomaty, however, predominates in species which occur in non‐shaded habitats, species with small, dissected or hairy leaves, and in annual species. Amphistomaty, therefore, tends to occur in species where CO(2) may be limiting photosynthesis (unshaded environments), or where there are structures to prevent water loss from the leaf (e.g. hairs). Hypostomaty, however, occurs in slow‐growing species (e.g. trees), species with leaves which have large boundary layers (large or entire leaves) and in species where CO(2) is unlikely to limit photosynthesis (shaded habitats).","PEAT, H.

A common initial response of the Golgi apparatus to any stress is an alteration or cessation of secretory activity. In the transformed cell, the Golgi apparatus is altered both morphologically and biochemically, suggesting a shift from a secretory to a membrane‐generating mode of functioning. However, since fewer or less well‐developed Golgi apparatus are frequently found in transformed cells, analytical methods of membrane isolation developed for normal tissues may not always yield equivalent results when applied to tumors. Cell surface alterations characteristic of malignant cells may result from modifications occurring at the level of the Golgi apparatus. Some lysosomal dysfunctions may result from underglycosylation of acid hydrolases by the Golgi apparatus. The use of cell‐free systems between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus or within Golgi apparatus cisterane is providing a new approach to the elucidation of the role of the Golgi apparatus in normal as well as pathological states.","Morré, Dorothy M.",J Electron Microsc Tech,357,19

However, this also involves a decrease in the surface area of the activated carbon filter. The CO(2) elimination and sevoflurane (SEV) reflection of the old device (ACD-100) were thus compared with the new version (ACD-50) in patients sedated after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. After ERC approval and written informed consent, 23 patients were sedated with SEV, using first the ACD-100 and then the ACD-50 for 60 min each. With each device, patients were ventilated with tidal volumes (TV) of 5 ml/kg of ideal body weight for the first 30 min, and with 7 ml/kg for the next 30 min. Ventilation parameters, arterial blood gases, Bispectral-Index™ (BIS, Aspect Medical Systems Inc., Newton, MA, USA), SEV concentrations exhaled by the patient (SEV-exhaled) and from the expiratory hose (SEV-lost) were recorded every 30 min. A SEV reflection index was calculated: SRI [%] = 100 × (1 − (SEV-lost/SEV-exhaled)). Data were compared using ANOVA with repeated measurements and Student’s T-tests for pairs. Respiratory rates, tidal and minute volumes were not significantly different between the two devices. End tidal and arterial CO(2) partial pressures were significantly higher with the ACD-100 as compared with the ACD-50. SEV infusion rate remained constant. SEV reflection was higher (SRI: ACD-100 vs. ACD-50, TV 5 ml/kg: 95.29 ± 6.45 vs. 85.54 ± 11.15, p = 0.001; 7 ml/kg: 93.42 ± 6.55 vs. 88.77 ± 12.26, p = 0.003). BIS was significantly lower when using the higher TV (60.91 ± 9.99 vs. 66.57 ± 8.22, p = 0.012), although this difference was not clinically relevant. During postoperative sedation, the use of ACD-50 significantly reduced CO(2) retention. SEV reflection was slightly reduced.

Infections are frequently the etiologies underlying the respiratory, and occasionally cardiac, failure that necessitates ECLS. Just as importantly, infections are among the most commonly reported adverse events during ECLS. Infections in this setting may be the sequelae of prolonged critical illness or of underlying immune dysregulation; they may be hospital-acquired infections, and they may or may not be attributable to the presence of ECLS itself, the latter being an aspect that can be difficult to determine. Current registry data and evidence from the literature offer some insights, but also leave open many questions regarding the nature and significance of infections reported both before and during ECLS, including the question of any causal link between ECLS and the development of infections. An ongoing lack of consistency in the identification, diagnosis, management, and prevention of infections during ECLS is limiting our ability to interpret literature data and thus highlighting the need for more rigorous investigation and standardization of definitions. This review aims to characterize the current understanding of infections associated with the use of ECLS, taking into account data from the updated Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry, which provides important context for understanding the epidemiology and outcomes of these patients.

The aim of this paper is to report our experience by describing the one-year management of a large cohort of patients in order to clarify how demanding management is in terms of burden on clinicians. Between June 2017 and June 2018, each access made at the Otolaryngology Clinic of our Institute for issues related to prosthesis by 70 laryngectomised patients rehabilitated by voice prosthesis was registered in a specific database. A review of the data provided information on the incidence, management and outcomes of adverse events encountered during the selected time frame. In addition, a T test was used to evaluate the differences between irradiated and non-irradiated patients and between primary and secondary tracheo-oesophageal-puncture. Leakage through the prosthesis was the most common cause for access (51.86%). The median number of accesses per patient per year was 3.47. The speech therapist autonomously managed 18.1% of accesses. The median number of accesses per patient per year needing a physician was 2.84. The median lifetime of the prosthesis was 4.85 months. Radiotherapy or modality (primary or secondary) of the puncture did not influence the number of accesses per year or the prosthesis lifetime. This retrospective analysis of results highlighted the most frequent issues and the most effective measures to deal with them, which allowed us to define a systematic algorithm to standardise and ease long-term outpatient management.","Parrilla, Claudio; Longobardi, Ylenia; Paludetti, Gaetano; Marenda, Maria Elisabetta; D’Alatri, Lucia; Bussu, Francesco; Scarano, Emanuele; Galli, Jacopo",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,357,1

OBJECTIVE: To construct a novel patient classification of potentially preventable emergency department visits following transport by ambulance, and analyse patient-level characteristic associations with this classification based in Ontario secondary data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Primary Care–like Ambulance transports following Response for 911-Emergencies (PriCARE) patient classification will be constructed using a two-phase RAND/UCLA modified Delphi design. All experts included are physicians with relevant experience in emergency and/or primary care in Ontario. The first phase of the study will determine consensus of the expert committee on which ED interventions performed on patients with non-emergent acuities could be conducted in sub-acute healthcare centres. The second phase will assess consensus of which patient, hospital and acuity factors are most appropriate to be incorporated into a PriCARE classification. We will also investigate secondary outcomes on consensus of which ED interventions could be transferred to a paramedic context given an expanded scope of practice and patient-level characteristics of PriCARE classified individuals.

SETTINGS: A rural setting of Nepal. PARTICIPANTS: Data collection included five video recordings, five key informant interviews and observation notes from a final co-design workshop that involved a total of 68 stakeholders: persons with COPD and their family members; healthcare providers, including respiratory physicians; local community leaders; representatives from local, provincial and federal government; academics; and representatives from non-government organisations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Feasibility and acceptability of using a co-design approach to develop an integrated model of care for people with multi-morbid COPD in rural Nepal. RESULTS: Our qualitative evaluation of the Hasso Plattner’s co-design process found that all stakeholders (including people with COPD/community members, primary care practitioners and local government/senior health officials) were actively engaged in and significantly contributed to the process of co-design. Four main themes were identified which determined the feasibility and acceptability of the resulting integrated model of care: engagement of stakeholders, factors contributing to the co-design, consequences of the co-design process, and challenges and opportunities learnt by the researchers and participants in the co-design process. Based on the relationship between the four main themes emerging from this research, we developed an evaluation framework to guide the co-design of a health service innovation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the Hasso Plattner’s co-design process. Our findings suggest that this co-design approach can be useful and acceptable to local communities and government agencies.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, an institutional protocol requiring preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging and serum Lactate Dehydrogenase levels was implemented. Chart review was performed including all women who underwent intra-abdominal surgery for symptomatic fibroids from 4/23/2013 to 4/23/2015. RESULTS: A total of 1,085 women were included, 479 before and 606 after implementation of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging / Lactate Dehydrogenase protocol. The pre-protocol group had more post-menopausal women (4% vs. 2%, p = 0.022) and women using tamoxifen (2% vs. 0%, p = 0.022) than those in the post-protocol group, but baseline patient characteristics were otherwise similar between groups. Incidence of malignant pathological diagnoses did not change significantly over the time period in relation to protocol implementation. The rate of open surgery for both hysterectomy and myomectomy remained the same in the year preceding and the year following initiation of the protocol (open hysterectomy rate was 19% vs. 16% in pre- and post-protocol groups, respectively, P = 0.463, and open myomectomy rate was 10% vs. 9% rates in pre- and post-protocol groups, respectively, P = 0.776). There was a significant decrease in the use of power morcellation (66% in pre- and 50% in post-protocol cohorts, p<0.001) and an increased use of containment bags (1% in pre- and 19% in post-protocol cohort). When analyzing the subset of women who had abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging / and Lactate Dehydrogenase results, abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging results alone resulted in higher rates of open approach (65% for abnormal vs. 35% for normal). Similarly, a combination of abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Lactate Dehydrogenase tests resulted in higher rates of open approach (70% for abnormal and 17% for normal). Abnormal Lactate Dehydrogenase results alone did not influence route. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of MIS procedures were decreased for women with abnormal preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging results.

In doing so, an e-health application (app), Seha, was introduced in 2018 that allows individuals to have face-to-face visual medical consultations with their doctors on their smartphones. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the app in improving healthcare delivery by ensuring patient satisfaction with the care given, increasing access to care, and improving efficiency in the healthcare system. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to assess the perceptions of users of the Seha app and non-users who continued with traditional health services. The data were collected using an online survey via Google Forms between June 2020 and September 2020. Independent t tests and chi-square (χ(2)) tests were conducted to answer the research questions. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between users and non-users in terms of ease of access to health services (t = − 9.38, p < 0.05), with app users having a higher mean score (4.19 ± 0.91) than non-users (3.41 ± 1.00); satisfaction with health services (t = − 6.33, p < 0.05), with users having a higher mean score (3.96 ± 0.91) than non-users (3.45 ± 0.94); and efficiency (only one visit needed for treatment) (t = − 3.20, p < 0.05), with users having a higher mean score (3.71 ± 0.93) than non-users (3.45 ± 0.93). There were significant associations between the use of the Seha app and age (χ(2) = 8.79, p < 0.05), gender (χ(2) = 22.19, p < 0.05), region (χ(2) = 19.74, p < 0.05), and occupation (χ(2) = 22.05, p < 0.05). There were significant relationships between the three items (on access, satisfaction, and efficiency) and experiencing technical issues (t = 4.47, t = 8.11, and t = 3.24, respectively, p < 0.05), with users who faced technical problems having significantly lower mean scores for all three items. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence that the Seha app improved the delivery of healthcare in Saudi Arabia. Users of the app had a better health experience in terms of their perceived ease of access to healthcare services; their satisfaction with healthcare services; and the efficiency of the system, measured by the number of required doctor visits. Other factors that appeared to influence the use of the app included age, gender, usual source of care, and technical difficulties.

METHODS: Arterial and venous CT images of 87 patients with small bowel malignancies were retrospectively analyzed. The subjective radiological features were evaluated by the two radiologists with a consensus agreement. The region of interest (ROI) was manually delineated along the edge of the lesion on the largest slice, and a total of 402 quantified features were extracted automatically from AK software. The inter- and intrareader reproducibility was evaluated to select highly reproductive features. The univariate analysis and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm were applied to select the feature subsets with high correlation and low redundancy. The multivariate logistic regression analysis based on texture features and radiological features was employed to construct predictive models for identification of small bowel lymphoma. The diagnostic performance of multivariate models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Skill acquisition may be subserved, in part, by interactions between the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex through a cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal network. In prior work, we investigated this network by targeting the cerebellum; here, we explored the consequence of stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) before administering an explicit motor sequence learning paradigm. Using a mixed within- and between- subjects design, we employed anodal (n = 24) and cathodal (n = 25) HD-tDCS (relative to sham) to temporarily alter brain function and examine effects on skill acquisition. The results indicate that both anodal and cathodal prefrontal stimulation impedes motor sequence learning, relative to sham. These findings suggest an overall negative influence of active prefrontal stimulation on the acquisition of a sequential pattern of finger movements. Collectively, this provides novel insight on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in initial skill acquisition, when cognitive processes such as working memory are used. Exploring methods that may improve motor learning is important in developing therapeutic strategies for motor-related diseases and rehabilitation.","Ballard, Hannah K.; Eakin, Sydney M.; Maldonado, Ted; Bernard, Jessica A.",PLoS One,357,8

AIM: The study determined the prevalence of overweight/obesity amongst adolescents in rural high schools and the association with selected factors. SETTING: Fetakgomo Municipality in rural Limpopo Province, South Africa. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 378 adolescents selected through multistage sampling from high schools. Data collected were socio-demography, nutritional knowledge, dietary practices and anthropometry. The International Obesity Task Force age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) cut-off values were used to determine overweight/obesity, whilst adult BMI cut-off values were used for those ≥ 18 years. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) greater than 0.5 indicated abdominal obesity, as well as waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) above the cut-off values. RESULTS: The proportion of overweight/obesity amongst adolescents was 35%, whilst 25% had abdominal obesity by WHR and 21% by WHtR. Multivariate logistic regression showed that being a girl (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.74–4.85), older adolescent (AOR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.57–6.29) and living in a household with employed adults (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.19–4.51) were associated with increased odds of being overweight/obese.

We analyzed posts on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-related Facebook groups and pages for the presence of guideline content, user engagement, and usefulness. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe and analyze posts from Facebook groups and pages that primarily focus on IPF-related content. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on a single date, identifying Facebook groups and pages resulting from separately searching “IPF” and “idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.” For inclusion, groups and pages needed to meet either search term and be in English, publicly available, and relevant to IPF. Every 10th post was assessed for general characteristics, source, focus, and user engagement metrics. Posts were analyzed for presence of IPF guideline content, useful scientific information (eg, scientific publications), useful support information (eg, information about support groups), and potentially harmful information. RESULTS: Eligibility criteria were met by 12 groups and 27 pages, leading to analysis of 523 posts. Of these, 42% contained guideline content, 24% provided useful support, 20% provided useful scientific information, and 5% contained potentially harmful information. The most common post source was nonmedical users (85%). Posts most frequently focused on IPF-related news (29%). Posts containing any guideline content had fewer likes or comments and a higher likelihood of containing potentially harmful content. Posts containing useful supportive information had more likes, shares, and comments. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook contains useful information about IPF, but posts with misinformation and less guideline content have higher user engagement, making them more visible. Identifying ways to help patients with IPF discriminate between useful and harmful information on Facebook and other social media platforms is an important task for health care professionals.","Kochan, Andrew; Ong, Shaun; Guler, Sabina; Johannson, Kerri A; Ryerson, Christopher J; Goobie, Gillian C",JMIR Public Health Surveill,357,12

Unfortunately, chemoprophylaxis and dapsone are only effective for half of the patients with PcP, indicating that additional preventive methods are needed. We predicated the pneumocystis surface protein A12 sequence 1–85 by DNAStar software and BepiPred, and identified it as a potential vaccine candidate by bioresearch. METHODS: We used recombinant A12(1–85) as antigen to immunized mice and detected serum titer of IgG, expression of inflammatory factors by EILSA, qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that immunization with recombinant A12(1–85) increased the serum titer of IgG, promoted the secretion of T lymphocytes, increased the expression of inflammatory factors, and elevated lung inflammatory injury in mice.

RESULTS: The crude protein (CP), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and relative feed value (RFV) of evaluated browse species were higher (p < .01) in wet season than the dry season except for Acacia asak, Ipomoea donaldsonii and Acacia mellifera. Nonetheless, the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents were higher (p < .01) in the dry season except for A. asak and I. donaldsonii. Moreover, A. asak, I. donaldsonii and A. mellifera were the browse species with higher (p < .01) RFV, IVDMD and CP but lower NDF and ADF during the dry season than the wet season, and these species are qualified as good‐quality forage. Thus. Barleria spinisepala were better to use in both seasons, but browse species like I. donaldsonii and A. asak in dry season were ranked as best quality roughage.

Its applications range from the manufacturing of vaccines and hormones to bulk chemicals and biofuels. In recent years, major efforts have been undertaken to expand this portfolio to include structurally complex natural products, such as polyketides and nonribosomally synthesized peptides. These compounds often have useful pharmacological properties, which make them valuable drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, or autoimmune disorders. In nature, polyketides and nonribosomal peptides are generated by consecutive condensation reactions of short chain acyl-CoAs or amino acids, respectively, with the substrates and reaction intermediates being bound to large, multidomain enzymes. For the reconstitution of these multistep catalytic processes, the enzymatic assembly lines need to be functionally expressed and the required substrates must be supplied in reasonable quantities. Furthermore, the production hosts need to be protected from the toxicity of the biosynthetic products. In this review, we will summarize and evaluate the status quo regarding the heterologous production of polyketides and nonribosomal peptides in S. cerevisiae.

SR-B1 facilitates the influx of cholesterol to the cell from lipoproteins in systemic circulation. This influx of cholesterol may be important for many cellular functions, including the synthesis of androgens. Castration-resistant prostate cancer tumors can synthesize androgens de novo to supplement the loss of exogenous sources often induced by androgen deprivation therapy. Silencing of SR-B1 may impact the ability of prostate cancer cells, particularly those of the castration-resistant state, to maintain the intracellular supply of androgens by removing a supply of cholesterol. SR-B1 expression is elevated in CRPC models and has been linked to poor survival of patients. The overarching belief has been that cholesterol modulation, through either synthesis or uptake inhibition, will impact essential signaling processes, impeding the proliferation of prostate cancer. The reduction in cellular cholesterol availability can impede prostate cancer proliferation through both decreased steroid synthesis and steroid-independent mechanisms, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this article, we discuss and highlight the work on SR-B1 as a potential novel drug target for CRPC management.","Pandey, Mitali; Cuddihy, Grace; Gordon, Jacob A.; Cox, Michael E.; Wasan, Kishor M.",Pharmaceutics,357,17

High CBI is correlated with high depression, neuropsychiatry symptoms, low cognitive patient’s functions. Caregivers have the following intrapsychic behaviors: poor self-care, poor ability to take care of themselves; they exercise control over themselves and do not consider and/or ignore their basic needs at emotional and physical levels. These intrapsychic behaviours are indicators of depression (SASB Model) and are correlated with high care burden–CBI and high depression-CDQ. DISCUSSION: Care burden is closely related to the depression and individual personality (intrapsychic experience) of the caregiver.

Significantly, however, in numerous pathological states including infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis) immune cells are effectively recruited to and infiltrate in the CNS. This immune response can be a two-edged sword required on the one hand to control infection and facilitate tissue repair and regeneration but on the other causing tissue injury that can result in life threatening complications.

The ease of exploitation is commonly dictated by favourable geological setting, ore grade, tonnage, existing processing technology, costs and attendant environmental concerns including local people. These aspects need to be assessed properly before commencing exploitation. Apart from strengthening downstream sector, upstream sector also need to be developed for identifying and quantifying additional natural resources to sustain “Rare Earth Industry Chain”. This endeavour may also involve innovative groups at the interface of information technology and the minerals, metals and materials engineering domains (cf. Pradip et al. 2019). Assessment of effective recovery of REE and associated metals from industrial wastes and mine dumps, comprising ‘Technospheric mining’, should continue to receive focussed attention. The indigenous manufacturing of intermediate products need to be augmented with matching progressive growth of technological advancements. Industrially speaking, promotion of the “Rare Earth Industry” should be an integral part of the present programme of “Make in India” (Singh 2019). In this regard, a beginning can be made by the AMD-IREL-BARC-NFC-DMRL-ARCI combine. To achieve this goal, several of the industrial partners like Aluminium extraction, Thermal Power Plants, Fertiliser Plants, different Mining Agencies and Steel Plants can also be involved as partners. Also, India can promote its ties with countries, as has been established now with Japan for improving its domain knowledge and new technologies for both upstream and downstream processes of the “Indian Rare Earth Industry”. Significantly, according to REAI News (2020), “2020 looks to be a pivotal year for rare earths”.","Singh, Yamuna",Rare Earth Element Resources: Indian Context,357,19

There is increasing recognition that adolescence is an important time to intervene; habits formed during this period tend to last, and physical and psychological changes during adolescence make it an important time to help individuals form healthier habits. Improving adolescents’ health behaviours is important not only for their own health now and in adulthood, but also for the health of any future children. Building on LifeLab—an existing, purpose-built educational facility at the University of Southampton—we have developed a multi-component intervention for secondary school students called Engaging Adolescents in Changing Behaviour (EACH-B) that aims to motivate and support adolescents to eat better and be more physically active. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the EACH-B intervention. The primary outcomes of the intervention are self-reported dietary quality and objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels, both assessed at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. The EACH-B intervention consists of three linked elements: professional development for teachers including training in communication skills to support health behaviour change; the LifeLab educational module comprising in-school teaching of nine science lessons linked to the English National Curriculum and a practical day visit to the LifeLab facility; and a personalised digital intervention that involves social support and game features that promote eating better and being more active. Both the taught module and the LifeLab day are designed with a focus on the science behind the messages about positive health behaviours, such as diet and PA, for the adolescents now, in adulthood and their future offspring, with the aim of promoting personal plans for change. The EACH-B research trial aims to recruit approximately 2300 secondary school students aged 12–13 years from 50 schools (the clusters) from Hampshire and neighbouring counties. Participating schools will be randomised to either the control or intervention arm. The intervention will be run during two academic years, with continual recruitment of schools throughout the school year until the sample size is reached. The schools allocated to the control arm will receive normal schooling but will be offered the intervention after data collection for the trial is complete. An economic model will be developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the EACH-B intervention compared with usual schooling. DISCUSSION: Adolescents’ health needs are often ignored and they can be difficult to engage in behaviour change. Building a cheap, sustainable way of engaging them in making healthier choices will benefit their long-term health and that of their future children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 74109264. Registered on 30 August 2019. EACH-B is a cluster randomised controlled trial, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (RP-PG-0216-20004).","Strömmer, Sofia; Barrett, Millie; Woods-Townsend, Kathryn; Baird, Janis; Farrell, David; Lord, Joanne; Morrison, Leanne; Shaw, Sarah; Vogel, Christina; Lawrence, Wendy; Lovelock, Donna; Bagust, Lisa; Varkonyi-Sepp, Judit; Coakley, Patsy; Campbell, Lyall; Anderson, Ross; Horsfall, Tina; Kalita, Neelam; Onyimadu, Olu; Clarke, John; Cooper, Cyrus; Chase, Debbie; Lambrick, Danielle; Little, Paul; Hanson, Mark; Godfrey, Keith; Inskip, Hazel; Barker, Mary",Trials,357,1

The stability and success of these institutions depends, in part, on popular support. Times of crisis can introduce novel dynamics that alter popular support for protective institutions, particularly among those who do not benefit from those protections. We explore this possibility in the context of Title IX's gender equality requirements and infrastructure to address sexual harassment in college sports. We conduct a large survey of college student-athletes to study their attitudes on these issues in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant financial challenges affecting college sports. We find that male student-athletes and those with sexist attitudes exhibit alarmingly low levels of support for ensuring the maintenance of equality and sexual harassment policy under Title IX during the COVID-19 crisis and eventual recovery. The results accentuate the vulnerability of certain populations during crises and the importance of maintaining strong institutional policy support during such times.","Druckman, James N.; Sharrow, Elizabeth A.",,357,1

Their predominant presence in the immune cells emphasizes its significant role in immune response. The downstream effector proteins IL-1β and IL-18 are responsible for the biological functions of the NLRP3 inflammasome upon encountering the alarmins and microbial ligands. Although the NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for host defense during infections, uncontrolled activation and overproduction of IL-1β and IL-18 increase the risk of developing autoimmune and metabolic disorders. Emerging evidences suggest the action of lncRNAs in regulating the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome in various disease conditions. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is an emerging field of study and evidence on their regulatory role in various diseases is grabbing attention. Recent studies emphasize the functions of lncRNAs in the fine control of the NLRP3 inflammasome at nuclear and cytoplasmic levels by interfering in chromatin architecture, gene transcription and translation. Recently, lncRNAs are also found to control the activity of various regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome. Understanding the precise role of lncRNA in controlling the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome helps us to design targeted therapies for multiple inflammatory diseases. The present review is a novel attempt to consolidate the substantial role of lncRNAs in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. A deeper insight on the NLRP3 inflammasome regulation by lncRNAs will help in developing targeted and beneficial therapeutics in the future.","Menon, Mridula P.; Hua, Kuo-Feng",Front Immunol,357,22

Optimal medical treatment is not completely understood at this time. The epidemiology and outcomes of bacterial co-infections are not well-established; however, empiric antibiotic (abx) use is anecdotally common. The purpose of this study is to characterize empiric antimicrobial drug selection and timing in COVID-19 and evaluate the impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: Cross-sectional cohort study for COVID-19 positive inpatients from March 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020 at an academic medical center and 4 community hospitals. Inclusion: patients with a documented positive COVID-19 PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Exclusion: patients less than 18 years; deceased or transitioned to hospice within 24 hours of admission. Primary endpoint: empiric abx drug, initiation, duration and indication. Additional data collected: severity of illness, co-infection diagnosis, microbiology, and adverse drug effects (ADE). Clinical outcomes included time to recovery by COVID-19 ordinal outcome, clinical status at day 15, and readmission. RESULTS: 400 patients were included with 27% from the ICU. COVID symptom category included mild (23.8%), moderate (53%), severe (15%), and critical (8.3%). 322 (80.5%) received abx at any time during hospital stay, 301 (93.5%) started within 1 day of admission. Most common documented indication community-acquired pneumonia (69%). Identified 43 (10.8%) microbiologically confirmed co-infections, including 5 MRSA and 7 Pseudomonas. Median duration of initial abx 4 days. 54/322 (16.8%) had abx restarted after discontinuation. Median days to recovery without abx was 10 days (7 – 14) and 14 days (9 – 20) with abx. Patient characteristics and outcomes described in table 1. 74 abx related ADE were identified: gastrointestinal 37 and renal 22. CONCLUSION: It’s difficult to distinguish bacterial and Covid-19 in coinfections in patients ill enough to be hospitalized. Longer courses of empiric abx therapy were prevalent as the severity of illness increased. However, the low frequency of microbiologically confirmed bacterial co-infections results in potentially unnecessary abx exposure. This exposure increases risk of abx ADE and may not improve clinical outcome.

The online discussions data from six hospitality and tourism related crises were used to test which crisis and media coverage characteristics significantly affected the public’s emotional and behavioral reactions to crises. With reference to the attribution theory and the situational crisis communication theory, this study identified the potentially influential crisis characteristics, hypothesized their relationship with variables describing consumer reactions to crises, and then tested those relationships in a series of ANOVA and hierarchical regression analyses. Results indicated that the locus of control, crisis stability, attribution of organizational responsibility, and organizational response strategy affected the public’s cognitive and emotional responses to crises most strongly. The attractiveness and goodwill of media sources also had an effect, as well as the quality and fairness of messages. This study makes a methodological contribution to tourism research by training machine-learning classifiers prior to conducting hypothesis testing.

Two-wave data collected from 326 employees in the manufacturing and technology industry in China supported our hypothesized model. We have found that narcissistic leaders have a negative impact on followership (F) and TF of subordinates; Supervisor–subordinate guanxi (SSG) and team leadership relationship identity play a partial mediating role between narcissistic leadership and subordinates and team followership. Furthermore, individual and team values play a moderating role in the process of influencing a mechanism.

The PaO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are closely related and both are used to monitor oxygenation status. However, SpO2 values cannot be used as an exact substitute for PaO2. The aim of this study in acutely ill and stable patients was to determine at which SpO2 level PaO2 is more or less certain to be in the physiological range. METHODS This is an observational study prospectively collecting data pairs of PaO2 and SpO2 values in patients admitted to the emergency room or intensive care unit (Prospective Inpatient Acutely ill cohort; PIA cohort). A second cohort of retrospective data of patients who underwent pulmonary function testing was also included (Retrospective Outpatient Pulmonary cohort; ROP cohort). Arterial hypoxemia was defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg and hyperoxemia as PaO2 > 125 mmHg. The SpO2 cut-off values with the lowest risk of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were determined as the 95th percentile of the observed SpO2 values corresponding with the observed hypoxemic and hyperoxemic PaO2 values. RESULTS 220 data pairs were collected in the PIA cohort. 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 94%, and 95% of hyperoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 above 96%. Additionally in the 1379 data pairs of the ROP cohort, 95% of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 93%. CONCLUSION The SpO2 level marking an increased risk of arterial hypoxemia is not substantially different in acutely ill versus stable patients. In acutely ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen an SpO2 target of 95% maximizes the likelihood of maintaining PaO2 in the physiological range.","Röttgering, Jantine G; de Man, Angelique M E; Schuurs, Thomas C; Wils, Evert-Jan; Daniels, Johannes M; van den Aardweg, Joost G; Girbes, Armand R J; Smulders, Yvo M",PloS one,357,16

Platelet factor 4 (PF4), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and P-selectin levels were higher in LAC than in HF pleural fluids. However, plasmatic PF4 and P-selectin levels were similar in LAC and HF. VEGF positively correlated with TGF-β and sPD-L1 in LAC but not in HF pleural fluids. LAC pleural fluids also inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxicity and reduced IL-17 production. PF4 levels inversely correlated with T cell function. The high content of PF4 in MPE was associated with poor prognosis. Our findings suggest that an impaired response of T lymphocytes induced by PF4 provides a significant advantage for tumor progression.","Mulet, Maria; Zamora, Carlos; Porcel, José M; Nieto, Juan C; Pajares, Virginia; Muñoz-Fernandez, Ana M; Calvo, Nuria; Esquerda, Aureli; Vidal, Silvia",Cancer letters,357,5

The aim of this study is to reveal whether anesthesia has an impact on maternal and fetal cord ischemia modified albumin levels. METHODS Seventy two women with uncomplicated term pregnancies were randomized to spinal (n=37) or general anesthesia (n=35) groups. The blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate of the patients were recorded during the procedure. Maternal blood samples of ischemia modified albumin (IMA) were taken 10 min from the start of the procedure. The fetal cord blood samples of IMA were taken immediately after birth. RESULTS Maternal (0.99 ± 0.19 vs. 0.80 ± 0.27) and fetal (1.00 ± 0.21 vs. 0.70 ± 0.26) IMA levels were significantly higher in the general anesthesia group. Fetal IMA levels were positively correlated with maternal gravidity (r=0.31; P=0.008), parity (r=0.25; P=0.028), and fetal birth weight (r=0.23, P=0.045). Also, as time from incision to delivery lengthens, fetal IMA levels increase (r=0.29, P=0.012). CONCLUSION Fetal cord ischemia modified albumin levels were higher in the general anesthesia group, therefore, it is proposed that regional anesthesia should be the preferred route of anesthesia for an elective cesarean section, at least until the impact of high fetal cord IMA levels are manifested.","Caglar, Gamze Sinem; Erdogdu, Perihan; Gursoy, Aslı Yarcı; Seker, Rabia; Demirtas, Selda",Journal of perinatal medicine,357,31

How the transmission of detrimental mtDNA mutations is restricted through the maternal lineage is debated. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial fission, together with the lack of mtDNA replication, segregate mtDNA into individual organelles in the Drosophila early germarium. After mtDNA segregation, mtDNA transcription begins, which activates respiration. Mitochondria harboring wild-type genomes have functional electron transport chains and propagate more vigorously than mitochondria containing deleterious mutations in hetreoplasmic cells. Therefore, mtDNA expression acts as a stress test for the integrity of mitochondrial genomes and sets the stage for replication competition. Our observations support selective inheritance at the organelle level through a series of developmentally orchestrated mitochondrial processes. We also show that the Balbiani body has a minor role in mtDNA selective inheritance by supplying healthy mitochondria to the pole plasm. These two mechanisms may act synergistically to secure the transmission of functional mtDNA through Drosophila oogenesis.","Chen, Zhe; Wang, Zong-Heng; Zhang, Guofeng; Bleck, Christopher K E; Chung, Dillon J; Madison, Grey P; Lindberg, Eric; Combs, Christian; Balaban, Robert S; Xu, Hong",The Journal of cell biology,357,17

However, in nulliparous women or women with a previous cesarean section, induction of labor can pose a clinical challenge. Despite an overall expansion of medical indications for labor induction, there is little international consensus regarding the criteria for induction of labor, or for the recommended methods among nulliparous women. In this light, we assessed variations in the practice of induction of labor among 21 birth units in a nation-wide cohort of women with no prior vaginal birth. MATERIAL AND METHODS We carried out a prospective observational pilot study of women with induced labor, and no prior vaginal birth, across 21 Norwegian birth units. We registered induction indications, methods and outcomes from Sept 1st - Dec 31st 2018 using a web-based case record form. Women were grouped into 'Nulliparous term cephalic', 'Previous cesarean section' and 'Other Robson' (Robson groups 6, 7, 8 or 10). RESULTS More than 98% of eligible women (n=1818) were included. There was a wide variety of methods used for induction of labor. In nulliparous term cephalic pregnancies, cesarean section rates ranged from 11.1 - 40.6% between birth units, whereas in the previous cesarean section group, rates ranged from 22.7 - 67.5%. The indications 'large fetus' and 'other fetal' indications were associated with the highest cesarean rates. Failed inductions and failure to progress in labor contributed most to the cesarean rates. Uterine rupture occurred in two women (0.11%), both in the previous cesarean section group. In neonates, 1.6% had Apgar <7 at 5 minutes, and 0.4% had an umbilical artery pH <7.00. CONCLUSIONS Cesarean rates and applied methods for induction of labor varied widely in this nation-wide cohort of women without a prior vaginal birth. Neonatal outcomes were similar to that of normal birth populations. Results could indicate the need to move towards more standardized induction protocols associated with optimal outcomes for mother and baby.","Sørbye, Ingvil Krarup; Oppegaard, Kevin Sunde; Weeks, Andrew; Marsdal, Kjersti; Jacobsen, Anne Flem",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,357,19

In contrast, none of the 3-(arylmethylene)-substituted 1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)azetidin-2-ones (L series) showed significant activities in the assay. Further studies indicated that B7c inhibited tubulin polymerization, disrupted in vitro vascularization, blocked cell cycle progression at G2/M phase, induced cell apoptosis, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species level in a dose-dependent way. Compound B7c also inhibited significantly tumor growth in a xenograft mice model with no obvious drop in the mice body weights. Collectively, these results suggested that B7c and its analogues should merit further investigation as new promising antitumor agents.","Liang, Yuru; Zhang, Mao; Zhou, Pengfei; Liu, Mingming; Li, Jianqi; Wang, Yang",Bioorganic chemistry,357,14

For all three techniques, Coordinate Response Measure sentences were used as the stimuli and ""Charlie"" was used as the call sign. A progressive tracking procedure was used to estimate the speech identification thresholds for listeners with varying hearing thresholds. The target sentence was always presented at 0° azimuth angle, whereas the maskers were colocated (0°) with the target or symmetrically spatially separated by ±15°, ±30°, or ±45°. Results Data analysis revealed similar speech identification thresholds for the iPad and headphone conditions and slightly poorer thresholds for the loudspeaker array condition across participant groups. This was true for all spatial separations between the target and the maskers. Conclusion Strong correlation between the headphone and iPad data presented in this study indicated that the spatial release from masking module in the PART iPad app can be used as a clinical tool to assess spatial processing ability prior to audiologic evaluation in the clinic and can also be used to make recommendations for and to track progress with aural rehabilitation programs over time.","Srinivasan, Nirmal Kumar; Holtz, Allison; Gallun, Frederick J",American journal of audiology,357,12

Despite the recognition of its importance, there is still a real need for standardized training of clinical microbiologists and harmonisation of diagnostic procedures. This is particularly true for veterinary clinical microbiology where additional challenges exist when microbiologists are trying to fulfil a professional role very similar to their colleagues working in human microbiology laboratories. The specific points that need addressing to improve the outputs of veterinary microbiology laboratories discussed here include 1) harmonisation of methodologies used by veterinary laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST); 2) specific guidelines for interpretation and reporting of AST results for animal pathogens; 3) guidelines for detection of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in animal isolates; 4) standardisation of diagnostic procedures for animal clinical specimens and 5) the need to train more veterinary clinical microbiology specialists. However, there is now a plan to address these issues led by the European Network for Optimisation of Veterinary Antimicrobial Treatment (ENOVAT) which is bringing together experts in veterinary microbiology, pharmacology, epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship from Europe and wider afield. ENOVAT is aiming to work with project partners towards standardisation and harmonisation of laboratory methodologies and optimisation of veterinary antimicrobial treatment. Ultimately, the project may provide a mechanism for standardisation and harmonisation of veterinary clinical microbiology methodologies, which could then be used as a template for implementation at a wider international level.","Timofte, Dorina; Broens, Els M; Guardabassi, Luca; Pomba, Constanca; Allerton, Fergus; Ikonomopoulos, John; Overesch, Gudrun; Damborg, Peter",Journal of clinical microbiology,357,20

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. SETTING Tertiary neurotologic referral center. PATIENTS Nineteen patients (12 female/7 male subjects) with facial paralysis because of posterior fossa surgery for tumor (n = 15), Bell's palsy (n = 1), facial neuroma (n = 1), hemangioma (n = 1), and trauma (n = 1) who underwent HFA from 1997 to 2011, with at least 1-year follow-up. Mean age at surgery is 47.4 years (range, 11.2-83 yr). Mean follow-up is 4.0 years. INTERVENTION Side-to-end hypoglossal to facial anastomosis with transposition of the intratemporal facial nerve (swingdown HFA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE House-Brackmann (H-B) facial nerve grade. RESULTS Seven patients (36.8%) achieved an H-B Grade III, 9 patients (47.4%) a grade IV, and 3 patients (15.8%) a grade V at last follow-up. No patients complained of dysphagia, dysarthria, or had evidence of oral incompetence. One patient complained of mild tongue weakness. Age at time of HFA (p ≤ 0.049, III younger than V) and time from facial nerve injury to HFA (p ≤ 0.02, III<IV and V) were significant factors for ultimate facial nerve outcome. All patients with an H-B III result had HFA within 6 months of injury. Other factors were not significant. CONCLUSION The HFA swingdown technique is a safe and effective method to restore facial nerve function in patients with facial paralysis and obviates the need for an interposition jump graft.","Slattery, William H; Cassis, Adam M; Wilkinson, Eric P; Santos, Felipe; Berliner, Karen","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",357,1

This study assessed acute ischemic stroke quality of care measure conformity by hospitals receiving Primary Stroke Center (PSC) certification and those receiving the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) Performance Achievement Award (PAA) recognition. METHODS AND RESULTS The patient and hospital characteristics as well as performance/quality measures for acute ischemic stroke from 1356 hospitals participating in the GWTG-Stroke Program 2010-2012 were compared. Hospitals were classified as PAA+/PSC+ (hospitals n = 410, patients n = 169,302), PAA+/PSC- (n = 415, n = 129,454), PAA-/PSC+ (n = 88, n = 26,386), and PAA-/PSC- (n = 443, n = 75,565). A comprehensive set of stroke measures were compared with adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics. Patient characteristics were similar by PAA and PSC status but PAA-/PSC- hospitals were more likely to be smaller and nonteaching. Measure conformity was highest for PAA+/PSC+ and PAA+/PSC- hospitals, intermediate for PAA-/PSC+ hospitals, and lowest for PAA-/PSC- hospitals (all-or-none care measure 91.2%, 91.2%, 84.3%, and 76.9%, respectively). After adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, PAA+/PSC+, PAA+/PSC-, and PAA-/PSC+ hospitals had 3.15 (95% CIs 2.86 to 3.47); 3.23 (2.93 to 3.56) and 1.72 (1.47 to 2.00), higher odds for providing all indicated stroke performance measures to patients compared with PAA-/PSC- hospitals. CONCLUSIONS While both PSC certification and GWTG-Stroke PAA recognition identified hospitals providing higher conformity with care measures for patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke, PAA recognition was a more robust identifier of hospitals with better performance.","Fonarow, Gregg C; Liang, Li; Smith, Eric E; Reeves, Mathew J; Saver, Jeffrey L; Xian, Ying; Hernandez, Adrian F; Peterson, Eric D; Schwamm, Lee H",Journal of the American Heart Association,357,1

DESIGN Retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing TAR with HCA and ACP. Patients were divided into group A (ACP ≥ 90 min, n = 12) and group B (ACP < 90 min, n = 17) and compared regarding in-hospital mortality and neurological complications (primary outcome measures) and major complications, biochemical markers of organ damage, and blood product use (secondary outcome measures). Complications were analyzed according to standards of the International Aortic Arch Surgery Study Group. RESULTS Overall in-hospital mortality was 4/29 (14%); 1/12 (8.3%) in group A versus 3/17 (18%) in group B, p = 0.62. No grade-V (lethal) neurological complication occurred, but five patients (all in group B) had grade-IV neurological complications: one general and two each focal and spinal neurological deficit (p = 0.047, overall). Prevalence of grade-II (temporary) general neurological deficit was 17% (group A) versus 27% (group B), p = 0.66. None of the patients suffered ≥ grade-IV respiratory or renal complications. Other complications, biochemical markers, and blood product usage were not significantly different. CONCLUSION Outcomes in TAR with HCA and extended (≥ 90 min) three-vessel ACP were encouraging and could be contemplated with anticipated time-consuming TAR.","Bjurbom, Markus; Franco-Cereceda, Anders; Liska, Jan; Olsson, Christian",Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ,357,16

This bold initiative aimed to address both the immediate and long-term health care needs within post-disaster Haiti through a strategic investment in graduate medical education (GME). Here, the authors describe their approach, which included building consensus, aspiring to international standards, and investing in shared governance structures under Haitian leadership. The Haitian MOH's strategy and priorities guided the development, implementation, and expansion of solutions to the ongoing crisis in human resources for health within the acute context. Local leadership of this initiative ensured a sustained and transformative model of GME that has carried Haiti beyond acute relief and towards a more reliable health system. The enduring success can be measured through sustained governance systems, graduates who have remained in Haiti, standardized curricula, a culture of continuous improvement, and the historic achievement of international accreditation. While ongoing challenges persist, Haiti has demonstrated that the strategy of investing in GME in response to acute disasters should be considered in other global settings to support the revitalization of tenuous health systems.","Morse, Michelle; Spahn, Lauren; Pierre, Paul; Lucien, Franc Iscka; Israel, Kerling; Toussaint, Sterman; Robert, Merly; Katz, Joel T; Buyske, Jo; Clisbee, Mary; Suffrin, Dimitri J C; Raymonville, Maxi; Cadet, Jean Claude; Pierre, Sosthene; Mukherjee, Joia; Rhatigan, Joseph; Farmer, Paul E",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,357,16

Pain relief, using multimodal analgesia, is an integral component of any orchestrated approach to achieve clinically appropriate goals in critically ill patients. Sedative management, however, remains a significant challenge. Subsequent studies including most recent randomized trials have failed to provide strong evidence in favor of a sedative agent, a mode of sedation or ancillary protocols such as sedative interruption and sedative minimization. In addition, clinical practice guidelines, despite a comprehensive evaluation of relevant literature, have limitations when applied to individual patients. These limitations have been most apparent during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As such, there is a need for a mindset shift to a practical and achievable sedation strategy, driven by patients' characteristics and individual patient needs, rather than one cocktail for all patients. In this review, we present key principles to achieve patient-and symptom-oriented optimal analgesia and sedation in the critically ill patients. Sedative intensity should be proportionate to care complexity with due consideration to an individual patient's modifiers. The use of multimodal analgesics, sedatives, and antipsychotics agents-that are easily titratable-reduces the overall quantum of sedatives and opioids, and reduces the risk of adverse events while maximizing clinical benefits. In addition, critical considerations regarding the choice of sedative agents should be given to factors such as age, medical versus operative diagnosis, and cardiovascular status. Specific populations such as trauma, neurological injury, and pregnancy should also be taken into account to maximize efficacy and reduce adverse events.","Shehabi, Yahya; Al-Bassam, Wisam; Pakavakis, Adrian; Murfin, Brendan; Howe, Belinda",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,357,1

The neural activity of the mice sensorimotor cortex was measured using epidural electrodes and analyzed with quantified electroencephalography (qEEG). Pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) and delta power were used to assess the neurorehabilitative effect of LIFU stimulation. Compared to the Stroke (non-treated) group, the LIFU group exhibited a decrease in cortical pathological delta activity, significant recovery in pdBSI and enhanced performance on the balance beam walking test.

This study aimed to report clinical outcomes of manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke refractory to SBT. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and angiographic data of 30 patients who underwent MAT with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter because of refractory occlusion after SBT with a Solitaire stent as first-line endovascular therapy. Refractory occlusion was defined by a lack of successful revascularization (defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) after five retrieval attempts. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of ≤2 at 3 months. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in 83.3% (25/30) of the patients who underwent MAT after failed SBT. There was no arterial rupture or dissection or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Two embolic occlusions in a new arterial territory and five subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred, neither of which caused neurological worsening. At the 3-month follow-up, 36.7% (11/30) of patients exhibited a good outcome. The mortality rate was 6.7% (2/30) at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that MAT with the Penumbra reperfusion catheter can further increase the revascularization rate without serious complications in patients with acute stroke with refractory occlusions after SBT with a Solitaire stent.","Kim, Seul Kee; Yoon, Woong; Moon, Sung Min; Park, Man Seok; Jeong, Gwang Woo; Kang, Heoung Keun",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,357,16

Despite its increasing popularity and safety, the abdominal donor site remains a major source of postoperative pain. Conventional postoperative pain relief protocol consists primarily of a patient-controlled anesthesia device delivering intravenous opioids. Opioids can cause numerous side effects such as sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and bladder and bowel dysfunction. A promising approach to provide postoperative pain control of the abdominal incision is the newly developed transversus abdominis plane peripheral nerve block. METHODS/DESIGN This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial designed to rigorously test the effectiveness of a transversus abdominis plane catheter delivering intermittent local anesthetic in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction. The primary objective of this study is compare the mean total opioid consumption in the first postoperative 48 hours between the control and study groups including the patient-controlled anesthesia amounts and oral narcotic doses converted to intravenous morphine equivalent units. The secondary outcome measures include the following parameters: total in-hospital cumulative opioid consumption; daily patient-reported pain scores; total in-hospital cumulative anti-nausea consumption; nausea and sedation scores; and Quality of Recovery score; time to first bowel movement, ambulation, and duration of hospital stay. DISCUSSION Autologous breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue is rapidly becoming the reconstructive option of choice for postmastectomy patients across North America. A substantial component of the pain experienced by patients after this abdominally based procedure is derived from the abdominal wall incision. By potentially decreasing the need for systemic opioids and their associated side effects, this transversus abdominis plane block study will utilize the most scientifically rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial methodology to potentially improve both clinical care and health outcomes in breast cancer surgery patients.

However, 20.4-34.9% of these patients may fail to achieve or maintain the weight loss on long-term follow-up and may require additional procedures. StomaphyX has been promoted for weight reduction in such patients. OBJECTIVES To study whether endoluminal reduction of gastric pouch and stoma using StomaphyX results in sustained weight loss in patients who regain weight after gastric bypass. METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on 59 postgastric bypass patients who underwent revision of gastric pouch using StomaphyX from 2007 to 2008. Postprocedure weight at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months follow-up as well as weight at the time of the review was recorded for each patient. RESULTS Average weight loss and excess body weight loss (EBWL) were 2.6 ± 2.3 kg and 7.3 ± 7.1% (n = 42) at 1 week, 3.7 ± 2.9 kg and 11.6 ± 12.1% (n = 31) at 1 month, and 3.8 ± 4.5 kg and 11.5 ± 17.9% (n = 10) at 6 months respectively. At the time of review, the average follow-up was 41 months, average weight loss was 1.7 ± 9.7 kg, and EBWL was 4.3 ± 29.8% (n = 53). Endoscopy in 12 patients at average 18 months follow-up showed no sustained reduction in pouch and stoma size. CONCLUSIONS StomaphyX results in weight loss that is not sustained on long-term follow-up. Pouch and stoma tend to regain their preprocedure size on follow-up.

BACKGROUND The identification of asymptomatic patients with carotid disease who are at risk of stroke remains a challenge. There is an increasing awareness that plaque characteristics may best risk-stratify this population. We hypothesized that OCT, a new high-resolution (∼ 10 μm) imaging modality, might be useful for the identification of low-risk versus high-risk carotid plaque features and help us to understand the relationship between carotid diameter stenosis and plaque morphology to ischemic stroke. METHODS Fifty-three patients undergoing diagnostic carotid angiography were studied with OCT. Data analysis was carried out by imaging experts who were unaware of the clinical characteristics of the study population. RESULTS Plaque with American Heart Association type VI complicated features was more common in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients (74.1% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.02). This was largely driven by differences in the incidence of thin-cap fibroatheroma with rupture (40.7% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.056) and thrombus (67.7% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.034). Conversely, non-type VI plaques were more common in asymptomatic than symptomatic patients (63.6% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.02). No association between the degree of stenosis and plaque morphology was identified. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective analysis of carotid OCT data supports the hypothesis that the evaluation of carotid plaque characteristics with this high-resolution imaging technique has the potential to alter the understanding and treatment of carotid artery disease.","Jones, Michael R; Attizzani, Guilherme F; Given, Curtis A; Brooks, William H; Ganocy, Stephen J; Ramsey, Christian N; Fujino, Yusuke; Bezerra, Hiram G; Costa, Marco A",JACC.

This review summarizes the different models used to efficiently reproduce certain aspects of BM in vitro; however, they still lack the complexity of this tissue, which is relevant for fundamental aspects such as drug resistance development in multiple myeloma. Extracellular matrix composition, material topography, vascularization, cellular composition or stemness vs. differentiation balance are discussed as variables that could be rationally defined in tissue engineering approaches for achieving more relevant in vitro models. Fully humanized platforms closely resembling natural interactions still remain challenging and the question of to what extent accurate tissue complexity reproduction is essential to reliably predict drug responses is controversial.

In this paper, I use the case of VMMC opposition in Lesotho to examine how the new era of 'partnerships' has shifted the architecture of contemporary global health, specifically considering how global agreements are translated or negotiated into local practice. I argue that Lesotho's domestic policy-makers, in employing national statistics to assess if VMMC is an effective approach to addressing the local epidemic, are asserting a claim of expertise.

METHODS Data were derived from the population-based Swedish AMORIS cohort with baseline examinations from 1985-1996. The Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) was calculated at two time points within 5 years. Thereafter, we associated changes in FIB-4 with outcomes. Incident severe liver disease was ascertained through linkage with Swedish national registers until 2011. Hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for outcomes were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS Of 126,942 persons with available FIB-4 data, 40,729 (32.1%) underwent a second test within 5 years (mean interval 2.4 years). During 613,376 person-years of follow-up, 581 events of severe liver disease were documented (0.95/1,000 person-years). An increase of one unit in FIB-4 was associated with an elevated risk of severe liver disease (aHR=1.81, 95%CI=1.67-1.96). Transitioning from a low- or intermediate- to a high-risk group was associated with an increased risk of severe liver disease compared with those consistently in the low-risk group (aHR=7.99 and 8.64, respectively). A particularly increased risk of severe liver disease was found in persons defined as high-risk at both tests (aHR=17.04, 95%CI=11.67-24.88). However, almost half of all events occurred in those consistently in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS Repeated testing of FIB-4 within 5 years improves the identification of individuals in the general population at an increased risk of severe liver disease. However, the sensitivity is comparatively low and improved tests are needed for screening in a general population or primary care setting.","Hagström, Hannes; Talbäck, Mats; Andreasson, Anna; Walldius, Göran; Hammar, Niklas",Journal of hepatology,357,24

METHOD Front-line nurses from a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China, participated. Participants completed the Chinese versions of the General Information Questionnaire, the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, and the General Self-Efficacy Scale. RESULTS A total of 149 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The median total hospice care attitudes score was median 102.00(interquartile range, 95.5-120.50). The nurses' attitudes toward hospice care were significantly associated with their age, knowledge of hospice care, level of empathy, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION The attitudes of front-line nurses toward hospice care need to be improved. Hospital departments should establish an effective public health emergency strategy, provide training to increase front-line nurses' knowledge and practical experience of hospice care, cultivate nurses' empathy, and enhance their sense of self-efficacy, in order to improve the quality of hospice care for patients and their families.","Liu, Qinghua; Tao, Jing; Gao, Lianlian; He, Xifei; Wang, Yuping; Xia, Wenlin; Huang, Lihong",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,357,27

Nurses have been at the centre of this experience managing the outbreak through direct bedside care, managing hospital units, providing Covid-19 testing, and contact tracing. PURPOSE The aim of this article is to examine the role that nurses played in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic through the voices of the participants. METHODS Using a phenomenological methodology thirty-one interviews were completed via phone and thematic analysis was completed. RESULTS The major themes that emerged from this phenomenological study were: emotional challenges, uncertainty, and protective factors. Emotional challenges included, stress, anxiety, exhaustion, frustration, guilt, and loneliness. These challenges were magnified by uncertainty through leadership and communication challenges, needs of the pandemic versus needs of the patient, and Covid-19 and best practice. In this study, emotional challenges were mitigated by the protective factors of: education, ability to contribute, team cohesiveness, and community support. CONCLUSIONS Nurses are challenged during this time but by limiting uncertainty and providing protective factors, nurses can be less affected by emotional challenges and able to provide nursing care and manage the outbreak effectively.","Nelson, Heather; Hubbard Murdoch, Natasha; Norman, Kasandra",The Canadian journal of nursing research = Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres,357,12

In addition, MCLR has been identified as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP)1 and PP2A, which are known to regulate the phosphorylation of various molecules related to synaptic excitability. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether MCLR exposure affects seizures induced by a low dose of kainic acid (KA; 0.05 µg, i.c.v.) administration. KA-induced seizure occurrence and seizure score significantly increased after repeated exposure to MCLR (2.5 or 5.0 µg/kg, i.p., once a day for 10 days), but not after acute MCLR exposure (2.5 or 5.0 µg/kg, i.p., 2 h and 30 min prior to KA administration), and hippocampal neuronal loss was consistently facilitated by repeated exposure to MCLR. In addition, repeated MCLR significantly elevated the membrane expression of kainate receptor GluK2 subunits, p-pan-protein kinase C (PKC), and p-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) at 1 h after KA. However, KA-induced membrane expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by repeated MCLR exposure. Consistent with the enhanced seizures and neurodegeneration, MCLR exposure significantly potentiated KA-induced oxidative stress and microglial activation, which was accompanied by increased expression of p-ERK and p-PKCδ in the hippocampus. The combined results suggest that repeated MCLR exposure potentiates KA-induced excitotoxicity in the hippocampus by increasing membrane GluK2 expression and enhancing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through the modulation of p-CaMKII, p-PKC, and p-ERK.","Hwang, Yeonggwang; Kim, Hyoung-Chun; Shin, Eun-Joo",Toxicology,357,1

However, these approaches have been typically optimized for a specific function or environment and do not have the flexibility that many real organisms exhibit to thrive in complex microenvironments. Here, inspired by adaptable microbes and using a combination of experiment and simulation, we demonstrate that one-dimensional colloidal chains can fold into geometrically complex morphologies, including helices, plectonemes, lassos, and coils, and translate via multiple mechanisms that can be varied with applied magnetic field. With chains of multiblock asymmetry, the propulsion mode can be switched from bulk to surface-enabled, mimicking the swimming of microorganisms such as flagella-rotating bacteria and tail-whipping sperm and the surface-enabled motion of arching and stretching inchworms and sidewinding snakes. We also demonstrate that reconfigurability enables navigation through three-dimensional and narrow channels simulating capillary blood vessels. Our results show that flexible microdevices based on simple chains can transform both shape and motility under varying magnetic fields, a capability we expect will be particularly beneficial in complex in vivo microenvironments.","Yang, Tao; Sprinkle, Brennan; Guo, Yang; Qian, Jun; Hua, Daoben; Donev, Aleksandar; Marr, David W M; Wu, Ning",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,357,1

However, oesophagectomy is often associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Taking into account that modern neoadjuvant therapy is effective and many of patients show no vital tumour cells in the operative specimens, we aim to perform a scoping review as part of the development phase for a prospectively planned multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating 'surgery as needed vs surgery on principle in patients with postneoadjuvant complete response of oesophageal cancer' (Prospective trial registration number DRKS00022801). This scoping approach will allow us to finally define and/or adapt the research question including the design and methodology of the randomised controlled trial taking into account the findings for example, research gaps and/or pitfalls in the currently available study pool addressing this or very similar questions.

He later experienced guidewire fragmentation in the carotid artery and aortic arch, with subsequent thrombus formation. We report partial removal of the guidewire and stent via carotid artery cutdown and open thoracotomy without complication.

This study aimed to assess the combined effect of EN and supplemental PN enriched with omega-3 PUFA on blood oxygenation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase III trial conducted from 10/2013 to 11/2017. A total of 100 ICU patients (18-85 years, APACHE II score > 15) requiring mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned to received combined EN and PN either with omega-3 PUFA (omega-3 group) or without (control group) for up to 28 days. Primary endpoint: 'change of PaO2/FiO2 from day (D) 1 to D4'. Secondary endpoints: lung function parameters, ICU complications, length of hospital stay, days free of ICU care/ventilation/sedation/catecholamine treatment, mortality, erythrocyte fatty acid composition, inflammatory parameters. Safety parameters: standard laboratory assessment, vital signs, physical examination, SOFA score, adverse events. RESULTS Combined EN and PN covered energy requirements to more than 80%. Blood oxygenation (ΔPaO2/FiO2 from D1 to D4: -1.3 ± 83.7, n = 42, and 13.3 ± 86.1, n = 39, in omega-3 and control group, respectively, p = 0.7795) and other lung function parameters did not differ between groups but days free of catecholamine treatment were significantly higher in the omega-3 group (~4 days, p = 0.0481). On D6, significantly more patients in the omega-3 group tolerated EN alone (51.0% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.0342). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content in erythrocytes was significantly increased in the omega-3 group at last observation compared with the control group (ΔEPA: 0.928 ± 0.808% vs. -0.024 ± 0.190%, p < 0.0001). No further significant group differences were detected. CONCLUSIONS Enteral and supplemental PN both enriched with omega-3 PUFA did not improve lung function but allowed earlier weaning from catecholamine treatment and PN.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if this kind of mesh has any advantage in long term results in comparison with the classic Lichtenstein technique with sutures and polypropylene mesh. MATERIAL AND METHODS We report a prospective and randomized study of patients who have been operated on for inguinal hernia between march of 2009 to march 2010, divided into 2 groups of 45 patients. In AutoAdhesive (AA) group, we included patients operated on with an autoadhesive mesh and in Classic Lichtenstein (CL) group we included cases with an inguinal hernioplasty with sutured polypropylene mesh. We evaluated time of inactivity, complications, recurrences and grade of pain after one year. RESULTS The mean age was 60 years in AA group and 49 in LC group. There were more men than women and there were no differences in co-morbilities between groups. The mean size of hernia orifice was 3cm in both groups and 60% of the hernias were indirect. After one year, 77 patients were evaluated; 39 in LC group and 38 in AA group. 86,8% and 87,2% of them were asymptomatic. The mean time of recovery of daily activities was 15 days in both groups. There were neither recurrences nor severe chronic pain in the AA group. The mean of grade of pain was 0 (range:0-4) in AA group and 0 (range: 0-5) in LC group. In this group, there was one recurrence and one patient was taking analgesics for intense pain. No mortality nor other long term complications were found.

Researchers seek to identify modifiable risk and protective factors for cognitive function. One such modifiable factor is functional social support, that is, one's perception of whether their social network can provide resources such as material help, companionship, information and emotional contact, if needed. While the literature generally reports positive associations between functional social support and cognitive function, results vary according to study methods such as the tool used to measure functional social support or the specific cognitive domain under investigation. Our review will summarise the association between functional social support and cognitive function in middle-aged and older-aged adults who reside in any setting (eg, community dwelling, long-term care facilities). We will also identify sources of discrepant findings between studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols guideline.

Previous studies, performed in serum-free media, determined that retrocyclins 1 (RC1) and RC2 could prevent successful germination of Bacillus anthracis spores, kill vegetative B. anthracis cells, and inactivate anthrax lethal factor. We now report that retrocyclins are extensively bound by components of native mouse, human, and fetal calf sera, that heat-inactivated sera show greatly enhanced retrocyclin binding, and that native and (especially) heat-inactivated sera greatly reduce the direct activities of retrocyclins against spores and vegetative cells of B. anthracis. Nevertheless, we also found that retrocyclins protected mice challenged in vivo by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intranasal instillation of B. anthracis spores. Retrocyclin 1 bound extensively to B. anthracis spores and enhanced their phagocytosis and killing by murine RAW264.7 cells. Based on the assumption that spore-bound RC1 enters phagosomes by ""piggyback phagocytosis,"" model calculations showed that the intraphagosomal concentration of RC1 would greatly exceed its extracellular concentration. Murine alveolar macrophages took up fluorescently labeled retrocyclin, suggesting that macrophages may also acquire extracellular RC1 directly. Overall, these data demonstrate that retrocyclins are effective in vivo against experimental murine anthrax infections and suggest that enhanced macrophage function contributes to this property.","Welkos, S; Cote, C K; Hahn, U; Shastak, O; Jedermann, J; Bozue, J; Jung, G; Ruchala, P; Pratikhya, P; Tang, T; Lehrer, R I; Beyer, W",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,357,7

Endoscopic detection of postoperative, ileo-colonic inflammation is well established, but the potential of pan-intestinal endoscopy is yet unknown. METHODS This prospective multicenter pilot study assessed the value of pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy using a colon capsule endoscope for the detection of inflammatory recurrence of Crohn´s disease. Patients who had been operatively treated for Crohn´s disease were included. Colon capsule endoscopy was performed 4-8 weeks (d1) and 4-8 months (d2) postoperatively together with ileo-colonoscopy at d2 using a modified Ruttgeerts index for evaluating disease activity. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included into this study. At d1, significant disease activity (Ruttgeerts index ≥2) was detected in 3/16 (19%) of the patients. At d2, half of the patients (6/12) showed active disease, whereas ileo-colonoscopy revealed significant inflammation in 5/15 (33%). All patients rated as having active disease by ileo-colonoscopy had been revealed by PICE as well. These findings influenced the medical treatment in every case. CONCLUSION Pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy seems to be feasible in the postoperative surveillance of Crohn's disease. Disease activity is reliably detected. Especially, the findings in the small bowl might be a significant advantage in comparison to ileo-colonoscopy, as they can have significant impact on clinical management. Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings and might lead to a replacement of the flexible ileo-colonoscopy with pan-intestinal capsule endoscopy in this indication in the future.","Hausmann, Johannes; Schmelz, Renate; Walldorf, Jens; Filmann, Natalie; Zeuzem, Stefan; Albert, Jörg G",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,357,1

We collected the data of 88 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Then patients were divided into a non-severe group and a critical group (including critically ill cases). Univariate analysis showed that the absolute lymphocyte count, albumin level, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, interleukin-6 (IL-6) level, erythrocyte count, globulin level, blood glucose level, and age were significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19. The multivariate binary logistic regression model revealed that Age, absolute lymphocyte count, and IL-6 level were independent risk factors in patients with COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the combination of IL-6 level, absolute lymphocyte count and age is superior to a single factor as predictors for predicting severe COVID-19, regardless of whether it is the area under curve (AUC) or the prediction sensitivity and specificity.

Progressive impaired glucose tolerance eventually leads to cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), the most prevalent complication of CF, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Optimising glycaemic control improves clinical status and reduces mortality; insulin therapy is the primary means of controlling glycaemia in CFRD, but its role in managing pre-diabetes is less clear. CF dietary therapy requires a high calorie diet due to increased energy expenditure and malabsorption, but this energy-dense diet is typically high in fat and sugar, and high sugar intakes often result in hyperglycaemia in individuals who have impaired glucose handling. Current guidelines for the dietary management of glucose abnormalities in CF are based on clinical consensus rather than empirical evidence. A systematic review conducted in 2012 on the effects of low glycaemic index dietary intervention in CF concluded that there is a dearth of evidence in this area. This review will update the systematic review by Balzer et al. in 2012 and will broaden the scope of their review to include any type of dietary intervention for managing glucose abnormalities in CF. METHODS Quantitative studies of dietary interventions to manage glucose abnormalities in individuals aged over 5 years with CF and glucose abnormalities will be reviewed. No limits will be placed on language or study design. The comparator will be standard CF dietary therapy (energy dense, high-fat diet) in addition to insulin therapy for individuals with CFRD. Electronic databases will be searched for completed quantitative studies published in peer-review journals that focus on dietary interventions for managing glucose abnormalities in CF. Searches will be conducted from 2000 up to the present day to reflect the evolving improvements in CF management. No restrictions will be placed on study design or language. Duration of the dietary intervention must be a minimum of 2 months and only interventions in out-patient or community settings will be included. Studies must report on dietary intervention, glycaemic control, anthropometry and lung function. Evidence will be assessed for heterogeneity and a narrative review or meta-analysis conducted as appropriate. DISCUSSION This systematic review will elucidate current knowledge of the effects of dietary interventions for managing glucose abnormalities in the vulnerable CF clinical population.

Methods and Results Male C57BL/6J mice (4-6 months of age) were subjected to sham surgeries or transverse aortic constriction to produce cardiac pressure overload. Two weeks after transverse aortic constriction, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day) or vehicle was administered daily for 4 weeks. Empagliflozin increased survival rate and significantly attenuated adverse left ventricle remodeling and cardiac fibrosis after transverse aortic constriction. Empagliflozin also attenuated left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, evaluated by echocardiography, and increased exercise endurance by 36% in mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure. Empagliflozin significantly increased glucose and fatty acid oxidation in failing hearts, while reducing glycolysis. These beneficial cardiac effects of empagliflozin occurred despite no significant changes in fasting blood glucose, body weight, or daily urine volume. In vitro experiments in isolated cardiomyocytes indicated that empagliflozin had direct effects to improve cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium transients. Importantly, molecular docking analysis and isolated perfused heart experiments indicated that empagliflozin can bind cardiac glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, restore activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and inhibit activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that empagliflozin may directly bind glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, rebalance coupling between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and regulate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway to attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure induced by pressure-overload in non-diabetic mellitus mice.","Li, Xuan; Lu, Qingguo; Qiu, Yunguang; do Carmo, Jussara M; Wang, Zhen; da Silva, Alexandre A; Mouton, Alan; Omoto, Ana C M; Hall, Michael E; Li, Ji; Hall, John E",Journal of the American Heart Association,357,31

METHODS A survey was conducted in the form of questionnaires to ALS patients and their caregivers. All measurements were performed by two visiting nurses. For statistical analysis, SPSS ver. 22.0 and Mann-Whitney U test on non-normal distribution were used. RESULTS In total, 19 patients (15 males and 4 females) and their caregivers participated in the survey. In the case of patients, the average duration of care was 5.9±3.7 years, and the mean periods of illness and tracheostomy were 5.3±3.2 years and 3.0±2.6 years, respectively. Replacement intervals were 14 days in 11 patients, 7 days in 4 patients, 28 days in 2 patients, and 21 days in 1 patient. One patient was unable to provide an accurate replacement interval. Eighteen (99%) caregivers had experience of adding volume to a cuff without pressure measure in the following instances: due to patients' needs in 7 cases, air leakage in 7 cases, and no reason in 4 cases. Mean pressure of tracheostomy cuff was 40±9.4 cmH2O, and air volume of tracheostomy cuff was 6.7±3.2 mL, but real mean volume was 7.0±2.9 mL. The number of suctioning for airway clearance was a mean 27.5±18.2 times a day. CONCLUSION According to this survey, we notice that almost all the patients and caregivers had an erroneous idea about cuff volume and pressure. Moreover, education and long-term professional care of tracheostomy cannot be overemphasized in this manner.","Park, Yeo Jin; Lee, Jesang; Kim, Sang Hun; Ko, Sung Hwa; Shin, Myung Jun; Chang, Jae Hyeok; Shin, Yong Beom",Annals of rehabilitation medicine,357,13

We have previously described a prodrug strategy that facilitates the lymphatic delivery of a model immunomodulator, mycophenolic acid (MPA) via incorporation into intestinal triglyceride transport pathways. The current study explored a series of structurally related glyceride and phospholipid mimetic prodrugs of MPA in an attempt to enhance lymph targeting and to better elucidate the design criteria for lipid mimetic prodrugs. MPA was conjugated to a glyceride or phospholipid backbone at various positions using different spacers employing ester, ether, carbonate and amide bonds. Patterns of prodrug hydrolysis were evaluated in rat digestive fluid, and lymphatic transport and plasma pharmacokinetics were assessed in lymph duct cannulated rats. Prodrugs with different spacers between MPA and the glyceride backbone resulted in up to 70-fold differences in gastrointestinal stability. MPA conjugation at the 2 position of the glyceride backbone and via an ester bond were most effective in promoting lymphatic transport. Phospholipid prodrug derivatives, or glyceride derivatives with MPA attached at the 1 position or when linked via ether, carbonate or amide bonds were poorly incorporated into lymphatic transport pathways.","Han, Sifei; Quach, Tim; Hu, Luojuan; Lim, Shea Fern; Gracia,; Trevaskis, Natalie L; Simpson, Jamie S; Porter, Christopher J H",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,357,1

However, after introduction of Onyx, transarterial approach is the preferred treatment option in many centers. We report our experience of dAVFs embolization with special emphasis on transarterial approach. METHODS Seventeen embolization procedures were performed in 13 patients with dAVFs between Jan 2009 and Oct 2014. Clinical symptoms, location and type of fistulas, embolization methods, complications, radiological and clinical outcomes were evaluated using charts and PACS images. RESULTS All 13 patients had symptomatic lesions. The locations of fistulas were transverse-sigmoid sinus in 6, middle fossa dura in 4, cavernous sinus in 2, and superior sagittal sinus in 1 patient. Cognard types were as follows : I in 4, IIa in 2, IIa+IIb in 5, and IV in 2. Embolization procedures were performed ≥2 times in 3 patients. Nine patients were treated with transarterial Onyx embolization alone. One of these required direct surgical puncture of middle meningeal artery. Complete obliteration of fistulas was achieved in 11/13 (85%) patients. There were no complications except for 1 case of Onyx migration in cavernous dAVF. Modified Rankin scale score at post-operative 3 months were 0 in 11, and 3 in 2 patients. CONCLUSION Transarterial Onyx embolization can be a first line therapeutic option in patients with dAVFs. However, transvenous approach should be tried first in cavernous sinus dAVF because of the risk of intracranial migration of liquid embolic materials. Furthermore, combined surgical endovascular approach can be considered as a useful option in inaccessible route.","Oh, Jae-Sang; Yoon, Seok-Mann; Oh, Hyuk-Jin; Shim, Jai-Joon; Bae, Hack-Gun; Lee, Kyeong-Seok",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,357,24

METHODS Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 500 consecutive patients undergoing LSG. Patient demographics, weight loss, complications and functional outcomes were analysed and operative technique described. RESULTS Five hundred patients underwent LSG over 3 years (37 revisional). Mean (range) preoperative body mass index was 45 kg/m(2) (35-76 kg/m(2) ). Mean follow-up and length of hospital stay were 14 months (1-34) and 3.8 days (3-12), respectively. All-cause 30-day readmission rate 1.2%. Mean excess weight loss (interquartile range, available patient data) was 43% (22-65%, 423 patients), 58% (45-70%, 352 patients), 76% (52-84%, 258 patients), 71% (51-87%, 102 patients) and 73% (55-86%, 13 patients) at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 months, respectively. There was no mortality. Intraoperative complications occurred in two (0.4%) - splenic bleeding; bougie related oesophageal injury. Early surgical complications in four (1.2%) patients (one staple line leak and three post-operative bleeds). Other early complications occurred in three (0.6%) patients (one pseudomembranous colitis; one central line sepsis; one portal venous thrombosis) and late in four (0.8%) patients (three port-site incisional hernias; mid-sleeve stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation). Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms decreased from 45 to 6%. CONCLUSION With attention to detail, LSG can lead to good excess weight loss with minimal complications.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with health care claims data from Truven Health, covering more than 40 million insured lives per year and representing all U.S. census regions. The study sample included subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a new diagnosis of varicose veins who had received at least one invasive treatment (eg, surgery, endovenous thermal ablation [radiofrequency or laser], or sclerotherapy [liquid or foam]). The adverse events of interest included a coded diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism within 30 days of a claim for invasive treatment. Patients treated between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, were observed for up to 2 years after diagnosis. RESULTS There were 985,632 unique subjects diagnosed with varicose veins; of them, a total of 131,887 subjects met all of the study criteria: 63,033 (47.8%) having multiple therapies; 22,980 (17.4%) having laser ablation; 21,637 (16.4%) having radiofrequency ablation; 12,708 (9.6%) having sclerotherapy; and 11,529 (8.7%) having surgery. The mean age of the sample was 52.8 years, ranging from 51.5 years (surgery cohort) to 54.5 years (radiofrequency ablation cohort); 77% of the sample was female, ranging from 71% (radiofrequency ablation cohort) to 92% (sclerotherapy cohort). The mean time to treatment after diagnosis was 105 days, ranging from 75 days (sclerotherapy cohort) to 116 days (radiofrequency ablation cohort). The diagnosed prevalence (percentage of subjects within each treatment cohort) of DVT was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, 4.4%; multiple therapies--same day, 3.4%; laser ablation, 3.1%; multiple therapies--deferred, 2.6%; surgery, 2.4%; and sclerotherapy, 0.8%. For pulmonary embolism, the diagnosed prevalence was as follows: radiofrequency ablation, surgery, and laser ablation, 0.3% each; and multiple therapies--same day, multiple therapies--deferred, and sclerotherapy, 0.2% each. CONCLUSIONS Thrombotic complications associated with invasive varicose vein treatments in the real-world setting may be higher than what has been reported in clinical trials, particularly in regard to DVT after endovenous thermal ablation therapy. A better understanding of these patterns of adverse events may have an impact on new strategies to safely and effectively manage patients with varicose veins.","O'Donnell, Thomas F; Eaddy, Michael; Raju, Aditya; Boswell, Kimberly; Wright, David",Journal of vascular surgery.

RESULTS 65/115 (56.5%) pediatricians answered the survey. Pediatricians estimated the reduction of patient consultations in April 2020 vs. 2019 by 40% (median), however, according to their practice administration software, patient visits decreased by 30%. The median number of cases with the diagnosis J21 (acute bronchitis) were significantly less in April 2020 vs. April 2019 (50 vs. 10 cases per pediatrician; p<0.001). Simultaneously, hospital admissions decreased by 43.7% from 402 total cases in April 2019 to 226 cases in April 2020.

When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.","Haldar, Sattwick; Kaleeswaran, Dhananjayan; Rase, Deepak; Roy, Kingshuk; Ogale, Satishchandra; Vaidhyanathan, Ramanathan",Nanoscale horizons,357,16

Still, the basis for their increased pathogenesis remains unclear. Additionally, the high morbidity in the younger population stays inexplicable, and the recent pandemic H1N1v outbreak in 2009 demonstrated the urgent need for a better understanding about influenza virus infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that HPAIV infection of mice not only led to lung destruction but also to functional damage of the thymus. Moreover, respiratory dendritic cells in the lung functioned as targets for HPAIV infection being able to transport infectious virus from the lung into the thymus. The pandemic H1N1 influenza virus was able to infect respiratory dendritic cells without a proper transport to the thymus. The strong interference of HPAIV with the immune system is especially devastating for the host and can lead to lymphopenia. In summary, from our data, we conclude that highly pathogenic influenza viruses are able to reach the thymus via dendritic cells and to interfere with T lymphocyte development. Moreover, this exceptional mechanism might not only be found in influenza virus infection, but also might be the reason for the increased immune evasion of some new emerging pathogens.","Vogel, Annette B; Haasbach, Emanuel; Reiling, Sarah J; Droebner, Karoline; Klingel, Karin; Planz, Oliver",Journal of immunology,357,1

RESULTS Surgical procedures, total operation time (278.8 versus 228.7 min, p = 0.0002) and time for lymph node dissection (181.3 versus 136.3 min, p = 0.0001) were significantly longer in the RPLDG group compared with the LADG group, while the volume of blood loss during reconstruction was reduced (17.5 versus 49.6 ml, p = 0.0019). Cosmetic satisfaction in the RPLDG group showed significant superiority over that in the conventional LADG group (p = 0.0252). CONCLUSION RPLDG was shown to be an acceptable and satisfactory procedure for the treatment of gastric cancer. To confirm the feasibility of this surgical procedure, it is necessary to conduct a well-designed randomized controlled study comparing RPLDG and conventional LADG in many patients.","Kunisaki, Chikara; Ono, Hidetaka A; Oshima, Takashi; Makino, Hirochika; Akiyama, Hirotoshi; Endo, Itaru",Digestive surgery,357,33
99680,99680,99680,COVID-19: An Immunopathologic Assault.,20.119036,9.095122,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of superobesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥50 kg/m(2)) has increased steadily during the past decade, and the most suitable surgical strategy for these patients is still controversial. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that in selected superobese patients, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) followed by laparoscopic duodenal switch (DS) might reduce the rate of postoperative complications and the need for the second step duodenal switch. The setting was a university hospital in France. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospective database of 110 consecutive patients with a BMI of ≥50 kg/m(2) undergoing the staged approach and matched for age, gender, and BMI with 110 consecutive patients undergoing single-stage DS. The excess weight loss (EWL), co-morbidity improvement, and incidence of postoperative complications were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS One patient died in the staged strategy group (mortality rate .9%). The postoperative complication rate was 8.2% in the staged strategy group (110 patients) and 15.5% in the single-stage DS group (110 patients; P = 1). Multivariate analysis showed that single-stage DS surgery is the only variable significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications (odds ratio 2.36; 95% confidence interval 1.001-5.61). In the staged strategy group, at a mean follow-up of 36.4 ± 13 months, 39 patients (35.5%) required the second-stage procedure. The mean %EWL was 50.8% ± 17.5% for SG alone (35% failed to maintain 50% EWL after SG), 61.5% ± 19.3% for the staged strategy, 72.7% ± 14.1% for 2-step DS (3.3% failed to maintain 50% EWL after 2-step DS), and 73.3% ± 17.6% for single-stage DS (7.3% failed to maintain 50% EWL after single-stage DS). CONCLUSIONS At 3 years of follow-up, staged DS surgery avoided biliopancreatic diversion in 72.7% of the patients. Single-stage DS increases the risk of postoperative complications but not of anastomotic leak.","Iannelli, Antonio; Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Topart, Philippe; Carles, Michel; Hébuterne, Xavier; Gugenheim, Jean",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,357,1

The utility of such tasks arises from the complex interaction of linguistic demands (word retrieval, sentence formulation, articulation). However, this complexity also makes spontaneous speech hugely variable and difficult to assess. The current study aimed to simplify the problem by identifying latent factors underlying performance in spontaneous speech in aphasia. The ecological validity of the factors was examined by examining how well the factor structures corresponded to traditionally defined aphasia subtypes. Method A factor analysis was conducted on 17 microlinguistic measures of narratives from 274 individuals with aphasia in AphasiaBank. The resulting factor scores were compared across aphasia subtypes. Supervised (linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (latent profile analysis) classification techniques were then conducted on the factor scores and the solutions compared to traditional aphasia subtypes. Results Six factors were identified. Two reflected aspects of fluency, one at the phrase level (Phrase Building) and one at the narrative level (Narrative Productivity). Two other factors reflected the accuracy of productions, one at the word level (Semantic Anomaly) and one at the utterance level (Grammatical Error). The other two factors reflected the complexity of sentence structures (Grammatical Complexity) and the use of repair behaviors (Repair), respectively. Linear discriminant analyses showed that only about two thirds of speakers were classified correctly and that misclassifications were similar to disagreements between clinical diagnoses. The most accurately diagnosed syndromes were the largest groups-Broca's and anomic aphasia. The latent profile analysis also generated profiles similar to Broca's and anomic aphasia but separated some subtypes according to severity. Conclusions The factor solution and the classification analyses reflected broad patterns of spontaneous speech performance in a large and representative sample of individuals with aphasia. However, such data-driven approaches present a simplified picture of aphasia patterns, much as traditional syndrome categories do. To ensure ecological validity, a hybrid approach is recommended, balancing population-level analyses with examination of performance at the level of theoretically specified subgroups or individuals.

DESIGN Online databases were used to identify journal articles published between 2009 and 2019, yielding over 1800 citations. The citations were uploaded into an online software product called Covidence that enables scoping/systematic review management. After duplicates were removed, 857 articles were screened by abstract and title name, 93 of which were put through for full-text screening. Twenty-five articles met predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Appraisal tools were utilized to establish the quality of the studies included. Numerical summaries were used to synthesize and describe the data set. Thematic analysis was utilized to identify global and subthemes within the data set. RESULTS Numerical summaries revealed that over half of the studies in the data set used a quantitative design. Thematic analysis of the data identified four global themes namely, ""each child is an individual,"" ""parents are key,"" ""parents require support,"" and ""professionals make a difference."" Each global theme was further divided into subthemes, most of which centered around the parents of children with HL. Each subtheme was categorized as a malleable or a fixed factor that impacts on hearing aid use in young children with HL. CONCLUSION This scoping review identified malleable and fixed factors that impact on hearing aid use in young children with HL. These factors centered around the individual characteristics of children with HL, the key responsibility their parents have, and the important contribution that professionals can make. Irrespective of whether factors are malleable or fixed, parents and professionals working with children with HL can have a positive impact on hearing aid use. This is likely to have a flow on, positive impact on their overall communication and learning outcomes.","Nailand, Lisa; Munro, Natalie; Purcell, Alison",Ear and hearing,357,12

A randomised controlled trial.,19.896807,9.356821,2020-05-16,"Administration of rocuronium to facilitate intubation has traditionally been regarded as acceptable for intraoperative motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring because of sufficiently rapid spontaneous neuromuscular blockade recovery. We hypothesized that residual neuromuscular blockade, in an amount that could hinder optimal neuromonitoring in patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm clipping, was still present at dural opening. We sought to identify how often this was occurring and to identify factors which may contribute to prolonged blockade. Records of 97 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Rocuronium was administered to facilitate intubation with no additional neuromuscular blockade given. Prolonged spontaneous recovery time to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.75 after rocuronium administration was defined as 120 min, which was approximately when dural opening and the setting of baseline MEPs were occurring. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to prolonged spontaneous recovery time. Prolonged spontaneous recovery time to a TOF ratio of 0.75 was observed in 44.3% of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that only the dosage of rocuronium based on ideal body weight had a positive correlation with prolonged spontaneous recovery time (P = 0.01). There was no significant association between dosage of rocuronium based on total body weight, age, sex, or body temperature and prolonged recovery time. This study demonstrates that the duration of relaxation for MEP monitoring purposes is well-beyond the routinely recognized clinical duration of rocuronium. Residual neuromuscular blockade could result in lower amplitude MEP signals and/or lead to higher required MEP stimulus intensities which can both compromise monitoring sensitivity.","Hayashi, Hironobu; Bebawy, John F; Koht, Antoun; Hemmer, Laura B",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,357,17

This study focused on active surveillance of several avian viral pathogens with a special reference to AIV in selected backyard duck populations in Bangladesh. A total of 500 pooled oropharyngeal and cloacal samples from individual ducks of four districts were tested by real time PCRs for the presence of AIV, avian avulavirus-1, anatid herpesvirus-1, avian parvovirus, avian bornavirus and avian coronavirus. The investigation identified 27 (5.4%) ducks positive for AIV and 12 (2.4%) for avian coronavirus. In 13 samples, RNA specific for AIV H4N6 was detected. Phylogenetic analysis of the AIV hemagglutinin H4 and neuraminidase N6 genes suggested a clustering of Bangladeshi AIV H4N6 in Eurasian lineage group 2. Other AIV positive sample had very low virus loads (Cq >36) and were not subtyped. Coronaviral sequences of a fragment of the polymerase gene were related to Eurasian-Australian duck gamma-coronaviruses. Our current active surveillance in free-range domestic backyard ducks in Bangladesh failed to detect highly pathogenic (HP) AIV in contrast to our previous passive monitoring study. Nevertheless, active monitoring of domestic duck populations may be important to highlight presence and transmission dynamics of economically less important AIV that still may serve as reassortment partners for the generation of new HP and zoonotic AIV.Research highlights Active surveillance for viral pathogens in domestic free-range backyard ducks.Detection of avian influenza virus subtype H4N6.First identification of avian gamma-coronavirus in ducks in Bangladesh.","Parvin, Rokshana; Kabiraj, Congriev Kumar; Mumu, Tanjin Tamanna; Chowdhury, Emdadul Haque; Islam, Mohammad Rafiqul; Beer, Martin; Harder, Timm",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,357,20

The aim of the study is to elucidate the characteristics and risk factors of late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV. METHODS The study included 482 patients who underwent TIVAP implantation for long-term chemotherapy and/or nutritional support between April 2012 and December 2017. Most patients (95.2%) had malignant diseases. Events requiring TIVAP removal were defined as TIVAP-related complications. RESULTS The median TIVAP and global follow-ups were 319 days (IQR 152-661) and 218,971 catheter days, respectively. The 3-year cumulative TIVAP availability rate was 70%. There were 44 complications (incidence of 9.1%; 0.201 complications/1000 catheter days). Infectious, catheter-related, and port-related complications occurred in 21, 14, and 9 patients, respectively with infectious complications occurring earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that age < 65 years and presence of non-gastrointestinal diseases were significant unfavorable factors for TIVAP-related complications. Patients with 1 and 2 of these factors had an elevated risk (2.2 and 5.4 times, respectively) compared with those without. CONCLUSIONS Among the late complications associated with TIVAP implantation via the IJV, infectious complications occur earlier and more frequently than catheter- and port-related complications. Patients with an age < 65 years and having non-gastrointestinal diseases have a significantly high risk of TIVAP-related complications.","Tsuruta, Shigeaki; Goto, Yasutomo; Miyake, Hideo; Nagai, Hidemasa; Yoshioka, Yuichiro; Yuasa, Norihiro; Takamizawa, Junichi",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,357,1

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the risk factors related to self-reported body weight gain among obese subjects. METHODS the study involved a population of 284 adult obese subjects. After a 7-week confinement period starting on March 17, a telephone interview (May 4 through 7) was conducted. In this phone call, self-reported body weight gain and a number of factors were recorded. In order to obtain the baseline data of this population, biochemical and anthropometric parameters were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS mean age was 60.4 ± 10.8 years (range: 23-71) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 35.4 ± 4.7 kg/m2 (range: 30.6-41.2). Gender distribution was 211 females (74.3 %) and 73 males (25.7 %). Self-reported body weight gain was 1.62 ± 0.2 kg. Among patients who reported doing a lot of exercise self-reported body weight gain was lower (1.62 ± 0.2 vs 1.12 ± 0.3 kg; p = 0.02). Regarding eating habits, patients recognized snacking in 17 % of the sample. Patients who reported snacking had higher self-reported body weight gains (2.60 ± 0.36 vs 1.30 ± 0.17 kg; p = 0.001). The remaining variables did not influence self-reported body weight gain. In the multiple regression analysis with self-reported body weight gain as dependent variable, adjusted for age, sex, and physical activity, the snaking habit remained a risk factor: beta = 1.21 (95 % CI: 0.31-2.13; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS the lockdown decreed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has produced an increase in self-reported body weight among obese subjects, which was related to the habit of taking snacks.","de Luis Román, Daniel A; Izaola, Olatz; Primo Martín, David; Gómez Hoyos, Emilia; Torres Torres, Beatriz; López Gómez, Juan José",Nutricion hospitalaria,357,1

Knowledge of and respect for these preferences by nursing staff are associated with better care outcomes for older people with various care needs. To assess preferences in a structured way, instruments focusing on different topics of everyday living appear to be useful. It is unclear which instruments exist for assessing preferences for everyday living. The aim of this planned review is to identify relevant instruments for assessing the preferences for everyday living of older people with various care needs in the form of an evidence map. Additionally, gaps requiring further research will be presented. METHODS AND ANALYSIS To identify the different instruments, we will conduct a systematic search in the electronic databases MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL and PsycINFO (via EBSCO). In addition, we will perform backward and forward citation tracking via reference lists and Google Scholar. The identified records will be independently screened (title/abstract and full text) by two reviewers. Data from the included studies will be extracted independently by the same two reviewers. In all three steps, the results will be checked for deviations, and if there are any deviations, they will be discussed. If no consensus can be achieved through discussion, a third reviewer will be engaged. All study designs will be included, and there will be no limitations regarding the publication status or time period. We will include all studies published in English and German that use instruments focusing on the assessment of preferences for everyday living in people older than 60 years of age with various care needs. For data charting, we will extract the number, categories and types of preferences, the care setting for which the instrument was developed and, if available, psychometric properties. Finally, the various extracted results will be presented in the form of tables and a bubble plot. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION There are no ethical concerns related to the construction of an evidence map, and ethical approval was given by the Witten/Herdecke University (application number 226/2020). We will discuss our results with practitioners in the field of nursing care and persons with various care needs. We will also make our results available to practitioners in an upcoming Project (PELI-D II) and to the public at (inter)national conferences and in the form of practice and peer-reviewed articles.","Rommerskirch-Manietta, Mike; Purwins, Daniel; Van Haitsma, Kimberly; Abbott, Katherine; Roes, Martina",BMJ open,357,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 2181 adults underwent 2366 elective spinal procedures between January 2007 and January 2012. All patients wore anti-embolic stockings, mobilised early and were kept adequately hydrated. In addition, 29% (689) of these were given low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) while in hospital. SSI surveillance was undertaken using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. RESULTS In patients who only received mechanical prophylaxis, the incidence of VTE was 0.59% and that of SSI 2.1%. In patients who were additionally given LMWH, the incidence of VTE was 0% and that of SSI 0.7%. The unadjusted p-value was 0.04 for VTE and 0.01 for SSI. There were no cases of epidural haematoma or 90-day mortality in either group. When adjusted for case-mix, LMWH remained a significant factor (p = 0.006) for VTE, but not for SSI.

However, the frequency of advance care planning conversations in practice remains low. In-depth understanding of patients' experiences with advance care planning might provide clues to optimise its value to patients and improve implementation. AIM To synthesise and describe the research findings on the experiences with advance care planning of patients with a life-threatening or life-limiting illness. DESIGN A systematic literature review, using an iterative search strategy. A thematic synthesis was conducted and was supported by NVivo 11. DATA SOURCES The search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL on 7 November 2016. RESULTS Of the 3555 articles found, 20 were included. We identified three themes in patients' experiences with advance care planning. 'Ambivalence' refers to patients simultaneously experiencing benefits from advance care planning as well as unpleasant feelings. 'Readiness' for advance care planning is a necessary prerequisite for taking up its benefits but can also be promoted by the process of advance care planning itself. 'Openness' refers to patients' need to feel comfortable in being open about their preferences for future care towards relevant others. CONCLUSION Although participation in advance care planning can be accompanied by unpleasant feelings, many patients reported benefits of advance care planning as well. This suggests a need for advance care planning to be personalised in a form which is both feasible and relevant at moments suitable for the individual patient.","Zwakman, M; Jabbarian, L J; van Delden, Jjm; van der Heide, A; Korfage, I J; Pollock, K; Rietjens, Jac; Seymour, J; Kars, M C",Palliative medicine,357,1

COVID-19 has only worsened this situation.1 An opioid receptor antagonist (ORA) such as naloxone is the most common intervention for OIRD. However, with increasing overdose from highly potent illicit opioids and polysubstance abuse, appraisal of the adequacy of ORA seems warranted and timely. COMMENT OIRD results from the binding of an excess number of agonist molecules to opioid receptors. Mechanistically, it makes sense to reverse this by displacing agonist molecules by administering an ORA. But realistically, the trend to higher-potency agonists and polysubstance abuse diminishes the effectiveness of this approach. We are left facing a crisis without a solution. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION For the increasingly common OIRD from highly potent illicit agonists and polysubstance overdose, ORAs are correspondingly less effective.

It is unknown to what extent other diabetes-associated comorbidities such as distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) might be influenced by obesity surgery. This pilot study aimed at providing further evidence for the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on both glycemic control and DPN in non-severely obese patients with insulin-dependent T2DM. METHODS In the present prospective cohort study, 20 patients with long-standing, insulin-dependent T2DM and a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m underwent laparoscopic RYGB. Body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and DPN [quantified by the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS)] were investigated. RESULTS Six months after surgery, the preoperative BMI of 32.8 ± 2.1 kg/m (mean ± standard deviation) dropped to 25.6 ± 2.5 kg/m (P < 0.001). Preoperative HbA1c levels decreased from 8.5 ± 1.2% to 7.1 ± 1.2% (P < 0.001), with 15% of patients having a normalized HbA1c level lower than 6.2%. Of 12 patients with documented DPN, the median NSS was 8 (range, 0-10) preoperatively and 0 (range, 0-9) postoperatively (P = 0.004), with 8 patients scoring an NSS of 0. The median NDS was 6 (range, 2-8) preoperatively and 4 (range, 0-8) postoperatively (P = 0.027), with 1 patient scoring an NDS of 0. All patients had an improvement or normalization in either 1 or both scores. CONCLUSIONS As expected, BMI and HbA1c levels improved significantly after RYGB. More interestingly, neuropathy scores, such as NSS and NDS, improved significantly early after surgery. Symptomatic neuropathy was completely reversible in 67% of the patients. These findings add further evidence to the fact that RYGB might be a valuable treatment option not only for improving glycemic control but also for reducing diabetes-associated comorbidities, such as DPN.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a waitlist for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. METHODS The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS Forty-six studies totaling 16,149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity as compared to single genes [80.8% (75.1%, 85.4%) vs. 57.8% (52.3%, 63.1%)] with no significant decrease in specificity [87.8% (84.1%, 90.7%) vs. 92.1% (90.4%, 93.5%)]. The most accurate single gene was found to be SDC2 with a sensitivity of 83.1% (72.6%, 90.2%) and a specificity of 91.2% (88.6%, 93.2%). CONCLUSIONS Stool DNA methylation tests have high specificity (92%) with relatively lower sensitivity (81%). Combining genes increases sensitivity as compared to single gene tests. The single most accurate gene is SDC2, which should be considered for further research.","Gachabayov, Mahir; Lebovics, Edward; Rojas, Aram; Felsenreich, Daniel M; Latifi, Rifat; Bergamaschi, Roberto",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,357,7

To provide possible directions for future research, this report explored the impact of the Belgian COVID-19 lockdown measures on patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS The data of 15 female patients with BN from an ongoing experience sampling method study were analyzed. Mixed effects models compared surroundings, social context, negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA) and binge eating before and after the implementation of the lockdown measures. RESULTS After the implementation of the lockdown measures, significant changes in surroundings and social context were found as well as an increase in NA and decrease in PA. Patients who experienced a higher binge eating frequency during the lockdown also experienced a stronger change in NA and PA. CONCLUSIONS Future research should also look at changes in surroundings, social context, affect and how these interact with factors such as personality traits and coping styles when investigating why some patients are more susceptible to the negative effects of lockdown measures than others.","Leenaerts, Nicolas; Vaessen, Thomas; Ceccarini, Jenny; Vrieze, Elske",Eating behaviors,357,16

Global pandemic outbreaks like Zika and Ebola were quickly controlled due to electronic surveillance systems enabling efficient information access and exchange. However, there is the need for a more robust technology to enhance adequate epidemic forecasting, data sharing, and effective communication. The purpose of this review was to examine the use of informatics and information technology tools and its impact on public health delivery. METHOD: Investigators searched six electronic databases. These were MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, COMPENDEX, Scopus, and Academic Search Premier from January 2000 to 31 March 2016. RESULTS: A total of 60 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. These studies were organized into three areas as (1) definition of the term public health informatics; (2) type of public health surveillance systems and implications for public health; and (3) electronic surveillance systems functionality, capability, training, and challenges. Our analysis revealed that due to the growing expectations to provide real-time response and population-centered evidence-based public health in this information-driven age there has been a surge in informatics and information technology adoption. Education and training programs are now available to equip public health students and professionals with skills in public health informatics. However, obstacles including interoperability, data standardization, privacy, and technology transfer persist. CONCLUSION: Re-engineering the delivery of public health is necessary to meet the demands of the 21st century and beyond. To meet this expectation, public health must invest in workforce development and capacity through education and training in informatics.","Williams, F; Oke, A; Zachary, I",Perspectives in public health,357,16

Progression under tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment was evaluated both according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and by the need to change systemic therapy. EML4-ALK fusion variants V1, V2 and V3 were found in 39%, 10% and 51% of cases, respectively. Patients with V3-driven tumors had more metastatic sites at diagnosis than cases with the V1 and V2 variants (mean 3.3 vs. 1.9 and 1.6, p = 0.005), which suggests increased disease aggressiveness. Furthermore, V3-positive status was associated with earlier failure after treatment with first and second-generation ALK TKI (median progression-free survival [PFS] by RECIST in the first line 7.3 vs. 39.3 months, p = 0.01), platinum-based combination chemotherapy (median PFS 5.4 vs. 15.2 months for the first line, p = 0.008) and cerebral radiotherapy (median brain PFS 6.1 months vs. not reached for cerebral radiotherapy during first-line treatment, p = 0.028), and with inferior overall survival (39.8 vs. 59.6 months in median, p = 0.017). Thus, EML4-ALK fusion variant V3 is a high-risk feature for ALK+ NSCLC.

Patients with pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS ≤6 were excluded or under-represented in the recent randomized mechanical thrombectomy trials. Our aim was to assess the impact of reperfusion in pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS ≤6 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed data collected between January 2012 and August 2015 in a bicentric prospective clinical registry of consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Every patient with a documented internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery occlusion with pretreatment DWI-ASPECTS ≤6 was eligible for this study. The primary end point was a favorable outcome defined by a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 90 days. RESULTS Two hundred and eighteen patients with a DWI-ASPECTS ≤6 were included. Among them, 145 (66%) patients had successful reperfusion at the end of mechanical thrombectomy. Reperfused patients had an increased rate of favorable outcome (38.7% versus 17.4%; P=0.002) and a decreased rate of mortality at 3 months (22.5% versus 39.1%; P=0.013) compared with nonreperfused patients. The symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was not different between the 2 groups (13.0% versus 14.1%; P=0.83). However, in patients with DWI-ASPECTS <5, favorable outcome was low (13.0% versus 9.5%; P=0.68) with a high mortality rate (45.7% versus 57.1%; P=0.38) with or without successful reperfusion.

To this effect, we employed three sets of primers specifically designed for amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. After optimization of reaction conditions, M. hyopneumoniae could be successfully detected at 63°C in 45 min through use of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A positive reaction was identified visually as white precipitate and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The detection limit for this assay was 10 copies/μL, as observed by electrophoretic analysis. The accuracy of the LAMP reaction was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion as well as by direct sequencing of the amplified product. This method can specifically detect M. hyopneumoniae; other species with high homology and other bacterial and virus strains gave negative results. To test the utility of this procedure, the LAMP assay was applied to 40 clinical samples collected from swine lung tissues experimentally challenged with M. hyopneumoniae isolates, and compared to the results from a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A concordance of 100% was observed between the two assays. In conclusion, the results from our study demonstrated that the LAMP assay provided a rapid reaction and was inexpensive to perform, with no need of complex instruments or systems such as Geneamp PCR. The LAMP assay may therefore be applied in routine diagnosis in the clinical laboratory and for in-field detection of M. hyopneumoniae infection.","Liu, M J; Du, G M; Bai, F F; Wu, Y Z; Xiong, Q Y; Feng, Z X; Li, B; Shao, G Q",Genetics and molecular research : GMR,357,31

We report a contemporary 5-year experience with endovascular therapy for MCA aneurysms at a high-volume neurovascular center. METHODS Review of prospectively maintained intracranial aneurysm database. RESULTS Between 2005 and 2009, 148 patients underwent treatment of 149 MCA aneurysms at our hospital, of which 33 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent endovascular therapy. Among these 33 patients, 14 presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients were treated with stent-assisted coiling, 1 with balloon-assisted coiling, and the remainder with coiling alone. Three patients required repeat endovascular treatment. There were 7 periprocedural complications, including intraprocedural aneurysm rupture resulting in death in 2 patients. Two patients died at later dates from remote aneurysm rehemorrhage. Average follow-up of remaining patients was 17.1 months radiographically, and 20.3 months clinically. Average modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at last follow up was 2.09, with 17 patients with mRS 0/1 and 5 patients with mRS 2. Fifteen patients showed evidence of radiographic residual at last follow up: 13 were simple neck residuals. Unruptured status and saccular aneurysms were associated with mRS 0/1 outcome (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS At our hospital, MCA aneurysms are being treated with endovascular techniques, but in a minority of patients. Despite the rate of residual neck remnants, few retreatments were necessary and few rehemorrhages occurred. The periprocedural complication rate was not insignificant; therefore, in more recent years and at present, most MCA aneurysms are considered for clipping first at our center.","Abla, Adib A; Jahshan, Shady; Kan, Peter; Mokin, Maxim; Dumont, Travis M; Eller, Jorge L; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Acta neurochirurgica,357,7

The butterfly goalie technique is thought to involve extreme ranges of hip motion that may predispose goaltenders to FAI. PURPOSE To quantify hip mechanics during 3 common goaltender movements and interpret their relevance to the development of FAI. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Fourteen collegiate and professional goaltenders performed skating, butterfly save, and recovery movements on the ice. Hip mechanics were compared across the 3 movements. RESULTS The butterfly did not exhibit the greatest range of hip motion in any of the 3 planes. Internal rotation was the only hip motion that appeared close to terminal in this study. When subjects decelerated during skating—shaving the blade of their skate across the surface of the ice—the magnitude of peak hip internal rotation was 54% greater than in the butterfly and 265% greater than in the recovery. No movement involved levels of concomitant flexion, adduction, and internal rotation that resembled the traditional impingement (FADIR) test. CONCLUSION The magnitude of internal rotation was the most extreme planar hip motion (relative to end-range) recorded in this study (namely during decelerating) and appeared to differentiate this cohort from other athletic populations. Consequently, repetitive end-range hip internal rotation may be the primary precursor to symptomatic FAI in hockey goaltenders and provides the most plausible account for the high incidence of FAI in these athletes. Resection techniques should, therefore, focus on enhancing internal rotation in goaltenders, compared with flexion and adduction. While the butterfly posture can require significant levels of hip motion, recovering from a save and, in particular, decelerating during skating are also demanding on goaltenders' hip joints. Therefore, it appears critical to consider and accommodate a variety of sport-specific hip postures to comprehensively diagnose, treat, and rehabilitate FAI.","Whiteside, David; Deneweth, Jessica M; Bedi, Asheesh; Zernicke, Ronald F; Goulet, Grant C",The American journal of sports medicine,357,14

However, previous studies have indicated that methodological problems are frequent in PDSA-based QI projects. Furthermore, it has been difficult to establish an association between the use of PDSA and improvements in clinical practices and patient outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to examine whether recently published PDSA-based QI projects show self-reported effects and are conducted according to key features of the method. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase and CINAHL databases. QI projects using PDSA published in peer-reviewed journals in 2015 and 2016 were included. Projects were assessed to determine the reported effects and the use of the following key methodological features; iterative cyclic method, continuous data collection, small-scale testing and use of a theoretical rationale. RESULTS Of the 120 QI projects included, almost all reported improvement (98%). However, only 32 (27%) described a specific, quantitative aim and reached it. A total of 72 projects (60%) documented PDSA cycles sufficiently for inclusion in a full analysis of key features. Of these only three (4%) adhered to all four key methodological features. CONCLUSION Even though a majority of the QI projects reported improvements, the widespread challenges with low adherence to key methodological features in the individual projects pose a challenge for the legitimacy of PDSA-based QI.

This approach led to the identification of 58 yeast proteins that interacted with p33 replication protein. The identified host proteins included protein chaperones, ubiquitin-associated proteins, translation factors, RNA-modifying enzymes, and other proteins with yet-unknown functions. We confirmed that 19 of the identified host proteins bound to p33 in vitro or in a split-ubiquitin-based two-hybrid assay. Further analysis of Cdc34p E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which is one of the host proteins interacting with p33, revealed that Cdc34p is a novel component of the purified viral replicase. Downregulation of Cdc34p expression in yeast, which supports replication of a TBSV replicon RNA (repRNA), reduced repRNA accumulation and the activity of the tombusvirus replicase by up to fivefold. Overexpression of wild-type Cdc34p, but not that of an E2-defective mutant of Cdc34p, increased repRNA accumulation, suggesting a significant role for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme function of Cdc34p in TBSV replication. Also, Cdc34p was able to ubiquitinate p33 in vitro. In addition, we have shown that p33 becomes ubiquitinated in vivo. We propose that ubiquitination of p33 likely alters its function or affects the recruitment of host factors during TBSV replication.","Li, Zhenghe; Barajas, Daniel; Panavas, Tadas; Herbst, David A; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,357,1

DESIGN Pragmatic randomized 3-arm superiority trial. The unit of randomization is the PWD/caregiver dyad. SETTING 4 clinical trial sites (CTS) based in academic and clinical health systems. PARTICIPANTS 2,150 English- or Spanish-speaking PWD, who are not receiving hospice or residing in a nursing home, and their caregivers. INTERVENTIONS Eighteen months of 1) Health systems-based dementia care provided by a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant Dementia Care Specialist who works within the health system, or 2) Community-based dementia care provided by a social worker or nurse Care Consultant who works at a community-based organization, or 3) Usual care with as-needed referral to the Alzheimer's Association Helpline. MEASUREMENTS Primary outcomes: PWD behavioral symptoms and caregiver distress as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Severity and Modified Caregiver Strain Index scales. SECONDARY OUTCOMES NPI-Q Distress, caregiver unmet needs and confidence, and caregiver depressive symptoms. Tertiary outcomes: PWD long-term nursing home placement rates, caregiver-reported PWD functional status, cognition, goal attainment, ""time spent at home"", Dementia Burden Scale-Caregiver, a composite measure of clinical benefit, Quality of Life of persons with dementia, Positive Aspects of Caregiving, and cost-effectiveness using intervention costs and Medicare claims.

This is compounded both by the lack of a standardised approach to assess the quality of modelling, and lack of clarity on its positioning within the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method for decision-making in the development of WHO guidelines, that considers both evidence from systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials (RTCs) or observational studies, together with stakeholder values and preferences, resource use, and feasibility issues.

We report our experiences, challenges encountered, and several key considerations to guide the future use of modelling in the development of WHO guidelines. These are: (1) Transparency in the conduct and reporting of model inputs and results; (2) The need for agreed standards for critical appraisal and use of modelling data in healthcare policy making; (3) recognition that modelling of cost-effectiveness is only one component of decision-making in development of WHO recommendations and in priority-setting; (4) The need for closer interaction and an ongoing dialogue between modellers and model end-users or decision-makers; (5) the important role of WHO in convening and facilitating comparative assessment of multiple models; and (6) The need to optimize research and data collection to inform modelling studies.","Easterbrook, Philippa J; Doherty, Meg C; Perriëns, Joseph H; Barcarolo, Jhoney L; Hirnschall, Gottfried O",AIDS,357,1

In this study, we determined the capacity of the rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS), also known as intelligent knife (iKnife), to discriminate between healthy, preinvasive, and invasive cervical tissue. Cervical tissue samples were collected from women with healthy, human papilloma virus (HPV) ± cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or cervical cancer. A handheld diathermy device generated surgical aerosol, which was transferred into a mass spectrometer for subsequent chemical analysis. Combination of principal component and linear discriminant analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was employed to study the spectral differences between groups. Significance of discriminatory m/z features was tested using univariate statistics and tandem MS performed to elucidate the structure of the significant peaks allowing separation of the two classes. We analyzed 87 samples (normal = 16, HPV ± CIN = 50, cancer = 21 patients). The iKnife discriminated with 100% accuracy normal (100%) vs. HPV ± CIN (100%) vs. cancer (100%) when compared to histology as the gold standard. When comparing normal vs. cancer samples, the accuracy was 100% with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 83.9 to 100) and specificity 100% (79.4 to 100). Univariate analysis revealed significant MS peaks in the cancer-to-normal separation belonging to various classes of complex lipids. The iKnife discriminates healthy from premalignant and invasive cervical lesions with high accuracy and can improve oncological outcomes and fertility preservation of women treated surgically for cervical cancer.

Upon receptor binding, the spike (S) proteins of both viruses are activated for membrane fusion by proteases, such as trypsin, present in the environment, facilitating virus entry from the cell surface. In contrast, in the absence of extracellular proteases, these viruses can enter cells via an endosomal pathway and utilize endosomal cathepsins for S protein activation. We demonstrate that the MHV-2 S protein uses multistep conformational changes for membrane fusion. After interaction with a soluble form of the MHV receptor (CEACAM1a), the metastable form of S protein is converted to a stable trimer, as revealed by mildly denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Liposome-binding assays indicate that the receptor-bound virions are associated with the target membrane through hydrophobic interactions. The exposure of receptor-bound S protein to trypsin or cathepsin L (CPL) induces the formation of six-helix bundles (6HB), the final conformation. This trypsin- or CPL-mediated conversion to 6HB can be blocked by a heptad repeat peptide known to block the formation of 6HB. Although trypsin treatment enabled receptor-bound MHV-2 to enter from the cell surface, CPL failed to do so. Interestingly, consecutive treatment with CPL and then chlorpromazine enabled a portion of the virus to enter from cell surface. These results suggest that trypsin suffices for the induction of membrane fusion of receptor-primed S protein, but an additional unidentified cellular factor is required to trigger membrane fusion by CPL.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,357,19

This study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the front-line staff. METHODS Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Fatigue Self-assessment Scale (FSAS) were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff. RESULTS The detection rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were 49.1%, 21.8%, and 76.0% among the front-line staff. The rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue in community workers were higher than those in medical workers and other occupational staff (P<0.01). The PHQ-9 of front-line staffs was negatively correlated with age, family income, family members' support, satisfaction of service objects, and sleep quality (all P<0.01), while positively correlated with education level, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and the duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all P<0.01). SAS was negatively correlated with age, family income, family support, satisfaction of objects service, and sleep quality (all P<0.01), while positively correlated with gender, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The front-line workers should manage work and rest time reasonably to adjust their negative mood and fatigue. The government and the society should pay more attention to the psychological state of the front-line staff, particularly for the staff working in the community or villages and towns in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, front-line staff can be obtained mental intervention or be taken a rest from the high-intensive work.","Teng, Ziwei; Huang, Jing; Qiu, Yan; Tan, Yuxi; Zhong, Qiuping; Tang, Hui; Wu, Haishan; Wu, Ying; Chen, Jindong",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government mobile and fog computing framework that can trace positive and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing apps and stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC), to ensure user privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC) every two hours, and this RUERC is broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Any nearby mobile device can receive the RUERC and record it for the next up to 21 days. As the government maintains the database of server-generated UERCs and contains a mapping between UERC and RUERC, the users' mobile devices can store the RUERC in the application cache without requiring further encryption. Additionally, if any cases are found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. This way, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown. Further, it becomes viable to identify super spreaders and to map the cluster of infected and suspected cases.","Whaiduzzaman, Md; Hossain, Md Razon; Shovon, Ahmedur Rahman; Roy, Shanto; Laszka, Aron; Buyya, Rajkumar; Barros, Alistair",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,357,1

However, palliative care knowledge in the general population is limited, and often physician referral occurs late in prognosis. The objective of this analysis was to examine factors associated with palliative care knowledge. METHOD Using data from the 2018 NCI's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5 Cycle 2, descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with respondents' palliative care knowledge using ORs and 95% confidence intervals as measures of association. The outcome of interest was measured with the item ""How would you describe your level of knowledge about palliative care?"" Possible response selections were ""I've never heard of it,"" ""I know a little bit about palliative care,"" and ""I know what palliative care is and could explain it to someone else."" To reduce the risk of type 1 error, jackknife variance estimations with repeated replications were used. All analyses were conducted with the SURVEYLOGISTIC command using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.), and the statistical significance level was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 3,450 respondents (weighted sample size: 249,489,772) met the inclusion criteria. About 89% (n = 3,000) of all respondents had inadequate knowledge of palliative care. Multivariable analyses indicated that frequent health care utilization as defined as ≥ 2 times per year [OR, 3.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.65-3.58], female gender (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.31-3.59), being married (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.14-3.59), having a college degree or higher (OR, 13.83; 95% CI, 1.71-12.04), and having a regular source of care (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.37-1.90) had greater odds of adequate palliative care knowledge. Those without a cancer diagnosis were less likely to have adequate knowledge of palliative care (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41-0.89). CONCLUSIONS Knowledge of palliative care in the United States is low, particularly for those not already actively using their available healthcare system. Public health education efforts are needed to target subgroups of the U.S. population identified by this analysis to increase palliative care knowledge.

We investigated the role of cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and G protein in hMPV infection. The pretreatment of hMPV with soluble heparin markedly inhibited the infection of HEp-2 cells. Recombinant G protein, comprising the extracellular domain of G, bound to heparin-agarose columns and also to HEp-2 cells. hMPV infection and G protein binding to HEp-2 cells was inhibited by other soluble GAGs, including chondroitin sulfates, by the enzymatic removal of cell surface GAGs with GAG lyases or by the pretreatment of cells with basic fibroblast growth factor. The role of cellular GAGs was confirmed by the binding of G protein to wild-type CHO cells but not to GAG-deficient CHO-pgsA745 cells. An analysis of the G protein sequence revealed two adjacent clusters of positively charged amino acids ((149)EKKKTRA(155) and (159)QRRGKGKE(166)). Truncated G fragments were expressed, and only the fragment containing these putative heparin binding domains retained heparin binding. The alanine mutagenesis of charged residues in either of these regions resulted in the loss of binding to heparin and to HEp-2 cells, suggesting that both sites are likely to be required for hMPV attachment. These results, taken together with the inhibition of hMPV infection by soluble G protein, indicate an important role for G protein and cellular GAGs in hMPV infection.","Thammawat, Sutthiwan; Sadlon, Tania A; Hallsworth, Peter G; Gordon, David L",Journal of virology,357,7

Products claiming to contain synergistic formulations are common, although there is often little supporting evidence. The antimicrobial interactions of all pairwise combinations of common disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride, didecyldimethylammonium chloride, polyhexamethylene biguanide, chlorocresol, and bronopol) were classified via checkerboard assay and validated by time-kill analyses. Combinations were tested against Acinetobacter baumannii NCTC 12156, Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 13379, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 13443, and Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 13143. Synergistic interactions were identified only for the combinations of chlorocresol with benzalkonium chloride and chlorocresol with polyhexamethylene biguanide. Synergism was not ubiquitously demonstrated against all species tested and was on the borderline of the synergism threshold. These data demonstrate that synergism between disinfectants is uncommon and circumstantial. Most of the antimicrobial interactions tested were characterized as additive. We suggest that this is due to the broad, nonspecific mechanisms associated with disinfectants not providing an opportunity for the combined activities of these compounds to exceed the sum of their parts. IMPORTANCE The scarcity of observed synergistic interactions suggests that in the case of many disinfectant-based products, combined mechanisms of interaction may be being misinterpreted. We emphasize the need to correctly differentiate between additivity and synergism in antimicrobial formulations, as inappropriate classification may lead to unnecessary issues in the event of regulatory changes. Furthermore, we question the need to focus on synergism and disregard additivity when considering combinations of disinfectants, as the benefits that synergistic interactions provide are not necessarily relevant to the application of the final product.","Noel, Daniel J; Keevil, C William; Wilks, Sandra A",mBio,357,1

Psychosocial interventions (PSI) can contribute to change sexual behaviour, however, their overall effectiveness is unclear. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of PSIs to increase condom and contraceptive use in LMICs. Seven databases were searched systematically for randomised trials comparing a PSI with a control condition. Risk ratios of 31 eligible studies were pooled in random-effects analyses for condom and contraceptive use and unprotected sex, using sensitivity analyses to further investigate the results. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. PSIs increased condom use by about 6% at post-test and 8% at follow-up as compared to control conditions. Contraceptive use was increased by about 14% at post-test. There were no effects on unprotected sex. Results suggest that PSIs have the potential to increase contraceptive and, to a smaller degree, condom use in LMICs. The reliability of these results is partly limited by heterogeneity and the risk of publication bias.

However, knowledge regarding HIV-1-specific B cells in vivo is limited. In this study, an HIV-1-specific B-cell line was established using healthy PBMC donors by the highly efficient Epstein-Barr virus transformation method to generate immortalized human naïve B-cell libraries. The enrichment of HIV-1 envelope-specific B cells was observed after four rounds of cell panning with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. An HIV-1 envelope-specific stable B-cell line (LCL-P4) was generated. Although this cell line acquired a lymphoblastic phenotype, no expression was observed for activation-induced cytidine deaminase, an enzyme responsible for initiating somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination in B cells. This study describes a method that enables fast isolation of HIV-1-specific B cells, and this approach may extend to isolating other B-cell-specific antigens for further experiments.","Sun, Zehua; Lu, Shiqiang; Yang, Zheng; Li, Jingjing; Zhang, Meiyun",The Journal of general virology,357,17

Little is known about the basic reproductive number (R0) for these enteroviruses. METHODS We estimated the R0 of EV71 and of Cox A16 from laboratory-confirmed HFMD outbreaks reported to the Department of Health, from 2004 to 2009. We derived a mathematical model and calculated R₀ based on the cumulative number of cases at the initial growth phase of the outbreaks, as determined by the epidemic curves. We tested the association of R₀ with settings and sizes of the institution and total number of persons affected. RESULTS We analyzed 34 outbreaks, 27 caused by Cox A16 and 7 caused by EV71. Assuming the incubation period to be 5 days, the median R₀ of EV71 was 5.48 with an interquartile range of 4.20 to 6.51, whereas the median R₀ of Cox A16 was 2.50 with an interquartile range of 1.96 to 3.67. The R₀ of EV71 was significantly higher than that of CoxA16, P = 0.002; and sensitivity analysis showed the same results. The R₀ was not associated with outbreak settings, sizes of the institutions, or number of persons affected. CONCLUSIONS The R₀ for EV71 and for Cox A16 was determined using a model which showed that the R₀ for EV71 was higher than that of Cox A16. This finding helps better understand the transmission dynamics of HFMD outbreaks and formulate public health measures for controlling the disease.","Ma, Edmond; Fung, Connie; Yip, Steven H L; Wong, Christine; Chuang, Shuk Kwan; Tsang, Thomas",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,357,12

There is currently no effective commercially available vaccine and there is a need for better understanding of host pathogen interactions with this virus. Various strains can cause both acute and persistent infections and therefore establish a balance with the host immune responses. We have studied host responses to this infection by analyzing the main branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in salmon cells in vitro and in tissues from infected fish to gain a better understanding of virus-host interactions. ISAV induce the main symptoms and signaling pathways of UPR (ATF6, PERK and IRE1) without inducing translational attenuation. This may be due to concomitant induction of an important negative feedback loop via the phosphatase regulator GADD34. The host cells can therefore respond with translation of cytokine and antiviral proteins to curb or control infection.","Kavaliauskis, Arturas; Arnemo, Marianne; Rishovd, Anne-Lise; Gjøen, Tor",Developmental and comparative immunology,357,1

However, although hand washing, social distancing and bubble living have been widely adopted by the 'team of 5 million', mass masking has not been socialised to the general population. AIM To identify factors associated with face masking in New Zealand during COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown to inform strategies to socialise and support mass masking. METHODS A quantitative online survey conducted in New Zealand during April 2020 invited residents aged ≥18 years to complete a questionnaire. Questions about face masking were included in the survey. The sample was drawn from a commissioned research panel survey, with boosted sampling for Māori and Pacific participants. Responses were weighted to reflect the New Zealand population for all analyses. RESULTS A total of 1015 individuals participated. Self-reported beliefs were strongly related to behaviours, with respondents viewing face masking measures as 'somewhat' or 'very' effective in preventing them from contracting COVID-19 more likely to report having worn a face mask than respondents who viewed them as 'not at all' effective. The strongest barriers to face mask use included beliefs that there was a mask shortage and that the needs of others were greater than their own. DISCUSSION Highlighting the efficacy of and dispelling myths about the relative efficacy of mask types and socialising people to the purpose of mass masking will contribute to community protective actions of mask wearing in the New Zealand response to COVID-19.","Gray, Lesley; MacDonald, Carol; Tassell-Matamua, Natasha; Stanley, James; Kvalsvig, Amanda; Zhang, Jane; Murton, Samantha; Wiles, Siouxsie; Puloka, Viliami; Becker, Julia; Johnston, David; Baker, Michael G",Journal of primary health care,357,10

We report a fatal case of COVID-19 pneumonia coinfected with HCoV-229E in Hong Kong. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E from a nasopharyngeal sample of the patient showed that the SARS-CoV-2 strain HK13 was most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 type strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (99.99% nucleotide identity), compatible with his recent history of travel to Wuhan. The HCoV-229E strain HK20-42 was most closely related to HCoV-229E strain SC0865 from the United States (99.86% nucleotide identity). To investigate if it may represent a newly emerged HCoV-229E genotype in Hong Kong, we retrieved 41 archived respiratory samples that tested positive for HCoV-229E from 2004 to 2019. Pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic airway diseases were common among infected patients. Complete RdRp, S, and N gene sequencing of the 41 HCoV-229E strains revealed that our contemporary HCoV-229E strains have undergone significant genetic drift with clustering of strains in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified, in addition to previously described genogroups 1 to 4, with recent circulating strains including strain HK20-42 belonging to novel genogroup 6. Positive selection was detected in the spike protein and receptor-binding domain, which may be important for viral evolution at the receptor-binding interphase. Molecular dating analysis showed that HCoV-229E shared the most recent common ancestor with bat and camel/alpaca 229E-related viruses at ∼1884, while camel/alpaca viruses had a relatively recent common ancestor at ∼1999. Further studies are required to ascertain the evolutionary origin and path of HCoV-229E.IMPORTANCE Since its first appearance in the 1960s, the genetic diversity and evolution of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) have been relatively understudied. In this study, we report a fatal case of COVID-19 coinfected with HCoV-229E in Hong Kong. Genome sequencing revealed that our SARS-CoV-2 strain is highly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan, compatible with the patient's recent travel history, whereas our HCoV-229E strain in this study is highly identical to a recent strain in the United States. We also retrieved 41 archived HCoV-229E strains from 2004 to 2019 in Hong Kong for sequence analysis. Pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic airway diseases were common diagnoses among the 41 patients. The results showed that HCoV-229E was evolving in chronological order. Two novel genogroups were identified in addition to the four preexisting HCoV-229E genogroups, with recent circulating strains belonging to novel genogroup 6.

While laboratory findings in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) show increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, the abnormalities in standard coagulation tests and platelet count are minimal. Recent studies suggest contribution of fibrinolysis shutdown to this phenomenon. Endothelial injury and alteration of its antithrombotic activity can lead to micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in the lungs, occurrence of which is associated with poor clinical outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the hypercoagulability induced by activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to impaired organ perfusion. This, alongside with hypoxemia, leads to multiorgan failure. Various diagnostic regimens, some of which include global assays of haemostasis, are currently being published and discussed. Numerous guidelines and recommendations of scientific societies and groups of specialists have been published. However, there is no single optimal algorithm for anticoagulation treatment and monitoring specific to the ICU patients with COVID-19.

For patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), the mesenteric division technique was changed from stapler to bipolar sealing using LigaSure for cost reasons. This study aimed objectively to assess the impact of the mesenteric division method on mobilization length of the Roux limb in an animal model. Clinical complications related to Roux limb tension also were analyzed in the authors' population of RYGB patients. METHODS Bowel and mesenteric divisions were performed in a porcine model. Four pigs received six to eight mesenteric divisions each. Steady force was applied for 1 min. The distances between the divided limbs of bowel were compared. To assess the clinical impact with RYGB patients, anastomotic complications were analyzed before and after incorporation of bipolar sealing in the authors' practice. RESULTS In the porcine model, the length of mesenteric stretch averaged 93.7 mm with stapled division and 109 mm with bipolar sealing (p = 0.021). From a laparoscopic RYGB population, 160 patients with stapled division were included, all of whom were at least 1 year beyond their surgery. The study analyzed 792 patients with bipolar sealing for leak or bleeding and included 479 bipolar sealed patients more than 1 year beyond their surgery for analysis of their strictures. No difference in bleeding or leaks was found between these groups. The stricture rate was significantly different, with seven strictures after stapled division (4.37%) compared with one stricture after bipolar sealing (0.2%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Bipolar sealing for mesenteric division is superior to stapling for optimization of enteric limb length at constant tension in a laboratory model. Clinical evidence supports this hypothesis with patients undergoing RYGB surgery by a decrease in the complications that can arise from Roux limb tension.","Manson, Roberto J; Pryor, Aurora D",Surgical endoscopy,357,31

IBV mainly causes respiratory disease but can also result in reduced weight gain, reduced egg production, increased frequency of abnormal eggs and increased rates of mortality. Vaccination is the most important way to control the disease. Nevertheless, novel strains of infectious bronchitis (IB) continue to emerge in the field. In order to respond promptly, combinations of existing IB vaccines are frequently tested to see whether they can provide cross-protection. The efficacy of a combination of vaccines based on Massachusetts, Dutch and QX-like IB strains against emerging IB Israel variant 2 and IB 793B strains was assessed by means of four challenge studies. At least 80% of the birds vaccinated with IB H120 (Mass type) combined with IB D274 (Dutch type) followed by a QX-like IB vaccine booster or vaccinated with a combination of IB H120, IB D274 and QX-like IB were protected against a challenge with IB 793B. In addition, IB 1263 (Mass type) boosted by QX-like IB showed an 85% protection following challenge with IB 793B. A combination of IB H120 and IB D274 boosted by QX-like IB vaccine conferred 70% protection whilst H120 and IB D274 combination on its own showed 61.1% protection against Israel variant 2 challenge. IB 1263 boosted by a QX-like IB vaccine showed 50% protection against IB Israel variant 2. Therefore, it can be concluded that a combination of the IB H120, IB D274 and QX-like IB confers broad protection against different non-related virulent IB strains.","Bru, T; Vila, R; Cabana, M; Geerligs, H J",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,357,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of NOX in the development of retinal pathologies, associated with excitotoxicity and the evaluation of NOX inhibitors as putative therapeutic agents. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the induction of the in vivo retinal model of (RS)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid hydrobromide (AMPA) excitotoxicity. Rats were intravitreally administered with PBS, AMPA (42 nmoles) or AMPA + NOX inhibitors, VAS2870 (pan-NOX inhibitor, 10-6-10-4 M), ML171 (NOX1 inhibitor, 10-5, 10-4 M), and GLX7013114 (NOX4 inhibitor, 10-4 M). Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies raised against nitrotyrosine, a ROS/oxidative stress marker, bNOS, a neuronal marker for nitric oxide synthase and the macro and microglia markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1, respectively. VAS2870 and ML171 showed neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions reversing the AMPA induced reduction of bNOS expressing amacrine cells and attenuating macro/microglial activation. GLX7013114 (10-4 M) did not protect bNOS expressing amacrine cells, but it did attenuate the AMPA induced increase in nitrotyrosine positive cells and activation of glial cells. These results suggest that NOX1, NOX4 and possibly NOX2 (due to the actions of VAS2870) play an important role in the pathophysiology of the retina and that NOX inhibitors are putative neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents against retinal abnormalities caused by excitotoxicity.","Dionysopoulou, Stavroula; Wikstrom, Per; Walum, Erik; Thermos, Kyriaki",Experimental eye research,357,31

We assessed the effects of preceding EMR on the efficacy and safety of RFA for nodular BE with advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma) using the US RFA Registry, a nationwide study of BE patients treated with RFA at 148 institutions. Safety outcomes included stricture, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hospitalization. Efficacy outcomes included complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM), complete eradication of dysplasia (CED), and number of RFA treatments needed to achieve CEIM. Analyses comparing patients with EMR before RFA to patients undergoing RFA alone were performed with Student's t-test, Chi-square test, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Four hundred six patients were treated with EMR before RFA for nodular BE, and 857 patients were treated with RFA only for non-nodular BE. The total complication rates were 8.4% in the EMR-before-RFA group and 7.2% in the RFA-only group (P = 0.48). Rates of stricture, bleeding, and hospitalization were not significantly different between patients treated with EMR before RFA and patients treated with RFA alone. CEIM was achieved in 84% of patients treated with EMR before RFA, and 84% of patients treated with RFA only (P = 0.96). CED was achieved in 94% and 92% of patients in EMR-before-RFA and RFA-only group, respectively (P = 0.17). Durability of eradication did not differ between the groups. EMR-before-RFA for nodular BE with advanced neoplasia is effective and safe. The preceding EMR neither diminished the efficacy nor increased complication rate of RFA treatment compared to patients with advanced neoplasia who had RFA with no preceding EMR. Preceding EMR is not associated with poorer outcomes in RFA.","Li, N; Pasricha, S; Bulsiewicz, W J; Pruitt, R E; Komanduri, S; Wolfsen, H C; Chmielewski, G W; Corbett, F S; Chang, K J; Shaheen, N J",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,357,1

Objectives To characterize new BSIs in PWID receiving treatment for infective endocarditis, to determine the clinical factors associated with their development, and to determine whether new BSIs and treatment setting are associated with mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study was performed at 3 tertiary care hospitals in London, Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2007, to March 31, 2018. Participants included a consecutive sample of all PWID 18 years or older admitted with infective endocarditis. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2007, to June 29, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures New BSIs and factors associated with their development, treatment setting of infective endocarditis episodes (ie, inpatient vs outpatient), and 90-day mortality. Results The analysis identified 420 unique episodes of infective endocarditis in 309 PWID (mean [SD] patient age, 35.7 [9.7] years; 213 episodes [50.7%] involving male patients), with 82 (19.5%) complicated by new BSIs. There were 138 independent new BSIs, of which 68 (49.3%) were polymicrobial and 266 were unique isolates. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli (143 of 266 [53.8%]) and Candida species (75 of 266 [28.2%]) were the most common microorganisms. Ongoing inpatient IVDU was documented by a physician in 194 infective endocarditis episodes (46.2%), and 127 of these (65.5%) were confirmed by urine toxicology results. Multivariable time-dependent Cox regression demonstrated that previous infective endocarditis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.20-2.98), inpatient treatment (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.30-8.76), and physician-documented inpatient IVDU (HR, 5.07; 95% CI, 2.68-9.60) were associated with a significantly higher rate of new BSIs, whereas inpatient addiction treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.88). New BSIs were not significantly associated with 90-day mortality (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.78-4.02); significant factors associated with mortality included inpatient infective endocarditis treatment (HR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.53-7.53), intensive care unit admission (HR, 9.51; 95% CI, 4.91-18.42), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.03), whereas right-sided infective endocarditis was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.67). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, new BSIs were common in PWID receiving parenteral treatment for infective endocarditis. Discharging patients to outpatient treatment was not associated with an increase in new BSI incidence or mortality; carefully selected PWID may therefore be considered for such treatment.","Tan, Charlie; Shojaei, Esfandiar; Wiener, Joshua; Shah, Meera; Koivu, Sharon; Silverman, Michael",JAMA network open,357,1

These diseases are associated with plasma and/or tissue increases in cholesterol derivatives mainly formed by auto-oxidation: 7-ketocholesterol, also known as 7-oxo-cholesterol, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The formation of these oxysterols can be considered as a consequence of mitochondrial and peroxisomal dysfunction, leading to increased in oxidative stress, which is accentuated with age. 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol cause a specific form of cytotoxic activity defined as oxiapoptophagy, including oxidative stress and induction of death by apoptosis associated with autophagic criteria. Oxiaptophagy is associated with organelle dysfunction and in particular with mitochondrial and peroxisomal alterations involved in the induction of cell death and in the rupture of redox balance. As the criteria characterizing 7-ketocholesterol- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cytotoxicity are often simultaneously observed in major age-related diseases (cardiovascular diseases, age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease) the involvement of these oxysterols in the pathophysiology of the latter seems increasingly likely. It is therefore important to better understand the signalling pathways associated with the toxicity of 7-ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol in order to identify pharmacological targets, nutrients and synthetic molecules attenuating or inhibiting the cytotoxic activities of these oxysterols. Numerous natural cytoprotective compounds have been identified: vitamins, fatty acids, polyphenols, terpenes, vegetal pigments, antioxidants, mixtures of compounds (oils, plant extracts) and bacterial enzymes.

The extent to which such tissue damage is a result of a gradual decline in immune regulation, which consequently compromises the capacity of the body to repair damages, has not been fully explored. Whereas CD4 T lymphocytes play a critical role in the orchestration of immunity, thymus involution initiates gradual changes in the CD4 T-cell landscape, which may significantly compromise tissue repair. In this review, we describe the lifespan accumulation of specific dysregulated CD4 T-cell subsets and their coevolution with systemic inflammation in the process of declined immunity and tissue repair capacity with age. Then, we discuss the process of thymus involution-which appears to be most pronounced around puberty-as a possible driver of the aging T-cell landscape. Finally, we identify individualized T cell-based early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.","Elyahu, Yehezqel; Monsonego, Alon",Ageing research reviews,357,16

DESIGN The study was planned prospectively and observationally. SETTING The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS Coronavirus disease 2019 patients older than 18 years old, polymerase chain reaction test positive, with signs of pneumonia on tomography, and hospitalized were included in the study. ICU need, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in-hospital mortality were considered as primary endpoints. INTERVENTIONS Blood samples were taken from patients three times for angiotensin II levels. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Angiotensin II levels were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The SPSS 24.0 program (Statistics Program for Social Scientists, SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data. A total of 112 patients were included in the study, of which 63.4% of the patients were men. The serum angiotensin II levels were statistically significantly lower in the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with the healthy control group (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance between the serum angiotensin II levels measured at three different times (p > 0.05). The serum angiotensin II levels of the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were found to be statistically significantly lower than those without acute respiratory distress syndrome in three samples collected at different clinical periods (p < 0.05). The angiotensin II levels of the patients who required admission to the ICU at all three times of blood sample collection were found to be statistically significantly lower than those who did not (p < 0.05). Although the serum angiotensin II levels of the patients who died were low, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality at all three times (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The serum angiotensin II levels decrease significantly in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and this decrease is correlated with lung damage.","Ozkan, Seda; Cakmak, Fatih; Konukoglu, Dildar; Biberoglu, Serap; Ipekci, Afsin; Akdeniz, Yonca Senem; Bolayirli, Ibrahim Murat; Balkan, Ilker Inanc; Dumanli, Guleren Yartas; Ikizceli, Ibrahim",Critical care medicine,357,1

This study aims to draw attention to the pandemic-specific factors that might be associated with the severity of depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 phobia of high school students. METHODS A total of 1,431 high school students aged 14 to 18 years were invited to participate in thisstudy using online survey forms. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire about themselves and the changes in their lives during the pandemic. They completed the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). RESULTS Findings showed that being a girl is an increased risk factor for anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 phobia. In addition, following the official daily COVID-19 data and having a healthcare professional in the building of residence are significant risk factors for COVID-19 phobia. Having a psychiatric disorder, having a chronic disease, losing anyone due to COVID-19 infection, undergoing a COVID-19 diagnostic test, and meeting friends in person are increased risk factors for anxiety or depression during the pandemic.

Using two different mathematical models for different datasets, we aimed to estimate measles transmissibility over time and explore any heterogeneous transmission patterns. METHODS The first model relied on the temporal distribution for date of illness onset for cases, and a generation-dependent model was applied to the data. Another model focused on the transmission network. Using the illness-onset date along with the serial interval and geographical location of exposure, we reconstructed a transmission network with 19 unknown links. We then compared the number of secondary transmissions with and without clinical symptoms or laboratory findings. RESULTS Using a generation-dependent model (assuming three generations other than the index case), the reproduction number (R) over generations 0, 1, and 2 were 25.3, 1.3, and < 0.1, respectively, explicitly yielding the transmissibility over each generation. The network data enabled us to demonstrate that both the mean and the variance for the number of secondary transmissions per primary case declined over time. Comparing primary cases with and without secondary transmission, high viral shedding was the only significant determinant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The R declined abruptly over subsequent generations. Use of network data revealed the distribution of the number of secondary transmissions per primary case and also allowed us to identify possible secondary transmission risk factors. High viral shedding from the throat mucosa was identified as a potential predictor of secondary transmission.","Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Journal of epidemiology,357,0

Recent studies have documented the evolutionary impacts of extreme events on single species, but no studies have yet investigated whether such events can drive community-wide patterns of trait shifts. On 22 January 2020, subtropical south Florida experienced an extreme cold episode during which air temperatures dropped below the lower thermal limit of resident lizard populations. In the week immediately after the cold event, we documented decreased lower thermal limits (CTmin) of six co-occurring lizard species that vary widely in ecology, body size and thermal physiology. Although cold tolerance of these species differed significantly before the cold snap, lizards sampled immediately after had converged on the same new, lower limit of thermal tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that extreme climate events can drive substantial and synchronous community-wide trait changes and provide evidence that tropical and subtropical ectotherms-often characterized as unable to withstand rapid changes in climatic conditions-can endure climatic conditions that exceed their physiological limits. Future studies investigating the mechanisms driving these trait shifts will prove valuable in understanding the ability of ectotherm communities to mitigate climate change.","Stroud, James T; Mothes, Caitlin C; Beckles, Winter; Heathcote, Robert J P; Donihue, Colin M; Losos, Jonathan B",Biology letters,357,16

METHODS We conducted a matched cohort study based on prospective data (Jan 1, 2009-June 1, 2011) from the Danish Cholecystectomy Database with perioperative information and clinical follow-up. Consecutive patients undergoing elective SLC during the study period were included and matched 1:2 with patients subjected to CLC using pre-defined criteria. Follow-up data were obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry, mailed patient questionnaires, and clinical examination. A port-site hernia was defined as a repair for a port-site hernia or clinical hernia located at one or more port sites. RESULTS In total, 699 patients were eligible and 147 patients were excluded from the analysis due to pre-defined criteria. The rate of returned questionnaires was 83%. Thus, 552 (SLC, n = 185; CLC, n = 367) patients were analyzed. The median observation time was 48 months (range 1-65) after SLC and 48 months (1-64) after CLC (P = 0.940). The total cumulated port-site hernia rate was 4 % and 6 % for SLC and CLC, respectively (P = 0.560).

A short description of various activities that could be offered by parents, teachers, resilient peers and psychologists are given. Some information on teenage resilience is presented. The information is discussed in the developmental context, including the main biological, environmental, and social problems revealed in teenage functioning during the pandemic. Views: The COVID-19 pandemic heavily modified the social life of teenagers, and changed their daily lives. Young people were abruptly withdrawn from schools and outdoor activities. In effect, they were faced with uncertainty and alienation, which led to decreased levels of well-being and an increase in psychological problems. Some teenagers report feeling as well as they felt before the pandemic, or report a higher level of well-being than they experienced prior to period of social isolation. Discussion on the topic of resilience is therefore needed. Adolescents, more than any other age group, need social interactions with peers, time spent outdoors, and face-to-face communication with others. The lack of these thing, accompanied by stress, leads to many mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and changes in daily activity. Teenagers put a lot of effort to resisting these, but since the tentative social conditions continue, the damage to their mental functioning increases. Conclusions: Raising awareness and discussing these issues is crucial, in order to alert the public health system about the mental health needs of adolescents during the pandemic.","Kleszczewska-Albinska, A.",Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii,357,1

Our study has indicated keratin 1-based epidermal autofluorescence (AF) as a biomarker of this type: Inducers of both inflammation and oxidative stress dose-dependently increased epidermal green AF with polyhedral structure in mice, with the AF intensity being highly associated with the dosages of the inducers. Lung cancer also induced increased epidermal green AF of mice, which was mediated by inflammation. Significant and asymmetrical increases in green AF intensity with polyhedral structure were found in the Dorsal Index Fingers’ skin of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. While the AF intensity of the subjects with high risk for developing AIS, ischemic stroke patients in recovery phase and lung cancer patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls, both AF intensity and AF asymmetry of these four groups were markedly lower than those of the AIS patients, which have shown promise for AIS diagnosis. Several lines of evidence have indicated K1 as an origin of the AF, e.g., K1 siRNA administration attenuated the oxidative stress-induced AF increase of mice.

The elimination status defined by the World Health Organization aims to identify countries where the virus is no longer circulating and can be verified after 36 months of interrupted transmission. However, since 2018, numerous countries have lost their elimination status soon after reaching it, showing that the indicators used to define elimination may not be predictive of lower risks of outbreaks. Methods and Findings We quantified the impact of local vaccine coverage and recent levels of incidence on the dynamics of measles in each French department between 2009 and 2018, using mathematical models based on the 'Epidemic-Endemic' regression framework. High values of local vaccine coverage were associated with fewer imported cases and lower risks of local transmissions. Regions that had recently reported high levels of incidence were also at a lower risk of local transmission, potentially due to additional immunity accumulated during these recent outbreaks. Therefore, all else being equal, the risk of local transmission was not lower in areas fulfilling the elimination criteria (i.e., low recent incidence). After fitting the models using daily case counts, we used the parameters' estimates to simulate the effect of variations in the vaccine coverage and recent incidence on future transmission. A decrease of 3% in the three-year average vaccine uptake led to a five-fold increase in the number of cases simulated in a year on average. Conclusions Spatiotemporal variation in vaccine coverage because of disruption of routine immunisation programmes, or lower trust in vaccines, can lead to large increases in both local and cross regional transmission. The association found between local vaccine coverage and incidence suggests that, although regional vaccine uptake can be hard to collect and unreliable because of population movements, it can provide insights into the risks of imminent outbreak. Periods of low local measles incidence were not indicative of a decrease in the risks of local transmission. Therefore, the incidence indicator used to define the elimination status was not consistently associated with lower risks of measles outbreak in France. More detailed models of local immunity levels or subnational seroprevalence studies may yield better estimates of local risk of measles outbreaks.","Robert, A.; Kucharski, A. J.; Funk, S.",,357,32

If many memories are reactivated each night, how much do they interfere with one another? To explore this question, we examined whether reactivating multiple memories incurs a cost to sleep-related benefits by contrasting reactivation of multiple memories versus single memories during sleep. First, participants learned the on-screen location of different images. Each image was part of a semantically interconnected group (e.g., images of different cats). Groups were comprised of either one, two, or six images. During sleep, group-related sounds (e.g., “meow”) were unobtrusively presented to reactivate memories for half of the groups. The benefit in location recall for cued versus non-cued items was independent of the number of items in the group, suggesting that reactivation occurs in a simultaneous, promiscuous manner. Intriguingly, sleep spindles and delta-theta power modulations were sensitive to group size and reflected the extent of previous learning. Our results demonstrate that multiple memories may be consolidated in parallel without compromising each memory’s sleep-related benefit, suggesting that the brain’s capacity for reactivation is not strictly limited by separate resources needed for individual memories. These findings highlight alternative models for parallel consolidation that should be considered in future studies.","Schechtman, Eitan; Antony, James W.; Lampe, Anna; Wilson, Brianna J.; Norman, Kenneth A.; Paller, Ken A.",bioRxiv,357,1

Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) which are characterized by being rapid and cost-effective in response to market changes, are a good alternative to cope with such unexpected events. From the layout point of view, in an RMS, the layout of facilities needs to be changeable and able to be redesigned easily. Dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP) is a good approach to develop layouts that are capable to be changed and redesigned. Dynamic programming (DP) has been known as one of the effective methods to deal with DFLP. To optimize DFLP by DP, the set of possible layouts for every single period which is called the state-space is given to DP and the best multi-period layout is found. Since the number of possible layouts increases rapidly with the increase in the number of facilities, considering all these layouts encounters two major difficulties, memory requirements and computer time requirements. This paper proposes a method that has two main phases. In the first phase, the set of layouts to be considered in each period are determined using a heuristic approach. These layouts are the states in the DP approach where the periods constituted the decomposition stages. The recursive formulation of DP is solved in the second phase using a hybridized metaheuristic approach. The proposed approach restricts the DP to a good subset of the state-space. A genetic algorithm is applied to search for the best subset of layouts where each chromosome represents one subset of layouts. This subset is given to DP to be solved and the result is considered as the fitness of the chromosome. By the evolution of the chromosomes, the best subset of layouts that leads to the best multi-period layout plan is found. The proposed approach is evaluated against DP benchmarks in the literature. Computational results show that the proposed approach is able to provide more efficient solutions, especially for large-sized problems.

The comprehensive competitiveness of Guangdong provincial economy ranks first in China. Under the influence of COVID-19, the freight development of Guangdong Province has been affected, but there is still lack of quantitative research. It is significant to explore the trend of economic development through the freight development of Guangdong Province. Based on the grey theory model, this paper uses six freight indexes to research freight development of Guangdong Province. Under the assumption that COVID-19 did not happen, we predicted the development value of freight index of Guangdong Province from January to December in 2020 and studied the influence based on the comparison between the predicted value and actual value. The empirical study shows three impact characteristics: stage characteristics, structural characteristics, and entity transmission characteristics. COVID-19 has a negative impact on the development of total freight volume, highway freight volume, waterway freight volume, and air freight volume in Guangdong Province. The influence values were −23.001%, −29.344%, −11.296%, and −3.838%. But, the freight volumes of railway and pipeline were positively affected by 14.343% and 13.057%, respectively, due to their continuity and substitution to other transportation modes. To further explore the abate measures of COVID-19 impact on Guangdong's freight development, the grey correlation model is introduced to study the correlation factors of freight development of Guangdong Province.

With HTN being a common risk factor for individuals with DM, it's important to understand how RMPs can support individuals with both DM and HTN. Methods: Members were enrolled in a multi-chronic condition RMP with access to both DM and HTN programs. Using Propensity Score Matching to ensure no statistical differences in age, gender, race, DM type, insulin dependence, self-reported HbA1c, median zip code income, and zip code, two sample populations were constructed of those who were enrolled in DM only and DM+HTN between 1/1/2019 and 6/30/2019 and active on the platform for at least 1 year. For robust results, Bootstrapped Propensity Score Matching was used with 2,000 iterations. Paired t-test was used to compare reduction in estimated a1c at 6-and 9-months. Due to COVID-19, outcomes at 12-months were not evaluated. Results: No statistical differences between DM only (n=888) and DM+HTN (n=888) groups in age (56 vs. 56), gender (50% vs. 48% female), race (59% vs. 62% Caucasian), diabetes type (95% vs. 95% T2DM), insulin dependent (24% vs. 27%), started uncontrolled (49% vs. 50%), and self-reported HbA1c at time of registration (7.3% vs. 7.3%).

The pandemic has made childcare challenging for parents globally, compromising the well-being and mental health of caregivers themselves (Brooks et al., 2020), and creating a potentially highly vulnerable situation for children (Gromada, Richardson, Rees, 2020). The COVID-19 emergency and the restrictions it has entailed bear short- and long-term implications for families, including the potential impact of delaying implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2015) and increased risk of children witnessing or experiencing violence and abuse (End Violence Against Children, 2020). Given this background, we investigated the family ecosystem, exploring both individual and parental factors in parents’ relationships with their children, during lockdown.","Biffi, Elisabetta Gambacorti-Passerini Maria Benedetta Bianchi Daniela",Rivista Italiana di Educazione Familiare,357,1

Prior evidence from influenza pandemics suggest that fatigue symptomology may continue beyond the acute phase, lasting for several months to several years post discharge. This living systematic review aimed to examine long term fatigue prevalence among survivors and among communities, as well as investigate the current evidence for associated factors. Design:Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Hospitalised and community samples. Participants:Patient populations with a confirmed diagnosis of a named influenza virus. Main outcomes measured: Fatigue, fatigue syndromes. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria for a pooled prevalence analysis and five studies were identified as eligible for a means differences analysis. A fatigue prevalence of 41% (95% CI 0.2990.488) was found among a total population of 1,310. Using the vitality sub-scale of the SF-36 as a proxy for fatigue, the estimate for means differences indicated a lower mean vitality score for survivors compared to population norms (M -1.523, CI -13.53-10.48), although this was not significant (P = 0.803). The most common associations with fatigue were PTSD, depression and anxiety, ICU admission, female gender and higher age. Conclusions: This study reveals that a significant proportion of survivors (41%) experienced fatigue following their recovery from an influenza virus such as SARS or MERS and that this fatigue can be long-lasting. Also, that some factors such as female gender and psychological factors may contribute to continuing fatigue outcomes for this population. Strengths and limitations: (a) this study provides support for long-term fatigue outcomes in people with a confirmed coronavirus or other influenza virus pandemic, (b) the study suggests an aetiological role for some psychological and social factors, (c) findings are limited by the availability of fatigue data and lack of pre-morbid fatigue information; (d) a meta-analysis on the associations was prohibited by the small number of studies investigating long-term fatigue correlates and (e) the heterogeneity of the studies (>75%) suggests the pooled estimates should be interpreted with caution.","Poole-Wright, K.

In turn, wine is a strategic agri-food product for the economy of several countries around the world, particularly in Mediterranean countries. Beyond the economic level, wine has an environmental, social, and cultural dimension. All these dimensions have implications in any plan for the wine sector and should be taken into account. In addition, these dimensions change around the world in accordance with different local factors. In this way, sometimes, it is not easy to design adjusted marketing plans for the wine sector, namely, in international markets. Taking the frameworks into account, the main objective of this study is to explore the scientific documents available on scientific platforms, namely, in the Web of Science, related to “wine marketing”. These studies (87 documents) were first explored through bibliometric software, such as the VOSviewer and the Atlas.ti, and then analyzed individually to capture the main insights shown by the scientific literature about wine marketing. To better organize the literature survey, with the information obtained from the bibliometric analysis, the following indexes were identified through factor analysis: “supply index”, “demand index”, “winery strategy index”, “tourism index”, “innovation index”, and “wine characteristics index”. The supply index highlights questions related to new technologies, climate change, logistics in international markets, institutions and regulations, being the main factors that influence wine producers. The demand index stresses the relevance, for consumers, of the relationship between the price and quality of a wine. On the other hand, younger consumers, in general, consume wine outdoors while socializing, giving importance to the label, often when the wine is recommended by someone. Older consumers give greater importance to the wine’s variety and to its region of origin. The winery strategy index shows the importance of questions relating to agri-chains, market differentiation, the history, and the brand. The tourism index brings together aspects associated with the complementarity between activities in the wine sector, wine routes, and contributions from culture and landscape. The innovation index highlights aspects related to the quality and the perceptions of the consumers. Finally, the wine characteristics index shows the little importance given by scientific literature relating to wine marketing and to attributes such as alcohol. A search on the Web of Science for the topic addressed here and “bibliometric” showed that there has been no research carried out with the approach taken here, showing the novelty of this study.","Vítor João Pereira Domingues, Martinho",Sustainability,357,14

This has resulted in the disruption of routine care to children with chronic rheumatological diseases. We studied the treatment adherence and disease status of these children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did a cross-sectional observational study of children (&lt;16 years) with rheumatological diseases. Parents of seventy consecutive children with rheumatological diseases were interviewed through the telephone to assess the treatment adherence and disease status from April 2020 to July 2020. Results: In our study cohort, 44.3' (n = 31) had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), 52.9' (n = 37) had childhood lupus childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE), 1.4' (n = 1) had juvenile scleroderma, and 1.4' (n = 1) had childhood vasculitis. About 38.6' (n = 27) had poor compliance due to reasons like difficulty in transportation (88.6') (n = 24), financial constraints (88.6') (n = 24), fear of acquiring COVID-19 by attending the study center (55.5') (n = 15), and fear of taking immunosuppressive drugs (18.5') (n = 5). Thirty percent (n = 21) respondents reported flare of symptoms. Common flare symptoms reported were joint pain (25.7') (n = 18), skin rashes (1.4') (n = 1), and oral ulcers (1.4') (n = 1). One patient with cSLE required admission for acute pancreatitis. Nearly 4.3' (n = 3) experienced influenza like illness. One patient with cSLE developed swab-positive mild COVID-19 illness. cSLE patients experienced significantly less flare symptoms compared to patients with other rheumatological illness (P = 0.03, odds ratio = 0.32, confidence interval = 0.1-0.9). Almost 98.6' (n = 68) of parents were not aware of electronic consultation portals. Conclusion: Although COVID-19 causes less symptomatic disease in children, this study highlights the indirect effects of pandemic like financial constraints and parental misconceptions on children with rheumatological diseases. Furthermore, the awareness about electronic portals in consultation needs to be increased. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, observing the distribution of generation times (time interval between the points of infection of an infector and infectee in a transmission pair) requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; the generation time distribution is therefore often estimated based on the serial interval distribution (distribution of time intervals between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee). This estimation follows one of two approaches: i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution; or ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period (time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual) distributions. These two approaches make different -- and not always explicitly stated -- assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","Lehtinen, S.; Ashcroft, P.; Bonhoeffer, S.",,357,26

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the viral spike protein have potential to both prevent and treat COVID-19, and reduce the risk of severe disease and death. Here, we describe AZD7442, a combination of two mAbs, AZD8895 (tixagevimab) and AZD1061 (cilgavimab), that simultaneously bind to distinct non-overlapping epitopes on the spike protein receptor binding domain to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Initially isolated from individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the two mAbs were designed to extend their half-lives and abrogate effector functions. The AZD7442 mAbs individually prevent the spike protein from binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, blocking virus cell entry. Together, these two mAbs create a higher barrier to viral escape and a wider breadth of coverage, neutralizing all known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prophylactic AZD7442 administration prevented infection, while therapeutic administration accelerated virus clearance from lung. In an ongoing Phase I study in healthy participants (NCT04507256), 300 mg intramuscular AZD7442 provided SARS-CoV-2 serum geometric mean neutralizing titers >10-fold above those of convalescent sera for >=3 months, which remained 3-fold above those of convalescent sera 9 months post-AZD7442 administration. Approximately 1-2% of serum AZD7442 levels were detected in nasal mucosa, a site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Extrapolation of the time course of serum AZD7442 concentrations suggests AZD7442 may provide up to 12 months of protection and benefit individuals at high-risk of COVID-19.","Loo, Y.-M.; McTamney, P.

Concerns have arisen in trying to control viruses because of an increasing incidence of viral infections. Ozone is considered to be a promising method to inactivate viruses on surfaces. In this investigation, the effects of ozone concentration, contact time, different capsid architecture of viruses, and relative humidity (RH) on inactivating viruses by ozone were evaluated. The authors observed that the survival fraction of viruses on surfaces decreased exponentially with increasing ozone dose. Viruses required ozone doses of 20-112 min(mg/m3) (contact time [min] multiplied by ozone concentration [mg/m3) for 90% inactivation and 47-223 min(mg/m3) for 99% inactivation. The ozone dose for 99% inactivation was two times higher than for 90% inactivation. The required ozone concentration at 85% RH was lower than at 55% RH.

Several experimental animal models have been developed to study the mechanism of virus-induced demyelination, including coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice. The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of MHV contains determinants of properties essential for virus-host interactions. However, the molecular determinants of MHV-induced demyelination are still unknown. To investigate the mechanism of MHV-induced demyelination, we examined whether the S gene of MHV contains determinants of demyelination and whether demyelination is linked to viral persistence. Using targeted RNA recombination, we replaced the S gene of a demyelinating virus (MHV-A59) with the S gene of a closely related, nondemyelinating virus (MHV-2). Recombinant viruses containing an S gene derived from MHV-2 in an MHV-A59 background (Penn98-1 and Penn98-2) exhibited a persistence-positive, demyelination-negative phenotype. Thus, determinants of demyelination map to the S gene of MHV. Furthermore, viral persistence is insufficient to induce demyelination, although it may be a prerequisite for the development of demyelination.","Das Sarma, J; Fu, L; Tsai, J C; Weiss, S R; Lavi, E",Journal of virology,357,10

The first of three membrane-spanning domains was required for intracellular targeting, because a mutant E1 (delta m1,2) lacking this domain was delivered to the plasma membrane. We have used immunoelectron microscopy to localize the wild-type E1 protein within Golgi elements of COS cells and AtT-20 cells expressing these proteins from recombinant vaccinia vectors. By immunoperoxidase and immunogold labeling, the wild-type E1 protein was localized to one or two cisternae located on one side of the Golgi stack that could be identified as the cis side in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, the mutant E1 protein was detected in all cisternae across the stack as well as at the plasma membrane. When the E1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to digestion with endoglycosidase H, the majority of the wild-type E1 glycoprotein was endoglycosidase H sensitive, whereas the majority of the mutant E1 was processed to an endoglycosidase H-resistant, polylactosaminoglycan-containing form. The findings indicate that the wild-type E1 protein is specifically targeted to cis Golgi cisternae and are consistent with the assumption that the first membrane-spanning domain is required for targeting to the cis Golgi.","Machamer, C E; Mentone, S A; Rose, J K; Farquhar, M G",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,357,16

Although recent reports indicate that three vaccine candidates are effective against SARS-CoV-2, more time is needed to generate enough doses for the general population. Meanwhile, frontline healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. To avoid collapse of the medical care system, there is a need to develop novel approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Due to this immunomodulatory action, the BCG vaccine is currently used as a therapeutic in bladder cancer. Data collected from epidemiological and observational studies indicate that BCG vaccination might provide protection against COVID-19. While these observations do not provide evidence of causality and are limited by cofounding and intrinsic biases, it is crucial to explore the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may provide a nonspecific innate immune boost and therefore protect against COVID-19 in randomized controlled clinical trials, particularly for people at higher risk of developing COVID-19, such as frontline healthcare workers.","Noval Rivas, M.; Rosser, C.

As we move forward through the next phases of the pandemic, we will need a decision-making system that allows us to remain nimble as clinicians to meet our patient's needs while also working with a new framework of healthcare operations. Here, we present our quality improvement process for the adaptation and application of the Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) toolto gynecologic surgical services beyond the initial COVID response and into recovery of surgical services; with analysis of the reliability of the modified-MeNTS tool in our multi-site safety net hospital network. This multicenter study evaluated the gynecology surgical case volume at three tertiary acute care safety net institutions within the LA County Department of Health Services: Harbor-UCLA (HUMC), Olive View Medical Center (OVMC), and Los Angeles County + University of Southern California (LAC+USC). We describe our modified-Delphi approach to adapt the MeNTS tool in a structured fashion and its application to gynecologic surgical services. Blinded reviewers engaged in a three-round iterative adaptation and final scoring utilizing the modified tool. The cohort consisted of 392 female consecutive gynecology patients across three Los Angeles County Hospitals awaiting scheduled procedures in the surgical queue.The majority of patients were Latina (74.7%) and premenopausal (67.1%). Over half (52.4%) of the patients had cardiovascular disease, while 13.0% had lung disease, and 13.8% had diabetes. The most common indications for surgery were abnormal uterine bleeding (33.2%), pelvic organ prolapse (19.6%) and presence of an adnexal mass (14.3%). Minimally invasive approaches via laparoscopy, robotic-assisted laparoscopy, or vaginal surgery was the predominant planned surgical route (54.8%). Modified-MeNTS scores assumed a normal distribution across all patients within our cohort (Median 33, Range 18-52). Overall, ICC across all three institutions demonstrated ""good"" interrater reliability (0.72). ICC within institutions at HUMC and OVMC were categorized as ""good"" interrater reliability, while LAC-USC interrater reliability was categorized as ""excellent"" (HUMC 0.73, OVMC 0.65, LAC+USC 0.77). The modified-MeNTS tool performed well across a range of patients and procedures with a normal distribution of scores and high reliability between raters. We propose that the modified-MeNTS framework be considered as it employs quantitative methods for decision-making rather than subjective assessments.","Saleeby, Erin; Acree, Rachel; Wieslander, Cecilia; Truong, Christina; Garcia, Lisa; Eckhardt, Sarah; Hari, Anjali; Al-Marayati, Laila; Greenwell, Lisa; Holschneider, Christine H",J Med Syst,357,1

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS: Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed. RESULTS: Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones. Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation.

Increasingly, confirmed patients being discharged according to the current diagnosis and treatment protocols, follow-up of convalescent patients is important to knowing about the outcome. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed among 98 convalescent patients with COVID-19 in a single medical center. The clinical features of patients during their hospitalization and 2-week postdischarge quarantine were collected. RESULTS: Among the 98 COVID-19 convalescent patients, 17 (17.3%) were detected positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid during 2-week postdischarge quarantine. The median time from discharge to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive was 4 days (IQR, 3-8.5).The median time from symptoms onset to final respiratory SARS-CoV-2 detection of negative result was significantly longer in re-positive group (34 days [IQR, 29.5-42.5]) than in non-re-positive group (19 days [IQR, 16-26]). On the other hand, the levels of CD3-CD56 + NK cells during hospitalization and 2-week postdischarge were higher in re-positive group than in non-re-positive group (repeated measures ANOVA, P = .018). However, only one case in re-positive group showed exudative lesion recurrence in pulmonary computed tomography (CT) with recurred symptoms. CONCLUSION: It is still possible for convalescent patients to show positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, but most of the re-positive patients showed no deterioration in pulmonary CT findings. Continuous quarantine and close follow-up for convalescent patients are necessary to prevent possible relapse and spread of the disease to some extent.","Zhu, Hui; Fu, Liyun; Jin, Yinhua; Shao, Jiale; Zhang, Shun; Zheng, Nanhong; Fan, Lingyan; Yu, Zhe; Ying, Jun; Hu, Yaoren; Chen, Tongen; Chen, Yanglingzi; Chen, Min; Chen, Mingjue; Xiong, Zi; Kang, Junfei; Jin, Jiachang; Cai, Ting; Ye, Honghua",J Clin Lab Anal,357,21

Herein we provide pragmatic advice on the management of commonly encountered calcium metabolic problems and osteoporosis. Non-urgent elective appointments should be postponed, and remote consultations and digital health solutions promoted. Patients should be empowered to self-manage their conditions safely. Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to assured national or international online resources and specific patient groups. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined. IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic. Patients established on denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide should continue planned therapy. In the event of supply issues with teriparatide or abaloparatide, pausing this treatment in the short term is likely to be relatively harmless, whereas delaying denosumab may cause an immediate increased risk of fracture. The challenge of this pandemic will act as a catalyst to innovate within our management of metabolic bone and mineral disorders to ensure best use of resources and resilience of healthcare systems in its aftermath.","Gittoes, Neil J; Criseno, Sherwin; Appelman-Dijkstra, Natasha M; Bollerslev, Jens; Canalis, Ernesto; Rejnmark, Lars; Hassan-Smith, Zaki",Eur J Endocrinol,357,26

Nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14), which features exonuclease (ExoN) and guanine N7 methyltransferase activity, is a critical player in SARS-CoV-2 replication and fidelity and represents an attractive antiviral target. Initiating drug discovery efforts for nucleases such as NSP14 remains a challenge due to a lack of suitable high-throughput assay methodologies. This report describes the combination of self-assembled monolayers and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry to enable the first label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity. The assay was used to measure NSP14 activity and gain insight into substrate specificity and the reaction mechanism. Next, the assay was optimized for kinetically balanced conditions and miniaturized, while achieving a robust assay (Z factor > 0.8) and a significant assay window (signal-to-background ratio > 200). Screening 10,240 small molecules from a diverse library revealed candidate inhibitors, which were counterscreened for NSP14 selectivity and RNA intercalation. The assay methodology described here will enable, for the first time, a label-free and high-throughput assay for NSP14 ExoN activity to accelerate drug discovery efforts and, due to the assay flexibility, can be more broadly applicable for measuring other enzyme activities from other viruses or implicated in various pathologies.","Scholle, Michael D; Liu, Cheng; Deval, Jerome; Gurard-Levin, Zachary A",SLAS Discov,357,25

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood. METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may help decision makers, the public health officials, and the general public better control the risk of pandemic, particularly in the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.","Tian, Ting; Zhang, Jingwen; Hu, Liyuan; Jiang, Yukang; Duan, Congyuan; Li, Zhongfei; Wang, Xueqin; Zhang, Heping",Infect Dis Poverty,357,20

Objective: To determine whether tocilizumab (TCZ) improves outcomes of patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design, Setting, and Particpants: This cohort-embedded, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, bayesian randomized clinical trial investigating patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen but without ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was conducted between March 31, 2020, to April 18, 2020, with follow-up through 28 days. Patients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group). Usual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14. Secondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events. Results: Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis. Of the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years. In the TCZ group, 12 patients had a WHO-CPS score greater than 5 at day 4 vs 19 in the UC group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -9.0%; 90% credible interval [CrI], -21.0 to 3.1), with a posterior probability of negative ARD of 89.0% not achieving the 95% predefined efficacy threshold. At day 14, 12% (95% CI -28% to 4%) fewer patients needed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV) or died in the TCZ group than in the UC group (24% vs 36%, median posterior hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 90% CrI, 0.33-1.00), with a posterior probability of HR less than 1 of 95.0%, achieving the predefined efficacy threshold. The HR for MV or death was 0.58 (90% CrI, 0.30 to 1.09). At day 28, 7 patients had died in the TCZ group and 8 in the UC group (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.33-2.53). Serious adverse events occurred in 20 (32%) patients in the TCZ group and 29 (43%) in the UC group (P = .21). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14. No difference on day 28 mortality was found. Further studies are necessary for confirming these preliminary results.

This interplay between microtubules and actomyosin is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1 released after microtubule depolymerization or microtubule disconnection from focal adhesions. However, how GEF-H1 activates Rho upon microtubule disassembly remains elusive. Here, we found that BNIP-2, a BCH domain-containing protein that binds both RhoA and GEF-H1 and traffics with kinesin-1 on microtubules, is important for GEF-H1-driven RhoA activation upon microtubule disassembly. Depletion of BNIP-2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreases RhoA activity and promotes cell migration. Upon nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly, the interaction between BNIP-2 and GEF-H1 increases, while knockdown of BNIP-2 reduces RhoA activation and cell rounding via uncoupling RhoA-GEF-H1 interaction. Together, these findings revealed that BNIP-2 couples microtubules and focal adhesions via scaffolding GEF-H1 and RhoA, fine-tuning RhoA activity and cell migration.","Pan, Meng; Chew, Ti Weng; Wong, Darren Chen Pei; Xiao, Jingwei; Ong, Hui Ting; Chin, Jasmine Fei Li; Low, Boon Chuan",Sci.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 30 (n = 30) biopsy samples obtained after hysterectomy in women with diffuse adenomyosis of grade II-III, accompanied by severe pain syndrome, who did not receive hormonal therapy. The morphologic comparison group comprised 30 (n = 30) biopsy samples obtained from women with adenomyosis, without pain syndrome, operated on for abnormal uterine bleeding, who also did not receive hormone therapy. RESULTS: The total density of immunological OTR labeling in the adenomyotic lesion foci was 73.7 ± 1.8%, and in the morphological control group it was 35.2 ± 1.4% (p <0.05), which indicates a significant effect of oxytocin as a ureterotonic peptide. Processes of local neurogenesis and growth of nerve fibers was established due to an increase in the expression of the nervous system growth factor NGF in the myometrium stroma, in comparison with biopsy samples of morphological control.Conclusion: Pelvic pain pathogenesis in women with diffuse adenomyosis compared with the painless form of the disease is an increase in the activity of ureterotonic factors of OTR oxytocin. Compared to the painless form of adenomyosis, the myometrial innervation apparatus of patients with pelvic pain is characterized by a significantly higher expression of nerve growth factor.","Orazov, Mekan; Radzinsky, Victor; Sharapova, Olga; Kostin, Igor; Chitanava, Yurii",Gynecol Endocrinol,357,1

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS: This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION: Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA). This approach may enable us to protect both patients and healthcare professionals that perform the operation from the risk of COVID-19.","Çiyiltepe, Hüseyin; Yildirim, Gülsah; Fersahoglu, Mehmet Mahir; Aydin, M Timuçin; Özcabi, Yetkin; Bulut, Nuriye Esen; Tasdelen, Iksan; Fersahoglu, Ayse Tuba; Yananli, Zühal Demirhan; Aydin, Ibrahim; Agca, Birol; Karakas, Hakki Muammer; Akyüz, Umit; Memisoglu, Kemal",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,357,16

TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) data were used to study the spatial variations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (TVCDs) over the study area during 16–20 weeks after the Chinese Spring Festival (25 January 2020). These data were used to select 11 regions for more detailed analysis of the variation of NO2 TVCDs on a decadal timescale. In this analysis, monthly and annual averaged NO2 TVCDs derived from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) observations were used for the years 2011 to 2019. The results show the NO2 TVCD trends for different regions, all decreasing in response to emission reduction policies but with a different onset and a possible halt of the decrease in recent years;trends and period in the south of the study area are different from those in the north. Variations of NO2 TVCDs on shorter timescales, monthly and weekly, were analyzed using TROPOMI data. In addition, the variations of weekly-averaged ground-based NO2 concentrations in 11 major cities were analyzed together with those for O3 and PM2.5. In particular these data were used to determine their effect on the air quality as expressed by the air quality index (AQI). For quantitative estimates, the use of weekly concentrations is more accurate than the use of monthly values, and the effects of long-term trends and their reversal needs to be taken into account for the separation of effects of the lockdown and the Spring Festival. Neglecting the possible reversal of the trends leads to overestimation of the lockdown effect in the south and underestimation in the north. The ground-based data confirm earlier reports, based on satellite observations, that the expected improvement of air quality due to the reduction of NO2 concentrations was offset by the increase of the concentrations of O3 and the different effects of the lockdown measures on PM2.5, as well as effects of meteorological influences and heterogeneous chemistry. The AQI seems to be mostly influenced by PM2.5 rather than NO2. A qualitative comparison between time series of satellite and ground-based NO2 observations shows both similarities and differences. The study further shows the different behaviors in city clusters in the north and south of China, as well as inland in the Sichuan and Guanzhong basins. Effects of other holidays and events are small, except in Beijing where the air quality in 2020 was notably better than in previous years. This study was undertaken for China, but the methodology and results have consequences for air quality studies in other areas, and part of the conclusions are generally applicable.","Cheng, Fan Li Zhengqiang Li Ying Dong Jiantao van der A Ronald de Leeuw Gerrit",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,357,10

CHB-related serology has been extensively studied, but reports on immune-cell profiles of anti-Ro/La-exposed neonates are lacking. In the current study, we characterised circulating immune-cell populations in anti-Ro/La+mothers and newborns, and explored potential downstream effects of skewed neonatal cell populations. METHODS: In total, blood from mothers (n=43) and neonates (n=66) was sampled at birth from anti-Ro/La+ (n=36) and control (n=30) pregnancies with or without rheumatic disease and CHB. Flow cytometry, microarrays and ELISA were used for characterising cells and plasma. RESULTS: Similar to non-pregnant systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren-patients, anti-Ro/La+mothers had altered B-cell subset frequencies, relative T-cell lymphopenia and lower natural killer (NK)-cell frequencies. Surprisingly, their anti-Ro/La exposed neonates presented higher frequencies of CD56dimCD16hi NK cells (p<0.01), but no other cell frequency differences compared with controls. Type I and II interferon (IFN) gene-signatures were revealed in neonates of anti-Ro/La+ pregnancy, and exposure of fetal cardiomyocytes to type I IFN induced upregulation of several NK-cell chemoattractants and activating ligands. Intracellular flow cytometry revealed IFNÎ³ production by NK cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in anti-Ro/La exposed neonates. IFNÎ³ was also detectable in their plasma. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates an increased frequency of NK cells in anti-Ro/La exposed neonates, footprints of type I and II IFN and an upregulation of ligands activating NK cells in fetal cardiac cells after type I IFN exposure. These novel observations demonstrate innate immune activation in neonates of anti-Ro/La+pregnancy, which could contribute to the risk of CHB.","Ivanchenko, Margarita; Thorlacius, Gudny Ella; Hedlund, Malin; Ottosson, Vijole; Meneghel, Lauro; Björkander, Sophia; Ossoinak, Amina; Tingström, Joanna; Bremme, Katarina; Sverremark-Ekström, Eva; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina; Sonesson, Sven-Erik; Chemin, Karine; Wahren-Herlenius, Marie",Ann. rheum. dis,357,24

Methods For the 1 purpose, an online survey of 32 questions was distributed to gastroenterologists nationwide. For the2 purpose the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of some endoscopic procedures performed at theGastroenterology Department of CHVNG/E between March 16 and May 8 during the years 2019 and 2020. Results 67 gastroenterologists have answered our survey between April 15th and May 5th 2020, mostly females (53.7 %)and 55 to 65 years-old group was the most prevalent (25.4 %). Only 14.9 % were residents. 86.6 % worked in a hospital with COVID-19 patients, with 16.4 % assigned to assist those patients. All the departments had suffered modifications. 90 %of the residents affirmed that their activity has changed mainly endoscopic practice, and 64.2 % respondents agreeing withan internship extension. 94 % declared to have non-essential endoscopic procedures postponed. 85.1 % maintained in-person medical visits, 88.1 % were already having remote consultations and 11.9 % did not have any clinical visit. In ourgastroenterology unit, the number of endoscopic procedures had decreased 73.1 % from 2019 to 2020. Conclusions The advent of the COVID-19 outbreak has led to important changes among Gastroenterology activities inPortugal, and national gastroenterology units are complying with the recommendations. Furthermore, PortugueseGastroenterologists believed that the decrease in endoscopic activity can compromise residents' education and training. Thegastroenterology department at CHVNG/E has shown a significant reduction in the number of endoscopic proceduresperformed during the same period from 2019 to 2020.","Gomes, C.; Pinho, R.; Silva, J.

Since the latent of this epidemic are also highly contagious, traditional infectious disease models cannot accurately describe the regularity of this epidemic transmission. Based on the traditional infectious disease model, an infectious disease model with a time delay is proposed. The time difference is used to characterize the cycle of viral infection and treatment time. Using the epidemic data released in real time, firstly, through the numerical simulation parameter inversion, the minimum error is obtained; then we simulate the development trend of the epidemic according to the dynamics system; finally, we compare and analyze the effectiveness of isolation measures.

Probiotic microorganisms possess the ability to displace cariogenic microorganisms and colonize the oral cavity. They can produce various antimicrobial substances such as bacteriocins, bacteriocin-like peptides, lactic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. Dairy products may be ideal for probiotic administration in dental patients. Many other means have been proposed, primarily for those allergic to dairy components, such as capsules, liquid form, tablets, drops, lozenges, sweetened cakes, and ice creams. The last two forms can be used in a coaching approach for children and elderly patients who find it difficult to avoid sugary beverages in their daily routine and benefit from the suggestion of easy, cheap, and common forms of delicacies. In caries prevention, the concept of the effector strain is already considered an integral part of the contemporary caries cure or prevention strategy in adults. Adults, though, seem not to be favored as much as children at early ages by using probiotics primarily due to their oral microbiome’s stability. In this non-systematic review we describe the modes of action of probiotics, their use in the cariology field, their clinical potential, and propose options to prevent caries through a patient coaching approach for the daily dental practice.","Amargianitakis, Markos Antoniadou Maria Rahiotis Christos Varzakas Theodoros",Applied Sciences,357,24

The human defence may include antibodies which interact with SARS-CoV-2 and neutralize its aggressive actions on multiple organ systems. Protective cross-reactivity of antibodies against measles and other known viral infections has been postulated, primarily as a result of the initial observations of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in children. Uncontrolled case series have demonstrated virus-neutralizing effect of convalescent plasma, supporting its efficiency at early stages of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Given the variability of the virus structure, the utility of convalescent plasma is limited to the geographic area of its preparation, and for a short period of time. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also be protective in view of its nonspecific antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Finally, human monoclonal antibodies may interact with some SARS-CoV-2 proteins, inhibiting the virus-receptor interaction and prevent tissue injury. The improved understanding of the host antiviral responses may help develop safe and effective immunotherapeutic strategies against COVID-19 in the foreseeable future.","Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Yessirkepov, Marlen; Zimba, Olena",J Korean Med Sci,357,12

We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations, indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors. Methods: We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135). We searched multiple databases to 18/11/2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature on migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts and risk factors using narrative synthesis. Results: 3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected. Migrants experience risk factors including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement. Conclusions: Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health and policy responses to the pandemic. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.","Hayward, Sally E; Deal, Anna; Cheng, Cherie; Crawshaw, Alison; Orcutt, Miriam; Vandrevala, Tushna F; Norredam, Prof Marie; Carballo, Manuel; Ciftci, Yusuf; Requena-Méndez, Ana; Greenaway, Chris; Carter, Jessica; Knights, Felicity; Mehrotra, Anushka; Seedat, Farah; Bozorgmehr, Prof Kayvan; Veizis, Apostolos; Campos-Matos, Ines; Wurie, Fatima; McKee, Prof Martin; Kumar, Prof Bernadette; Hargreaves, Sally",J Migr Health,357,16

Studies have demonstrated that Geritalk, a two day (16 hours total) in-person communication skills training improves self-assessed preparedness, skill acquisition, and sustained practice of communication skills. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Geritalk was adapted to a virtual format (four days, 10 hours total). OBJECTIVES: Our study evaluated the change in participants' self-assessed preparedness for serious illness communication before and after the virtual course and satisfaction with the course, and compared these findings to responses from a prior in-person Geritalk course. METHODS: Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine fellows at three urban academic medical centers completed surveys, which employed five-point Likert scales, before and after the virtual course to assess satisfaction with the course and preparedness for serious illness communication. RESULTS: Of the 20 virtual Geritalk participants, 17 (85%) completed the pre-course assessment, and 14 (70%) completed the post-course assessment. Overall, satisfaction with the course was high (mean 4.9 on a 5-point scale). Compared to in-person Geritalk participants, virtual course participants reported comparable and significant (P < 0.01) improvements in mean self-reported preparedness across all surveyed communication skills. CONCLUSION: We show that a virtual communication skills training is feasible and effective. Our findings suggest that the innovative virtual Geritalk course has the potential to increase access to communication skills training, improve serious illness communication skills, and in improve the quality of care received by older adults with serious illness.","Frydman, Julia L; Gelfman, Laura P; Lindenberger, Elizabeth C; Smith, Cardinale B; Berns, Stephen; Kelley, Amy S; Dow, Lindsay A",J. pain symptom manage,357,24

Usually, the choice of technique (percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy [PDT] versus open surgical tracheotomy [OST]) depends on the preference of surgeons and patient-related factors. In case of COVID-19, airborne spread of viral particles and limited time of apnea must be considered in the choice of the safest technique. The aim of this study is to compare the complication rates and offer an assessment of relative risks and benefits of PDT versus OST in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study considering 47 consecutive patients affected by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, needing invasive mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. This study was performed at the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary referral center. Complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients underwent PDT and 30 patients were submitted to OST. Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had post-operative complications (local infection, hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema) with no significant difference between PDT and OST. CONCLUSION: PDT and OST are characterized by similar postoperative complication rates in severe COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that OST might be preferred if expert ENT surgeons are available, as PDT could result in longer apnea and exposure to generated aerosol. However, authors recommend considering either OST or PDT at the discretion of the medical staff involved, according to the personal experience of the operators performing the procedure.","Botti, Cecilia; Lusetti, Francesca; Neri, Tommaso; Peroni, Stefano; Castellucci, Andrea; Salsi, Pierpaolo; Ghidini, Angelo",Auris nasus larynx,357,5

Understanding the progression of mental health and factors underlying the perpetuation of distress during the pandemic is pivotal in informing interventions and public health messaging. This current study examined longitudinal effects of two cognitive vulnerabilities, looming cognitive style, and intolerance of uncertainty, as well as coping styles on anxiety and depression through online questionnaires at two time points in the pandemic, May 2020 (N = 1520) and August 2020 (N = 545). Depression, but not anxiety, significantly increased across time, which was moderated by coping style. Serial mediation modeling using path analysis demonstrated a significant pathway illustrating increased looming cognitive style in the beginning of the pandemic leads to increased intolerance of uncertainty, avoidant coping, and anxiety later in the pandemic. Results suggest a novel model in conceptualizing anxiety during the pandemic, namely highlighting looming cognitive style as an underlying cognitive vulnerability factor and antecedent of intolerance of uncertainty and illuminating the temporal directionality between looming cognitive style and intolerance of uncertainty. These findings provide important implications regarding intervention and public health messaging with modifiable behavioral and cognitive factors to improve mental health during a pandemic.","Carnahan, Nicolette D.; Carter, Michele M.; Sbrocco, Tracy",International journal of cognitive therapy,357,1

Large-scale population screening is an effective means to control the spread of COVID-19. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serology assays are the most available techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, they suffer from either less sensitivity and accuracy or low instrument accessibility for screening. To balance the sensitivity, specificity, and test availability, here, we developed enhanced colorimetry, which is termed as a magnetic pull-down-assisted colorimetric method based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system (M-CDC), for SARS-CoV-2 detection. By this method, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from synthetic sequences and cultured viruses can be detected by the naked eye based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probes, with a detection limit of 50 RNA copies per reaction. With CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted detection, SARS-CoV-2 can be specifically distinguished from other closely related viruses. M-CDC was further used to analyze 41 clinical samples, whose performance was 95.12%, consistent with that of an approved Clinical RT-qPCR Diagnosis kit. The developed M-CDC method is not dependent on sophisticated instruments, which makes it potentially valuable to be applied for SARS-CoV-2 screening under poor conditions.","Jiang, Yongzhong; Hu, Menglu; Liu, An-An; Lin, Yi; Liu, Linlin; Yu, Bo; Zhou, Xiaoming; Pang, Dai-Wen",ACS Sens,357,2

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and resulted in a continuing pandemic. Macrolides have been extensively researched as broad adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 due to its immunostimulant abilities. Among such class of drugs, azithromycin is described as azalide and is well-known for its ability to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including matrix metalloproteinases, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8. In fact, a report recently published highlighted the effectiveness of combining azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Indeed, it has been underlined that azithromycin quickly prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection by raising the levels of both interferons and interferon-stimulated proteins at the same time which reduces the virus replication and release. In this sense, the current review aims to evaluate the applications of macrolides for the treatment of COVID-19.","Batiha, G. E.; Zayed, M. A.; Awad, A. A.; Shaheen, H.

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the crucial interventions to control virus spread and dissemination. Molecular assays have been the gold standard to directly detect for the presence of viral genetic material in infected individuals. However, insufficient viral RNA at the point of detection may lead to false negative results. As such, it is important to also employ immune-based assays to determine one's exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to assist in the surveillance of individuals with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Within a span of 4 months, extensive studies have been done to develop serological systems to characterize the antibody profiles, as well as to identify and generate potentially neutralizing antibodies during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vast diversity of novel findings has added value to coronavirus research, and a strategic consolidation is crucial to encompass the latest advances and developments.

Supporting individuals to develop strategies to maintain a healthier weight when there are additional life challenges may prevent relapse. This mixed-methods study describes the impact the COVID-19 restrictions had on adults engaged in weight management before and during the pandemic in order to determine helpful strategies. METHODS: Longitudinal data was captured from online surveys completed by Slimming World (SW) members 0-4 weeks after joining, October/November 2019, providing pre-joining and baseline (T0&T1), 3- (T2) and 6- month (T3-during COVID-19) data. Representatives from the general population, not attending a weight management service, completed the same questionnaires providing cross-sectional control data. All weights are self-reported. For this study, questions assessing the impact of the COVID-19 challenges on health-related behaviours and well-being are included comparing responses at T0/T1, T2 & T3. Longitudinal data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA and cross-sectional data, one-way independent ANOVAs to compare means. Comparisons between SW members and controls were determined using z-proportion tests. Qualitative data generated was thematically analysed using a six-step approach to produce the key emerging themes. RESULTS: 222 SW members completed all three surveys, achieving a weight loss of 7.7 ± 7.5%. They maintained positive health-related behaviour changes made since joining, including increased fruit and vegetables (p < 0.001), fewer sugary drinks (p < 0.001), cooking from scratch (p < 0.001) and increased activity levels (p < 0.001). Despite COVID-19 restrictions, they were still reporting improvements in all behaviours and had healthier scores than the controls on all but alcohol intake, although still within guidelines. Qualitative data indicated that the situation created various challenges to managing weight with fresh foods harder to access, comfort eating, drinking more alcohol, eating more sugary foods and snacking through boredom. However, some reported having more free time enabling better planning, more time to cook from scratch and increased physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of peer, group and online support and guidance for individuals to develop sustainable behaviour changes and a level of resilience. These strategies can then be drawn upon enabling maintenance of lifestyle changes and management of weight even in challenging times.","Avery, Amanda; Toon, Josef; Kent, Jennifer; Holloway, Laura; Lavin, Jacquie; Bennett, Sarah-Elizabeth",BMC Public Health,357,16

COVID-19 presents not only urgent challenges for this hurricane season due to the likeliness of continued or heightened COVID-19 threat, but also challenges with the next hurricane season with additional waves of the pandemic. There is severe urgency to understand the impact of COVID-19 risk perceptions and the extent people are willing to risk their lives by sheltering in place rather than evacuating during severe hurricanes. In June 2020, a survey (in both English and Spanish) of 40 questions was disseminated through regional planning councils, emergency management, and the media to Florida residents. A total of 7,072 people responded from over 50 counties. Most data obtained were ordinal or categorical in nature, encouraging usage of nonparametric analysis and chi-square tests. Almost half the respondents view themselves as vulnerable to COVID-19 due to preexisting health conditions, and 74.3% of individuals viewed the risk of being in a shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic as more dangerous than enduring hurricane hazards. Additionally, there was a significant number of individuals who would choose to not utilize a public shelter during COVID-19 when they would have previously. Officials can use the results of this study regarding how household evacuation plans change with social distancing to better inform strategies of shelter preparedness and COVID-19 risk mitigation to minimize risk to those in harm's way of storm surge and other hurricane effects during a mandatory evacuation order. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Collins, J.; Polen, A.; McSweeney, K.; Colón-Burgos, D.; Jernigan, I.",Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,357,23

Using functional MRI (fMRI), it is possible to characterize cerebral blood flow from blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. In this study, we applied spatial independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data of 37 stroke patients scanned within 24 hr of symptom onset, 17 of whom received follow-up scans the next day. Our analysis revealed ""Hypoperfusion spatially-Independent Components"" (HICs) whose spatial patterns of BOLD signal resembled regions of delayed perfusion depicted by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. These HICs were detected even in the presence of excessive patient motion, and disappeared following successful tissue reperfusion. The unique spatial and temporal features of HICs allowed them to be distinguished with high accuracy from other components in a user-independent manner (area under the curve = 0.93, balanced accuracy = 0.90, sensitivity = 1.00, and specificity = 0.85). Our study therefore presents a new, noninvasive method for assessing blood flow in acute stroke that minimizes interpretative subjectivity and is robust to severe patient motion.","Hu, Jiun-Yiing; Kirilina, Evgeniya; Nierhaus, Till; Ovadia-Caro, Smadar; Livne, Michelle; Villringer, Kersten; Margulies, Daniel; Fiebach, Jochen B; Villringer, Arno; Khalil, Ahmed A",Hum. brain mapp,357,16

The result is that SME managers must manage their firms through a crisis under very challenging conditions. The purpose of the present paper is to address how SME managers respond in the second “wave” of COVID-19 based on their perceived uncertainty as well as eventual learning from the first “wave” in early 2020. Design/methodology/approach: Four hypotheses are presented, resulting in a theoretical model relating crisis impact, uncertainty, learning from crisis experience and effectuation behaviour. The theoretical model is tested through an empirical questionnaire-based quantitative study of Norwegian SMEs in the bar and restaurant sector, applying structural equation modelling as the analytical technique. Findings: The results show that impact from COVID-19 leads to both uncertainty and learning and further that uncertainty primarily leads to a focus on affordable loss while learning leads to experimentation behaviour. Originality/value: The present paper is novel in several ways. First, it empirically studies a unique situation where a crisis encompasses two “waves” of significant impact on the firms in focus. This provides the opportunity to address managers' learning through a crisis for application in a very similar situation later. Second, the present paper provides an empirically supported model of how uncertainty or learning leads to different dimensions of effectuation behaviour in a crisis situation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Haneberg, D.

AIM: To assess healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives on pre-warning rapid response calls (RRC) with 'Code-95' in announcements when attending to deteriorating or aggressive patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Design: prospective cross-sectional single-centre survey of HCW over a 3-week period. SETTING: tertiary public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCW caring for deteriorating or aggressive patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the primary outcome was to assess HCW perspectives in attending Code-95 calls. Secondary outcomes were to identify any differences related to craft group, age, experience or presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 297 responses was analysed; 86.7% of HCW (n = 257) attending Code-95 calls reported anxiety. Medical staff reported greater anxiety in comparison to nursing staff (93.8% vs 78.5%; P = 0.002). Efferent team reported higher anxiety in contrast to afferent team (92.6% vs 58.8%; P = 0.021). There was no significant difference in perceived anxiety based on age (&#8804;40 vs >40 years of age), years of experience (&#8804;5 vs >5 years), comorbidities or mental illness; 54% reported concerns about adequacy of infection-control policies and personal protective equipment; 45% were worried about inadequate training for responding to Code-95 calls. CONCLUSIONS: Most surveyed HCW supported Code-95 announcements pre-warning them of potential COVID-19 exposure when attending a RRC. However, the majority of HCW reported anxiety when attending these calls. Medical and efferent team HCW perceived greater anxiety compared to nursing and afferent team HCW. The Code-95 system to pre-warn rapid response teams may be a useful addition to protecting HCW from infectious diseases, although broader implementation will require greater resourcing, training and support.","Subramaniam, Ashwin; Zuberav, Alexandr; Wengritzky, Robert; Bowden, Christopher; Tiruvoipati, Ravindranath; Wang, Wei Chun; Wadhwa, Vikas",Intern Med J,357,22

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, frontline healthcare professionals have been experiencing extremely stressful situations and damage to their physical and mental health. These adverse conditions cause stress and biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory changes, as well as oxidative damage, and could be potentially detrimental to the health of the individual. The study population consisted of frontline health professionals working in BHU in a city in southern Brazil. Among the 45 participants, two were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were diagnosed using immunochromatographic tests such as salivary RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in the participants. The infected professionals (CoV-2-Prof) showed a significant increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In this group, the levels of uric acid, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets decreased. In the group of uninfected professionals (NoCoV-2-Prof), significant increase in HDL levels and the percentages of eosinophils and monocytes, was observed. Further, in this group, uric acid, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and the hematocrit count and mean corpuscular volume were significantly reduced. Both groups showed significant inflammatory activity with changes in the levels of C-reactive protein and mucoprotein. The NoCoV-2-Prof group showed significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels.

Methods: We performed a multicentre, retrospective study involving 13 COVID-19 Units in Campania region from February to May 2020. We defined as severe COVID-19 presentation the cases that required mechanical ventilation and/or admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and/or in case of death. Results: We enrolled 371 COVID-19 patients, of whom 34 (9.2%) had a history or a diagnosis of cancer (24 solid, 6 onco-hematological). Oncologic patients were older (p&lt;0.001), had more comorbidities (p&lt;0.001) and showed a higher rate of severe COVID-19 presentation (p=0.001) and of death (p&lt;0.001).

However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women. Building on this, we tested whether older adults - and particularly older men -- would report the least amount of COVID-19 worry and also fewer COVID-19 behavior changes. METHODS: From March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. RESULTS: During the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults. Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes. DISCUSSION: Interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 behavior changes in older men. These results also highlight the importance of understanding emotional-responses to COVID-19, as these are predictive of their behavioral responses.","Barber, Sarah J; Kim, Hyunji",,357,10

We examined the geographic variation in excess all-cause mortality by race and ethnicity to better understand the impact of the pandemic. We used individual-level administrative data on the US population between January 2011 and April 2020 to estimate the geographic variation in excess all-cause mortality by race and Hispanic origin. All-cause mortality allows a better understanding of the overall impact of the pandemic than mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly. Nationwide, adjusted excess all-cause mortality during that period was 6.8 per 10,000 for Black people, 4.3 for Hispanic people, 2.7 for Asian people, and 1.5 for White people. Nationwide averages mask substantial geographic variation. For example, despite similar excess White mortality, Michigan and Louisiana had markedly different excess Black mortality, as did Pennsylvania compared with Rhode Island. Wisconsin experienced no significant White excess mortality but had significant Black excess mortality. Further work understanding the causes of geographic variation in racial and ethnic disparities-the relevant roles of social and environmental factors relative to comorbidities and of the direct and indirect health effects of the pandemic-is crucial for effective policy making.","Polyakova, Maria; Udalova, Victoria; Kocks, Geoffrey; Genadek, Katie; Finlay, Keith; Finkelstein, Amy N",Health Aff (Millwood),357,24

The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 µg, 100 µg, or 250 µg. There were 15 participants in each dose group. RESULTS: After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-µg group, 109,209 in the 100-µg group, and 213,526 in the 250-µg group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-µg dose group reported one or more severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine.

At this early stage, the mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 are still subject to intense scrutiny and the long-term mental health consequences as a result of the disease are unknown. Here we discuss the hypothesis that patients who survive severe COVID-19 and who experience significant activation of the immune system, are at greater risk of developing depression. We posit that a phenomenon known as cytokine storm dramatically activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), resulting in the increase in kynurenine metabolites. Kynurenine is metabolized by IDO-1 in the brain, producing chemokines, in which a prolonged exposure may result long-term brain impairment. In this article, we also propose the possibility that a SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion increases the local levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 down-regulation. Thereby, angiotensin II could increase kynurenine metabolites producing pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, resulting in impairment of cognitive function, enhanced oxidative stress and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It is our premise that patients who experience such a cytokine storm may be at increased risk of long-term mental illness, such as depression.","Bouças, Ana P; Rheinheimer, Jakeline; Lagopoulos, Jim",Neuroscientist,357,16

The aim of this review was to explore and describe the current literature in HOCI surveillance. Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and MedRxiv were searched up to 30 November 2020 using broad search criteria. Articles of HOCI surveillance systems were included. Data describing HOCI definitions, HOCI incidence, types of HOCI identification surveillance systems, and level of system implementation were extracted. A total of 292 citations were identified. Nine studies on HOCI surveillance were included. Six studies reported on the proportion of HOCI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged from 0 to 15.2%. Six studies provided HOCI case definitions. Standardized national definitions provided by the UK and US governments were identified. Four studies included healthcare workers in the surveillance. One study articulated a multimodal strategy of infection prevention and control practices including HOCI surveillance. All identified HOCI surveillance systems were implemented at institutional level, with eight studies focusing on all hospital inpatients and one study focusing on patients in the emergency department. Multiple types of surveillance were identified. Four studies reported automated surveillance, of which one included real-time analysis, and one included genomic data. Overall, the study quality was limited by the observational nature with short follow-up periods. In conclusion, HOCI case definitions and surveillance methods were developed pragmatically. Whilst standardized case definitions and surveillance systems are ideal for integration with existing routine surveillance activities and adoption in different settings, we acknowledged the difficulties in establishing such standards in the short-term.","Abbas, M; Zhu, N J; Mookerjee, S; Bolt, F; Otter, J A; Holmes, A H; Price, J R",J Hosp Infect,357,10

Increasing the federal share of Medicaid spending as unemployment rises would mitigate fiscal pressure on states and preserve public services. But unlike the demand for Medicaid's health care protections, which rises when economic activity declines, the demand for long-term care protections will grow even in a healthy economy as the population ages. Enhanced federal support is urgent not only to cope with the virus today but also to meet the long-term care needs of the nation's aging population in the years to come.

However, the uptake of ACP among patients with chronic diseases is relatively low. Web-based ACP programs can support patients and their relatives in ACP. However, information needs of patients and their relatives for ACP are unknown. The aim of this study is to explore information needs of patients with chronic disease and their relatives for web-based ACP. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with chronic diseases and relatives at their home or at the study center. In three cases, the patient and relative were paired since they preferred to be interviewed together. We asked about information they would search for when to start with ACP, where they would search for information, what search terms they would use on the Internet, and what content and information they would consider important on an ACP website. The interviewer asked participants to clarify their responses during the interview. We used thematic analysis to analyze the interviewees' responses. RESULTS: We interviewed nine patients with different chronic diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and kidney diseases, and seven relatives, namely partners or (adult) children. The interviewees were aged 24 to 80 years, nine were female and seven were male. Both patients with a chronic disease and relatives mentioned comparable information needs. Many interviewees indicated they would use the Internet to search for information about ACP. Mentioned search terms were ""advance care planning"", ""treatment plan"", ""disease trajectory"" and names of patient associations. Information needs concerned their disease trajectory and quality of life, medical treatment decisions, practical support in arranging care, the concept of ACP and guidance in ACP, communication of treatment and care preferences, peer support of others with chronic diseases, and information for relatives. Many appreciated encouragement of their healthcare providers to take a pro-active role in ACP. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that information needs for ACP included guidance in ACP, support in making decisions about medical treatment, and practical support in arranging care. We recommend adapting web-based ACP information to the information needs of patients and their relatives to increase its findability, uptake and usefulness.","van der Smissen, Doris; Rietjens, Judith A C; van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; van Dulmen, Sandra; van der Heide, Agnes; Korfage, Ida J",BMC Palliat Care,357,16

The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.","Hasan, A.; Susanto, H.; Tjahjono, V.

The benefits of early mobility while undergoing ECMO have been previously documented. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented physical therapists with novel challenges, balancing the risk of a widespread shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) with the benefits of early mobility for patients on ECMO. The purpose of this case study is to report the successful rehabilitation of a critically ill patient with COVID-19 undergoing VV ECMO. Methods: This is a case description of a 38-year-old man who presented to the hospital with COVID-19 and subsequent intubation and cannulation for VV ECMO. Physical therapy was initiated while the patient remained critically ill on VV ECMO. Focused coordination and education were employed to limit PPE usage by limiting the number of essential staff/therapists that entered the room as well as changing the frequency of therapy sessions dependent on how the patient was progressing functionally. Results: On VV ECMO day 11, he was able to sit up and perform a sit-to-stand. ECMO decannulation occurred on hospital day 14 with extubation on hospital day 18. The patient progressed functionally while quarantined in the room until he was discharged home with supplemental oxygen after spending 29 days in the hospital. Conclusion: This case study demonstrates the clinical decision-making used to provide physical therapy services for a critically ill patient with COVID-19. High-level team coordination resulted in limiting the use of PPE as well as reducing staff exposure frequency during rehabilitation. Despite his severe critical illness, the patient was successfully discharged home within 30 days.","Andersen, E. M.; Kelly, T. L.; Sharp, A.; Keller-Ross, M. L.; Brunsvold, M.

The Asociación Española de Gastroenterología (AEG) and the Sociedad Española de Endoscopia Digestiva (SEED) have proposed the EPAGE guidelines for managing postponed colonoscopies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the EPAGE guidelines as a management tool compared to the immunologic faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and compared to risk score (RS) that combines age, sex and the iFOBT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and significant bowel disease (SBD). METHODS: A prospective, single-centre study enrolling 743 symptomatic patients referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy. Each order was classified according to the EPAGE guidelines as appropriate, indeterminate or inappropriate. Patients underwent an iFOBT and had their RS calculated. RESULTS: The iFOBT (p<0.001), but not the EPAGE guidelines (p = 0.742), was an independent predictive factor of risk of CRC. The ROC AUCs for the EPAGE guidelines, the iFOBT and the RS were 0.61 (95% CI 0.49-0.75), 0.95 (0.93-0.97) and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for CRC, and 0.55 (0.49-0.61), 0.75 (0.69-0.813) and 0.78 (0.73-0.83) for SBD, respectively. The numbers of colonoscopies needed to detect a case of CRC and a case of SBD were 38 and seven for the EPAGE guidelines, seven and two for the iFOBT, and 19 and four for a RS &#8805;5 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EPAGE guidelines, unlike the iFOBT, is not suitable for screening candidate patients for a diagnostic colonoscopy to detect CRC. The iFOBT, in combination with age and sex, is the most suitable strategy for managing demand for endoscopy in a restricted-access situation.","Rodríguez-Alonso, Lorena; Rodríguez-Moranta, Francisco; Maisterra, Sandra; Botargues, Josep M; Berrozpe, Ana; Ruíz-Cerulla, Alexandra; Suris, Gerard; Camps, Blau; Gornals, Joan B; Guardiola, Jordi",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Sars Cov-2 - ACE2 binding leads to a RAS mediated immune response, which targets especially lungs to form ARDS, which in turn, is the most important cause of mortality in COVID-19. CD8+ T cell response dominates over CD4+ T cell response and natural killer cell dysfunction also leads to CD4+ cell dysfunction in COVID-19; this immune dysregulation leads to inappropriate (ARDS) and inadequate (low or quickly waning antibodies) responses to the disease and unfortunately, prepares the patients for re-infections. The peripheral anergy seen in chronic sarcoidosis has much resemblance to COVID-19; CD8+ T cell accumulation is also responsible for inadequate reaction to tuberculin and antigenic stimulus. This article, based on the similarity of COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, discusses a combination of the therapeutic strategy of the tetanus-diphtheria vaccine and dual RAS inhibition, alongside with hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents, as a solution to overcome the problems described above.","Ozbalci, Demircan",Med Hypotheses,357,26

METHOD: The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. RESULTS: COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%).

The review identified nine xylitol studies with a fair or high quality, four conducted in children and five in adults, all demonstrating a decrease in MS levels in association with habitual consumption of xylitol. The three microbiota studies employing multispecies probe approaches revealed no effects for xylitol on the microbiota. The only erythritol study fulfilling the inclusion criteria showed no consistent effects on MS levels.Conclusions: Xylitol consumption is likely to decrease MS counts but it may not change the overall microbiota.

However, the relationship between being underweight and COVID-19 mortality remains inconclusive. Previous dose-response meta-analyses did not enroll or specifically analyze the underweight population. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and mortality in both obese and underweight patients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until August 12, 2020 using the keywords “COVID-19,” “body mass index,” “obesity,” “overweight”, and “underweight.” Three reviewers independently assessed the relevant articles, including the title, abstract, and full text, to identify eligible studies. We performed a two-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis, including only studies with at least three quantitative classifications for BMI. The nonlinear trend was evaluated using a restricted cubic splines model with three-knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by pooling only those studies which specifically evaluated underweight patients (BMI&amp;lt;18.5 kg/m2). Results: Thirteen studies comprising 25,828 patients were included in the analysis. In the linear model, the mortality of patients with COVID-19 increased by 1.5% for each 1-kg/m2 increase in BMI (pooled relative risk [RR] =1.015, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.004−1.027). However, a significant non-linear relationship between BMI and mortality was observed (Wald test: Pnon-linearity&amp;lt;0.001). We demonstrated a J-shaped curve, indicating that both underweight and obese patients had a higher mortality than those with normal weight. Interestingly, overweight patients (BMI, 25−30 kg/m2) seemed to have the lowest mortality risk. Using a BMI of 15 kg/m2 as the reference, the RRs of mortality decreased with BMI, and this trend continued until BMI of approximately 28 kg/m2 (RR=0.743, 95% CI=0.576−0.959). The relationship between BMI and mortality was then reversed, and an upward trend was observed when BMI exceeded 30 kg/m2;the RRs (95% CI) at BMIs 30, 35, 40, and 45 kg/m2 were 0.745 (0.570−0.974), 0.841 (0.643−1.100), 1.082 (0.850−1.377), and 1.457 (1.129−1.879), respectively. Conclusion: This study is the first dose-response meta-analysis that showed both underweight and obese COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of increased mortality. A J-curve relationship was demonstrated between BMI and COVID-19 mortality.","Bukhari, Khulood Huang Huei-Kai Hung Duan-Pei Peng Carol Chiung-Hui Shih Ming-Chieh Chang Rachel Huai-En Tu Yu-Kang Munir Kashif M.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,357,24

Acute kidney injury has been found prevalent in transplant recipients with COVID-19. In those with severe COVID-19 disease who transfer to an intensive care unit prevalence of acute kidney injury is more than 50%. The pathophysiological mechanisms of kidney involvement and the type of involvement are unclear. Here, we present a 71-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was admitted to our hospital with pulmonary and renal involvement. A kidney allograft biopsy demonstrated diffuse intrarenal hemorrhage, capillary congestion, and severe acute tubular injury. COVID-19 RNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction from lysed allograft tissues, but no findings of acute or chronic cellular or antibody-mediated rejection were detected. This case indicates that COVID-19 may involve the allograft by causing hemorrhage within the renal parenchymal via direct or indirect pathways.","Demir, Mehmet Emin; Merhametsiz, Özgür; Yurttutan Uyar, Neval; Uyar, Murathan; Sevmis, Murat; Sevmis, Sinasi; Aktas, Sema; Hacisalihoglu, Uguray Payam; Baba, Z Füsun",Exp. clin. transplant,357,20

Methods: Between December 2014 and December 2019, 13 patients underwent the reconstruction of soft tissue defects in various sites using the lower trapezius musculocutaneous flap carrying a portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle. There were 10 males and 3 females, with an average age of 52.1 years (range, 29-83 years). Twelve wounds were resulted from resection of various malignant tumor, including 6 cases of head and neck tumors, 5 cases of shoulder and back tumors, 1 case of chest and back tumors. Among the 12 cases, 4 cases were complicated with wound infection and bone exposure, 1 case with skull defect and cerebral dura exposure, and 1 case with wound infection, skull necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. One case was injured in a traffic accident, which resulted in infection wound in the back and shoulder and bone exposure. The sizes of the defect and musculocutaneous flap ranged from 11 cm×7 cm to 23 cm×15 cm and 25 cm×8 cm to 40 cm×14 cm, respectively. According to the spatial relationship between the donor and recipient sites, propeller flaps (8 cases) or percutaneous tunnel island flaps (5 cases) were used to transfer the myocutaneous flap to the recipient area to repair the wound. The donor site was directly closed and sutured in 9 cases, and those with excessive tension were repaired with free skin grafts in 2 cases or transferred flaps in 2 cases. Results: After the operation, necrosis of the distal 4-cm of the musculocutaneous flap occurred in 2 cases. After debridement, the resultant wounds were reconstructed using a local flap and a posterior intercostal artery perforator flap, respectively. The remaining 11 myocutaneous flaps survived completely without arteries and veins crisis. The wounds in the donor and recipient areas healed by first intention. All the patients were followed up 1 to 48 months (mean, 7.4 months). The color and texture of the flap were good. During the follow-up, 1 patient underwent tumor resection again due to tumor recurrence, and 1 patient with a scalp hemangiosarcoma died due to unexplained thoracic hemorrhage. Tumor recurrence was not found in the remaining patients. The musculocutaneous flap coverage was stable and the infection was controlled. Conclusion: The lower trapezius musculocutaneous flap carrying a portion of the latissimus dorsi muscle can be an alternation option to reconstruct refractory wounds with exposure of vital structures and organs and infection.","Xie, Tingjun; Liu, Yuanbo; Han, Tinglu; Zhu, Shan; Zang, Mengqing; Chen, Bo; Li, Shanshan",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,357,32

DESIGN: Qualitative study using constructivist evolved grounded theory (EGT) methodology. One-to-one semistructured interviews were conducted using a general interview guide. Voice over Internet Protocol was used through Skype. SETTING: Conducted between March 2020 and November 2020 in the Welsh Ambulance Services National Health Services Trust UK which serves a population of three million. PARTICIPANTS: Paramedics were recruited through a poster circulated by email and social media. Following purposive sampling, 20 Paramedics were enrolled and interviewed. RESULTS: Emergent categories included: Protect me to protect you, Rapid disruption and adaptation, Trust in communication and information and United in hardship. The Basic Social Process was recognised to involve Tragic Choices, conceptualised through an EGT including Tragic personal and professional choices including concerns over personnel protective equipment (PPE), protecting themselves and their families, impact on mental health and difficult clinical decisions, Tragic organisational choices including decision making support, communication, mental health and well-being and Tragic societal choices involving public shows of support, utilisation and resourcing of health services.

We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&lt; 16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

In this review, we discuss recent studies that point to the crucial role of GM-CSF in the immune response against infections. Upon induction, GM-CSF activates four main signalling networks including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, MAPK, and NF&#954;B pathways. Many of these transduction pathways such as JAK/STAT signal via proteins commonly activated with other antiviral signalling cascades, such as those induced by IFNs. GM-CSF also helps defend against respiratory infections by regulating alveolar macrophage differentiation and enhancing innate immunity in the lungs. Here, we also summarize the numerous clinical trials that have taken advantage of GM-CSF's mechanistic attributes in immunotherapy. Moreover, we discuss how GM-CSF is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and how its activity is interfered with to reduce inflammation such as in the case of COVID-19.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome that results from sepsis ultimately leads to degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx and subsequently increased vascular leakage. Current fluid resuscitation techniques only transiently improve outcomes in sepsis, and can cause edema. Nitric oxide (NO) treatment for sepsis has shown promise in the past, but implementation is difficult due to the challenges associated with delivery and the transient nature of NO. To address this, we tested the anti-inflammatory efficacy of sustained delivery of exogenous NO using i.v. infused NO releasing nanoparticles (NO-np). The impact of NO-np on microhemodynamics and immune response in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxemia mouse model was evaluated. NO-np treatment significantly attenuated the pro-inflammatory response by promoting M2 macrophage repolarization, which reduced the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and slowed vascular extravasation. Combined, this resulted in significantly improved microvascular blood flow and 72-h survival of animals treated with NO-np. The results from this study suggest that sustained supplementation of endogenous NO ameliorates and may prevent the morbidities of acute systemic inflammatory conditions. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator in many acute inflammatory conditions, it is likely that NO enhancement strategies may be useful for the treatment of sepsis and other acute inflammatory insults that trigger severe systemic pro-inflammatory responses and often result in a cytokine storm, as seen in COVID-19.","Williams, Alexander T; Muller, Cynthia R; Govender, Krianthan; Navati, Mahantesh S; Friedman, Adam J; Friedman, Joel M; Cabrales, Pedro",Free Radic Biol Med,357,26

This helps to limit not only the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections but also the morbidity and mortality associated with it. Different strategies for screening of COVID-19 in containment zones and non-containment areas include testing of symptomatic patients and their contacts in fever clinics, hospital-based testing, testing on demand and population-based screening. The choice of tests like reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen testing (RAT) or antibody test depends upon these strategies and also the turnaround time. Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection. This commentary provides the insights and experiences on COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR. The utility of this test is limited by several false positive, false negative and inconclusive results at early stages of infection, scarcity of reagents and lack of well-equipped labs including trained staff. Moreover, appropriate sample collection and transport, standard laboratory protocols, stringent quality control norms, good quality RNA extraction kits, PCR kits with suitable primers can help in improving accuracy of the test results.

METHODS: Following the identification of work outputs in part 1 of the project, relative weighting was assigned to all outputs based on the time intensity and complexity of each task. The number of pharmacists verifying an inpatient medication order each day was selected to represent the labor input. A multivariable linear regression was performed to determine the final work outputs for inclusion in the model. Productivity and productivity index values were calculated for each day from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019. RESULTS: Of the 27 work outputs identified via consensus by the clinical pharmacist working team, 17 work outputs were ultimately included in the productivity model. The average productivity during the period July 2018 through June 2019 was derived from the model and will serve as the baseline productivity for acute care clinical pharmacists.

From the educational perspective, this very practical topic is often taught in a lab environment where many resources can be used, demonstrated, and tested. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many institutions to move the teaching activities from onsite to online, while accesses to laboratories became very limited. For theoretical learnings, this transition can be done without experiencing significant issues. However, for practical learnings, several challenges emerge. In this study, we present the transition process from onsite to online of a Design for Robot Assembly workshop and the adaptations to accomplish all practical learnings. The objective is to demonstrate a student-centred approach to learning that is adaptable for an online teaching context. An innovative method of designing and running an online workshop that does not require access to lab facilities is introduced. Furthermore, we summarize the challenges from workshop preparation to the post-workshop discussion. Based on these experiences, we provide suggestions and a guideline for best practices of running an online Design for Robot Assembly workshop, which can also be used for regular online teaching to promote a more practical experience. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

The SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is also evidence of transmission through aerosols and digestive tracts. Because orthodontic treatment involves a large population who need routine return-visits, it was significantly affected and suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of the dental clinics and hospitals. Although the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China, and many areas have gradually resumed work and classes, orthodontic participants are still under high risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or patients in the incubation period may cause the cross-infection between orthodontic practitioners and patients. The close proximity between the practitioners and the patients, and the generation of droplets and aerosols that contain saliva and blood during treatment further increase the risks of transmission. In this article, we summarized the preventive strategies for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to protect both staff and patients during the orthodontic practice.","Guo, Yongwen; Jing, Yan; Wang, Yunshi; To, Aileen; Du, Shufang; Wang, Liuzheng; Bai, Ding",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,357,26

While contact tracing and case investigation have been carefully designed to protect privacy, the huge volume of tracing which is being carried out as part of the pandemic response in the United States is highlighting potential concerns around privacy, legality, and equity. Contact tracing during the pandemic has gained particular attention for the new use of digital technologies-both on the consumer side in the form of Exposure Notification applications, and for public health agencies as digital case management software systems enable massive scaling of operations. While the consumer application side of digital innovation has dominated the news and academic discourse around privacy, people are likely to interact more intensively with public health agencies and their use of digital case management systems. Effective use of digital case management for contact tracing requires revisiting the existing legal frameworks, privacy protections, and security practices for management of sensitive health data. The scale of these tools and demands of an unprecedented pandemic response are introducing new risks through the collection of huge volumes of data, and expanding requirements for more adept data sharing among jurisdictions. Public health agencies must strengthen their best practices for data collection and protection even in the absence of comprehensive or clear guidance. This requires navigating a difficult balance between rigorous data protection and remaining highly adaptive and agile.","Wacksman, Jeremy",Ethics Inf Technol,357,20

Common issues that were raised with the use of telemedicine included difficulty in procuring physical laboratory results and a lack of personal warmth during telemedicine visits.

Objective: To assess the impact on infant mortality due to a decrease in the prevalence of breastfeeding during 2020 due to physical isolation due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Colombia Materials and methods: The population attributable risk approach was used, taking into account the prevalence of BF and its potential decrease associated with measures of physical isolation and the relative risk (RR) of the association between EBF and the occurrence of acute infections consequences in the growth (weight for height) of children under the age of five through a mathematical modeling program. Results: There is an increase of 11.39% in the number of cases with growth arrest in the age group of 6 to 11 months with a 50% decrease in breastfeeding prevalence;an increase in the number of cases of diarrhea between 1 and 5 months of age up from 5% (5.67%);and an increase in the number of deaths in children under 5 years (9.04%) with a 50% decrease in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusions: The lower prevalence of breastfeeding has an impact on infant morbidity and mortality in the short and medium -term.

Neuroimaging studies of reward-modulated inhibitory control can identify potential objective markers of impairment and may deepen our understanding of why probands engage in costly behaviors leading to adverse outcomes. The study aimed to identify reward-modulated inhibitory control neural circuitries, their association with ADHD symptoms, and real-world implications of a decreased capacity to engage in reward-modulated inhibitory control. METHODS: A total of 106 adults (90% male) with rigorous childhood diagnoses of ADHD were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Monetary Incentive Go/NoGo task. Adulthood symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity based on self- and informant report were assessed. The number of lifetime attempts taken to quit smoking were also assessed as an exemplar real-world outcome. RESULTS: Hyperactivity/impulsivity was negatively associated with activation in the pallidum and primary motor cortex when inhibiting a previously rewarded Go stimulus that yielded a small immediate reward in order to obtain a larger reward later on. Reduced recruitment of the pallidal-thalamic-motor circuit mediated the negative association between hyperactivity/impulsivity and reward-modulated inhibitory control accuracy. Reduced pallidum activation, in response to reward-modulated inhibitory control, was also associated with more attempts made to successfully quit smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Probands with persistent hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms have alterations in brain regions that calculate the value of inhibiting an action that yields an immediate reward in order to obtain delayed larger rewards. This deficit results in poor inhibitory control on basic tasks and during real-world behaviors that rely on similar processes.","Jones, Neil P; Versace, Amelia; Lindstrom, Rachel; Wilson, Tracey K; Gnagy, Elizabeth M; Pelham, William E; Molina, Brooke S G; Ladouceur, Cecile D",Biol.

Consequently, improved therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a newly potential therapy that can recognize specific surface antigen without major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive candidate antigen as it is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis and survival in CCA. We, therefore, set forth to create the fourth-generation CAR (CAR4) construct containing anti-MUC1-single-chain variable fragment (scFv) and three co-stimulatory domains (CD28, CD137, and CD27) linked to CD3Î¶ and evaluate anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells in CCA models. Compared to untransduced T cells, anti-MUC1-CAR4 T cells produced increased levels of TNF-&#945;, IFN-Î³ and granzyme B when exposed to MUC1-expressing KKU-100 and KKU-213A CCA cells (all p < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid given to the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized control trial. Adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to the general ward were randomly assigned to either receive methylprednisolone or not for 7 days. The primary end point was the incidence of clinical deterioration 14 days after randomization. RESULTS: We terminated this trial early because the number of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in all the centers decreased in late March. Finally, a total of 86 COVID-19 patients underwent randomization. There was no difference of the incidence of clinical deterioration between the methylprednisolone group and control group (4.8 vs. 4.8%, p = 1.000). The duration of throat viral RNA detectability in the methylprednisolone group was 11 days (interquartile range, 6-16 days), which was significantly longer than that in the control group (8 days [2-12 days], p = 0.030). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in other secondary outcomes. Mass cytometry discovered CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells in the methylprednisolone group which were significantly lower than those in the control group after randomization (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: From this prematurely closed trial, we found that the short-term early use of corticosteroid could suppress the immune cells, which may prolong severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

It is important to understand the law of public sentiment dissemination and use it in a timely and appropriate way. Using the big data of online public sentiment during the COVID-19 period, this paper analyzes and establishes a cross-validation based public sentiment system dynamics model which can simulate the evolution processes of public sentiment under the effects of individual behaviors and governmental guidance measures. A concrete case of a violation of relevant regulations during COVID-19 epidemic that sparked public sentiment in China is introduced as a study sample to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. By running the model, the results show that an increase in government responsiveness contributes to the spread of positive social sentiment but also promotes negative sentiment. Positive individual behavior suppresses negative emotions while promoting the spread of positive emotions. Changes in the disaster context (epidemic) have an impact on the spread of sentiment, but the effect is mediocre.","Huang, Hainan; Chen, Weifan; Xie, Tian; Wei, Yaoyao; Feng, Ziqing; Wu, Weijiong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),357,16

A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) originating from Wuhan, China in November 2019 spread globally. Unfortunately, Diamond Princess is the first cruise ship on board to have an outbreak of COVID-19 with 3711 passengers and crew members. It began from Yokohama on January 20, 2020, and was supposed to return to Yokohama on February 3 2020. An 80-year-old male passenger, who debarked in Hong Kong on January 25 2020, tested positive for COVID-19 on February 1. Diamond Princess was immediately ordered to stay in the ocean and follow quarantine measures near Yokohama from February 3 onwards. Several other cruise ships such as the Grand Princess, MS Wester-dam, Zaandam, etc. had COVID-19 outbreaks onboard. The failure to isolate the crew at the very beginning of quarantine resulted in further transmission of the virus to the passengers and crew. In conclusion, the compact conditions in the cruise ships with high population density amplified the transmission of COVID-19, mainly driven by contact rate and mixing effects.","Sahu, Arti; Naqvi, Waqar M.",Int.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of the ADD patients diagnosed by clinical symptoms and MRI findings of TMJ in the Department of Stomatology, General Hospital of Chinese PLA from January 2018 to December 2019. A total of 111 ADD patients [33 males and 78 females, aged(31.0±10.9) years old] were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had CSP: non-CSP group (n=40) and CSP group (n=71). The clinical symptoms and types of ADD were observed and recorded. According to the specific side of CSP in the CSP group, the patients were further divided into the ipsilateral side and the contralateral side of CSP. The pain, TMJ sounds and the ADD types were also observed. Chi square test was used to compare the pain, TMJ sounds, limited mouth opening and ADD types of the two groups. Binary Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between CSP and clinical symptoms and ADD characteristics. Results: The incidence of pain in the CSP group [89% (63/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [70% (28/40)] (P<0.05). In CSP patients, the incidences of pain and joint sounds on the ipsilateral side of CSP were significantly higher than that on the contralateral side (P<0.05). MRI showed that the incidence of bilateral ADD in the CSP group [58%(41/71)] was significantly higher than that in the non-CSP group [37%(15/40)] (P<0.05).There were significant differences in the incidences of no disc displacement (DD), anterior disk displacement with reduction(ADDwR) and anterior disk displacement without reduction (ADDwoR) between ipsilateral and contralateral joints of the CSP patients (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidences of no DD, ADDwR and ADDwoR between left and right joints of the non-CSP patients (P>0.05). The incidence of ADDwoR in ipsilateral side of the CSP patients was significantly higher than that in contralateral side (P<0.05). Pain (OR=3.375) and the side of disc displacement (OR=2.278) in patients with ADD were positively correlated with CSP (P<0.05). Conclusions: The clinical symptoms and types of disc displacement between patients with and without CSP were significantly different. The incidences of pain and bilateral disc displacement in the CSP group were significantly higher than those in the non-CSP group. In addition, the incidences of pain, TMJ sounds and anterior disk displacement without reduction on the ipsilateral side of patients with CSP were significantly higher than those on the contralateral side. The pain symptoms and side of disc displacement were positively related to CSP.","Huang, D Z; Zhang, Q; Zhai, X T; Wang, Y; Liu, G; Hu, M; Liu, H C; Jiang, H",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,357,5

Two model lungs were ventilated with one ventilator to i) test the adequacy of individual tidal volumes via capnography, ii) assess cross-breathing between lungs, and iii) offer a simulation-based algorithm for ensuring equal tidal volumes. Ventilation asymmetry was induced by placing rubber band around one model lung, and the uneven distribution of tidal volumes (VT) was counterbalanced by elevating airflow resistance (HR) contralaterally. VT, end-tidal CO2 concentration (ETCO2), and peak inspiratory pressure (Ppi) were measured. Unilateral LC reduced VT and elevated ETCO2 on the affected side. Under HR, VT and ETCO2 were re-equilibrated. In conclusion, capnography serves as simple, bedside method for controlling the adequacy of split ventilation in each patient. No collateral gas flow was observed between the two lungs with different time constants. Ventilator sharing may play a role in emergency situations.","Korsós, Anita; Peták, Ferenc; Südy, Roberta; Schranc, Álmos; Fodor, Gergely H; Babik, Barna",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,357,33

AIM: To explore how general practitioners (GPs) experienced discussing values, goals and preferences with patients during COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative research in general practice. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews for which Dutch GPs were recruited via purposive sampling. Content analysis was used. RESULTS: Fifteen GPs were interviewed. Six themes were identified: (i) urge of advance care planning, (ii) the GP's perceived role in it, (iii) preparations for it, (iv) (proactively) discussing it, (v) essentials for good communication and (vi) advance care planning in the (near) future. Calls for proactively discussing advance care planning in the media and in COVID-guidelines caused awareness of it's importance. GPs envisaged an important role for themselves in initiating it, especially with patients at risk to deteriorate or die from COVID-19. Timing advance care planning appeared difficult but crucial. The recommended digital way of communication was considered problematic due to missing nonverbal communication and difficulties in involving relatives. It was noted that admission to the ICU, which was hardly discussed before the COVID-19 pandemic, should remain a topic during advance care planning. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic brought advance care planning into a new light, GPs were more experienced with discussing it and patients were more aware of their frailty. Because of the nearing 'grey wave', advance care planning should remain top priority. Therefore, it should be central in GP and post-academic training.","Dujardin, Janneke; Schuurmans, Jaap; Westerduin, Dieke; Wichmann, Anne B; Engels, Yvonne",Palliat Med,357,26

We discuss the practical and technical aspects of preparation for a remote conversation and review some differences, limitations, and advantages of these discussions. The greatest challenge with the medium is the loss of the ability to read and display nonverbal cues. Vigilant attention to proven communication strategies and solicitation of patient involvement with the discussion can allow the care provider to display empathy at a distance.

Our aim was to gain insight into the lived experience of clinicians who worked in ICUs during the surge. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured, in-depth interviews. SETTING: Clinicians who worked in three ICUs in Paris (France) during the peak of the pandemic (April and May 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven ICU clinicians (12 physicians, 11 nurses, three nursing assistants, and one respiratory therapist). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Six themes emerged: coping with initial disorganization and creating new routines, the intensification of professional relationships and the development of unexpected collaborations, losing one's reference points and recreating meaningful interactions with patients, working under new constraints and developing novel interactions with family members, compensating for the absence of family members and rituals at the end of life, and the full engagement of ICU clinicians during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Among ICU clinicians, there was a sense of total professional engagement during the surge. Caring for critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients was fraught with challenges and generated a strong feeling of responsibility, as clinicians felt they had to compensate for the absence of family members. Rethinking policies about family visits and safeguarding positive relationships among colleagues are two important priorities for future healthcare crises.","Kentish-Barnes, Nancy; Morin, Lucas; Cohen-Solal, Zoé; Cariou, Alain; Demoule, Alexandre; Azoulay, Elie",Crit. care med,357,16

Consequently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Given the rising concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries sent people into lockdown and advised precautionary measures like social distancing, handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Many countries realised that lockdown is the only solution to stop the spread of this dangerous disease. In many countries, the government and the health care professionals working day and night to identify infected people, test, and quarantine those showing symptoms of COVID-19. Government agencies and health care workers in many countries are also advising people to keep a social distance of at least six feet from person to person and sanitise their hands if they touch anything coming from outside the home, and certainly before touching their faces.

METHODS: The study was conducted at Canakkale University Hospital in Turkey. Included in the study were 82 non-metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes were followed-up after primary treatment, but suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. FCR, SWB and psychological resilience were assessed using the fear of cancer recurrence inventory-short form (FCRI-SF), SWB scale and the brief resilience scale (BRS), respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of breast cancer survivors concerning FCR, SWB, and psychological resilience were 17.77±5.38, 36.20±6.21 and 20.01±4.51, respectively. A significant negative correlation was noted between the scores of FCR and SWB and psychological resilience (r=-0.329, p<0.001 and r=-0.316, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, a significantly positive correlation was identified between psychological resilience and SWB (r=0.501, p=0.003). A hierarchical linear regression analysis with FCRI-SF as the dependent variable, and SWB and BRS as explanatory variables, indicated that SWB affects FCRI-SF scores and is a potential predictor of FCR. A mediation analysis revealed that SWB partially mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and FCR. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors with high SWB and psychological resilience scores experience less FCR, despite their failure to maintain the medical follow-up due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Consequently, it spreads across the globe and is affecting wellbeing frameworks and the global economy. This pandemic disease places a heavy burden on governments in general, so individuals must adhere to WHO's instructions to limit its spread. The current study was applied to find out the extent of commitment among the Iraqi people to the standards of prevention measures against the coronavirus. Materials and Methods A cross sectional study was conducted with 1153 respondents widely in all governorates of Iraq to identify the commitment of the Iraqis to the preventive measures against COVID-19 in Iraq. This study covered the Iraqis in three main regions (Southern, middle, and Northern) for data collection. It was conducted between the 17th and 25th of March 2020, and Iraqis were administered with a structured questionnaire comprising of three domains. Results The results showed that the majority of the respondents (52%) were female, and most of them (42.3%) were observed between the age group of 31-40 years.

Not every suspected case undergoes testing, because testing kits and other equipment are limited in many parts of the world. Yet populations increasingly use the internet to manage both home and work life during the pandemic, giving researchers mediated connections to millions of people sheltering in place. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an online news platform to recruit volunteers willing to report COVID-19-like symptoms and behaviors. METHODS: An online epidemiologic survey captured COVID-19-related symptoms and behaviors from individuals recruited through banner ads offered through Microsoft News. Respondents indicated whether they were experiencing symptoms, whether they received COVID-19 testing, and whether they traveled outside of their local area. RESULTS: A total of 87,322 respondents completed the survey across a 3-week span at the end of April 2020, with 54.3% of the responses from the United States and 32.0% from Japan. Of the total respondents, 19,631 (22.3%) reported at least one symptom associated with COVID-19. Nearly two-fifths of these respondents (39.1%) reported more than one COVID-19-like symptom. Individuals who reported being tested for COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report symptoms (47.7% vs 21.5%; P<.001). Symptom reporting rates positively correlated with per capita COVID-19 testing rates (R2=0.26; P<.001). Respondents were geographically diverse, with all states and most ZIP Codes represented. More than half of the respondents from both countries were older than 50 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: News platforms can be used to quickly recruit study participants, enabling collection of infectious disease symptoms at scale and with populations that are older than those found through social media platforms. Such platforms could enable epidemiologists and researchers to quickly assess trends in emerging infections potentially before at-risk populations present to clinics and hospitals for testing and/or treatment.","Dixon, Brian E; Mukherjee, Sumit; Wiensch, Ashley; Gray, Mary L; Ferres, Juan M Lavista; Grannis, Shaun J",J Med Internet Res,357,0

These restrictions directly impacted College Park Academy (CPA), a public charter middle and high school in Prince George's County, MD that typically follows a hybrid approach to in-person and online instruction. The purpose of this qualitative study was to review CPA's transition to full online distance learning during emergency remote teaching. The research worked to establish a snapshot of the school's underlying structure and disaster preparedness strategies before evaluating the perceived viability of the online model and its effects on students, teachers, parents, and educational administrators. The researchers conducted interviews, as well as document analysis and online classroom observations. The findings reveal that despite strong infrastructure and communications during the transition, there remained issues with school readiness, including the maintenance of academic rigor and social emotional wellbeing. Overall, recommendations are made as to how the school would benefit from a shift in its approach to technology-enhanced learning, including the need for digital tools that better facilitate wellness checks, provide human touchpoints, and target collaborative, student-centered pedagogy. These lessons learned are relevant for other school administrators to consider as society continues to adapt to a new era of virtual learning during times of crisis.","Williams, Kate Maloney; Corwith, Anne",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),357,1

We explore human mobility patterns as a measure of behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that risk-taking attitude is a critical factor in predicting reduction in human mobility and increase social confinement around the globe. We find that the sharp decline in movement after the WHO (World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic can be attributed to risk attitudes. Our results suggest that regions with risk-averse attitudes are more likely to adjust their behavioral activity in response to the declaration of a pandemic even before most official government lockdowns.

Even though empirical approaches that try to quantify economic narratives are getting increasingly popular, there is no theory or even a universally accepted definition of economic narratives underlying this research. First, we review and categorize the economic literature concerned with narratives and work out the different paradigms that are at play. Only a subset of the literature considers narratives to be active drivers of economic activity. In order to solidify the foundation of narrative economics, we propose a definition of collective economic narratives, isolating five important characteristics. We argue that, for a narrative to be economically relevant, it must be a sense-making story that emerges in a social context and suggests action to a social group. We also systematize how a collective economic narrative differs from a topic and from other kinds of narratives that are likely to have less impact on the economy. With regard to the popular use of topic modeling as an empirical strategy, we suggest that the complementary use of other canonical methods from the natural language processing toolkit and the development of new methods is inevitable to go beyond identifying topics and be able to move towards true empirical narrative economics.","Roos, Michael; Reccius, Matthias",,357,16

The study also assessed whether acceptance coping moderates the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake, and examined the associations between trait disinhibition, perceived stress and changes to HED food intake. An online survey completed by 124 adults living in Victoria, Australia (total eligible n = 147; 38.5 ± 12.9 years) during the COVID-19 lockdown showed that 49% of participants reported increased overall food intake, and 21-29% reported increased intake of HED sweet and savoury foods during the COVID-19 lockdown. Of the eating behaviour traits assessed, low craving control was the only significant predictor of increased HED sweet and savoury food intake (cognitive restraint, disinhibition and emotional eating were non-significant predictors). Perceived stress was associated with reported increases in overall savoury and sweet snack intake, but was not significantly associated with changes to specific HED food groups (sweet and savoury). In this sample, acceptance coping did not significantly moderate the relationship between craving control and increased HED food intake. Based on these replicated findings, further trials should now consider interventions targeting craving control to promote controlled food intake in individuals at-risk of weight gain during the current COVID-19 and future potential lockdowns.","Buckland, Nicola J; Kemps, Eva",Appetite,357,20

The objective was to evaluate the implementation of a tele-consultation program in an adult population with RA Methods: Analytical observational study longitudinal cohort (Clinical trials NCT04768413) that evaluated the effectiveness of a tele consultation model compared with a face-to-face consultation model in adult RA patients. Patients were followed 12 weeks (Jul-Oct 2020) at an RA center of excellence in Colombia. Simple random sampling was done. Two groups were included: Group A, patients who were cared for by tele-consultation care and Group B, thosewho wished to continue with the usual face-to-face consultation. Data regarding activity of disease (Week 0,6,12) [Patient Activity Scale (PAS) in both groups and DAS28 in group B], and Quality of life [EQ-5D-3L], disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], therapeutic adherence [Morisky-Green Adherence Scale (MGLS)] and self-care capacity [Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale -Revised (ASA-R)] were evaluated (weeks 0-12). Outcomes regarding COVID-19 were evaluated. Bivariate analysis was done (StataV-13;P-value<0.05). Results: 218 adults were included: (109/Group A-109/Group B). The groups did not differ in general characteristics (Table). Group A: (n = 71), no statistically significant differences were observed in the median scores of VAS global, VAS pain, PAS, HAQ, EQ-5D and ASA-R while increase in adherence was demonstrated (MGLS, without statistical significance). Group B: (n = 18), a significant increase in adherence (MGLS, p = 0,019) and in self-care (ASA-R, p = 0,0077) were found, no other differences were found (including DAS-28).

Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. METHODS: Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020.In 2020, SR (suicides per 100 000 LY) were lower in periods with severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.2, &#967;2 = 4.033, p = 0.045) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 16.8). A comparison with previous years showed that this difference was caused by unusually high SR before the imposition of restrictions, while SR during the pandemic were within the trend corridor of previous years (expected suicides = 32.3, observed suicides = 35; IRR = 1.084, p = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: SR during COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the trend in previous years. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is urgently needed.

Here, we develop and analyze a mathematical model to assess the impact of early diagnosis of pre-symptomatic individuals on the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease in West Africa in scenarios where Ebola may remain at low levels in the population. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing integrated control measures of early diagnosis and isolation. The mathematical analysis shows a threshold where early diagnosis of pre-symptomatic individuals, combined with a sufficient level of effective isolation, can lead to an epidemic control of Ebola virus disease. That is, the local erradication of the disease or the effective management of the disease at low levels of endemicity.","Chowell, Diego; Safan, Muntaser; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos",,357,16

Since de novo compound design is an extremely long, time-consuming, and expensive process, efforts are underway to discover existing compounds that can be repurposed for COVID-19 and new viral diseases. MODEL: We propose a machine learning representation framework that uses deep learning induced vector embeddings of compounds and viral proteins as features to predict compound-viral protein activity. The prediction model in-turn uses a consensus framework to rank approved compounds against viral proteins of interest. RESULTS: Our consensus framework achieves a highmean Pearson correlation of 0.916, mean R2 of 0.840 and a low mean squared error of 0.313 for the task of compound-viral protein activity prediction on an independent test set. As a use case, we identify a ranked list of 47 compounds common to three main proteins of SARS-COV-2 virus (PL-PRO, 3CL-PRO and Spike protein) as potential targets including 21 antivirals, 15 anticancer, 5 antibiotics and 6 other investigationalhuman compounds.We performadditional molecular docking simulations to demonstrate thatmajority of these compounds have low binding energies and thus high binding affinity with the potential to be effective against the SARS-COV-2 virus.

One important question is whether healthcare workers (HCWs) should receive priority access to a vaccine in the event that an effective vaccine becomes available. This question is especially relevant in the coronavirus pandemic with governments and health authorities currently facing questions of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. MAIN TEXT: In this article, we critically evaluate the most common ethical arguments for granting healthcare workers priority access to a vaccine. We review the existing literature on this topic, and analyse both deontological and utilitarian arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. For illustrative purposes, we focus in particular on the distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine. We also explore some practical complexities attendant on arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that there are deontological and utilitarian cases for prioritising HCWs. Indeed, the widely held view that we should prioritise HCWs represents an example of ethical convergence. Complexities arise, however, when considering who should be included in the category of HCW, and who else should receive priority in addition to HCWs.","Symons, Xavier; Matthews, Steve; Tobin, Bernadette",BMC Med Ethics,357,20

METHODS: Between November 2006 and November 2009, 41 patients with a mean age of 69.6 years (range 51-86) underwent 51 bicompartmental knee arthroplasties with the Journey-Deuce knee prosthesis. All patients presented with symptomatic medial and patellofemoral compartment osteoarthritis, with intact cruciate ligaments and a preserved lateral compartment on plain radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Clinical assessment was undertaken pre-surgery and at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years post-surgery using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EuroQol Group 5-Dimension self-reported questionnaire (EQ-5D) and maximal active range of motion (ROM). RESULTS: 30 patients (37 knees) were followed-up at a mean time of 11.4 years (SD 1.1; range 10.5-14.0). Eight patients (ten knees) were deceased and three could not be contacted at final review. No major component revision was performed. Pre-operative OKS 25.4 (SD 5.2; range 15-40), knee flexion 116.4° (SD 10.3°; range 100°-140°) and EQ-5D 70.5 (SD 19.9; range 25-95). 10-year OKS 43.5 (SD 4.1; range 32-48), knee flexion 127.3° (SD 11.1°; range 105°-144°) and EQ-5D 77.4 (SD 9.3; range 60-100). The OKS (p < 0.0001), EQ-5D (p = 0.024) and active knee flexion ROM (p < 0.0001) all significantly improved from pre-surgery to 1-year post-surgery, with no further significant changes in these scores between any post-operative time period up until 10 years. 32% (7/22) of tibial and 45% (10/22) of femoral components showed progressive radiolucencies between 2 and 5-year and 10-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest cohort of patients having undergone BCKA (with the Journey-Deuce prosthesis) with longest follow-up described in the literature. At 10 years, patients presented with significantly improved clinical outcomes, comparable to other surgical arthroplasty options. No major component revision was performed. Progressive radiolucencies were noted in 32% of tibial and 45% of femoral components without corresponding clinical signs of loosening.

The critical challenge is the rapid detection of Coronavirus infected people. The available techniques being utilized are body-temperature measurement, along with anterior nasal swab analysis. However, taking nasal swabs and lab testing are complex, intrusive, and require many resources. Furthermore, the lack of test kits to meet the exceeding cases is also a major limitation. The current challenge is to develop some technology to non-intrusively detect the suspected Coronavirus patients through Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL). Another challenge to conduct the research on this area is the difficulty of obtaining the dataset due to a limited number of patients giving their consent to participate in the research study. Looking at the efficacy of AI in healthcare systems, it is a great challenge for the researchers to develop an AI algorithm that can help health professionals and government officials automatically identify and isolate people with Coronavirus symptoms. Hence, this paper proposes a novel method CoVIRNet (COVID Inception-ResNet model), which utilizes the chest X-rays to diagnose the COVID-19 patients automatically. The proposed algorithm has different inception residual blocks that cater to information by using different depths feature maps at different scales, with the various layers. The features are concatenated at each proposed classification block, using the average-pooling layer, and concatenated features are passed to the fully connected layer. The efficient proposed deep-learning blocks used different regularization techniques to minimize the overfitting due to the small COVID-19 dataset. The multiscale features are extracted at different levels of the proposed deep-learning model and then embedded into various machine-learning models to validate the combination of deep-learning and machine-learning models. The proposed CoVIR-Net model achieved 95.7% accuracy, and the CoVIR-Net feature extractor with random-forest classifier produced 97.29% accuracy, which is the highest, as compared to existing state-of-the-art deep-learning methods. The proposed model would be an automatic solution for the assessment and classification of COVID-19. We predict that the proposed method will demonstrate an outstanding performance as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques being used currently.","Almalki, Y.

However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can affect spermatogenic function long-term remains to be evaluated.","Best, Jordan C; Kuchakulla, Manish; Khodamoradi, Kajal; Lima, Thiago Fernandes Negris; Frech, Fabio Stefano; Achua, Justin; Rosete, Omar; Mora, Belén; Arora, Himanshu; Ibrahim, Emad; Ramasamy, Ranjith",World J Mens Health,357,1

Systemic involvement in COVID-19 is due to the ubiquitous expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, responsible for the entry in the cells of SARS-CoV-2, Several reports in humans and animal models showed a significant ACE2 mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary cells. Moreover, higher mortality and poorer outcomes have been widely described in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetes and vertebral fractures, which are all highly prevalent in subjects with pituitary dysfunctions. AIM: To review the main endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 with their possible implications for pituitary diseases, the possible direct and indirect involvement of the pituitary gland in COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of established pituitary diseases which can be already at increased risk for worse outcomes and on neurosurgical activities as well as vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underlines that there could be a specific involvement of the pituitary gland which fits into a progressively shaping endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. Moreover, the care for pituitary diseases need to continue despite the restrictions due to the emergency. Several pituitary diseases, such as hypopituitarism and Cushing disease, or due to frequent comorbidities such as diabetes may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in affected patients. There is the urgent need to collect in international multicentric efforts data on all these aspects of the pituitary involvement in the pandemic in order to issue evidence driven recommendations for the management of pituitary patients in the persistent COVID-19 emergency.","Frara, Stefano; Allora, Agnese; Castellino, Laura; di Filippo, Luigi; Loli, Paola; Giustina, Andrea",Pituitary,357,23

Here, we developed a trimeric form of the RBD and show that it induces a potent neutralizing antibody response against live virus with diverse effector functions and provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice and rhesus macaques. The trimeric form induces higher neutralizing antibody titer compared to monomer with as low as 1µg antigen dose. In mice, adjuvanting the protein with a TLR7/8 agonist formulation alum-3M-052 induces 100-fold higher neutralizing antibody titer and superior protection from infection compared to alum.

MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. METHODS: A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. RESULTS: Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.5±8.3y, mean education of 13.3±4.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19-2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09-6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93-5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06-0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17-0.81). DISCUSSION: MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD. Community dementia screening programs can increase MCI/ADRD detection and improve patient-centered outcomes and medical decision-making.","Galvin, James E; Tolea, Magdalena I; Chrisphonte, Stephanie",PLoS One,357,10

METHODS: This study undertook a cross-sectional design to survey a convenience sample of 681 residents of North London on their social distancing (SD) behaviours, demographics, housing situation, politics, psychology and social support using an online questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to measure the associations between these explanatory factors and non-adherence to all SD rules and intentional non-adherence to SD rules. RESULTS: The vast majority (92.8%) of participants did not adhere to all SD rules and nearly half (48.6%) engaged in intentional non-adherence of rules. The odds of not adhering to all SD rules increased if a participant was not identified as highly vulnerable to COVID-19 [OR = 4.5], had lower control over others' distancing [OR = .724], had lower control over responsibilities for which coming into contact with others was unavoidable [OR = .642], and if SD behaviours were reported after lockdown was first relaxed [OR = .261]. The odds of intentionally not adhering to SD rules increased if a participant had a lower intention to socially distance [OR = .468], had lower control over others' distancing [OR = .829], had a doctoral degree compared to a master's degree [OR = .332], a professional qualification [OR = .307], a bachelor's degree [OR = .361] or work-related qualification [OR = .174], voted for the UK Government compared to not voting for the Government [OR = .461], perceived higher normative pressure from neighbours [OR = 1.121] and had greater support from friends [OR = 1.465]. CONCLUSIONS: Non-adherence to all SD rules had a stronger association with vulnerability to COVID-19 and control over SD, whereas intentional non-adherence had a stronger association with intention and anti-social psychological factors. It is recommended that people living in high-risk environments, such as those living in houses of multiple occupancy, should be specially supported when asked to stay at home, and public health messaging should emphasise shared responsibility and public consciousness.","Hills, Stephen; Eraso, Yolanda",BMC Public Health,357,20

However, in some cases, moderate and severe symptoms have been observed with pneumonia. Many companies are developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates using different technologies that are classified into four groups (intact target viruses, proteins, viral vectors and nucleic acids). For rapid development, RNA vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines have been urgently approved, and their injection has already started across the world. These types of vaccine technologies have been developed over more than 20 years using translational research for use against cancer or diseases caused by genetic disorders but the COVID-19 vaccines are the first licensed drugs to prevent infectious diseases using RNA vaccine technology. Although these vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 for a short period, safety and efficiency evaluations should be continuously monitored over a long time period.

Although some evidence has indicated the prognostic values of thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia, there are conflicting results concerning the leukocyte and monocyte count. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective Double Centre study, we reviewed the results of WBC and monocyte counts of 1320 COVID-19 patients (243 of whom (18.4%) had severe disease) both on admission and within a 7-day follow-up. Results: We found that both the number of monocytes and the percentage of monocytosis were higher in the severe group;however, it was not statistically significant. On the other hand, we found that not only the mean number of WBCs was significantly higher in the severe cases also leukocytosis was a common finding in this group;indicating that an increased number of WBC may probably predict a poor prognosis. Also, the monocyte count was not affected by age;however, univariate analysis showed that the percentage of leukocytosis was significantly greater in the older group (>50) with an odds ratio of 1.71 (P: 0.003). Conclusion: Alteration of monocytes either on admission or within hospitalization would not provide valuable data about the prediction of COVID-19 prognosis. Although the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 is the major limitation of the present study, further investigations in the field of laboratory biomarkers will pave the way to manage patients with severe disease better.","Pirsalehi, A.; Salari, S.; Baghestani, A.; Sanadgol, G.; Shirini, D.; Baerz, M.

Previous studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid could be detected in the feces of patients even after smearnegative respiratory samples. However, demonstration of confirmed fecal-oral transmission has been difficult. Clinical studies have shown an incidence rate of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms ranging from 2% to 79.1% in patients with COVID-19. They may precede or accompany respiratory symptoms. The most common GI symptoms included nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In addition, some patients also had liver injury, pancreatic damage, and even acute mesenteric ischemia/thrombosis. Although the incidence rates reported in different centers were quite different, the digestive system was the clinical component of the COVID-19 section. Studies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was not only expressed in the lungs, but also in the upper esophagus, small intestine, liver, and colon. The possible mechanism of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients may include direct viral invasion into target cells, dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, immune-mediated tissue injury, and gut dysbiosis caused by microbiota. Additionally, numerous experiences, guidelines, recommendations, and position statements were published or released by different organizations and societies worldwide to optimize the management practice of outpatients, inpatients, and endoscopy in the era of COVID-19.

Thus, pharmaceutical distributors are regularly assessed by qualified experts. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a suspension of normal activities, remote assessments via videoconferencing may represent a temporary alternative to on-site audits. We exploratorily evaluated the feasibility of remote assessments of pharmaceutical distributors, located in a low- or middle-income country hard-to reach during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted pilot remote assessments of four conveniently selected distributors. The expert was remotely connected via videoconference, and supported by an in-country assessment facilitator (ICAF), who had received ad hoc training and was present at the assessed facility. First, the remote expert assessed the quality assurance (QA) activities and rated their compliance with the standards of the World Health Organization Good Storage & Distribution Practices (GSDP), as per routine practice. Second, s/he assessed the completeness, clarity and accuracy of data collected remotely, first per distributor, and then in aggregated form. RESULTS: Data completeness was assessed by the expert as excellent, while clarity and accuracy were good. Overall data quality (a combination of completeness, clarity and accuracy) was good, with no major differences across QA activities, nor across distributors. Contextual limitations included poor internet connection, language barriers, and distributors' lack of familiarity with QA terminology. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are exploratory and cannot be extrapolated to other contexts, nor to other types of audits. Nonetheless, this pilot experience suggests that a well-planned remote assessment of pharmaceutical distributors, conducted with the support of a well-trained onsite ICAF, can provide data of acceptable quality, allowing to assess GSDP-compliance and to make temporary decisions about licensing or purchasing. Purchasers and policy makers should read the results of remote assessments in light of their intrinsic limitations. At the moment, onsite assessments remain the gold standards, but this could change in the longer term, with improved information technology and in light of the need to avoid unnecessary travels. Furthermore, remote assessments could be considered for routine pre-screening candidates for on-site assessments, and for targeted follow-up of on-site assessment.","Bourasseau, A.; Lavergne, L.; Ravinetto, R.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy &amp; Practice,357,1

Therefore, predicting the patterns of droplet spreading in public transport environment is of primary importance. This paper puts forward a novel computational and artificial intelligence (AI) framework for fast prediction of the spread of droplets produced by a sneezing passenger in a bus. The formation of droplets of salvia is numerically modelled using a volume of fluid methodology applied to the mouth and lips of an infected person during the sneezing process. This is followed by a large eddy simulation of the resultant two phase flow in the vicinity of the person while the effects of droplet evaporation and ventilation in the bus are considered. The results are subsequently fed to an AI tool that employs deep learning to predict the distribution of droplets in the entire volume of the bus. This combined framework is two orders of magnitude faster than the pure computational approach. It is shown that the droplets with diameters less than 250 micrometers are most responsible for the transmission of the virus, as they can travel the entire length of the bus.","Mesgarpour, Mehrdad; Abad, Javad Mohebbi Najm; Alizadeh, Rasool; Wongwises, Somchai; Doranehgard, Mohammad Hossein; Ghaderi, Saeidreza; Karimi, Nader",J Hazard Mater,357,6

Many companies and developers did not understand for what purpose open-source software was developed, and some even opposed the existence of such solutions. Others, on the contrary, supported and still support the creation and distribution of this kind of programs, despite their unprofitableness. One of these programs is Moodle. It is a free web application that provides the ability to create websites for online learning, created in the early 2000s. Anyone can easily create or modify their own learning platform for free and without problems with copyright and licenses. The platform supports a huge number of languages, is constantly updated, and is also easy and convenient to customize. The user can add and customize his plugins and addons. The system has found wide application in connection with the emergence of COVID-19, since most schools and universities have switched to distance learning. Moodle functionality allows you to collect more than 50 users in one session without losing productivity. The platform has a built-in mechanism for authorizing users, including a login and password, which will not allow intruders to carry out unauthorized access to personal data of users. Teachers can leave the necessary files and recordings of classes on the platform for learners to access them. This article discusses the goals and issues of creating open-source software, its customization and application for solving problems of various kinds of activities, including the organization of multi-user educational platforms using the Moodle platform. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Ukhov, P.

Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed, and the mental health of clinicians has been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence among GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lock down locally. AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","Trivedi, Namrata; Trivedi, Vivek; Moorthy, Arumugam; Trivedi, Hina",,357,29

These situations, while relevant, do not cover all situations in which CD8+ T cell memory is relevant. It is increasingly clear that CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype form in response to infections with extensive or prolonged tissue inflammation, for example, influenza, herpes, and more recently, COVID-19. In these circumstances, inflammatory mediators expectedly affect forming memory CD8+ T cells, especially in tissues in which pathogens establish. Notwithstanding recent important discoveries, many outstanding questions on how inflammation shapes CD8+ T cell memory remain unanswered. We will discuss, in this review, what is already known and the next steps to understand how inflammation influences CD8+ T cell memory.","Borges da Silva, Henrique",Immunohorizons,357,16

Observations emerging from different countries highlight these findings although some of them seem to be discordant. Overall, it appears that Asian countries could fight the battle better than most developed nations in the Europe and America during the current pandemic, despite having poor GHS scores.

Poor mnemonic discrimination is a potential risk or maintenance factor for anxiety, and recent studies suggest state affect may moderate relations between mnemonic discrimination and trait anxiety. No studies have evaluated mnemonic discrimination in specific subtypes of anxiety or with clinically relevant stressors. This preregistered study evaluated the role of social anxiety and the anticipation of a future speech on MST performance. Participants with high (n = 66) and low (n = 64) levels of social anxiety were randomly assigned to a stressor condition or a control condition prior to the MST.

We estimated the potential impact of adding linked, opt-out HIV testing alongside SARS-CoV-2 testing on HIV incidence and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in six US cities. METHODS: Using a previously-calibrated dynamic HIV transmission model, we constructed three sets of scenarios for each city: (1) sustained current levels of HIV-related treatment and prevention services (status quo); (2) temporary disruptions in health services and changes in sexual and injection risk behaviours at discrete levels between 0%-50%; and (3) linked HIV and SARS-CoV-2 testing offered to 10%-90% of the adult population in addition to scenario (2). We estimated cumulative HIV infections between 2020-2025 and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of linked HIV testing over 20 years. RESULTS: In the absence of linked, opt-out HIV testing, we estimated a total of 16.5% decrease in HIV infections between 2020-2025 in the best-case scenario (50% reduction in risk behaviours and no service disruptions), and 9.0% increase in the worst-case scenario (no behavioural change and 50% reduction in service access). We estimated that HIV testing (offered at 10%-90% levels) could avert a total of 576-7,225 (1.6%-17.2%) new infections. The intervention would require an initial investment of $20.6M-$220.7M across cities; however, the intervention would ultimately result in savings in health care costs in each city. CONCLUSIONS: A campaign in which HIV testing is linked with SARS-CoV-2 testing could substantially reduce HIV incidence and reduce direct and indirect health care costs attributable to HIV.","Zang, Xiao; Krebs, Emanuel; Chen, Siyuan; Piske, Micah; Armstrong, Wendy S; Behrends, Czarina N; Del Rio, Carlos; Feaster, Daniel J; Marshall, Brandon D L; Mehta, Shruti H; Mermin, Jonathan; Metsch, Lisa R; Schackman, Bruce R; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Nosyk, Bohdan",Clin Infect Dis,357,16

The Death or 'D' model is a simplified version of the well-known SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) compartment model, which allows for the transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically by assuming no recovery during the pandemic. By fitting to available data, the D-model provides a precise way to characterize the exponential and normal phases of the pandemic evolution, and it can be extended to describe additional spatial-time effects such as the release of lockdown measures. More accurate calculations using the extended SIR or ESIR model, which includes recovery, and more sophisticated Monte Carlo grid simulations - also developed in this work - predict similar trends and suggest a common pandemic evolution with universal parameters. The evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries shows the typical behavior in concord with our model trends, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow decline, typically asymmetric with respect to the pandemic peak. The fact that the D and ESIR models predict similar results - without and with recovery, respectively - indicates that COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus, but that most people become asymptomatic (D model) and eventually recover (ESIR model).","Enrique Amaro, José; Dudouet, Jérémie; Nicolás Orce, José",Applied mathematical modelling,357,1

In the study, we assessed the effect of non-maternal toxic dosages of ruxolitinib (0-30 mg/kg/day between E7.5-E20.5) on the brain of the developing mouse embryos. While the pregnant mice did not show any apparent adverse effects, the Gfap protein marker for glial cells and S100ß mRNA marker for astrocytes were reduced in the postnatal day (P) 1.5 pups' brains. Gfap expression and Gfap+ cells were also suppressed in the differentiating neurospheres culture treated with ruxolitinib. Compared to the control group, adult mice treated with ruxolitinib prenatally showed no changes in motor coordination, locomotor function, and recognition memory. However, increased explorative behaviour within an open field and improved spatial learning and long-term memory retention were observed in the treated group.

The conducted GT analysis and cross-sectional studies revealed that during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, the interest in immune-related compounds and foods like vitamins C and D, zinc, omega-3, garlic, ginger, or turmeric, as well as their consumption increased. Improving immunity was the main reason behind the supplementation and changes in consumption of pro-healthy foods. GT analysis has shown these interests were positively correlated with the interest in COVID-19, but adversely with cumulative cases or deaths. Respondents tended to start supplementation during the first COVID-19 wave rather than the second one. Except for the role of vitamins D and C, zinc, and selenium in patients with deficiencies of those nutrients, there are no clear and convincing studies that support the role of DSs use in COVID-19 prevention and treatment in healthy, well-nourished individuals.

OBJECTIVES: A strategy involving the electrostatic interaction between a common antiseptic and a discontinued antibiotic (i.e. octenidine and carbenicillin) was evaluated as a potential treatment for gonorrhoea. Octenidine/carbenicillin is a novel group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) with inherent in vitro antibacterial activity that comes from its parent antiseptic and antibacterial ions, octenidine and carbenicillin, respectively. METHODS: Antibacterial activities for octenidine dihydrochloride, disodium carbenicillin, octenidine/carbenicillin and stoichiometrically equivalent 1:1 octenidine dihydrochloride to disodium carbenicillin were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay for N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 49226) and three clinical isolates. Predictive permeability using the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay and cytotoxicity against HeLa cells was also evaluated. RESULTS: Additive in vitro antibacterial activities against N. gonorrhoeae were observed in this study, which suggests octenidine/carbenicillin could be a useful agent in reducing N. gonorrhoeae transmission and minimizing gonorrhoea infections. Octenidine/carbenicillin also exhibited bioequivalence to azithromycin and doxycycline, two currently prescribed antibiotics. Likewise, octenidine/carbenicillin had improved predicted permeability compared with octenidine dihydrochloride. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial GUMBOS synthesized in this study could be used as an adjunctive treatment approach to current drug therapies for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea infection control and prevention.","Lopez, Kelsey M; Hobden, Jeffrey A; Warner, Isiah M",J. antimicrob. chemother,357,16

Black/African Americans are contracting and dying from COVID-19 disproportionately. We assessed risk factors for death from COVID-19 among black inpatients at an urban center in Detroit, MI. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study. We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay, who were admitted between 3/8-5/6/2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The case fatality rate was 29.1% (122/419). The mean duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 5.3 (3.9) days. Patients who died were older (mean [SD] age, 68.7 [14.8] years vs 60.3 [16.0] years; p <0.0001), had dementia (35 [28.7%] vs 34 [11.4%]; p <0.0001), hemiplegia (14 [11.5%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.004), malignancy (11 [9.0%] vs 12 [4.0%]; p=0.04), and moderate-severe liver disease (4 [3.3%] vs 1 [0.3%]; p=0.01). The incidence of AMS on presentation was higher among patients who died than those who survived, 43% vs. 20.0%, respectively (p<0.0001). From multivariable analysis, the odds of death increased with age (&#8805;60 yrs.), admission from a nursing facility, Charlson score, altered mental status, higher C-reactive protein on admission, need for mechanical ventilation, presence of shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These demographic, clinical and laboratory factors should help healthcare providers identify black patients at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes.

In this study, we aim to find out potential small molecule inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) from the known DrugBank database version 5.1.8. We applied structure-based virtual screening of the database containing 11875 numbers of drug candidates to identify potential hits for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. Seven potential inhibitors having admirable XP glide score ranging from ?15.071 to ?8.704?kcal/mol and good binding affinity with the active sites amino acids of Mpro were identified. The selected hits were further analyzed with 50?ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to examine the stability of protein-ligand complexes. The root mean square deviation and potential energy plot indicates the stability of the complexes during the 50?ns MD simulation. The MM-GBSA analysis also showed good binding energy of the selected hits (?83.2718 to ?58.6618?kcal/mol). Further analysis revealed critical hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between compounds and the target protein.

Besides, cancer patients and survivors are severely immunocompromised due to the harsh effect of anti-cancer therapy targeting the bone marrow cells. Cancer patients and survivors can therefore be potentially extremely clinically vulnerable and at risk from infectious diseases. The recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its infection called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a worldwide health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). A high fatality rate has been reported in COVID-19 patients suffering from underlying cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the critical and crucial aspect of monitoring cancer patients and survivors for potential cardiovascular complications during this unprecedented health crisis involving the progressive worldwide spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease;however, COVID-19 has shown cardiac injury symptoms similar to the cardiotoxicity associated with anti-cancer therapy, including arrhythmia, myocardial injury and infarction, and heart failure. Due to the significant prevalence of micro- and macro-emboli and damaged vessels, clinicians worldwide have begun to consider whether COVID-19 may in fact be as much a vascular disease as a respiratory disease. However, the underlying mechanisms and pathways facilitating the COVID-19-induced cardiac injury in cancer and non-cancer patients remain unclear. Investigations into whether COVID-19 cardiac injury and anti-cancer drug-induced cardiac injury in cancer patients and survivors might synergistically increase the cardiovascular complications and comorbidity risk through a ""two-hit"" model are needed. Identification of cardiac injury mechanisms and pathways associated with COVID-19 development overlapping with anti-cancer therapy could help clinicians to allow a more optimized prognosis and treatment of cancer survivors suffering from COVID-19. The following review will focus on summarizing the harmful cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients and survivors treated with an anti-cancer drug. This review will improve the knowledge of COVID-19 impact in the field of cardio-oncology and potentially improve the outcome of patients.","Lozahic, C.; Maddock, H.; Sandhu, H.",Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,357,9

We show how COVID-19 has increased the perceived value of consuming alcohol among women, particularly when weighed up against the social and emotional ""costs"" of reducing consumption. Our findings have implications for the delivery of alcohol-related health risk messages designed for middle-aged women both during, and into the recovery phases of the pandemic, who already consume more alcohol and experience more alcohol-related health risk than women in other age groups.","Lunnay, Belinda; Foley, Kristen; Meyer, Samantha B; Warin, Megan; Wilson, Carlene; Olver, Ian; Miller, Emma R; Thomas, Jessica; Ward, Paul R",Front Public Health,357,23

In Malaysia, work-related infection of health workers (HW) occurred mainly when COVID-19 was not suspected in patients and no adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn. Although knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections among workers remains limited, the impact appears to be substantial. This is supported by the mortality rate among infected workers. Occupational health check-ups carried out at the present time should be systematically analyzed in order to gain more information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 among HW.

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was also included as part of the treatment plans at various stages of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Eligible adult patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CHM plus standard care or standard care alone for 7 days. The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment. Results: Between Jan 31, 2020, and Feb 19, 2020, 42 out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial: 28 in the CHM plus standard care group and 14 in the standard care alone group. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]), 21 (21/42, 50%) were aged ≥65 years, 35 (35/42, 83%) were women, and 42 (42/42, 100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148–2.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness.

The health impacts of lockdowns during COVID-19,19.631413,2.5976224,2021-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults (MIS-A) is a recently emerging condition that occurs as a delayed complication of COVID-19 infection. It involves inflammation of multiple extra-pulmonary organ systems. Diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations have yet to be clearly defined. We present a case of a young adult with suspected MIS-A who initially displayed symptoms and radiological findings of colitis. Case: A 22-year-old male with no past medical history suffered a minor respiratory illness for a few days and tested positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Approximately 6 weeks later, he presents after 3 days of right-sided abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fever. He is initially admitted with a working diagnosis of gastroenteritis. Sustained fever and escalating blood markers of illness led to abdominal CT; showing inflammation of ascending colon as well as some loops of small bowel. Hypotension becomes increasingly pronounced and on the fourth day of admission he developed type 1 respiratory failure with evidence of fluid overload. He was transferred to critical care for vasopressor and respiratory support. All microbiological and autoimmune screens performed return negative results but inflammatory markers were significantly elevated, he was diagnosed as MIS-A. IVIg was added to the antibiotics on day 4. His clinical condition dramatically improved and he was discharged home after 10 days in hospital. His blood tests have returned to normal and he has no lasting complications from his illness. DISCUSSION: This case displays the potential for MIS-A to present in various ways, with this example a primarily gastroenterological illness. It therefore highlights the importance of physicians in different fields having an awareness of the condition, in order to identify when MDT input is required to guide treatment. We review the current literature on various presentations and treatments of MIS-A, and discuss the need for clear case definition.","McCrossan, Craig E; Mair, Luke; Parsons, Helena; Tattersall, Rachel S; Basu, Kumar K",Clin Infect Pract,357,1

However, recent publications have failed to show clinical success when midodrine was administered every 8 hours. One possible reason for the lack of clinical efficacy at this dosing interval may be the pharmacokinetic properties of midodrine that support a more frequent dosing interval. Here, we report our institutional experience with midodrine at a dosing frequency of every 6 hours. DESIGN: Single, quaternary academic medical center, retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING: Floor and ICU patients admitted to Mayo Clinic, Rochester, from May 7, 2018, to September 30, 2020. PATIENTS: Adult patients with an order for midodrine with a dosing frequency of “every 6 hours” or “four times daily” were eligible for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: No intervention performed. All data were abstracted retrospectively from the electronic medical record. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four unique patients were identified that met inclusion criteria. Patients were an average of 65 years and 63.6% were male. The individual doses of midodrine ranged from 5 to 20 mg. Twenty-three patients (52.3%) were receiving IV vasopressors at the time midodrine was ordered every 6 hours. Vasopressor requirements decreased from an average of 0.10 norepinephrine equivalents 24 hours prior to the every 6-hour order to 0.05 norepinephrine equivalents 24 hours after an order for midodrine every 6 hour was placed. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the dosing frequency of midodrine to every 6 hours may optimize its pharmacokinetic profile without compromising safety. This midodrine dosing frequency should be prospectively evaluated as a primary strategy for accelerated IV vasopressor wean.","Macielak, Shea A.; Vollmer, Nicholas J.; Haddad, Natalie A.; Nabzdyk, Christoph G.

It is essential to predict respiratory deterioration in the short term. We investigated the use of inflammatory markers to predict respiratory distress within three days from their analysis in COVID-19 patients. This retrospective observational study included 81 patients admitted with COVID-19. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether the maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) for three days from the blood marker measurements was ≥0.4 (high FiO(2) group; HFG) or <0.4 (low FiO(2) group; LFG). Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), white blood cell, D-dimer, and creatinine levels were compared between the two groups. The levels of all markers were significantly higher in HFG patients. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of IL-6, CRP, and LDH had high values of 0.85, 0.82, and 0.81, respectively. The odds ratio of IL-6 which was crude and adjusted for dexamethasone administration initiated before laboratory measurement, showed the high value of 29.1 (5.6–295.6) and 53.9 (4.5–3242.8), respectively. IL-6 can be used as a reliable marker for predicting respiratory illness within three days after assessment.","Fujino, Mitsuhiro; Ishii, Michiyo; Taniguchi, Takuya; Chiba, Hiroya; Kimata, Masaki; Hitosugi, Masahito",Diagnostics (Basel),357,2

Understanding trends and demands of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the infected and COVID-free populations are needed in long-term planning. We detail IR procedure trends in the first 27 weeks of the pandemic and compare with the pre-pandemic era. METHODS: In this IRB approved retrospective electronic case review, all IR patients in our institution from 1 January to 9 July 2020, the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak were included. IR procedures were classified using Interventional Radiology—Procedure Acuity Scale (IR-PAS) and category of IR procedures. Along with descriptive frequencies, the Mann–Whitney U test and Chi-square test of independence were performed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 3655 IR procedures were performed compared to 3851 procedures pre-pandemic. No statistically significant difference in weekly IR caseloads across IR-PAS tiers between both periods (p = .088) and category of procedure (p = .054) were noted. General intervention procedures remained the largest proportion and musculoskeletal procedures the minority, in both periods. More general intervention radiology and oncology procedures were performed during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the SARS-CoV outbreak. Thirty-four (0.93%) IR procedures were performed on 30 COVID-19 patients. There was no IR procedure-related COVID-19 cross-transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Demand for IR procedures among COVID-free patients remains high, and IR procedures involving COVID-19 represents a fraction of the IR caseload. A sustainable model in providing timely IR services to COVID-free patients needs to be considered.","How, Guo Yuan; Pua, Uei",Insights Imaging,357,20

However, the study on the function of circRNAs in the immune system remains insufficient. This study discusses the basic principles of circRNAs regulation and the systems involved in physiology-related and pathology-related processes. The effect of circRNAs on immune regulation is elucidated. The ongoing development of circRNAs and basic immunology has multiplied their potential in treating diseases. Such perspective will summarize the status and effect of circRNAs on various immune cells in cancer, autoimmune diseases and infections. Moreover, this study will primarily expound the system of circRNAs in T lymphocytes, macrophages and other immune cells, which creates a novel perspective and lay a theoretical basis for treating diseases.","Li, Zhouxiao; Cheng, Ye; Wu, Fan; Wu, Liangliang; Cao, Hongyong; Wang, Qian; Tang, Weiwei",Biomark Res,357,20

Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5′ and 415 nucleotides of the 3′ terminal of CYMV's gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant. This coding strategy represents a novel property of plant virus defective RNAs.","White, K.Andrew; Brancroft, J. B.; Mackie, George A.",Virology,357,20

METHODS: Asymptomatic judiciary staff of Jodhpur and Jaipur benches of High Courts were enrolled after informed written consent. A questionnaire was filled and 3–5 ml venous blood was collected from participants. The ICMR-NIV COVID Kavach IgG ELISA and EUROIMMUN IgG ELISA were used for detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. RESULTS: A total of 63 samples (41 from Jodhpur and 22 from Jaipur) were collected between 28(th) July to 4(th) August 2020. The overall anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was found to be 6.35%.

This study describes changes in the presentation, presenting severity and disposition of patients accessing emergency services in Calgary, Alberta, during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: In this descriptive study, we constructed a population cohort of all patients who accessed emergency services by calling emergency medical services (EMS) (ambulance service that provides prehospital treatment and transport to medical facilities) or presenting directly to an emergency department (4 adult and 1 pediatric) or 2 urgent care centres in Calgary during the exposure period (December 2019 to June 2020) compared to 2 historical control periods (December to June, 2017–2018 and 2018–2019) combined. Outcomes included frequency of presentation, system flow indicators, patient severity, disposition and mortality. We used a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing function to visualize trends. We described differences at the maximum and minimum point of the exposure period compared to the control period. RESULTS: A total of 1 127 014 patient encounters were included. Compared to the control period, there was a 61% increase in the number of patients accessing EMS and a 35% decrease in the number of those presenting to an adult emergency department or urgent care centre in the COVID-19 period. The proportion of EMS calls for the highest-priority patients remained stable, whereas the proportion of patients presenting to an emergency department or urgent care centre with the highest-priority triage classification increased transiently by 0.9 percentage points (increase of 89%). A smaller proportion of patients were transported by EMS (decrease of 21%), and a greater proportion of emergency department patients were admitted to hospital (increase of 25%). After the first case was reported, the mortality rate among EMS patients increased by 265% (3.4 v. 12.4 per 1000 patient encounters).

METHODS: In total, 141 COVID-19 patients were assigned to group 1 (diabetes), group 2 (secondary hyperglycemia) or group 3 (controls). Initial and six- and twelve-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 16 days, 175 days and 351 days after symptom onset, respectively. CT findings and clinical and peak laboratory parameters were collected and compared. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors for the presence of residual lung abnormalities at the 6-month follow-up exam. Seven variables (age; the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome; the duration of hospitalization; the peak levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and the initial total CT score) were chosen in the final multivariable models. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, abnormalities were still observed on chest CT in 77/141 (54.6%) patients. Reticular patterns (40/141, 28.4%) and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (29/141, 20.6%) were the most common CT abnormalities on the follow-up CT scans. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 had significantly higher incidences of residual lung abnormalities than those in Group 3 (65.4% and 58.3%, respectively vs. 36.6%; p < 0.05). Twelve months after disease onset, the chest CT changes persisted in 13/25 (52.0%) patients. A duration of hospitalization > 20 days (OR: 5.630, 95% CI: 1.394–22.744, p = 0.015), an LDH level ≥ 317 U/L (OR: 7.020, 95% CI: 1.032–47.743, p = 0.046) and a total CT score > 15 (OR: 9.919, 95% CI: 1.378–71.415, p = 0.023) were independent predictors of residual pulmonary abnormalities in patients with diabetes or secondary hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of surviving COVID-19 patients with diabetes or secondary hyperglycemia had residual pulmonary abnormalities six months after disease onset, and we found evidence of persistent chest CT changes at the one-year follow-up.

DPP4 receptor is highly conserved among many species, but the genetic variability among direct binding residues to MERS-CoV restrained its cellular tropism to humans, camels and bats. The occurrence of natural polymorphisms in human DPP4 binding residues is not well characterized. Therefore, we aimed to assess the presence of potential mutations in DPP4 receptor binding domain (RBD) among a population highly exposed to MERS-CoV in Morocco and predict their effect on DPP4 –MERS-CoV binding affinity through a computational approach. DPP4 synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were identified by sanger sequencing, and their effect were modelled by mutation prediction tools, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to evaluate structural changes in human DPP4 protein bound to MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein. We identified eight mutations, two synonymous mutations (A291 =, R317 =) and six non-synonymous mutations (N229I, K267E, K267N, T288P, L294V, I295L). Through docking and MD simulation techniques, the chimeric DPP4 –MERS-CoV S1 RBD protein complex models carrying one of the identified non-synonymous mutations sustained a stable binding affinity for the complex that might lead to a robust cellular attachment of MERS-CoV except for the DPP4 N229I mutation. The latter is notable for a loss of binding affinity of DPP4 with MERS-CoV S1 RBD that might affect negatively on cellular entry of the virus.

The numerical experiments were performed from 3–16 February in 2019 and in 2020, during which a severe fog–haze event (3–16 February 2020) occurred in the BTH region, with a simulated maximum daily PM2.5 of 245 μg m−3 in Tangshan and 175 μg m−3 in Beijing. The results indicate that the daily PM2.5 decreased by 5–150 μg m−3 due to the emissions reduction and increased by 10–175 μg m−3 due to the meteorological condition in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Handan, Hengshui, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Tangshan from 7–14 February. For the horizontal distribution, PM2.5 and different aerosol species concentrations from 7–14 February 2020 increased compared with those during the same period in 2019, indicating that the accumulation of pollutants caused by the unfavorable meteorological condition offset the decreases caused by the emissions reduction, leading to the high aerosol concentration during the COVID-19 lockdown. 摘要 本研究从气象条件和减排两方面探讨了COVID-19封锁期间严重雾霾发生的原因[研究目的], 并定量的分析了气象条件和减排对PM2.5浓度的相对影响[创新点].使用WRF-Chem在2019年2月3日–16日和2020年2月3日–16日进行了三个数值模拟试验, 分别为2019年气象场与MEIC-2019 (2019年中国多分辨率月度排放清单) ,2020年气象场与MEIC-2019,2020年气象场与MEIC-2020[研究方法].结果表明COVID-19封锁期间严重雾霾的原因是不利气象条件增加的PM2.5浓度大于减排减少的PM2.5浓度[重要结论].","Zhang, Yanqing; Ma, Zhaokun; Gao, Yi; Zhang, Meigen",,357,1

Clinical trials combining small molecule inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies have been initiated at rapid pace, with the biological understanding between their synergistic interactions lagging behind. Here, we have evaluated the synergy between BTK inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy via macrophage mediated antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Initially, we observed increased ADCP with ibrutinib, whilst second generation BTK inhibitors failed to synergistically interact with monoclonal antibody treatment. Kinase activity profiling under BTK inhibition identified significant loss of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) only under ibrutinib treatment. We validated this potential off-target effect via JAK inhibition in vitro as well as with CRISPR/Cas9 JAK2(−/−) experiments in vivo, showing increased ADCP and prolonged survival, respectively. This data supports inhibition of the JAK-STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) signaling pathway in B-cell malignancies in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy to increase macrophage-mediated immune responses.","Barbarino, Verena; Henschke, Sinika; Blakemore, Stuart James; Izquierdo, Elena; Michalik, Michael; Nickel, Nadine; Möllenkotte, Indra; Vorholt, Daniela; Müller, Linda; Brinker, Reinhild; Fedorchenko, Oleg; Mikhael, Nelly; Seeger-Nukpezah, Tamina; Hallek, Michael; Pallasch, Christian P.",Cancers (Basel),357,27

Gender and age specific differences in specific online activities were assessed. n = 3245 subjects participated in an online survey conducted between the 8th April and the 11th May 2020. Participants’ age ranged between 18 and >55 years. A considerably high percentage (71.4%) of participants reported increased online media consumption during the lockdown. Male participants were more likely to increase their consumption of gaming and erotic platforms, while female participants reported a higher increase in the engagement in social networks, information research, and video streaming than males. The findings revealed an increased usage of all online applications during the lockdown.

Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials aimed at assessing the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity, and the duration of immunity induced by the QazCovid-in® vaccine after one or two immunisations. METHODS: From 23.09.2020 to 19.03.2021 we performed a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial and from 18.10.2020 to 17.04.2021 an open-label phase 2 clinical trials of the QazCovid-in® vaccine with a 6 months follow-up at a single centre in Almaty, the Republic of Kazakhstan. Eligible healthy adults aged 18 years and older with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomly assigned to the treatment groups using a computerised randomisation scheme generator. In the phase 1 clinical trial, two doses of the vaccine (5 μg each) or placebo (0·9% NaCl) were administered intramuscularly to 44 subjects aged 18–50 years, 21 days apart. In the phase 2 trial, 200 healthy participants were randomised into four equal-sized groups according to the age (18–49 or ≥50 years) and either single (day 1) or double (day 1 and 21) vaccination protocol. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity. The cellular response was measured by a whole-blood cytokine release assay (phase 1 only). The trials were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04530357. FINDINGS: The QazCovid-in® vaccine was safe and well-tolerated and induced predominantly mild adverse events; no serious or severe adverse events were recorded in both trials. In the phase 1 trial, the percentage of subjects with a fourfold increase of antibody titres (sero conversion) in MNA was 59% after one vaccine dose and amounted to 100% after two doses. Neutralizing antibody titres reached the geometric mean titre (GMT) of 100 after administration of two doses. A statistically significant increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after vaccination indicated the Th1-biased response. On day 180, 40% of placebo-treated subjects demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the levels of antibodies measured by both ELISA and MNA, which suggests the infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the phase 2 trial, 100% of subjects aged 18–49 years seroconverted for SARS-CoV-2 on day 21 after the first dose, as indicated by MNA yielding the GMTs of 32 or 30 in the one- and two-dose groups, respectively. Amongst ≥50-year-old subjects, the number of sero conversions in the two- and one-dose groups on day 21 was 94% and 92% with the respective GMTs of 25 and 24. After the second dose, the sero conversion rate reached 100%; however, the GMT was significantly lower when compared with the corresponding value measured in subjects aged 18–49 years (83 vs 143). In both trials, specific antibodies were detected in MNA and ELISA on study day 180, but the titres dropped in comparison to day 42. The results of this study serve as the rationale for the phase 3 study. INTERPRETATION: The QazCovid-in® vaccine is safe and well-tolerated and promotes pronounced humoral immunity which lasts for at least 6 months after double intramuscular immunisation.","Zakarya, Kunsulu; Kutumbetov, Lespek; Orynbayev, Mukhit; Abduraimov, Yergali; Sultankulova, Kulyaisan; Kassenov, Markhabat; Sarsenbayeva, Gulbanu; Kulmagambetov, Ilyas; Davlyatshin, Timur; Sergeeva, Maria; Stukova, Marina; Khairullin, Berik",EClinicalMedicine,357,20

Fellowship education programs in gynecologic oncology have quickly adapted to the “new normal” of social distancing using video conferencing platforms to continue clinical and didactic teaching. United in a time of crisis, we have embraced systemic change by developing and delivering collaborative educational content, overcoming the limitations imposed by institutional silos. Additional innovations are needed in order to overcome the losses in program surgical volume and research opportunities. With the end of the viral pandemic nowhere in sight, program directors can rethink how education is best delivered and potentially overhaul aspects of fellowship curriculum and content. Similarly, restrictions on travel and the need for social distancing has transformed the 2020 fellowship interview season from an in-person to a virtual experience. During this time of unprecedented and rapid change, program directors should be particularly mindful of the needs and health of their trainees and consider tailoring their educational experiences accordingly.","Ferriss, J.

The number of clinical trials that can be performed is limited. We developed mathematical models to project multiple therapeutic approaches. Our models recapitulate off-treatment viral dynamics and predict a three-phase immune response. Simulated treatment with remdesivir, selinexor, neutralizing antibodies, or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that rapid viral elimination is possible if in vivo potency is sufficiently high. Therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when symptoms develop may decrease shedding duration and immune response intensity but have little effect on viral area under the curve (AUC), which is driven by high early viral loads. Potent therapy dosed before viral peak during presymptomatic infection could lower AUC. Drug resistance may emerge with a moderately potent agent dosed before viral peak. Our results support early treatment for COVID-19 if shedding duration, not AUC, is most predictive of clinical severity.","Goyal, Ashish; Cardozo-Ojeda, E. Fabian; Schiffer, Joshua T.",Sci Adv,357,5

Community health workers (CHWs) are in an intermediary position between the health system and the community. While this position provides CHWs with a good platform to improve community health, a major challenge in large-scale CHW programmes is the need for CHWs to establish and maintain beneficial relationships with both sets of actors, who may have different expectations and needs. This paper focuses on the quality of CHW relationships with actors at the local level of the national health system and with communities. METHODS: The authors conducted a selective review of journal articles and the grey literature, including case study findings in the 2020 book Health for the People: National CHW Programs from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. They also drew upon their experience working with CHW programmes. RESULTS: The space where CHWs form relationships with the health system and the community has various inherent strengths and tensions that can enable or constrain the quality of these relationships. Important elements are role clarity for all actors, working referral systems, and functioning supply chains. CHWs need good interpersonal communication skills, good community engagement skills, and the opportunity to participate in community-based organizations. Communities need to have a realistic understanding of the CHW programme, to be involved in a transparent process for selecting CHWs, and to have the opportunity to participate in the CHW programme. Support and interaction between CHWs and other health workers are essential, as is positive engagement with community members, groups, and leaders. CONCLUSION: To be successful, large-scale CHW programmes need well-designed, effective support from the health system, productive interactions between CHWs and health system staff, and support and engagement of the community. This requires health sector leadership from national to local levels, support from local government, and partnerships with community organizations. Large-scale CHW programmes should be designed to enable local flexibility in adjusting to the local community context.","LeBan, Karen; Kok, Maryse; Perry, Henry B.",Health Res Policy Syst,357,21

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing Surgical Site Infections (SSI) in elective colorectal surgery. In a multicentre trial, we randomized patients undergoing elective colorectal resection surgery, comparing the effectiveness of OIVA versus intravenous antibiotics (IVA) regimens to prevent SSI as the primary outcome (NCT04438655). In addition to intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanic, patients in the OIVA group received Oral Neomycin and Bacitracin 24 h before surgery. MBP was administered according to local habits which were not changed for the study. The trial was terminated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many centers failed to participate as well as the pandemic changed the rules for engaging patients. Two-hundred and four patients were enrolled (100 in the OIVA and 104 in the IVA group); 3 SSIs (3.4%) were registered in the OIVA and 14 (14.4%) in the IVA group (p = 0.010). No difference was observed in terms of anastomotic leak. Multivariable analysis indicated that OIVA reduced the rate of SSI (OR 0.21 / 95% CI 0.06–0.78 / p = 0.019), while BMI is a risk factor of SSI (OR 1.15 / 95% CI 1.01–1.30 p = 0.039). Subgroup analysis indicated that 0/22 patients who underwent OIVA/MBP + vs 13/77 IVA/MBP- experienced an SSI (p = 0.037). The early termination of the study prevents any conclusion regarding the interpretation of the data. Nonetheless, Oral Neomycin/Bacitracin and intravenous beta-lactam/beta-lactamases inhibitors seem to reduce SSI after colorectal resections, although not affecting the anastomotic leak in this trial. The role of MBP requires more investigation.","Arezzo, Alberto; Mistrangelo, Massimiliano; Bonino, Marco Augusto; Salusso, Paola; Forcignanò, Edoardo; Vettoretto, Nereo; Botteri, Emanuele; Cillara, Nicola; Ottonello, Roberto; Testa, Valentina; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Corcione, Silvia; Passera, Roberto; Morino, Mario",Updates Surg,357,32

Pooling samples for lower risk populations has the potential to accommodate increased demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of 4-way pooling of SARS-CoV-2 specimens for high-throughput RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Individual samples were pooled 1:4 through automated liquid handling, extracted, and assayed by our emergency use authorized CDC-based RT-PCR laboratory developed test. Positive samples were serially diluted and theoretical and empirical PCR cycle thresholds were evaluated. Thirty-two distinct positive samples were pooled into negative specimens and individual CTs were compared to pooled CTs. Low positive samples were repeated for reproducibility and 32 four-way pools of negative specimens were assayed to determine specificity. RESULTS: Four-way pooling was associated with a loss of sensitivity of 1.7 and 2.0 CTs for our N1 and N2 targets, respectively. Pooling correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 94 % (n = 30/32) of samples tested. The two low positive specimens (neat CT > 35) not detected by pooling were individually repeated and detected 75 % (n=6/8) and 37.5 % (n = 3/8) of the time, respectively. All specimens individually determined negative were also negative by pooling. CONCLUSION: We report that 1:4 pooling of samples is specific and associated with an expected 2 CT loss in analytical sensitivity. Instead of running each sample individually, pooling of four samples will allow for a greater throughput and conserve scarce reagents.","Perchetti, Garrett A.; Sullivan, Ka-Wing; Pepper, Greg; Huang, Meei-Li; Breit, Nathan; Matthias, Patrick; Jerome, Keith R.; Greninger, Alexander L.",J Clin Virol,357,26

There are many ways solutes are transported across the thin (~40 Å) hydrophobic barrier. Transport is divided into passive diffusion and active transport. A biological membrane is semi-permeable, being permeable to some molecules, most notably water, while being very impermeable to most solutes that require some form of transporter. Passive diffusion (simple and facilitated) only requires the energy inherent in the solute’s electrochemical gradient and results in equilibrium across the membrane. In contrast, active transport requires additional energy (i.e. ATP), and results in a non-equilibrium, net accumulation of the solute. Passive transport can involve simple diffusion or facilitated carriers including ionophores and channels. Active transport comes in many, often complex forms. Examples of active transport include primary active transport (uniport), secondary active transport (cotransport, antiport) and group translocation. Besides the multitude of transport systems, transport can be accomplished by Gap Junctions, receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, exocytosis and apoptotic membrane blebbing.","Stillwell, William",An Introduction to Biological Membranes,357,30

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I(2) value was less than 0·4. FINDINGS: The study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1·65 [95% CI 1·12–2·44]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2·19 [95% CI 1·22–3·95]), chest pain or angina (1·15 [1·05–1·26]), and heart failure (1·22 [1·02–1·45]). INTERPRETATION: Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit–risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Forty-one Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), who provide a wide spectrum of health services for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and other underinsured and uninsured populations in urban areas across the country, are no exception. The National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), set out to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities for improvement in infection prevention and control (IPC) training and systems from the perspective of UIO frontline healthcare workers. As part of the CDC's Project Firstline, NCUIH was chosen as a partner in a national collaborative. The first task was to conduct listening sessions with frontline UIO staff to learn more about IPC practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty staff from 16 UIOs, representing full ambulatory, limited ambulatory, outreach and referral, and outpatient and residential treatment programs participated in virtual video focus groups in July of 2020. Thematic and content analysis protocols guided data analysis and coding. Analysis of findings generated four major themes: staff adaptation in the context of resilience; responsibility and duty to protect patients, families, and coworkers; mental and emotional issues for UIO staff; and IPC challenges in the context of COVID-19. Participants' challenges ranged from lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to the absence of standardized training. Significant disparities in social determinants of health experienced by Native American and non-Native populations served by UIOs create additional challenges to the delivery of and access to care during the pandemic. The diverse array of tribal cultural values and contexts of the people and communities served by UIOs reportedly serve as both facilitators and barriers to care, awareness, and uptake of infectious disease public health practices.","Collins, Noah; Crowder, Jolie; Ishcomer-Aazami, Jamie; Apedjihoun, Dionne",Front Sociol,357,12

Policymakers mostly resorted to normative measures to limit close contacts and impose social distancing. Our study aimed to estimate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by location and activity in crowded metropolitan areas. The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was defined as the product of crowding (people within a six feet distance) and exposure duration (fraction of 15 min). Our epidemiological investigation used aggregated and anonymized mobility data from Google Maps to estimate the visit duration. We collected visit duration data for 561 premises in the metropolitan area of Genoa, Italy from October 2020 to January 2021. The sample was then clustered into 14 everyday activities, from grocery shopping to the post office. Crowding data by activity were obtained from pre-existing building norms and new government measures to contain the pandemic. The study found significant variance in the risk of exposure to COVID-19 among activities and, for the same activity, among locations. The empirical determination of the risk of exposure to COVID-19 can inform national and local public health policies to contain the pandemic’s diffusion.

The medical workforce has dealt with this outbreak with varying strategies and adaptations, which are relevant to its field and to the region. As one of the ‘hotspots’ in the UK , the surgical branch of trauma and orthopaedics need strategies to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of COVID-19. METHODS: Adapting to the crisis locally involved five operational elements: 1) triaging and workflow of orthopaedic patients; 2) operation theatre feasibility and functioning; 3) conservation of human resources and management of workforce in the department; 4) speciality training and progression; and 5) developing an exit strategy to resume elective work. Two hospitals under our trust were redesignated based on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Registrar/consultant led telehealth reviews were carried out for early postoperative patients. Workflows for the management of outpatient care and inpatient care were created. We looked into the development of a dedicated operating space to perform the emergency orthopaedic surgeries without symptoms of COVID-19. Between March 23 and April 23, 2020, we have surgically treated 133 patients across both our hospitals in our trust. This mainly included hip fractures and fractures/infection affecting the hand. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is not the first disease outbreak affecting the UK, nor will it be the last. The current crisis has necessitated rapid development of new hospital guidelines and early adaptive strategies in our services. Protocols and directives need to be formalized keeping in mind that COVID-19 will have a long and protracted course until a definitive cure is discovered.","Mathai, Naveen J.; Venkatesan, Aakaash Sethuraman; Key, Thomas; Wilson, Christopher; Mohanty, Khitish",Bone Jt Open,357,13

METHOD: 200 pre-pandemic sera and 48 samples positive for various conditions (18 viral hepatitis, 18 dengue, 11 ANA and 1 dsDNA) were used as controls and to assess for cross-reactivity. Anonymised residual leftover sera positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were recruited as cases (n=133). The sensitivity/specificity/cross-reactivity/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of the POCTs were assessed. Concordance between the POCTs and chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) were analysed. RESULTS: Abbott/Roche POCT specificity was 98.7%/100% (95% CI 96.5-99.8/98.5-100) and sensitivity was 97.2%/97.2% (95% CI 85.5-99.9/85.5-99.9) in cases ≥14 days post-first positive RT-PCR (POS), PPV was 68.7%/100% (95% CI 41.3-87.2/94.7-100.0), and NPV was 97.4%/97.6% (95% CI 97.0-97.8/97.2-98.0). In cases ≥14 days POS, concordance of Abbott/Roche POCT and CLIAs was 97.2%/100% (35/36 and 36/36 results). The sensitivity of individual IgM-band results on both POCTs did not increase >95% even after 14 days POS (Abbott 2.78%, Roche 44.4%). CONCLUSION: Both POCTs have good specificity, little cross-reactivity with other antibodies, and sensitivity >95% when used in subjects ≥14 days POS. Analysis of individual POCT IgG/IgM-bands did not provide any additional information. POCTs can substitute for CLIAs in cases ≥14 days POS. In low prevalence areas, POCTs would be especially useful when combined with antigen testing in an orthogonal format to increase the PPV of COVID-19 results.","CS, Lau; SP, Hoo; YL, Liang; SK, Phua; TC, Aw",Pract Lab Med,357,6

Our hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels might be a factor and a more appropriate parameter has emerged as an alternative to assess seasonality and exploit it for public health policies. Using geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological criteria, we selected twelve North-equatorial-South countries with similar characteristics. We then obtained UV levels, mobility and Covid-19 daily incidence rates for nearly the entire 2020. Using machine learning, we demonstrated that UV radiation strongly associated with incidence rates, more so than mobility did, indicating that UV is a key seasonality indicator for Covid-19, irrespective of the initial conditions of the epidemic.

No reaction was observed with extracts of the heart, muscles, spleen, brain and lung. The Ab cross‐reacted with a 40‐kDa protein from human, rat and sheep liver, but not withliver extracts from the silver side fish (Odontesthes bonariensis). No correlation was found between the development of the hypergammaglobulinemia that followed the viral infection and theoccurrence of the autoAb.

The 40‐kDa protein was purified from mouse liver extracts by ion‐exchange chromatography, gel filtration and SDS‐PAGE. Because the N‐terminal was blocked, we digested the protein in‐gel with trypsin and sequenced various peptides. Results indicated a 100% homology of sequence between the protein recognized by the autoAb and liver fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the enzyme that mediates the last step of tyrosine catabolism.

Because of their origin in the bat enteric system, we wondered if severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also use bacterial components to modulate infectivity. To test this question, we incubated CoVs with LPS and PG and evaluated infectivity, finding no change following LPS treatment. However, PG from Bacillus subtilis reduced infection >10,000-fold, while PG from other bacterial species failed to recapitulate this. Treatment with an alcohol solvent transferred inhibitory activity to the wash, and mass spectrometry revealed surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as the inhibitory compound. This antibiotic had robust dose- and temperature-dependent inhibition of CoV infectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that surfactin disrupts CoV virion integrity, and surfactin treatment of the virus inoculum ablated infection in vivo. Finally, similar cyclic lipopeptides had no effect on CoV infectivity, and the inhibitory effect of surfactin extended broadly to enveloped viruses, including influenza, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, chikungunya, Una, Mayaro, Dugbe, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Overall, our results indicate that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin has broad viricidal activity and suggest that bacteria by-products may negatively modulate virus infection. IMPORTANCE In this article, we consider a role for bacteria in shaping coronavirus infection. Taking cues from studies of enteric viruses, we initially investigated how bacterial surface components might improve CoV infection. Instead, we found that peptidoglycan-associated surfactin is a potent viricidal compound that disrupts virion integrity with broad activity against enveloped viruses. Our results indicate that interactions with commensal bacterial may improve or disrupt viral infections, highlighting the importance of understanding these microbial interactions and their implications for viral pathogenesis and treatment.","Johnson, Bryan A.; Hage, Adam; Kalveram, Birte; Mears, Megan; Plante, Jessica A.; Rodriguez, Sergio E.; Ding, Zhixia; Luo, Xuemei; Bente, Dennis; Bradrick, Shelton S.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Popov, Vsevolod; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Rossi, Shannan; Russell, William K.; Menachery, Vineet D.",J Virol,357,29

Former species are in fact groups of closely related species (or complexes); cryptic species frequently show high antifungal resistance.

New clinical breakpoints were released in February 2020 and one of the most relevant modifications was the definition of the new “susceptible, increased exposure” (formerly “intermediate”) category. Another relevant change was the adoption of the concept of area of technical uncertainty (ATU) that refers to problematic areas which involve uncertainty of susceptibility categorisation (e.g., when minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for susceptible and resistant organisms overlap). To accommodate both the new “susceptible, increased exposure” category and the concept of ATU, MICs of azoles and amphotericin B that fall in the former “intermediate” category have been automatically categorized as either R (amphotericin B) or ATU (triazoles).

As its contribution toward resolving this challenge, this study assessed the durability and morphological characteristics of high-strength performance bricks produced from a mixture of PET waste (PW) and foundry sand (FS). The PET waste bricks (PWBs) were produced through different proportioning (PW: FS) of 20%, 30%, and 40% of the dry mass of FS. The PWBs produced were tested for durability and compressive and tensile strengths and compared to fired clay bricks to evaluate their load-bearing capacity under compression and tension. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests were employed to analyze the morphological structure of the bricks. The test results revealed that the PWBs recorded an appreciable strength of 1.5–2 times that of fired clay bricks, and lower water absorption whilst retaining their ultimate strengths after complete immersion in water and acidic concentrations. The morphology of PWB possessed greater intercluster bonds on the surface compared to clay bricks. The findings demonstrate a reasonable methodological approach toward the production of masonry bricks using a mixture of PET waste and spent foundry sands.","Aneke, Frank Ikechukwu; Awuzie, Bankole Osita; Mostafa, Mohamed M.

Methods Among 22 COVID-19 patients, 19 underwent cEEGs, and 3 underwent routine EEGs (<1 hour). Demographic and clinical variables, including comorbid conditions, discharge disposition, survival and cEEG findings, were collected. Results cEEG was performed for evaluation of altered mental status (n=17) or seizure-like events (n=5). Five patients, including 2 with epilepsy, had epileptiform abnormalities on cEEG. Two patients had electrographic seizures without a prior epilepsy history. There were no acute neuroimaging findings. Periodic discharges were noted in one-third of patients and encephalopathic EEG findings were not associated with IV anesthetic use. Conclusions Interictal epileptiform abnormalities in the absence of prior epilepsy history were rare. However, the discovery of asymptomatic seizures in two of twenty-two patients was higher than previously reported and is therefore of concern. Significance cEEG monitoring in COVID-19 patients may aid in better understanding an epileptogenic potential of SARS-CoV2 infection.

As the major sensor of UPR in eukaryotes, IRE1, in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, catalyzes the unconventional splicing of HAC1 in yeast, bZIP60 in plants and XBP1 in metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IRE1p and HAC1 mRNA, the only UPR pathway found in yeast, evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust UPR induction. However, the functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of IRE1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established. Here, we report that IRE1 and its substrate bZIP60 function as a strictly cognate enzyme-substrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants. Moreover, we show that the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway, the other known branch of UPR in plants, does not play a detectable role in virus infection, demonstrating the distinct function of the IRE1-bZIP60 pathway in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that bZIP60 and HAC1, products of the enzyme-substrate duet, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with ER stress in yeast. Taken together, we conclude that the downstream signaling of the IRE1-mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants, and that the IRE1-bZIP60 UPR pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other UPR branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus-plant interactions.","Zhang, Lingrui; Chen, Hui; Brandizzi, Federica; Verchot, Jeanmarie; Wang, Aiming",PLoS Genet,357,22

The proportion of pilot homes with outbreaks, and outbreak size, were compared to non-pilot homes in Liverpool. Adherence to testing protocols was evaluated. Fifteen staff were interviewed, and transcript data were thematically coded using an iterative analysis to identify and categorize factors influencing testing implementation. RESULTS: In total, 1,638 LFD rapid tests were performed on 407 staff. Protocol adherence was poor with 8.6% of staff achieving >75% protocol adherence, and 25.3% achieving [Formula: see text] 50%. Six care homes had outbreaks during the study. Compared to non-pilot care homes, there was no evidence of significant difference in the proportion of homes with outbreaks, or the size of outbreaks. Qualitative data showed difficulty implementing testing strategies due to excessive work burden. Factors influencing adherence related to test integration and procedural factors, socio-economic factors, cognitive overload and the emotional value of testing.

CT was considered normal in 215 patients (20%) and inconclusive in 1 patient. The overall sensitivity of CT was 88%, specificity 76%, PPV 79%, and NPV 85%. At week-2, the same figures were 89%, 69%, 88% and 71% respectively and 60%, 84%, 30% and 95% respectively at week-6. At the end of confinement when the rate of positive PCR became extremely low the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of CT were 50%, 82%, 6% and 99% respectively. CONCLUSION: At the peak of the epidemic, chest CT had sufficiently high sensitivity and PPV to serve as a first-line positive diagnostic tool but at the end of the epidemic wave CT is more useful to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia.","Boussouar, Samia; Wagner, Mathilde; Donciu, Victoria; Pasi, Nicoletta; Salem, Joe Elie; Renard-Penna, Raphaele; Marot, Stéphane; Freund, Yonathan; Redheuil, Alban; Lucidarme, Olivier",PLoS One,357,1

Hospitals are integral to the control and prevention of COVID-19; however, they are facing numerous challenges during the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to introduce the practical experience of the design and implementation of a web-based COVID-19 service platform at a tertiary hospital in China as well as the preliminary results of the implementation. METHODS: The web-based COVID-19 service platform was deployed within the health care system of the Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital and Internet Hospital; the function of the platform was to provide web-based medical services for both members of the public and lay health care workers. The focal functions of this system included automated COVID-19 screening, related symptom monitoring, web-based consultation, and psychological support; it also served as a COVID-19 knowledge hub. The design and process of each function are introduced. The usage data for the platform service were collected and are represented by three periods: the pre-epidemic period (December 22, 2019, to January 22, 2020, 32 days), the controlled period (January 23 to March 31, 2020, 69 days), and the postepidemic period (April 1 to June 30, 2020, 91 days). RESULTS: By the end of June 2020, 96,642 people had used the automated COVID-19 screening and symptom monitoring systems 161,884 and 7,795,194 times, respectively. The number of general web-based consultation services per day increased from 30 visits in the pre-epidemic period to 122 visits during the controlled period, then dropped to 73 visits in the postepidemic period. The psychological counseling program served 636 clients during the epidemic period. For people who used the automated COVID-19 screening service, 160,916 (99.40%) of the total users were classified in the no risk category. 464 (0.29%) of the people were categorized as medium to high risk, and 12 people (0.01%) were recommended for further COVID-19 testing and treatment. Among the 96,642 individuals who used the COVID-19 related symptoms monitoring service, 6696 (6.93%) were symptomatic at some point during the monitoring period. Fever was the most frequently reported symptom, with 2684/6696 symptomatic people (40.1%) having had this symptom. Cough and sore throat were also relatively frequently reported by the 6696 symptomatic users (1657 people, 24.7%, and 1622 people, 24.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The web-based COVID-19 service platform implemented at a tertiary hospital in China is exhibited to be a role model for using digital health technologies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital solutions of automated COVID-19 screening, daily symptom monitoring, web-based care, and knowledge propagation have plausible acceptability and feasibility for complementing offline hospital services and facilitating disease control and prevention.","Lian, Wanmin; Wen, Li; Zhou, Qiru; Zhu, Weijie; Duan, Wenzhou; Xiao, Xiongzhi; Mhungu, Florence; Huang, Wenchen; Li, Chongchong; Cheng, Weibin; Tian, Junzhang",J Med Internet Res,357,12

The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.

These changes have occurred in parallel with systemic and structural changes in health care and higher education, both of which have experienced challenges with improving access and controlling costs, and have become a centerpiece of legislative and political discourse. At the same time, advances in technology have introduced new possibilities in education, with the emergence of online, blended, and “flipped” learning models that supplement or replace face-to-face instruction with distance learning. Hybrid education is a type of blended learning, utilizing both face-to-face and online instructional strategies. In a hybrid learning environment, online content may be delivered synchronously or asynchronously, replacing traditional face-to-face instructional time and reducing “seat time” for students. Recent attention has been brought to online and hybrid/blended learning in physical therapist education in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as programs have been required to abruptly move from face-to-face to remote instruction. Hybrid and other forms of blended learning strategies have been described at the physical therapist education course level. However, there is no literature describing hybrid learning implementation at the physical therapist education program “levels,” and there has been limited discussion on best practices for delivering hybrid, blended, and online instruction in physical therapist education. This perspective provides an overview of hybrid education, describes theoretical frameworks that guide implementation of a hybrid education curriculum, and discusses future directions for hybrid physical therapist education and educational research.","Gagnon, Kendra; Young, Brian; Bachman, Teresa; Longbottom, Thomas; Severin, Richard; Walker, Michael J",Phys Ther,357,20

It has fatality rate that floats from 5 to 15% and the symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia and/or fatigue up to dyspnea, responsible for hospitalization and in most of the cases of artificial oxygenation. In the attempt to understand how the virus spreads and how to pharmacologically abolish it, it was highlighted that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects human cells by means of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (M(pro)). Once bound to its receptor ACE2, the other two proteases, in concert with the receptor‐mediated signaling, allow virus replication and spread throughout the body. Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 in that its blockade by the virus increases Bradykinin and its metabolites, well known to facilitate inflammation in the lung (responsible for cough and fever), facilitate both the coagulation and complement system, three mechanisms that are typical of angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which symptoms occur in COVID‐19 patients. Thus, we propose to pharmacologically block the kallikrein‐kinin system upstream bradykinin and the ensuing inflammation, coagulation and complement activation by means of lanadelumab, which is a clinically approved drug for hereditary angioedema.","Colarusso, Chiara; Terlizzi, Michela; Pinto, Aldo; Sorrentino, Rosalinda",Br J Pharmacol,357,20

All of these behaviors are associated with non-communicable diseases and can interfere with immunity. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. High-energy “Western” diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Alcohol use and tobacco also have detrimental effects on the immune system. Therefore, population-wide body weight control, reduction of smoking rates and limitation of alcohol consumption are important preventive measures. Furthermore, sufficient restorative sleep is needed for adequate immune functioning. Appropriate lifestyle changes in regard to nutrition, exercise, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake may help shift the population distribution of infection risk and aid in preventing severe COVID-19 disease. Large-scale surveys should explore the effects of lifestyle changes, and the provision of reliable lifestyle information and effective interventions to individuals and communities during the pandemic is a pressing need.","Lange, Klaus W.; Nakamura, Yukiko",Glob Health J,357,1

Methods and Results: Suspensions of vaccinia poxvirus and endospores of Bacillus subtilis were used at defined concentrations as a model for poxviruses and spores of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), both of which are pathogens that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. Negative staining electron microscopy was performed directly or after sedimentation of these suspensions on to the sample supports using airfuge ultracentrifugation. For both virus and spores, the detection limit using direct adsorption of a 10‐μl sample volume onto the sample support was 10(6) particles per ml. Using airfuge ultracentrifugation with a sample volume of 80 μl, the detection limit could be reduced to 10(5) particles per ml for spores and to 5 × 10(4) particles per ml for poxviruses. The influence on particle detection of incubation time, washing and adsorption procedures was investigated. Conclusions: The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method were acceptable, particularly considering the small sample volume and low particle number applied onto the sample support. Significance and Impact of the Study: Diagnostic negative staining electron microscopy is used for the diagnosis of pathogens in emergency situations because it allows a rapid examination of all particulate matter down to the nanometre scale.

To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against the SA variant, we sought to perform as in vitro binding and neutralization assays, and in vivo animal studies.

Available evidence suggest they improve oxygenation in a subset of patients without changing long-term trajectory. Given the differences in respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and “traditional” ARDS, we sought to identify their physiologic impact. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients mechanically ventilated for COVID-19, from the ICUs of 2 tertiary care centers, who received inhaled epoprostenol (iEpo) for the management of hypoxemia. The primary outcome is change in PaO(2)/FiO(2). Additionally, we measured several patient level features to predict iEpo responsiveness (or lack thereof). RESULTS: Eighty patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV2 received iEpo while mechanically ventilated and had PaO(2)/FiO(2) measured before and after. The median PaO(2)/FiO(2) prior to receiving iEpo was 92 mmHg and interquartile range (74 – 122). The median change in PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 9 mmHg (-9 – 37) corresponding to a 10% improvement (-8 – 41). Fifty-percent (40 / 80) met our a priori definition of a clinically significant improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) (increase in 10% from the baseline value). Prone position and lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) when iEpo was started predicted a more robust response, which held after multivariate adjustment. For proned individuals, improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 14 mmHg (-6 to 45) vs. 3 mmHg (-11 – 20), p = 0.04 for supine individuals; for those with severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100, n = 49) the median improvement was 16 mmHg (-2 – 46). CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of patients have a clinically significant improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) after the initiation of iEpo. This suggests it is worth trying as a rescue therapy; although generally the benefit was modest with a wide variability. Those who were prone and had lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) were more likely to respond.","Sonti, Rajiv; Pike, C. William; Cobb, Nathan",J Intensive Care Med,357,24

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. METHODS: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from January to June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in R(t), levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. RESULTS: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced R(t). Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on < 10 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity. CONCLUSION: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS: We observed a total of 4267 (N=150 46), 4311 (N=17 409) and 3829 (N=15 015) positive tests indicative of the presence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 during the August, September and October 2020 serosurvey rounds, respectively. The adjusted seroprevalence declined from 28.39% (95% confidence interval [CI] 27.65 to 29.14) in August to 24.08% (95% CI 23.43 to 24.74) in September and 24.71% (95% CI 24.01 to 25.42) in October. On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of having antibody positivity (p<0.01).

We aimed to describe clinical and serological characteristics of children with HBoV hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection and to evaluate whether differences occur between HBoV alone and in co-infection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 60 children (median age of 6.2 months, range 0.6–70.9) hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, with HBoV detected from a respiratory sample, using a reverse transcriptase-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63 and HUK1, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus1–3, and human metapneumovirus). RESULTS: HBoV was detected alone in 29 (48.3%) patients, while in co-infection with other viruses in 31 patients (51.7%), with a peak between December and January. Among the 60 patients, 34 were bronchiolitis, 19 wheezing, 3 pneumonia, 2 upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 whooping cough. Seven children (11.6%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory failure. No differences was observed in age, family history for atopy and/or asthma, clinical presentations, chest X-ray, or laboratory findings in children with HBoV alone vs. multiple viral detection. RSV was the most frequently co-detected virus (61.3%). When compared with HBoV detection alone, the co-detection of RSV and HBoV was associated with male sex (P = 0.013), younger age (P = 0.01), and lower blood neutrophil count (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: HBoV can be detected alone and in co-infection respiratory samples of children with an acute respiratory tract infection. A cause–effect relationship between HBoV and respiratory infection is not clear, so further studies are needed to clarify this point.","Petrarca, Laura; Nenna, Raffaella; Frassanito, Antonella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Di Mattia, Greta; Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio",World J Pediatr,357,16

The RBD was fused to both a HiBIT tag and an IL6 secretion signal to enable facile collection from the cell culture media. The addition of culture media containing this protein, termed HiBIT-RBD, to cells expressing ACE2 led to binding that was specific to ACE2 and both time and concentration dependant, Binding could be inhibited by both RBD expressed in E. coli and by a full length S1 - Fc fusion protein (Fc-fused S1) expressed in eukaryotic cells. The mutation of residues that are known to play a role in the interaction of RBD with ACE2 also reduced binding. This assay may be used to identify drugs which inhibit the viral uptake into cells mediated by binding to ACE2.","Lima, Marcelo A.; Skidmore, Mark; Khanim, Farhat; Richardson, Alan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,357,5

METHODS: This research was conducted using online questionnaires. The questionnaires were compiled by students for a presentation at the Brescia Colloquium 2020. The participants were integrated undergraduate and graduate dental students from the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb. The questionnaires were completed by students during March 2020 and during February 2021 and were anonymous. For the statistical analysis of the data, the software package SPSS 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) was used. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine the basic statistical parameters (frequencies, median, mod, minimum and maximum values). The significance of the differences among the tested groups was assessed by the Chi-Square or the Fisher's Exact Tests. RESULTS: All dental students experienced some discomfort and were worried about the future competence. No gender differences were found (p>0.05). Preclinical students were less motivated than clinical students (p<0, 01) during first lockdown, while significant differences were found between preclinical and clinical students considering safety, competence and confidence to treat patients during second lockdown CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic impacted the wellbeing of the students, their learning and teaching at the School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb.

With the large majority of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals being asymptomatic, major concerns have been raised about possible long-term consequences of the infection. We developed an antigen capture assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in urine samples from COVID-19 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs (NP-PCR+). The study used a collection of 233 urine samples from 132 participants from Yale New Haven Hospital and the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia obtained during the pandemic (106 NP-PCR+ and 26 NP-PCR-) as well as a collection of 20 urine samples from 20 individuals collected before the pandemic. Our analysis identified 23 out of 91 (25%) NP-PCR+ adult participants with SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in urine (Ur-S+). Interestingly, although all NP-PCR+ children were Ur-S-, 1 NP-PCR- child was found to be positive for spike protein in urine. Of the 23 Ur-S+ adults, only 1 individual showed detectable viral RNA in urine. Our analysis further showed that 24% and 21% of NP-PCR+ adults have high levels of albumin and cystatin C in urine, respectively. Among individuals with albuminuria (>0.3 mg/mg of creatinine) statistical correlation could be found between albumin and spike protein in urine. Together, our data showed that 1 of 4 of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals develop renal abnormalities such as albuminuria.

In COVID-19, this process is believed to be associated with clinical severity. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS-13), are strong markers of endothelial dysfunction. We evaluated the impact of the VWF/ADAMTS-13 fraction on COVID-19 severity and prognosis. Materials and methods: A cohort study including 74 COVID-19 patients, with 22 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 52 to the medical ward (MW), was carried out. We also evaluated, in a group of 54 patients who were prospectively observed, whether variations in VWF/ADAMTS-13 correlated with the degree of severity and routine blood parameters. Results: A VWF:RCo/ADAMTS-13 fraction above 6.5 predicted in-hospital mortality in the entire cohort. At admission, a VWF:RCo/ADAMTS-13 fraction above 5.7 predicted admission to the ICU. Furthermore, the VWF:RCo/ADAMTS-13 fraction directly correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (Spearman r: 0.51, p < 0.0001) and D-dimer (Spearman r: 0.26, p = 0.03). In the prospective cohort, dynamic changes in VWF:RCo/ADAMTS-13 and the CRP concentration were directly correlated (Spearman r, p = 0.0014). This relationship was significant in both groups (ICU: p = 0.006; MW: p = 0.02).Conclusions: The present findings show that in COVID-19, the VWF/ADAMTS-13 fraction predicts in-hospital mortality. The VWF/ADAMTS-13 fraction may be a helpful tool to monitor COVID-19 patients throughout hospitalization.","Tiscia, Giovanni; Favuzzi, Giovanni; De Laurenzo, Antonio; Cappucci, Filomena; Fischetti, Lucia; Colaizzo, Donatella; Chinni, Elena; Florio, Lucia; Miscio, Giuseppe; Piscitelli, Angela Pamela; Mastroianno, Mario; Grandone, Elvira",Diagnostics (Basel),357,16

Very little is known about the occurrence and characteristic of cardiac arrest in critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated at the intensive care unit (ICU). The aim was to investigate the incidence and outcome of intensive care unit cardiac arrest (ICU-CA) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively recorded data of all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted (27 February 2020–14 January 2021) at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). Of 183 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 18% (n = 33) had ICU-CA. The median age of the study population was 63 (55–73) years and 66% (n = 120) were male. Demographic characteristics and comorbidities did not differ significantly between patients with and without ICU-CA. Simplified Acute Physiological Score II (SAPS II) (ICU-CA: median 44 points vs. no ICU-CA: 39 points) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (median 12 points vs. 7 points) on admission were significantly higher in patients with ICU-CA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present in 91% (n = 30) with and in 63% (n = 94) without ICU-CA (p = 0.002). Mechanical ventilation was more common in patients with ICU-CA (97% vs. 67%). The median stay in ICU before CA was 6 (1–17) days. A total of 33% (n = 11) of ICU-CAs occurred during the first 24 h of ICU stay. The initial rhythm was non-shockable (pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole) in 91% (n = 30); 94% (n = 31) had sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The median time to ROSC was 3 (1–5) minutes. Patients with ICU-CA had significantly higher ICU mortality (61% vs. 37%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the presence of ARDS (odds ratio (OR) 4.268, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.211–15.036; p = 0.024) and high SAPS II (OR 1.031, 95% CI 0.997–1.065; p = 0.077) were independently associated with the occurrence of ICU-CA.

She also had multiple confirmed ill COVID-19 contacts at her workplace before the onset of her symptoms. Funduscopic examination and multimodal imaging revealed placoid lesions in the macula and midperiphery of both eyes consistent with ampiginous choroiditis. COVID-19 antibody testing returned positive for IgG, and an extensive systemic evaluation was otherwise unremarkable. She was treated with oral prednisone and azathioprine with stabilization of the retinal lesions and no progression of her symptoms.

We aimed to investigate the changes in pancreatic density on CT and its correlation with amylase/lipase values in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Materials and methods Radiological changes using non-contrast CT and amylase/lipase values were evaluated retrospectively in patients admitted to the pandemic clinic. The patients were classified into two groups: [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive and PCR-negative]. The correlation and difference between the data were evaluated statistically. Results There was no significant difference with respect to age and gender between the two groups (PCR-positive and PCR-negative). There was a significant difference in the head, neck, trunk, and tail of the pancreas and mean density values, but no statistically significant difference in amylase and lipase values between the two groups. No significant correlation was found using Spearman’s correlation test. Conclusion Based on our findings, pancreatic involvement and severe necrotizing pancreatitis can be seen in COVID-19 patients. Pancreatic involvement is more common in patients with severe disease. Patients with gastrointestinal complaints should be evaluated for pancreatitis and their amylase/lipase values should be assessed. We believe that decreased pancreatic density on CT scans can be an early sign of pancreatitis.","Bozdag, Ahmet; Eroglu, Yesim; Sagmak Tartar, Ayse; Gundogan Bozdag, Pinar; Aglamis, Serpil",Cureus,357,1

METHODS: Four primary outcome measures, namely the quality of life (QOL), maximum urine flow ratio (UFR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and prostate volumes, as well as four urethra-related and 35 non-urethra-related symptoms, were investigated to evaluate the effects on 31 BPH patients subjected to WM (Terazosin Hydrochloride Hytrin, THH) and 30 cases to TCM (herbal Saxifrage tablet, HST). The effects of both treatments are compared by the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The contributions of symptoms for four assessments are analysed by the logistic regression model and the Chow test. RESULTS: The effect of TCM is weaker than that of WM in the assessment of the IPSS score (p < 0.05), and both treatments are similar in the prostate volumes, the maximum UFR and the QOL assessments (p > 0.05), as well as in the effective number of urethra-related or non-urethra-related symptoms before and after treatment (p > 0.05). By comparing the linear regression models, different urethra-related and non-urethra-related symptom patterns associated with TCM and WM therapies are detected for four assessments, especially for the prostate volume assessment (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: TCM (HST) is a potentially effective treatment in improving the QOL, prostate volumes and maximum UFR for patients with BPH, though it is less effective in ameliorating the IPSS score when compared with WM (THH). The non-urethra-related symptoms experienced by BPH patients might be one of the parameters to further achieve the tailored diagnosis and treatment for BPH.","Li, Shao; Lu, Aiping; Wang, Yongyan",Complement Ther Med,357,18

Telemedicine has been suggested to manage acute complaints and divert patients from in-person care. Objectives The objective of this study was to describe and assess the impact of a rapidly scaled virtual urgent care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a virtual urgent care platform over one month during the COVID-19 pandemic surge. We described scaling our telemedicine urgent care capacity, described patient clinical characteristics, assessed for emergency department (ED) referrals, and analyzed post-visit surveys. Results During the study period, a total of 17,730 patients were seen via virtual urgent care. 454 (2.56%) were referred to an ED. The most frequent diagnoses were COVID-19 related or upper respiratory symptoms. Geospatial analysis indicated a wide catchment area. 251 providers were onboarded to the platform; at peak, 62 providers supplied 364 hours of coverage in one day. The average patient satisfaction score was 4.4/5. 2,668 patients (15.05%) responded to the post-visit survey; 1,236 (49.35%) would have sought care in an ED (11.86%) or in-person urgent care (37.49%). Conclusions A virtual urgent care was scaled to manage a volume of more than 800 patients a day across a large catchment area during the pandemic surge. About half of patients would have otherwise presented to an ED or urgent care in-person. Virtual urgent care is an option for appropriate patients while minimizing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Koziatek, Christian A.; Rubin, Ada; Lakdawala, Viraj; Lee, David C.; Swartz, Jordan; Auld, Elizabeth; Smith, Silas W.; Reddy, Harita; Jamin, Catherine; Testa, Paul; Femia, Robert; Caspers, Christopher",J Emerg Med,357,2

The main stressful factors reported by students were: adjustment to the new academic activities (23.3 %), lack of autonomy (19.4%), and conflicts with family members (6.8%). The three main areas impaired were: changes in the sleeping pattern (68%), difficulty in concentration (67%), and loss of energy (58.6%). Furthermore, 36% of our student sample reported being suffering from anxiety symptoms, whereas 26% showed depressive symptomatology. Students having previous psychological and psychiatric contacts with mental health services (23%) showed a more severe traumatic and depressive symptomatology. The problematic thinking style “all or nothing” was predominantly associated with psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms. “Everything Will Be Fine” could be identified by the “optimistic style” (27.2%), inversely correlated with the psychopathological measures and concentration problems. The results of the logistic regression analysis indicated that the length of home confinement (second month) seemed to increase by over 3 times the likelihood of experience posttraumatic symptomatology, and a thinking style “all or nothing” was the final strongest predictor increasing the risk by over 5 times. The implementation of psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable young subgroups to contain the structuring of psychopathological profiles represent a fundamental challenge.","Giusti, Laura; Salza, Anna; Mammarella, Silvia; Bianco, Denise; Ussorio, Donatella; Casacchia, Massimo; Roncone, Rita",Front Psychiatry,357,22

A pre-operative computed tomography scan showed widespread interstitial pneumonitis. However, the surgery went ahead given concerns over tumour progression, albeit with a lesser resection to preserve lung tissue as the patient was slightly hypoxic.

Here, we report a proof-of-concept approach for the development of quantitative, multiplexed flow cytometry-based serological and neutralization assays. The serology assays test the IgG and IgM against both the full-length spike antigens and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike antigen. Benchmarking against an RBD-specific SARS-CoV IgG reference standard, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titer was quantified in the range of 37.6 µg/mL to 31.0 ng/mL. The quantitative assays are highly specific with no correlative cross-reactivity with the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses. We further demonstrated good correlation between anti-RBD antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers. The suite of serology and neutralization assays help to improve measurement confidence and are complementary and foundational for clinical and epidemiologic studies.","Tian, Linhua; Elsheikh, Elzafir B.; Patrone, Paul N.; Kearsley, Anthony J.; Gaigalas, Adolfas K.; Inwood, Sarah; Lin-Gibson, Sheng; Esposito, Dominic; Wang, Lili",Int J Mol Sci,357,17

An integrated health-care system offers advantages in response to the community outbreak and transmission of highly infectious diseases. On the basis of practitioner experience with a pioneering integrated health-care system in Shenzhen, China, this article presents the following effective strategies in response to the epidemic: (1) enhance the public workforce in primary health care; (2) integrate resources to allow regional sharing and efficient use; (3) employ teams centered on general practitioners for community containment; and (4) adopt e-health and telemedicine for health-care delivery. An integrated health-care system is usually very specific to a particular regional context; however, the core strategies and mechanisms based on the Luohu model can contribute to improving the public health capacity in emergency responses; they can transform health-care delivery in the COVID-19 epidemic.

In addition to these known mutations, other new mutations have been found across regions in this study. Based on the results, in which 4,326 SARS-CoV-2 whole sequences were used, some mutations are found to be peculiar with certain regions, while some other mutations are found in all regions. In Asia, mutations (3 different mutations in QLA46612 isolated from South Korea) were found in the same sequence. Although huge number of mutations are detected (more than 70 in Asia) by regions, according to bioinformatics tools, some of them which are G75V (isolated from North America), T95I (isolated from South Korea), G143V (isolated from North America), M177I (isolated from Asia), L293M (isolated from Asia), P295H (isolated from Asia), T393P (isolated from Europe), P507S (isolated from Asia), and D614G (isolated from all regions) (These color used only make correct) predicted a damage to spike’ protein structure. Furthermore, this study also aimed to reveal how binding sites of ligands change if the spike protein structure is damaged, and whether more than one mutation affects ligand binding. Mutations that were predicted to damage the structure did not affect the ligand-binding sites, whereas ligands’ binding sites were affected in those with multiple mutations. It is thought that this study will give a different perspective to both the vaccine SARS-CoV studies and the change in the structure of the spike protein belonging to this virus against mutations.","Aktas, Emre",Bioinform Biol Insights,357,1

Methods: Cohort study (population-based) including 79,083 people >=50 years-old in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). At study start (01/03/2020) baseline cohort characteristics (demographic, previous comorbidities, chronic medications and vaccinations history) were recorded. Primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed COVID19 incurred in cohort members throughout 01/03/2020-30/06/2020. Risk of suffering COVID19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age/sex and previous comorbidities. Results: Across study period, 536 laboratory-confirmed COVID19 cases were observed (mean incidence: 39.5 cases per 100,000 persons-week). In multivariable-analysis, age/years (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02; p=0.050), nursing-home (HR: 20.19; 95% CI: 15.98-25.51; p<0.001), neurological disease (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.77; p=0.029), taking diuretics (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.10-1.75; p=0.006), antiplatelet (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76; p=0.021) and benzodiazepines (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.53; p=0.047) significantly increased risk; while smoking (HR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.41-0.80; p=0.001), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61-1.00; p=0.048), angiotensin II receptor blockers (HR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.51-0.96; p=0.027) and statins (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.96; p=0.025) were associated with reduced risk. Among non-institutionalised persons, cancer, renal and cardiac disease appeared also related to increased risk, whereas influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk. Conclusion: In a setting with relatively low incidence of COVID19 across the first wave of pandemic period, age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID19 among middle-aged/older adults. Conversely, statins, angiotensin-receptor blockers/inhibitors and influenza vaccination were related with decreased risk.

As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate. In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA® from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.","BORDEHORE, CESAR; Navarro, Miriam; Herrador, Zaida; Fonfria, Eva S.",,357,33

This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as ‘affected group’ and ‘unaffected group’ on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS: Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population’s mental state.","Lei, Lei; Huang, Xiaoming; Zhang, Shuai; Yang, Jinrong; Yang, Lin; Xu, Min",Med Sci Monit,357,18

The major factor that drives resistance rates globally is spread. The COVID-19 pandemic should lead to improved infection prevention and control practices, both in healthcare facilities and the community. COVID-19 will also have ongoing and profound effects on local, national and international travel. All these factors should lead to a decrease in the spread of resistant bacteria. So overall, COVID-19 should lead to a fall in resistance rates seen in many countries. For this debate we show why, overall, COVID-19 will not result in increased AMR prevalence. But globally, changes in AMR rates will not be uniform. In wealthier and developed countries, resistance rates will likely decrease, but in many other countries there are already too many factors associated with poor controls on the spread of bacteria and viruses (e.g. poor water and sanitation, poor public health, corrupt government, inadequate housing, etc.).

This magnitude, termed the critical immunization threshold (q), can be obtained from the classical SIR model equilibrium equation, equaling (1 - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where R0 is the basic reproduction number and{epsilon} is the vaccine efficacy. When a significant proportion of the population is already immune, this becomes (n - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where n is the proportion of non-immune individuals. A similar equation can be obtained for short-term immunization thresholds(qt), which are dependent on Rt. qs for most countries are between 60-75% of the population. Current qt for most countries are between 20-40%. Therefore, the combination of gradual vaccination and other non-pharmaceutical interventions will mark the transition to the herd immunity, providing that the later turns out to be a feasible objective. Nevertheless, immunization through vaccination is a complex issue and many challenges might appear.","Balbas, Luis Alfredo Bautista; Conesa, Mario Gil; Balbas, Blanca Bautista; Jimenez, Ainhoa Alcaide; Caravaca, Gil Rodriguez",,357,29
