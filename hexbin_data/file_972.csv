Data on the rates of pituitary dysfunction and recovery in a large cohort of NFPA patients undergoing ETSS and the predictors of endocrine function before and after ETSS are scarce. This study is purposed to analyze the comprehensive changes in hormonal function and identify factors that predict recovery or worsening of hormonal axes following ETSS for NFPA. METHODS: A retrospective review of 601 consecutive patients who underwent ETSS between 2010 and 2018 at one institution was performed. Recovery or development of new hypopituitarism was analyzed in 209 NFPA patients who underwent ETSS. RESULTS: Patients with preoperative endocrine deficits (59.8%) in one or more pituitary axes had larger tumor volumes (P = 0.001) than those without preoperative deficits. Recovery of preoperative pituitary deficit occurred in all four axes, with overall mean recovery of 29.7%. The cortisol axis showed the highest recovery whereas the thyroid axis showed the lowest, with 1-year cumulative recovery rates of 44.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Postoperative hypopituitarism occurred overall in 17.2%, most frequently in the thyroid axis (24.3%, 27/111) and least frequently in the cortisol axis (9.7%, 16/165). Axis-specific predictors of post-operative recovery and deficiency were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic alterations in pituitary hormones were observed in a proportion of patients following ETSS in NFPA patients. Postoperative endocrine vulnerability, recovery, and factors that predicted recovery or loss of endocrine function depended on the hormonal system, necessitating an axis-specific surveillance strategy postoperatively.","Hwang, Jenie Y; Aum, Diane J; Chicoine, Michael R; Dacey, Ralph G; Osbun, Joshua W; Rich, Keith M; Zipfel, Gregory J; Klatt-Cromwell, Cristine N; McJunkin, Jonathan L; Pipkorn, Patrik; Schneider, John S; Silverstein, Julie M; Kim, Albert H",Pituitary,972,20

While many initial screening protocols centered around laboratory detection of the virus, early testing assays were thought to be poorly sensitive in comparison to chest computed tomography, especially in asymptomatic disease. Coupled with shortages of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing kits in many parts of the world, these regions instead turned to the use of advanced imaging as a first-line screening modality. However, in contrast to previous Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus epidemics, chest X-ray has not demonstrated optimal sensitivity to be of much utility in first-line screening protocols. Though current national and international guidelines recommend for the use of RT-PCR as the primary screening tool for suspected cases of COVID-19, institutional and regional protocols must consider local availability of resources when issuing universal recommendations. Successful containment and social mitigation strategies worldwide have been thus far predicated on unified governmental responses, though the underlying ideologies of these practices may not be widely applicable in many Western nations. As the strain on the radiology workforce continues to mount, early results indicate a promising role for the use of machine-learning algorithms as risk stratification schema in the months to come.","Fields, Brandon K K; Demirjian, Natalie L; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,972,20

This study evaluates the impact of using simulated electronic health records (sEHR) for inpatients, and electronic problem-based learning (e-PBL) and online virtual medical interviews (online-VMI) for outpatients, for an online-sCP using a learning management system (LMS) and online meeting system facilitated by a supervising physician. METHODS: The sEHR was reviewed by medical students and subsequently discussed with a supervising physician using an online meeting system. In the e-PBL, medical students reviewed the simulated patients and discussed on the LMS. For the online-VMI, a faculty member acted as an outpatient and a student acted as the doctor. Small groups of students discussed the clinical reasoning process using the online meeting system. A mixed-method design was implemented. Medical students self-assessed their clinical competence before and after the online-sCP. They answered questionnaires and participated in semi-structured focus group interviews (FGIs) regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the practice. RESULTS: Forty-three students completed the online-sCP during May and June 2020. All students indicated significant improvement in all aspects of self-evaluation of clinical performance after the online-sCP. Students using sEHR reported significant improvement in writing daily medical records and medical summaries. Students using e-PBL and online-VMI reported significant improvement in medical interviews and counseling. Students also indicated CCs as more useful for learning associated with medical interviews, physical examinations, and humanistic qualities like professionalism than the online-sCP. Eight FGIs were conducted (n = 42). The advantages of online-sCP were segregated into five categories (learning environment, efficiency, accessibility, self-paced learning, and interactivity); meanwhile, the disadvantages of online-sCP were classified into seven categories (clinical practice experience, learning environment, interactivity, motivation, memory retention, accessibility, and extraneous cognitive load). CONCLUSIONS: Online-sCP with sEHR, e-PBL, and online-VMI could be useful in learning some of the clinical skills acquired through CC. These methods can be implemented with limited preparation and resources.","Kasai, Hajime; Shikino, Kiyoshi; Saito, Go; Tsukamoto, Tomoko; Takahashi, Yukiko; Kuriyama, Ayaka; Tanaka, Kazuhisa; Onodera, Misaki; Yokoh, Hidetaka; Tatusmi, Koichiro; Yoshino, Ichiro; Ikusaka, Masatomi; Sakao, Seiichiro; Ito, Shoichi",BMC Med Educ,972,24

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective double-blinded cohort. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained intraoperatively from 164 pediatric patients undergoing outpatient adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy with or without pressure equalization tubes (PETs) and were analyzed with PCR for the presence of 22 known URIs, including SARS-CoV-2. Surgeons and families were blinded to the results. At the conclusion of the study, rates of detectable infection were determined and intraoperative and postoperative events (unexpected admissions, length of PACU stay, rates of laryngospasm/bronchospasm, oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, and postoperative presentation to an emergency department) were compared between infected and uninfected patients. RESULTS: Of the 164 patients (50% male, 50% female, ages 8 mo-18 y), 136 patients (82.9%) tested positive for one or more URI at the time of surgery. Forty one patients (25.0%) tested positive for three or more URIs concurrently, and 11 (6.7%) tested positive for five or more URIs concurrently. There were no significant differences in admission rates, length of PACU stay, rates of laryngospasm/bronchospasm, oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, or postoperative presentation to an emergency department between positive and negative patients. No patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: A recent positive URI test does not confer any additional intraoperative or postoperative risk in the setting of outpatient adenoidectomy/tonsillectomy in healthy patients. There is no utility in preoperative URI testing, and delaying surgery due to a recent positive URI test is not warranted in this population.

With the spread of the disease, similar cases have also been confirmed in other regions of China. We aimed to report the imaging and clinical characteristics of these patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: All patients with laboratory-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected between January 23, 2020, and February 4, 2020, in a designated hospital (Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital). This analysis included 90 patients (39 men and 51 women; median age, 50 years (age range, 18–86 years). All the included SARS-CoV-2-infected patients underwent non-contrast enhanced chest computed tomography (CT). We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the distribution characteristics, pattern, morphology, and accompanying manifestations of lung lesions. In addition, after 1–6 days (mean 3.5 days), follow-up chest CT images were evaluated to assess radiological evolution. FINDINGS: The majority of infected patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan or to infected patients and mostly presented with fever and cough. More than half of the patients presented bilateral, multifocal lung lesions, with peripheral distribution, and 53 (59%) patients had more than two lobes involved. Of all included patients, COVID-19 pneumonia presented with ground glass opacities in 65 (72%), consolidation in 12 (13%), crazy paving pattern in 11 (12%), interlobular thickening in 33 (37%), adjacent pleura thickening in 50 (56%), and linear opacities combined in 55 (61%). Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and lymphadenopathy were uncommon findings. In addition, baseline chest CT did not show any abnormalities in 21 patients (23%), but 3 patients presented bilateral ground glass opacities on the second CT after 3–4 days. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be confirmed based on the patient’s history, clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and laboratory tests. Chest CT examination plays an important role in the initial diagnosis of the novel coronavirus pneumonia. Multiple patchy ground glass opacities in bilateral multiple lobular with periphery distribution are typical chest CT imaging features of the COVID-19 pneumonia.","Xu, Xi; Yu, Chengcheng; Qu, Jing; Zhang, Lieguang; Jiang, Songfeng; Huang, Deyang; Chen, Bihua; Zhang, Zhiping; Guan, Wanhua; Ling, Zhoukun; Jiang, Rui; Hu, Tianli; Ding, Yan; Lin, Lin; Gan, Qingxin; Luo, Liangping; Tang, Xiaoping; Liu, Jinxin",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,972,26
