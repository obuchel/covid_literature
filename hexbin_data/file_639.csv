Under mild conditions, aldazines undergo the addition of pinacolborane in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst, which delivered N-boryl-N-benzyl hydrazone products. Notably, the reaction is highly selective, and results in exclusive mono-hydroboration and desymmetrization of symmetrical aldazines.

In this work, a virtual laboratory for a family of centrifugal pumps has been developed. Cavitation development within the centrifugal pumps and the pumps performances in pipeline networks were studied. Negative potential head and high fluid temperature increased early cavitation incidence, while low fluid temperature, as well as positive potential head reduced it. The choice of pipe diameter and its roughness factor played significant roles in the pumps' performance. The study shows that virtual laboratory represents a good training environment that enables precise pipeline and pump flow matching.","Oyewola, O. M.; Oloketuyi, S. I.; Badmus, I.; Ajide, O.

233707,Serological Test to Determine Exposure to SARS-CoV-2: ELISA Based on the Receptor-Binding Domain of the Spike Protein (S-RBDN318-V510) Expressed in Escherichia coli,2021,"New vaccines are urgently needed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which kills more than 1.4 million people each year. CD4 T cell differentiation is a key determinant of protective immunity against Mtb, but it is not fully understood how host-pathogen interactions shape individual antigen-specific T cell populations and their protective capacity. Here, we investigated the immunodominant Mtb antigen, MPT70, which is upregulated in response to gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) or nutrient/oxygen deprivation of in vitro-infected macrophages. Using a murine aerosol infection model, we compared the in vivo expression kinetics of MPT70 to a constitutively expressed antigen, ESAT-6, and analyzed their corresponding CD4 T cell phenotype and vaccine protection. For wild-type Mtb, we found that in vivo expression of MPT70 was delayed compared to ESAT-6. This delayed expression was associated with induction of less differentiated MPT70-specific CD4 T cells but, compared to ESAT-6, also reduced protection after vaccination. In contrast, infection with an MPT70-overexpressing Mtb strain promoted highly differentiated KLRG1+CX3CR1+ CD4 T cells with limited lung-homing capacity. Importantly, this differentiated phenotype could be prevented by vaccination, and against the overexpressing strain, vaccination with MPT70 conferred protection similar to vaccination with ESAT-6. Together, our data indicate that high in vivo antigen expression drives T cells toward terminal differentiation and that targeted vaccination with adjuvanted protein can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining T cells in a protective less differentiated state. These observations shed new light on host-pathogen interactions and provide guidance on how future Mtb vaccines can be designed to tip the immune balance in favor of the host.IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis, caused by Mtb, constitutes a global health crisis of massive proportions and the impact of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to cause a rise in tuberculosis-related deaths. Improved vaccines are therefore needed more than ever, but a lack of knowledge on protective immunity hampers their development. The present study shows that constitutively expressed antigens with high availability drive highly differentiated CD4 T cells with diminished protective capacity, which could be a survival strategy by Mtb to evade T cell immunity against key antigens. We demonstrate that immunization with such antigens can counteract this phenomenon by maintaining antigen-specific T cells in a state of low differentiation. Future vaccine strategies should therefore explore combinations of multiple highly expressed antigens and we suggest that T cell differentiation could be used as a readily measurable parameter to identify these in both preclinical and clinical studies.","Clemmensen, Helena Strand; Dube, Jean-Yves; McIntosh, Fiona; Rosenkrands, Ida; Jungersen, Gregers; Aagaard, Claus; Andersen, Peter; Behr, Marcel A; Mortensen, Rasmus",mBio (Online),,639

PURPOSE: A common denial trend that occurs with ""outpatient medical benefit drugs"" is payers not requiring or permitting prior authorization (PA) proactively, yet denying the drug after administration for medical necessity. In this situation, a preemptive strategy of complying with payer-mandated requirements is critical for revenue protection. To address this need, our institution incorporated a medical necessity review into its existing closed-loop, pharmacy-managed precertification and denials management program. SUMMARY: Referrals for targeted payers and high-dollar medical benefit drugs not eligible for PA and deemed high risk for denial were incorporated into the review. Payer medical policies were evaluated and clinical documentation assessed to confirm alignment. This descriptive report outlines the medical necessity workflow as a component of the larger precertification process, details the decision-making process when performing the review, and delineates the roles and responsibilities for involved team members. A total of 526 drug orders were evaluated from September 2018 to August 2019, with 146 interventions completed. Of the 761 individual claims affected by proactive medical necessity review, 99.2% resulted in payment and less than 1% resulted in revenue loss, safeguarding more than $5.3 million in annual institutional drug reimbursement. At the time of analysis, there were only 3 cases of revenue loss. CONCLUSION: Our institution's pharmacy-managed medical necessity review program for high-dollar outpatient drugs safeguards reimbursement for therapies not eligible for payer PA. It is a revenue cycle best practice that can be replicated at other institutions.","Hawes, Emily M; Misita, Caron P; Amerine, Lindsey B; Francart, Suzanne J",Am. j. health system pharm,,639
256437,Dynamic Profiling of Binding and Allosteric Propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Different Classes of Antibodies: Mutational and Perturbation-Based Scanning Reveals the Allosteric Duality of Functionally Adaptable Hotspots,2021,"Simple SummaryVirus-like particles (VLPs) have attracted significant interest as immunotherapy platforms and cancer vaccines for inducing antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. We prepared a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) cancer vaccine, by conjugating the HER2-derived CH401 epitope to the external surface of Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-like particles via copper-free click chemistry. Another candidate was prepared by loading Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists as adjuvant into the interior cavity of PhMV-CH401—although the addition of the adjuvant conferred no additional immune priming. The VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidate was administered subcutaneously, using a prime-boost immunization schedule and BALB/c mice. The vaccine candidate elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased the toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor challenge studies demonstrated efficacy, as evident from the delayed onset of tumor growth and the prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. naïve BALB/C mice.AbstractTo develop a human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-specific cancer vaccine, using a plant virus-like particle (VLP) platform. Copper-free click chemistry and infusion encapsulation protocols were developed to prepare VLPs displaying the HER2-derived CH401 peptide epitope, with and without Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists loaded into the interior cavity of the VLPs;Physalis mottle virus (PhMV)-based VLPs were used. After prime-boost immunization of BALB/c mice through subcutaneous administration of the vaccine candidates, sera were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the CH401-specific antibodies;Th1 vs. Th2 bias was determined by antibody subtyping and splenocyte assay. Efficacy was assessed by tumor challenge using DDHER2 tumor cells. We successful developed two VLP-based anti-HER2 vaccine candidates—PhMV-CH401 vs. CpG-PhMV-CH401;however, the addition of the CpG adjuvant did not confer additional immune priming. Both VLP-based vaccine candidates elicited a strong immune response, including high titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increased toxicity of antisera to DDHER2 tumor cells. DDHER2 tumor growth was delayed, leading to prolonged survival of the vaccinated vs. naïve BALB/C mice. The PhMV-based anti-HER2 vaccine PhMV-CH401, demonstrated efficacy as an anti-HER2 cancer vaccine. Our studies highlight that VLPs derived from PhMV are a promising platform to develop cancer vaccines.","Hu, He Steinmetz Nicole F.",Cancers,,639

If the learning motivation cannot be improved, then the achievement will not be optimal as well. Moreover, the current pandemic time decreases students’ motivation. The use of reward and punishment method is an alternative to raise students’ learning motivation. The purpose of this research was to observe the use of BION (Bintang Online) in improving the learning motivation of 5th grade students in State Elementary School 1 of Ngembel amidst the pandemic where physical distancing is simply a logical consequence. The supporting instruments were (1) observation sheet, (2) questionnaire sheet, (3) documentation photo, and (4) interview sheet. The data were collected using 4 methods: (1) observation, (2) questionnaire, (3) documentation, and (4) interview. The effect of BION medium was fairly positive based on the obtained result. Based on the observation result, the post-cycle, compared to the pre-cycle, had 22% improvements in assignment completion, 27% improvement in punctuality, and 22% improvement in criteria mastery. Another reference came from the questionnaire;in the 3rd point, 100% of the students felt that BION was able to raise their motivation. The interview with the parents, regarding the effect of BION on the students’ intrinsic motivation to learn independently, also showed similar result. Based on these data, it is concluded that BION is effective in improving the students’ learning motivation during the pandemic.

In the context of human cancers, there is evidence that ACE2 might function as a tumor suppressor. The expression levels of ACE2 among the different subtypes of breast cancer has not been investigated. METHODS: We have examined the differential expression of ACE2 and its correlation with prognosis in breast cancer subtypes using the METABRIC (n = 1898) and TCGA (n = 832) cohorts. Correlations were evaluated by Pearsons's correlation co-efficient and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate differences in disease-free survival between the ACE2 high and ACE2 low groups. RESULTS: There is minimal expression of ACE2 in the luminal classes, but significantly higher levels in the Basal-like and HER2-enriched subclasses. Metastatic biopsies of these tumor types also show enhanced expression of ACE2. High levels of ACE2 correlated with decreased disease-free survival in the HER2-enriched subtype, and it was positively correlated with EGFR expression. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest ACE2 might function as a context dependent factor driving tumor progression in breast cancer and permit new opportunities for targeted therapy.","Nair, Madhumathy G; Prabhu, Jyothi S; Ts, Sridhar",Cancer Treat Res Commun,,639

Here, milk samples from 8 COVID-19-recovered and 7 COVID-19-suspected donors were tested for antibody (Ab) binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. All samples exhibited significant specific IgA reactivity to the full Spike, while 80% exhibited significant IgA and secretory (s)Ab binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Additionally, 67% of samples exhibited IgG and/or IgM binding to RBD. IgA and sAb titers were highly correlated, indicating most IgA to be sIgA. Overall, these data indicate that a robust sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in human milk after infection should be expected in a significant majority of individuals. Further research is highly warranted to determine Ab functionality, and the potential for exploiting extracted milk sIgA for therapeutic use.","Fox, Alisa; Marino, Jessica; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Hahn-Holbrook, Jennifer; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Powell, Rebecca L",iScience,,639

This includes actual and potential future impacts on Australia's three national screening programs for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. These programs aim to improve cancer outcomes through an organised approach to the early detection of cancer and precancer in asymptomatic populations. The design of each program varies according to biological differences in the three cancers, the available screening technology, the target population, and variations in their administration of Australia's federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The observed and potential impacts of COVID-19 on these programs, and on related activities such as the current national enquiry into lung cancer screening feasibility, therefore vary significantly. This article focuses on observed short-term impacts, adaptations and the longer-term outlook for cancer screening in relation to COVID-19. It summarises potential responses to minimise the harms of disruptions caused by COVID-19, and highlights research and policy opportunities in the pandemic response and recovery which could inform and accelerate optimisation of cancer screening in the long term.","Feletto, Eleonora; Grogan, Paul; Dickson, Carolyn; Smith, Megan; Canfell, Karen",Public Health Res.

In October-November 2020, a questionnaire examination and measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were performed in a random sample of the general population (n = 1167). The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies and to assess their host-related correlates. The prevalence of IgG seropositivity was 11.4% (95% CI: 9.5-13.2%) and IgM seropositivity was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.5-5.8%). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was found in 4.8% of subjects. A positive IgG test was statistically significantly associated with age (inverse relationship), a person's contact with a COVID-19 patient, quarantine, and two symptoms in the past: fever and loss of smell/taste. Positive IgG tests were less prevalent in subjects who had diagnoses of arterial hypertension, diabetes, or rheumatologic disorders. IgM test positivity was associated with quarantine and loss of smell/taste only with no effect of chronic diseases found.

Croatia is still a low-risk country for the HIV epidemic, thanks in part to the establishment of 10 Centers for Voluntary, Anonymous and Free HIV Counseling and Testing (VCT). Risk perception of contracting a sexually transmitted disease is described as one’s own assessment of the possibility of getting it. Health behaviors, and thus risk perception, can be explained by various models and theories, and one of the accepted models is the socio-cognitive model of health beliefs (Health Belief Model-HBM). Health literacy is defined as personal, cognitive, and social skills that determine an individual’s ability to access, understand, and use health data. Cyberchodria is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive research of health content over the Internet.

However, if these measures are implemented for a long period of time, they can result in adverse modification of people's health perceptions and lifestyle behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-national survey was to address the lack of adequate real-time data on the public response to changes in lifestyle behavior during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-national web-based survey was administered using Google Forms during the month of April 2020. The settings were China, Japan, Italy, and India. There were two primary outcomes: (1) response to the health scale, defined as perceived health status, a combined score of health-related survey items; and (2) adoption of healthy lifestyle choices, defined as the engagement of the respondent in any two of three healthy lifestyle choices (healthy eating habits, engagement in physical activity or exercise, and reduced substance use). Statistical associations were assessed with linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We received 3371 responses; 1342 were from India (39.8%), 983 from China (29.2%), 669 from Italy (19.8%), and 377 (11.2%) from Japan. A differential countrywise response was observed toward perceived health status; the highest scores were obtained for Indian respondents (9.43, SD 2.43), and the lowest were obtained for Japanese respondents (6.81, SD 3.44). Similarly, countrywise differences in the magnitude of the influence of perceptions on health status were observed; perception of interpersonal relationships was most pronounced in the comparatively old Italian and Japanese respondents (ß=.68 and .60, respectively), and the fear response was most pronounced in Chinese respondents (ß=.71). Overall, 78.4% of the respondents adopted at least two healthy lifestyle choices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike health status, the influence of perception of interpersonal relationships on the adoption of lifestyle choices was not unanimous, and it was absent in the Italian respondents (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.65-5.79). The influence of perceived health status was a significant predictor of lifestyle change across all the countries, most prominently by approximately 6-fold in China and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: The overall consistent positive influence of increased interpersonal relationships on health perceptions and adopted lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic is the key real-time finding of the survey. Favorable behavioral changes should be bolstered through regular virtual interpersonal interactions, particularly in countries with an overall middle-aged or older population. Further, controlling the fear response of the public through counseling could also help improve health perceptions and lifestyle behavior. However, the observed human behavior needs to be viewed within the purview of cultural disparities, self-perceptions, demographic variances, and the influence of countrywise phase variations of the pandemic. The observations derived from a short lockdown period are preliminary, and real insight could only be obtained from a longer follow-up.","Manjunath, Nandi Krishnamurthy; Majumdar, Vijaya; Rozzi, Antonietta; Huiru, Wang; Mishra, Avinash; Kimura, Keishin; Nagarathna, Raghuram; Nagendra, Hongasandra Ramarao",JMIR Form Res,,639

METHODS: This cross‐sectional survey was developed using the Life Events Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition: DSM‐5 (DSM‐5) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5). The survey was distributed to members of the American College of Emergency Physicians from May 21, 2020, through June 22, 2020. RESULTS: Among 1300 emergency physicians, a significant number of participants (22.3%; 95% confidence interval, 20.3–24.3%) reported symptoms of stress consistent with PTSD (PCL score ≥ 33). Higher PCL‐5 scores were associated with age younger than 50 years (P < 0.05) and <10 years in practice (P < 0.05). The major sources of stress identified by participants included disinformation about COVID‐19, computer work/electronic medical record, personal protective equipment concerns, and workload. The most common consequences of workplace stress were feeling distant or cut off from other people and sleep disturbance, such as trouble falling or staying asleep. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of emergency physicians reported symptoms of stress consistent with PTSD. Higher PCL‐5 scores were associated with age younger than 50 years and <10 years in practice.","Marco, Catherine A.; Larkin, Gregory L.; Feeser, V.

637565,Potent Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by Hetero-Bivalent Alpaca Nanobodies Targeting the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain,2021-04-26,"The aim of this study was to define the breadth and specificity of dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell epitopes using a comprehensive set of 135 overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) in a cohort of 34 individuals with acute (n = 10) and resolved (n = 24) COVID-19. Following short-term virus-specific in vitro cultivation, the single peptide-specific CD4+ T cell response of each patient was screened using enzyme linked immuno spot assay (ELISpot) and confirmed by single-peptide intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. 97% (n = 33) of patients elicited one or more N, M or E-specific CD4+ T cell responses and each patient targeted on average 21.7 (range 0–79) peptide specificities. Overall, we identified 10 N, M or E-specific peptides that showed a response frequency of more than 36% and five of them showed high binding affinity to multiple HLA class II binders in subsequent in vitro HLA binding assays. Three peptides elicited CD4+ T cell responses in more than 55% of all patients, namely Mem_P30 (aa146-160), Mem_P36 (aa176-190), both located within the M protein, and Ncl_P18 (aa86-100) located within the N protein. These peptides were further defined in terms of length and HLA restriction. Based on this epitope and restriction data we developed a novel DRB*11 tetramer (Mem_aa145-164) and examined the ex vivo phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in one patient. This detailed characterization of single T cell peptide responses demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection universally primes a broad T cell response directed against multiple specificities located within the N, M and E structural protein.","Heide, Janna; Schulte, Sophia; Kohsar, Matin; Brehm, Thomas Theo; Herrmann, Marissa; Karsten, Hendrik; Marget, Matthias; Peine, Sven; Johansson, Alexandra M.; Sette, Alessandro; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Kwok, William W.; Sidney, John; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529740/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009842,639

METHODS: The stable base ABHRs were developed. The preferred bases were incorporated with various concentrations of snow mushroom extract. The stable and preferred snow mushroom ABHR was moisturizing and sanitizing efficacies evaluated in 20 human volunteers in a comparison with its placebo. RESULTS: The stable hand sanitizer gel bases containing 66.5% of ethanol and 0.3% triclosan were developed and incorporated with the extract of snow mushroom polysaccharide. Of which, the preparations containing 10% of snow mushroom and 0.3% of gelling agent gained the highest preferences as assessed in 20 Thai volunteers. The snow mushroom hand sanitizer was proved to be none irritated in the same group of the volunteers as was the placebo. The snow mushroom gel significantly (P < 0.05) moist the skin better than the placebo at all time of the interval assessment until the end of the study at 180 min. The hand sanitizers were confirmed on their anti‐septic, at which the efficacies of the active and placebo ABHR were comparable (P = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Snow mushroom ABHR gel with its confirmed moisturizing and sanitizing efficacies is presented. It is meetings with the recommendation on hand hygienic improvement to combat the infections of diseases spreading. The preparation can be frequency applied with its proved skin hydrating efficacy co‐contributes in a good condition of hand hygiene.","Lourith, Nattaya; Pungprom, Sathaporn; Kanlayavattanakul, Mayuree",J Cosmet Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531816/,639
663847,Integrated Biophysical Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding and Allosteric Interactions with Antibodies,2021-04-30,"Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) found in vertebrates restrict infections by specific viruses. IFITM3 is known to be essential for restriction of influenza virus infections in both mice and humans. Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote. Since bacterial IFITMs share minimal amino acid identity with human IFITM3, we hypothesized that examination of bacterial IFITMs in human cells would provide insight into the essential characteristics necessary for antiviral activity of IFITMs. We examined IFITMs from Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus for potential antiviral activity. Both of these IFITMs conferred a moderate level of resistance to influenza virus in human cells, identifying them as functional homologues of IFITM3. Analysis of sequence elements shared by bacterial IFITMs and IFITM3 identified two hydrophobic domains, putative S-palmitoylation sites, and conserved phenylalanine residues associated with IFITM3 interactions, which are all necessary for IFITM3 antiviral activity. We observed that, like IFITM3, bacterial IFITMs were S-palmitoylated, albeit to a lesser degree. We also demonstrated the ability of a bacterial IFITM to co-immunoprecipitate with IFITM3 suggesting formation of a complex, and also visualized strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs with IFITM3. However, the mycobacterial IFITMs lack the endocytic-targeting motif conserved in vertebrate IFITM3. As such, these bacterial proteins, when expressed alone, had diminished colocalization with cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments that are the primary site of IFITM3-dependent influenza virus restriction. Though the precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is not known, our results support a model whereby transfer of a bacterial IFITM gene to eukaryotic cells may have provided a selective advantage against viral infection that was refined through the course of vertebrate evolution to include more robust signals for S-palmitoylation and localization to sites of endocytic virus trafficking.","Melvin, William J.; McMichael, Temet M.; Chesarino, Nicholas M.; Hach, Jocelyn C.; Yount, Jacob S.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26075508/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7062759,639
668737,Pattern recognition receptors in health and diseases,2021-08-04,"OBJECTIVES: To highlight clinical and operational issues, identify factors that shape patient responses in Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) and test the correlations between composite measures and overall hospital ratings. DESIGN: Responses to HCAHPS surveys were used in a partial correlation analysis to ascertain those HCAHPS composite measures that most relate to overall hospital ratings. The linear mean scores for the composite measures and individual and global items were analyzed with descriptive analysis and correlation analysis via JMP and SPSS statistical software. SETTING: HCAHPS is a patient satisfaction survey required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for hospitals in the USA. The survey is for adult inpatients, excluding psychiatric patients. PARTICIPANTS: 3382 US hospitals. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Pearson correlation coefficients for the six composite measures and overall hospital rating. RESULTS: The partial correlations for overall hospital rating and three composite measures are positive and moderately strong for care transition (0.445) and nurse communication (0.369) and weak for doctor communication (0.066). CONCLUSIONS: From a health policy standpoint, it is imperative that hospital administrators stress open and clear communication between providers and patients to avoid problems ranging from misdiagnosis to incorrect treatment. Additional research is needed to determine how the coronavirus of 2019 pandemic influences patients’ perceptions of quality and willingness to recommend hospitals at a time when nurses and physicians show symptoms of burnout due to heavy workloads and inadequate personal protective equipment.","Belasen, Alan T; Hertelendy, Attila J; Belasen, Ariel R; Oppenlander, Jane",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201215/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa140,639
