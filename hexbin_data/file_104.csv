We discuss policies that might differentially affect social groups’ risk for illness or death. Our purpose is not to establish the precise magnitude of disparities likely to occur; rather, it is to call attention to avoidable disparities that can be expected in the absence of systematic attention to differential social risks in pandemic preparedness plans. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels should consider potential sources of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities during a pandemic and formulate specific plans to minimize these disparities.","Blumenshine, Philip; Reingold, Arthur; Egerter, Susan; Mockenhaupt, Robin; Braveman, Paula; Marks, James",Emerg Infect Dis,104,3

However, little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections. We analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the Netherlands during 2004. Implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%–86.6%) reduction in reproduction number. This reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak. Even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus.","Heijne, Janneke C.M.; Teunis, Peter; Morroy, Gabriella; Wijkmans, Clementine; Oostveen, Sandy; Duizer, Erwin; Kretzschmar, Mirjam; Wallinga, Jacco",Emerg Infect Dis,104,3

We studied 4 time-series algorithm modifications designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artificially added data. To test these modified algorithms, we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments (EDs). At a constant alert rate of 1%, sensitivity was improved for both datasets by using a minimum standard deviation (SD) of 1.0, a 14–28 day baseline duration for calculating mean and SD, and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate denominator. Stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for day-of-week effects increased sensitivity for the DoD data but not for the ED data. These enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system data.","Tokars, Jerome I.; Burkom, Howard; Xing, Jian; English, Roseanne; Bloom, Steven; Cox, Kenneth; Pavlin, Julie A.",Emerg Infect Dis,104,3

A major public health goal is to make efficacious vaccines against these viruses by using novel approaches, including cell-culture system, reverse genetics, and adjuvant development. Important consideration for the strategy includes preparation of vaccines from a currently circulating strain to induce broad-spectrum immunity toward newly emerged human H5 strains. This strategy would be a good solution early in a pandemic until an antigenically matched and approved vaccine is produced. The concept of therapeutic vaccines (e.g., antidisease vaccine) directed at diminishing the cytokine storm frequently seen in subtype H5N1–infected persons is underscored. Better understanding of host–virus interaction is essential to identify tools to produce effective vaccines against influenza (H5N1).","Haque, Azizul; Hober, Didier; Kasper, Lloyd H.",Emerg Infect Dis,104,3

A total of 246,772 mammals in 190 genera (68 families) were imported. The most widespread agents of risk zoonoses were rabies virus (in 78 genera of mammals), Bacillus anthracis (57), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (48), Echinococcus spp. (41), and Leptospira spp. (35). Genera capable of harboring the greatest number of risk zoonoses were Canis and Felis (14 each), Rattus (13), Equus (11), and Macaca and Lepus (10 each).

Here we utilize gp350 to generate tailored exosomes with an identical tropism. These exosomes can be used for the targeted co-transfer of functional proteins to normal and malignant human B cells. We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells. In essence, we show that gp350 alone confers B-cell tropism to exosomes and that these exosomes can be further engineered to simultaneously trigger virus- and tumor-specific immune responses. The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies.","Ruiss, Romana; Jochum, Simon; Mocikat, Ralph; Hammerschmidt, Wolfgang; Zeidler, Reinhard",PLoS One,104,8

Here, we report a unique recombinant HAdV strain (CBJ113) isolated from a HAdV-positive child with SARI. The whole-genome sequence was determined using Sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome indicated that the CBJ113 strain shares a common origin with HAdV-C2, HAdV-C6, HAdV-C1, HAdV-C5, and HAdV-C57 and formed a novel subclade on the same branch as other HAdV-C subtypes. BootScan and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses showed that the CBJ113 genome has an intra-subtype recombinant structure and comprises gene regions mainly originating from two circulating viral strains: HAdV-1 and HAdV-2. The parental penton base, pVI, and DBP genes of the recombinant strain clustered with the HAdV-1 prototype strain, and the E1B, hexon, fiber, and 100 K genes of the recombinant clustered within the HAdV-2 subtype, meanwhile the E4orf1 and DNA polymerase genes of the recombinant shared the greatest similarity with those of HAdV-5 and HAdV-6, respectively.

Surfactant proteins’ (SPs) changes could have a role in the reduced compliance but the matter is still unsettled. The aim of this study was to clarify the meaning of SPs changes during pneumonia in term newborns. METHODS: In 28 term ventilated newborns, 13 with pneumonia and 15 with no lung disease, we measured SP-B, SP-A, disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), and total phospholipids (PL) concentrations in tracheal aspirates at intubation and close to extubation. We also measured DSPC kinetics using (U-(13)C-PA)dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine. RESULTS: At baseline, SP-B, expressed as % of PL, was significantly different between the groups, being 3.5-fold higher in pneumonia than controls. Conversely, SP-A did not vary between the groups. At extubation, SP-B and SP-A concentrations had decreased significantly in newborns with pneumonia, while there was no significant change in controls. DSPC t(1/2) was significantly shorter in the pneumonia group (11.8 (5.5–19.8) h vs. 26.6 (19.3–63.6) h, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: In term newborns with pneumonia, SP-B increases with respect to PL, and DSPC is turned over at a faster rate.

First, this review examines the mechanisms of action of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and a free radical-scavenging agent that increases intracellular GSH, at the cellular level. NAC can act as a precursor for glutathione synthesis as well as a stimulator of the cytosolic enzymes involved in glutathione regeneration. The chemical properties of NAC include redox interactions particularly with other members of the group XIV elements (selenium, etc.) and ebselen, a lipid-soluble seleno-organic compound. Second, NAC has been shown to protect against oxidative stress-induced neuronal death in cultured granule neurons. Recent findings on the protective effect of NAC against 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-induced toxicity in cerebellar granule neurons are summarized.

The objective of the study was to validate whether patients with higher serum PCT concentrations have a higher incidence of ARDS. METHODS: The study was a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. All patients who received cardiac surgery with CPB were screened for study eligibility. Patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort or the control cohort according to serum PCT concentration on the first postoperative day with a cut-off value of 7.0 ng/mL. Patients were followed up until the 7th postoperative day. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ARDS, which was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were enrolled, 64 patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort and 232 patients were assigned to the control cohort. PCT concentration was 16.23 ± 5.9 ng/mL in the PCT-elevated cohort, and 2.70 ± 1.43 ng/mL in the control cohort (p < 0.001). The incidence of ARDS was significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (21.9% versus 5.6%, p < 0.001). The incidence of moderate-to-severe ARDS was also significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (10.9% versus 0.4%, p < 0.001). The hazard ratio of ARDS at 7 days in the PCT-elevated cohort, as compared with the control cohort, was 6.8 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 17.4).

Levels of relatedness, including paternity/maternity (parentage), were assessed across all individuals using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, and unrelated cheetahs (n = 89) from 7 regions were genotyped at 38 loci to document broad geographical patterns. There was limited differentiation among regions, evidence that this is a generally panmictic population. Measures of genetic variation were similar among all regions and were comparable with Eastern African cheetah populations. Parentage analyses confirmed several observations based on field studies, including 21 of 23 previously hypothesized family groups, 40 probable parent/offspring pairs, and 8 sibling groups. These results also verified the successful integration and reproduction of several cheetahs following natural dispersal or translocation. Animals within social groups (family groups, male coalitions, or sibling groups) were generally related. Within the main study area, radio-collared female cheetahs were more closely interrelated than similarly compared males, a pattern consistent with greater male dispersal.

OUTCOMES: Outcomes evaluated include need and effectiveness of antibiotics to prevent infections in gynaecologic procedures. EVIDENCE: Medline and The Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 1978 and January 2011 on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecologic procedures. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/ controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2011. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of evidence obtained was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Guideline implementation should result in a reduction of cost and related harm of administering antibiotics when not required and a reduction of infection and related morbidities when antibiotics have demonstrated a proven benefit. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. All women undergoing an abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. (I-A); 2. All women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy should receive prophylactic antibiotics. (III-B); 3. The choice of antibiotic for hysterectomy should be a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin. If patients are allergic to cephalosporin, then clindamycin, erythromycin, or metronidazole should be used. (I-A); 4. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered 15 to 60 minutes prior to skin incision. No additional doses are recommended. (I-A); 5. If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy (e.g., > 3 hours), or if the estimated blood loss is > 1500 mL, an additional dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose. (III-C); 6. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for laparoscopic procedures that involve no direct access from the abdominal cavity to the uterine cavity or vagina. (l-E); 7. All women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence should receive a single dose of firstgeneration cephalosporin. (III-B); 8. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for hysteroscopic surgery. (II-2D); 9. All women undergoing an induced (therapeutic) surgical abortion should receive prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of postabortal infection. (I-A); 10. Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested to reduce infectious morbidity following surgery for a missed or incomplete abortion. (I-E); 11. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for insertion of an intrauterine device. (I-E) However, health care professionals could consider screening for sexually transmitted infections in high-risk populations. (III-C); 12. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for an endometrial biopsy. (III-L); 13. The best method to prevent infection after hysterosalpingography is unknown. Women with dilated tubes found at the time of hysterosalpingography are at highest risk, and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) should be given. (II-3B); 14. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for urodynamic studies in women at low risk, unless the incidence of urinary tract infection post-urodynamics is > 10%. (1-E); 15. In patients with morbid obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m(2)), doubling the antibiotic dose may be considered. (III-B); 16.. Administration of antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for patients who undergo a genitourinary procedure.

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 400 HCWs working in eight hospitals in Beijing by face to face interview using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: We found that 280/400 (70.0%) of HCWs were compliant with mask-wearing while in contact with patients. Respiratory infection occurred in 238/400 (59.5%) subjects from November, 2007 through February, 2008. Respiratory infection was higher among females (odds ratio [OR], 2.00 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.16-3.49]) and staff working in larger hospitals (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.09-2.72]), but was lower among subjects with seasonal influenza vaccination (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.76]), wearing medical masks (reference: cotton-yarn; OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39-0.91]) or with good mask-wearing adherence (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.98]). The risk of respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas was similar to that of HCWs in high risk area. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that female HCWs and staffs working in larger hospitals are the focus of prevention and control of respiratory infection in Beijing hospitals. Mask-wearing and seasonal influenza vaccination are protective for respiratory infection in HCWs; the protective efficacy of medical masks is better than that of cotton yarn ones; respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas should also be given attention.","Yang, Peng; Seale, Holly; Raina MacIntyre, C.; Zhang, Haiyan; Zhang, Zhen; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Xiaoli; Li, Xinyu; Pang, Xinghuo; Wang, Quanyi",Braz J Infect Dis,104,3

It contains many viruses that threaten human health, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) of the genus Flavivirus as well as hepatitis C virus of the genus Hepacivirus. Cell culture systems highly permissive for the Flaviviridae viruses are very useful for their isolation, propagation, and diagnosis, an understanding of their biology, and the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. Previously, we isolated a human hepatoma HuH-7-derived cell clone, Huh7.5.1–8, which is highly permissive to hepatitis C virus infection. Here, we have characterized flavivirus infection in the Huh7.5.1–8 cell line by comparing with that in the African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cell line, which is permissive for a wide spectrum of viruses. Upon infection with JEV, Huh7.5.1–8 cells produced a higher amount of virus particles early in infection and were more susceptible to virus-induced cell death than Vero cells. Similar outcomes were obtained when the cells were infected with another flavivirus, YFV (17D-204 strain). Quantification of cellular and extracellular viral RNA revealed that high JEV production in Huh7.5.1–8 cells can be attributed to rapid viral replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection. In a plaque assay, Huh7.5.1–8 cells developed JEV plaques more rapidly than Vero cells. Although this was not the case with YFV plaques, Huh7.5.1–8 cells developed higher numbers of YFV plaques than Vero cells. Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding an antiviral RNA helicase, RIG-I, showed that Huh7.5.1–8 cells expressed not only a full-length RIG-I mRNA with a known dominant-negative missense mutation but also variants without the mutation. However, the latter mRNAs lacked exon 5/6−12, indicating functional loss of RIG-I in the cells. These characteristics of the Huh7.5.1–8 cell line are helpful for flavivirus detection, titration, and propagation.","Saito, Kyoko; Fukasawa, Masayoshi; Shirasago, Yoshitaka; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Osada, Naoki; Yamaji, Toshiyuki; Wakita, Takaji; Konishi, Eiji; Hanada, Kentaro",PLoS One,104,3

We aimed to examine the efficacy of a 14-day course of mouthwash twice daily compared to standard treatment (antibiotic) for the treatment of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. The OMEGA2 trial was a parallel-group and open-labelled randomised controlled trial among men with untreated oropharyngeal gonorrhoea that was conducted between September 2018 and February 2020 at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre in Australia. Men were randomised to the intervention (rinsing, gargling and spraying mouthwash twice daily for 14 days) or control (standard treatment) arm and followed for 28 days. Participants in both arms were advised to abstain from sex and kissing with anyone for 14 days after enrolment. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline, Day 14 and Day 28 and tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and culture. The primary outcome was the detection of oropharyngeal N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT at Day 14 after treatment. This trial was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12618001380280). This trial stopped early due to a high failure rate in the mouthwash arm. Twelve men were randomly assigned to either mouthwash (n = 6) or standard treatment (n = 6). Of the 11 men who returned at Day 14, the cure rate for oropharyngeal gonorrhoea in the mouthwash arm was 20% (95% CI 1–72%; 1/5) and in the standard treatment arm was 100% (95% CI 54–100%; 6/6). A 14-day course of mouthwash failed to cure a high proportion of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea cases.","Chow, Eric P.

There are two types of CO(2) detectors, i.e., single-use-only colorimetric devices and capnometers. Although portable capnometers are widely used for resuscitation, there have been no reports regarding their clinical utility in neonates. The correspondence between end-tidal CO(2) (PetCO(2)) level determined using a battery-powered portable capnometer and arterial CO(2) (PaCO(2)) was investigated using paired data obtained simultaneously from 26 neonates weighing 1262 ± 589 g at examination on mechanical ventilation. PetCO(2) level and PaCO(2) showed a strong correlation (r = 0.839, P < 0.001), and the correlation equation was: PetCO(2) = 0.8 × PaCO(2) + 1.1. Therefore, PetCO(2) readings obtained with a battery-powered portable capnometer were likely to be underestimated. This became more pronounced with decreasing infant body weight at examination as the net difference in measurements of PaCO(2) and PetCO(2) was significantly positively correlated with infant body weight at examination (r = 0.451, P < 0.001). The observations presented here may be helpful in the use of battery-powered portable capnometers in neonates requiring controlled ventilation with tracheal intubation.","Hirakawa, Eiji; Ibara, Satoshi",J Clin Monit Comput,104,9

Here we have investigated the molecular signature of MetS in urine. METHODS: We used NMR-based metabolomics to investigate a European cohort including urine samples from 11,754 individuals (18–75 years old, 41% females), designed to populate all the intermediate conditions in MetS, from subjects without any risk factor up to individuals with developed MetS (4–5%, depending on the definition). A set of quantified metabolites were integrated from the urine spectra to obtain metabolic models (one for each definition), to discriminate between individuals with MetS. RESULTS: MetS progression produces a continuous and monotonic variation of the urine metabolome, characterized by up- or down-regulation of the pertinent metabolites (17 in total, including glucose, lipids, aromatic amino acids, salicyluric acid, maltitol, trimethylamine N-oxide, and p-cresol sulfate) with some of the metabolites associated to MetS for the first time. This metabolic signature, based solely on information extracted from the urine spectrum, adds a molecular dimension to MetS definition and it was used to generate models that can identify subjects with MetS (AUROC values between 0.83 and 0.87). This signature is particularly suitable to add meaning to the conditions that are in the interface between healthy subjects and MetS patients. Aging and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are also risk factors that may enhance MetS probability, but they do not directly interfere with the metabolic discrimination of the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Urine metabolomics, studied by NMR spectroscopy, unravelled a set of metabolites that concomitantly evolve with MetS progression, that were used to derive and validate a molecular definition of MetS and to discriminate the conditions that are in the interface between healthy individuals and the metabolic syndrome.

However, due to its involvement in the formation of ROS, H(2)O(2) causes several side effects, including disorders of the metabolism of skin cells and the development of chronic inflammation mediated by oxidative stress. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, on the proteome of keratinocyte membranes exposed to H(2)O(2). Overall, the hydrogen peroxide caused the levels of several proteins to increase, while the treatment with CBD prevented these changes. Analysis of the protein-protein interaction network showed that the significant changes mainly involved proteins with important roles in the proteasomal activity, protein folding processes (regulatory subunit of the proteasome 26S 6A, beta proteasome subunit type 1, chaperonin 60 kDa), protein biosynthesis (40S ribosomal proteins S16, S2 and ubiquitin-S27a), regulation of the redox balance (carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1 and NAD(P)H [quinone] 1 dehydrogenase) and cell survival (14-3-3 theta protein). Additionally, CBD reduced the total amount of MDA, 4-HNE and 4-ONE-protein adducts. Therefore, we conclude that CBD partially prevents the changes induced by hydrogen peroxide by reducing oxidative stress and maintaining proteostasis networks. Moreover, our results indicate that combination therapy with CBD may bring a promising approach in the clinical use of hydrogen peroxide by preventing its pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effect through potential participation of CBD in membrane mediated molecular signaling.","Atalay, Sinemyiz; Gęgotek, Agnieszka; Domingues, Pedro; Skrzydlewska, Elżbieta",Redox Biol,104,3

An altered pattern of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath has been proposed as a potential non‐invasive diagnostic tool for detection of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of breath‐testing for colorectal cancer screening and early diagnosis using an advanced breath sampler. METHODS: The exhaled breath of patients with colorectal cancer and non‐cancer controls with negative findings on colonoscopy was collected using the ReCIVA® Breath Sampler. This portable device is able to capture the alveolar breath fraction without environmental contamination. VOCs were desorbed thermally and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The discriminatory ability of VOCs in detecting colorectal cancer was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for each VOC, followed by cross‐validation by the leave‐one‐out method, and by applying stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 83 patients with colorectal cancer and 90 non‐cancer controls. Fourteen VOCs were found to have significant discriminatory ability in detecting patients with colorectal cancer. The model with the diagnosis of cancer versus no cancer resulted in a statistically significant likelihood of discrimination of 173·45 (P < 0·001), with an area under the ROC curve of 0·979. Cross‐validation of the model resulted in a true predictive value for colorectal cancer of 93 per cent overall. Reliability of the breath analysis was maintained irrespective of cancer stage. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that analysis of exhaled VOCs can discriminate patients with colorectal cancer from those without. This finding may eventually lead to the creation of a smart online sensory device, capable of providing a binary answer (cancer/no cancer) and directing to further screening.","Altomare, D.

Loneliness explained 21% of socioeconomic health inequalities between the lowest and highest socio-economic groups in self-reported chronic disease prevalence, 27% in poorer self-rated health, and 51% in psychological distress. Subgroup analyses revealed that for young adults, loneliness had a larger contribution to socioeconomic gaps in self-rated health (37%) than in 80+-year-olds (16%). Our findings suggest that loneliness may be a social determinant of health, contributing to the socioeconomic health gap independently of well-documented factors such as lifestyles and demographics, in particular for young adults. Public health policies targeting socioeconomic health inequalities could benefit from integrating loneliness into their policies, especially for young adults.","Meisters, Rachelle; Putrik, Polina; Westra, Daan; Bosma, Hans; Ruwaard, Dirk; Jansen, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,104,3

Thus, it is important to evaluate the abundance of medical resources regionally and explore the spatial heterogeneity of medical resource allocation. METHODS: Using medical geographic big data, this study analyzed 369 Chinese cities and constructed a medical resource evaluation model based on the grading of medical institutions using the Delphi method. It evaluated China’s medical resources at three levels (economic sectors, economic zones, and provinces) and discussed their spatial clustering patterns. Geographically weighted regression was used to explore the correlations between the evaluation results and population and gross domestic product (GDP). RESULTS: The spatial heterogeneity of medical resource allocation in China was significant, and the following general regularities were observed: 1) The abundance and balance of medical resources were typically better in the east than in the west, and in coastal areas compared to inland ones. 2) The average primacy ratio of medical resources in Chinese cities by province was 2.30. The spatial distribution of medical resources in the provinces was unbalanced, showing high concentrations in the primate cities. 3) The allocation of medical resources at the provincial level in China was summarized as following a single-growth pole pattern supplemented by bipolar circular allocation and balanced allocation patterns. The agglomeration patterns of medical resources in typical cities were categorized into single-center and balanced development patterns. GDP was highly correlated to the medical evaluation results, while demographic factors showed, low correlations. Large cities and their surrounding areas exhibited obvious response characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide policy-relevant guidance for improving the spatial imbalance of medical resources, strengthening regional public health systems, and promoting government coordination efforts for medical resource allocation at different levels to improve the overall functioning of the medical and health service system and bolster its balanced and synergistic development.

Methods: The present study analyzed data from a Migration and Mobility Determinants on Health survey and was conducted in 2017 among 935 migrant slum dwellers of Dhaka city (North & South) and Gazipur City Corporations, as a part of the icddr,b’s Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (UHDSS). The face-to-face interviews were conducted with the adult population by using a semi-structured questionnaire that included variables related to socio-demographics, migration, occupation, and HRQoL (SF-12). Bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with HRQoL. Results: The mean (±SD) scores of physical component summary (PCS), and mental component summary (MCS) were 57.40 ± 22.73 and 60.77 ± 22.51, respectively. As per multiple regression analysis, lower PCS scores were associated with having older age, being female, and not having any job. Mean MCS scores were significantly lower among participants who reported having older age, not having any job, not working/ less working hours (≤8 h/day), as well as increased work-related stress in the current urban slum. Conclusions: The findings suggest that available urban social protection programs should include a comprehensive social safety net for the improvement of the slum infrastructure as well as proper health care and risk mitigation plans at workplaces.","Koly, Kamrun Nahar; Islam, Md.

Adults who have recovered from intensive care management could develop muscle weakness, neurocognitive impairment, difficulties in managing activities of daily living and to returning to work, and psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. A prospective, observational study was designed. Data were collected from January to December 2018 from a structured follow-up program, at 3 time points after ICU discharge: at seven days, a visit in the general ward, a phone interview at three months and an ambulatory visit at six months. A total of 95 patients were enrolled, 36% female, with a median age of 65 (55–73) years and a median ICU length of stay of 13 (8–20) days. At the seven days follow-up, patients who had a positive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed a significantly longer time of intubation (p = 0.048) and length of ICU stay (p = 0.023). At three months, we observed a significant relationship between a positive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a median value of EuroQol-5D (p = 0.048). At six months, we observed that patients who had a positive Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale were significantly younger than the other group. Findings from the present study suggest that a longer time of intubation and length of ICU stay are associated with a higher level of anxiety and depression immediately after ICU discharge. Follow-up programs are recommended to assess and rehabilitate cognitive function at ICU discharge.","Villa, Marta; Villa, Silvia; Vimercati, Simona; Andreossi, Mara; Mauri, Fabrizia; Ferlicca, Daniela; Rona, Roberto; Foti, Giuseppe; Lucchini, Alberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,104,3

(2) Methods: A staging classification was applied to 262 patients from the EffecTAVI Registry at baseline and re-assessed within 30-days after TAVI. The primary endpoint of the study was all-cause mortality at 1-year. Secondary endpoints included cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, permanent pacemaker implantation, endocarditis, and re-hospitalization for all causes. (3) Results: At baseline, 23 (8.7%) patients were in Stage 0/1 (no cardiac damage/left ventricular damage), 106 (40.4%) in Stage 2 (left atrial or mitral valve damage), 59 (22.5%) in Stage 3 (pulmonary vasculature or tricuspid valve damage) and 74 (28.3%) in Stage 4 (right ventricular damage). At 30-days after TAVI, a lower prevalence of advanced stages of cardiac damage than baseline, mainly driven by a significant improvement in left ventricular diastolic parameters and right ventricular function, was reported. At 1-year, a stepwise increase in mortality rates was observed according to staging at baseline: 4.3% in Stage 0/1, 6.6% in Stage 2, 18.6% in Stage 3 and 21.6% in Stage 4 (p = 0.08). No differences were found in secondary endpoints. (4) Conclusions: TAVI has an early beneficial impact on the left ventricular diastolic and right ventricular function.

Scientific research has therefore continued to explore new possibilities, including naturally available substances. Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside present, e.g., in bitter almonds. This glycoside has already sparked many discussions among scientists, especially about its anticancer potential and related toxic cyanides. However, toxicity at different doses made it generally unacceptable. Although amygdalin given at the correct oral dose may not lead to poisoning, it has not yet been accurately quantified, as its action is often affected by different intestinal microbial consortia. Its pharmacological activities have been studied, but its effects on the body’s inflammatory response are lacking. This review discusses the chemical structure, toxicity, and current knowledge of the molecular mechanism of amygdalin activity on immune functions, including the anti-inflammatory effect, but also discusses inflammation as such, its mediators with diverse functions, which are usually targeted by drugs.","Figurová, Daniela; Tokárová, Katarína; Greifová, Hana; Knížatová, Nikola; Kolesárová, Adriana; Lukáč, Norbert",Molecules,104,9

However, online media can come in many forms and stories of scientific discovery can be told by many individuals. We tested whether the relationship of a spokesperson to the science story being told (i.e., the narrative perspective) influences how people react and respond to online science media. We created five video stimuli that fell into three treatments: a scientist presenting their own research (male or female), a third-party summarizing research (male or female), and an infographic-like video with no on-screen presenter. Each of these videos presented the same fabricated science story about the discovery of a new ant species (Formicidae). We used Qualtrics to administer and obtain survey responses from 515 participants (~100 per video). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the videos and after viewing the stimulus answered questions assessing their perceptions of the video (trustworthiness and enjoyment), the spokesperson (trustworthiness and competence), scientists in general (competence and warmth), and attitudes towards the research topic and funding. Participants were also asked to recall what they had seen and heard. We determined that when participants watched a video in which a scientist presented their own research, participants perceived the spokesperson as having more expertise than a third-party presenter, and as more trustworthy and having more expertise than the no-spokesperson stimuli. Viewing a scientist presenting their own work also humanized the research, with participants more often including a person in their answer to the recall question. Overall, manipulating the narrative perspective of the source of a single online video communication effort is effective at impacting immediate objective outcomes related to spokesperson perceptions, but whether those objectives can positively influence long-term goals requires more investigation.","Ruzi, Selina A.; Lee, Nicole M.; Smith, Adrian A.",PLoS One,104,3

If the underlying cause is not treated or eliminated, the disease can progress and may lead to several clinical complications including hepatocellular carcinoma or even death. Thus, detection, staging, and follow-up of liver fibrosis are the main issues in the prognosis and treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. In recent years, new advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology and protein fractionation techniques have improved protein identification as well as protein quantification in many different samples and diseases including liver fibrosis. In particular, the fibrinogen α chain and more specifically the serum levels of the 5.9 kDa fragment of fibrinogen α C-chain have shown to be altered in several hepatic etiologies. In fact, these results have been reproduced by different laboratories, and recently a marked downregulation of this protein fragment has also been described in the initial stages of liver fibrosis. In this chapter, we have described the potential role of fibrinogen α chain and particularly the 5.9 kDa fragment of fibrinogen α C-chain as a circulating marker of liver fibrosis.","Marfà, Santiago; Jimenez, Wladimiro",Biomarkers in Liver Disease,104,3

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a natural focus of many of these miniaturization efforts, owing to its capability to efficiently replicate target regions of interest from small quantities template DNA. Scale-down of PCR has proven to be particularly challenging, however, due to an unfavorable combination of relatively severe temperature extremes (resulting in the need to repeatedly heat minute aqueous sample volumes to temperatures in the vicinity of 95°C with minimal evaporation) and high surface area to volume conditions imposed by nanoliter reactor geometries (often leading to inhibition of the reaction by nonspecific adsorption of reagents at the reactor walls). Despite these daunting challenges, considerable progress has been made in the development of microfluidic devices capable of performing increasingly sophisticated PCR-based bioassays.

Skewed distributions of key epidemiological parameters of the virus and patient care are a challenge for the control of the outbreak as well as keeping the system functional. METHODS: The skewed parameters—pre-patency period, incubation period, duration of viral shedding and time to admission to hospital—are analyzed in regard to their impact and possible countermeasures. RESULTS: The skewed distributions are exclusively time related variables. They are a handicap for outbreak control as well patient management. Optimization between residual open flanks and the efforts to close them is difficult. The main stakeholders are the local health departments, the diagnostic laboratories, the health care infrastructure and finally the citizens in regard to the burden due to non-pharmaceutical interventions including quarantine and isolation. The duration of quarantine and isolation should urgently be shortened for health care workers (HCW) as well as people in critical infrastructure by ready (re-) testing. Calculated risks have to be taken within a phase 3 of a pandemic to keep a system going. CONCLUSIONS: The skewed distributions are a special challenge for infectious disease control. In the case of ending quarantine and isolation in phase 3 of the pandemic, they should be judged specifically in regard to the client/patient.

Infants with severe BPD may develop pulmonary hypertension (PHN) and may require chronic mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy. The outcomes of these infants have not been studied well. We proposed to review survival and outcomes of infants requiring tracheostomy secondary to severe BPD in our NICU at 24 months. METHODS: We reviewed infants’ charts who were diagnosed with BPD that underwent tracheostomy from January 2011 to May 2016 at our children’s hospital NICU. Data were recorded from hospital stay as well as from follow up clinics. Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to beginning of study. RESULTS: Forty-one babies (37 during initial hospitalization and 4 subsequently) requiring tracheostomy were identified from our database. Median gestational age at birth was 26 weeks (25–27 IQR), mean birthweight of 731 g (±245 SD) and 32% were small for gestational age (SGA). Median age of tracheostomy placement was 168 days (108–197 IQR), and median PMA 48 wks (40–56 IQR). 26% of infants requiring tracheostomy also had subglottic stenosis along with BPD. 34 infants (83%) survived to discharge from NICU. 66% (27/41) of our patients had a composite outcome of death, ventilator dependency and/or poor neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years. We found that a higher respiratory severity score at the time of tracheostomy placement and later post-menstrual age at admission to level IV NICU was associated with a worse outcome. Small for gestational age infants were found to have worse outcomes as well. 41% (13/32) of infants had more than 3 hospital admissions after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort about 80% of infants with severe BPD and tracheostomy survived to discharge with need for prolonged home ventilation in more than half of the survivors. Later postmenstrual age at admission to level 4 NICU was associated with a worse outcome. Our retrospective data may be inadequate to determine the causal relationship between postmenstrual age at admission and outcome. These patients continue to have high morbidity and recurrent hospitalizations.","Upadhyay, Kirtikumar; Vallarino, Dario Antonio; Talati, Ajay J.",BMC Pediatr,104,3

Recent studies suggest that EMT is a key factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, as the disruption of EMT-related effector molecules can inhibit the occurrence and development of PF. With the numerous advancements made in molecular biology in recent years, researchers have discovered that exosomes and their cargos, such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and proteins, can promote or inhibit the EMT, modulate the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, contribute to the proliferation of fibroblasts and promote immunoregulatory and mitochondrial damage during pulmonary fibrosis. Exosomes are key factors regulating the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into myofibroblasts. Interestingly, exosomes derived from BMSCs under pathological and physiological conditions may promote or inhibit the EMT of type II alveolar epithelial cells and the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts to regulate pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, exosomes may become a new direction in the study of drugs for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.","Xie, Linshen; Zeng, Ye",Front Pharmacol,104,0

Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Viruses,13.151203,11.915444,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Prevalence of depression is increasing in young people, and there is a need to develop and evaluate behavioural interventions which may provide benefits equal to or greater than talking therapies or pharmacological alternatives. Exercise could be beneficial for young people living with depression, but robust, large-scale trials of effectiveness and the impact of exercise intensity are lacking. This study aims to test whether a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention targeting young people living with depression is feasible by determining whether it is possible to recruit and retain young people, develop and deliver the intervention as planned, and evaluate training and delivery. METHODS: The design is a three-arm cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial with embedded process evaluation. Participants will be help-seeking young people, aged 13–17 years experiencing mild to moderate low mood or depression, referred from three counties in England. The intervention will be delivered by registered exercise professionals, supported by mental health support workers, twice a week for 12 weeks. The three arms will be high-intensity exercise, low-intensity exercise, and a social activity control. All arms will receive a ‘healthy living’ behaviour change session prior to each exercise session and the two exercise groups are energy matched. The outcomes are referral, recruitment, and retention rates; attendance at exercise sessions; adherence to and ability to reach intensity during exercise sessions; proportions of missing data; adverse events, all measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months; resource use; and reach and representativeness. DISCUSSION: UK National Health Service (NHS) policy is to provide young people with advice about using exercise to help depression but there is no evidence-based exercise intervention to either complement or as an alternative to medication or talking therapies. UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest that exercise can be an effective treatment, but the evidence base is relatively weak. This feasibility trial will provide evidence about whether it is feasible to recruit and retain young people to a full RCT to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an exercise intervention for depression.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of all patients admitted within thirty days of a positive Sars CoV-2 test to an integrated health system near Chicago, Illinois between March 12 and May 31, 2020. Covariates evaluated included demographics, symptoms on admission, vital signs, medications, comorbidities, census tract data and social history. Univariable analysis was performed and variables with an alpha of 0.05 or less were included in multivariable regression modeling to identify factors associated with mechanical ventilation. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance of the model. RESULTS: Of 990 patients admitted with COVID-19 12.6% (125) were mechanically ventilated. The median age was 68 (interquartile range 55–82), 48.4% (479) were female and 49.6% (491) were Caucasian. Independent factors associated with mechanical ventilation included female sex (Adjusted OR [AOR] 0.621, Confidence Interval [CI] 0.427–0.903; p=0.0363), body mass index (BMI) (AOR 1.035, CI 1.011–1.060; p=0.0175), percent of english speaking population within patient’s census tract (AOR 0.989, CI 0.979–0.998; p=0.0454), respiratory rate (AOR 1.054, CI 1.027–1.083; p=0.0011), oxygen saturation (AOR 0.922, CI 0.901–0.943; p< 0.0001), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (AOR 0.176, CI 0.051–0.605; p=0.0207) and hematologic malignancy (AOR 3.668, CI 1.403–9.590; p=0.0261). AUC of the model was 0.8 (0.75–0.84). Characteristics of patients admitted with COVID-19 [Image: see text] Multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with mechanical ventilation [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Risk factors associated with mechanical ventilation included male gender, elevated BMI, census tract with lower percentage of english speakers, increased respiratory rate, low oxygen saturation, hematologic malignancy and not having a CVA. We suspect that history of CVA may have been associated with overall patient debility in which aggressive measures such as intubation were not deemed appropriate. Identifying patients with risk factors associated with mechanical ventilation may allow for early and targeted interventions to improve outcomes.

In this study, the protective effect of Yixin-shu (YXS) capsules, a conventional medicine for various cardiovascular diseases, against myocardial ischemia-induced HF in rats was systematically investigated by RNA-seq technology. HF rats treated with YXS (0.8 or 1.6 g/kg/d, ig) for 6 weeks had significantly decreased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and collagen III and attenuated cardiac structure rupture and collagen deposition. Additionally, YXS treatment decreased the levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and TUNEL-positive rate and the nitrotyrosine staining, but increased levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Further experiments demonstrated that YXS restored Trx2 and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, thereby improving cardiac function in the rats with HF. Silencing Trx2 decreased the protection of YXS in the response to H(2)O(2) as evidenced by the increase of caspase-3 activity and decrease of GSH level. Thus, YXS enhanced heart function and decreased myocardial damage through restoring Trx2 and inhibiting JNK and p38 activation in ischemia-induced HF.","Xiang, Changpei; Zhang, Fangbo; Gao, Jinhuan; Guo, Feifei; Zhang, Mao; Zhou, Rui; Wei, Junying; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Yi; Zhang, Jingjing; Yang, Hongjun",Oxid Med Cell Longev,104,1

Previous surveys have shown surgical and gastroenterology trainees have had mixed experiences of supervision and training, and no surveys have explored specifically the role of trainee to trainer feedback. This study aimed to explore the experience of training and of providing trainer feedback for all disciplines of endoscopy trainees. DESIGN/METHOD: An online survey designed in collaboration with Joint Advisory Committee training committee and trainee representatives was distributed from January 2020 but was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and hence terminated early. RESULTS: There were 129 responses, including trainees from all disciplines and regions, of which 86/129 (66.7%) rated the culture in their endoscopy units favourably—either good or excellent. 65/129 (50.4%) trainees reported having one or more training lists allocated per week, with 41/129 (31.8%) reporting only ad hoc lists. 100/129 (77.5%) respondents were given feedback and 97/129 (75.2%) were provided with learning points from the list. 65/129 (50.4%) respondents reported their trainer completed a direct observation of procedure or direct observation of polypectomies. 73/129 (56.6%) respondents reported that they felt able to give feedback to their trainer, with 88/129 (68.2%) feeling they could do this accurately. Barriers to trainer feedback cited included time constraints, lack of anonymity and concerns about affecting the trainer–trainee relationship. CONCLUSION: Overall, the training environment has improved since previous surveys. There are still issues around interdisciplinary differences with some surgical trainees finding the training environment less welcoming, and trainee perceptions of hierarchical barriers and trainer responsiveness to feedback limiting the accuracy of their feedback.","Ratcliffe, Elizabeth; Subramaniam, Sharmila; Ngu, Wee Sing; McConnell, Susan; Beales, Ian L P; McCrudden, Raymond; Smith, Geoff V; Wells, Christopher",Frontline Gastroenterol,104,3

Up to 40% of people affected by pain receive no or inadequate treatment. Providing a scalable, time-, and location-independent way for pain diagnostic, management, prevention and treatment mobile health applications (MHA) might be a promising approach to improve health care for pain. However, the commercial app market is rapidly growing and unregulated, resulting in an opaque market. Studies investigating the content, privacy and security features, quality and scientific evidence of the available apps are highly needed, to guide patients and clinicians to high quality MHA. Contributing to this challenge, the present study investigates the content, quality, and privacy features of pain apps available in the European app stores. METHODS: An automated search engine was used to identify pain apps in the European Google Play and Apple App store. Pain apps were screened and checked for systematic criteria (pain-relatedness, functionality, availability, independent usability, English or German). Content, quality and privacy features were assessed by two independent reviewers using the German Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS-G). The MARS-G assesses quality on four objectives (engagement, functionality, aesthetics, information quality) and two subjective scales (perceived impact, subjective quality). RESULTS: Out of 1034 identified pain apps 218 were included. Pain apps covered eight different pain types. Content included basic information, advice, assessment and tracking, and stand-alone interventions. The overall quality of the pain apps was average M = 3.13 (SD = 0.56, min = 1, max = 4.69). The effectiveness of less than 1% of the included pain apps was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Major problems with data privacy were present: 59% provided no imprint, 70% had no visible privacy policy. CONCLUSION: A multitude of pain apps is available. Most MHA lack scientific evaluation and have serious privacy issues, posing a potential threat to users. Further research on evidence and improvements privacy and security are needed. Overall, the potential of pain apps is not exploited.","Terhorst, Yannik; Messner, Eva-Maria; Schultchen, Dana; Paganini, Sarah; Portenhauser, Alexandra; Eder, Anna-Sophia; Bauer, Melanie; Papenhoff, Mike; Baumeister, Harald; Sander, Lasse Bosse",Internet Interv,104,1

Understanding the determinants involved in successful radical drug innovations is key to increasing this type of output in the future. The objective of this review is to search the literature for key firm-level determinants of radical drug innovation. Following a systematic literature review approach, we considered more than 4100 peer-reviewed journal articles and PhD theses, of which we included 38 in the narrative synthesis. To guide the review, we use Crossan and Apaydin’s (J Manag Stud 47:1154–1191, 2010) model of firm-level determinants of innovation for the first time within the pharmaceutical industry, which is unique due to the risks, costs, and time frames associated with radical drug innovation. We focus on three groups of determinants: leadership, managerial levers, and business processes. We find the following to be particularly important for radical drug innovation: external knowledge sourcing (managerial lever); internal knowledge management (managerial lever); ability of top leaders to innovate, as determined by educational background and professional experience (leadership); and leaders’ focus on shaping innovation and performance cultures (leadership). We offer a conceptual framework of critical determinants of radical drug innovation and highlight managerial implications. We also discuss gaps in radical drug innovation research and provide suggestions for future study. Many of the findings discussed in this paper are contradictory because they rely on different definitions and measures, which inhibits our full and accurate understanding of radical drug innovation development. More research is needed to address untested measures of radical drug innovation.","Stiller, Ingo; van Witteloostuijn, Arjen; Cambré, Bart",Manag Rev Q,104,16

Drought conditions have led to a rapid rise in semi-permanent, urban water storage containers called rainwater tanks known to be critical larval habitat for the species. The presence of these larval habitats has increased the risk of establishment of highly urbanised, invasive mosquito vectors such as Ae. aegypti. Here we use a spatially explicit network model to examine the role that unsealed rainwater tanks may play in population connectivity of an Ae. aegypti invasion in suburbs of Brisbane, a major Australian city. We characterise movement between rainwater tanks as a diffusion-like process, limited by a maximum distance of movement, average life expectancy, and a probability that Ae. aegypti will cross wide open spaces such as roads. The simulation model was run against a number of scenarios that examined population spread through the rainwater tank network based on non-compliance rates of tanks (unsealed or sealed) and road grids. We show that Ae. aegypti tank infestation and population spread was greatest in areas of high tank density and road lengths were shortest e.g. cul-de-sacs. Rainwater tank non-compliance rates of over 30% show increased connectivity when compared to less than 10%, suggesting rainwater tanks non-compliance should be maintained under this level to minimize the spread of an invading Ae. aegypti population. These results presented as risk maps of Ae. aegypti spread across Brisbane, can assist health and government authorities on where to optimally target rainwater tank surveillance and educational activities.

Though a lot of commercial and community (non-commercial) frameworks have been proposed to streamline the major stages in the ML lifecycle, they are normally overqualified and insufficient for an ML system in its nascent phase. Driven by real-world experience in building and maintaining ML systems, we find that it is more efficient to initialize the major stages of ML lifecycle first for trial and error, followed by the extension of specific stages to acclimatize towards more complex scenarios. For this, we introduce a simple yet flexible framework, MLife, for fast ML lifecycle initialization. This is built on the fact that data flow in MLife is in a closed loop driven by bad cases, especially those which impact ML model performance the most but also provide the most value for further ML model development—a key factor towards enabling enterprises to fast track their ML capabilities. Better yet, MLife is also flexible enough to be easily extensible to more complex scenarios for future maintenance. For this, we introduce two real-world use cases to demonstrate that MLife is particularly suitable for ML systems in their early phases.","Yang, Cong; Wang, Wenfeng; Zhang, Yunhui; Zhang, Zhikai; Shen, Lina; Li, Yipeng; See, John",Mach Learn,104,31

We aimed to review the methodology and outcomes of previous studies that have evaluated the use of telemedicine in movement disorders. Methods: This scoping review was performed by searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases from 1946 to November 2020. Studies that assessed the application of telemedicine for delivering care to patients with a movement disorder were included. We reported the aims and employed methodologies and categorized the outcomes from each study. Results: The search retrieved 228 articles, and 41 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The majority of telemedicine studies were case series or randomized controlled pilot trials, investigating feasibility and acceptability in Parkinson's disease. Even with heterogeneity among outcome measures, they can be categorized into themes, such as feasibility, satisfaction, and efficacy. Conclusions: Telemedicine use has grown rapidly, due to the demands of providing care during a global pandemic. This application of telemedicine has been considered a promising way to expand care in Neurology, although research evaluating the dissemination of its use is dilatory. This review highlights the number of studies that have found telemedicine to be an acceptable and feasible way to deliver care for movement disorders. Further research is needed to expand on harmonization of outcomes, reach, adoption, and long-term use of telemedicine.","Houston, Emily; Kennedy, Amanda G; O'Malley, Donna; Rabinowitz, Terry; Rose, Gail L; Boyd, James",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,104,16

The amount of time spent varies from day to day, yet little is known about the temporal nature of daily activity patterns in adults. The aim of this review is to identify the annual rhythms of daily activity behaviours in healthy adults and explore what temporal factors appear to influence these rhythms. METHODS Six online databases were searched for cohort studies exploring within-year temporal patterns (e.g. season effects, vacation, cultural festivals) in sleep, sedentary behaviour or physical activity in healthy 18 to 65-year-old adults. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias scoring were performed in duplicate. Extracted data was presented as mean daily minutes of each activity type, with transformations performed as needed. Where possible, meta-analyses were performed using random effect models to calculate standardised mean differences (SMD). RESULTS Of the 7009 articles identified, 17 studies were included. Studies were published between 2003 and 2019, representing 14 countries and 1951 participants, addressing variation in daily activities across season (n = 11), Ramadan (n = 4), vacation (n = 1) and daylight savings time transitions (n = 1). Meta-analyses suggested evidence of seasonal variation in activity patterns, with sleep highest in autumn (+ 12 min); sedentary behaviour highest in winter (+ 19 min); light physical activity highest in summer (+ 19 min); and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity highest in summer (+ 2 min) when compared to the yearly mean. These trends were significant for light physical activity in winter (SMD = - 0.03, 95% CI - 0.58 to - 0.01, P = 0.04). Sleep appeared 64 min less during, compared to outside Ramadan (non-significant). Narrative analyses for the impact of vacation and daylight savings suggested that light physical activity is higher during vacation and that sleep increases after the spring daylight savings transition, and decreases after the autumn transition. CONCLUSIONS Research into temporal patterns in activity behaviours is scarce. Existing evidence suggests that seasonal changes and periodic changes to usual routine, such as observing religious events, may influence activity behaviours across the year. Further research measuring 24-h time use and exploring a wider variety of temporal factors is needed.","Ferguson, Ty; Curtis, Rachel; Fraysse, Francois; Lagiseti, Rajini; Northcott, Celine; Virgara, Rosa; Watson, Amanda; Maher, Carol A",BMC public health,104,1

Aim To compare TEP inguinal hernia repair performed when the patient was treated under spinal anesthesia (SA) with that performed under general anesthesia (GA). Material and methods All total of 80 patients were studied between December 2015 and March 2017. Hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl were used for SA, to achieve a sensorial level of T3. Propofol, sevoflurane, rocuronium, fentanyl, and tracheal intubation were used for GA. Intraoperative events related to SA, surgical times, intra- and postoperative complications, and pain scores were recorded. Results The mean operative time in the SA TEP group was 70.2 ±6.7 min, which was significantly longer than the mean operative time in the GA TEP group of 67.2 ±6.2 min (p < 0.038). The mean pain scores in the SA TEP group were 0.23 ±0.42 at the first hour, 1.83 ±0.64 at 6 h and 1.28 ±0.45 at 24 h. These scores were significantly lower than the corresponding scores of 5.18 ±0.84 (p < 0.001), 2.50 ±0.55 (p < 0.001) and 1.58 ±0.55 in the GA TEP group. Generally, patients were more satisfied with SA than GA (p < 0.004). Conclusions Spinal anesthesia TEP is significantly less painful in the early postoperative period, leading to earlier ambulation than GA TEP. Additionally, SA TEP results in significantly less need for analgesics and better patient satisfaction results. SA TEP seems to be a better alternative than the existing GA TEP.","Yildirim, Dogan; Hut, Adnan; Uzman, Sinan; Kocakusak, Ahmet; Demiryas, Suleyman; Cakir, Mikail; Tatar, Cihad",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,104,1

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Forty-three male horses. METHODS Food was withheld for 36 hours before horses were placed under general anesthesia and positioned in dorsal recumbency. One laparoscopic portal and 2 instrument portals were placed for the laparoscopic procedure. A third instrument portal was created in bilateral cryptorchid horses. A vessel-sealing device was used for hemostasis and transection of retained testes. Descended testes were removed via closed castration with primary closure of the scrotal incision. Time required for removal of the retained testis and perioperative complications were recorded. Short-term (14, 30, 60 days) and long-term follow-up (>1.5 years) consisted of telephone interview with owners and referring veterinarians. RESULTS Forty-three male horses underwent laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy. Thirteen horses were bilateral cryptorchids, 19 were unilateral cryptorchids with a descended testis, and 11 were unilateral cryptorchids with 1 testis previously removed. Inguinal testes, identified in 5 horses, were pulled into the abdomen prior to excision. The vaginal ring was apposed with endoscopic staples in 3 of 5 horses. Mean surgery time was 31.34 ± 7.41 minutes. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications were encountered. No short-term or long-term complications were reported. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy can be safely performed with a vessel sealing-device in dorsal recumbent horses. This method was effective and did not result in any complication in our case series.","Bracamonte, José L; Thomas, Keri L",Veterinary surgery : VS,104,1

The presence and zoonotic assemblages of G. duodenalis have previously been reported in rabbits. In this study, to understand the infection status of G. duodenalis in rabbits from Shaanxi province, a total of 537 fecal samples were collected from two breeds of rabbits in four age groups (<30 days, 31-90 days, 91-200 days and >200 days) from four geographical origins (Fengxiang, Yangling, Tongchuan, and Shanyang). The presence of G. duodenalis in these samples was assessed using molecular assays based on beta-giardin (bg). The glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) loci were then amplified in the bg-positive samples for multi-locus genotype (MLG) analysis. The total prevalence of G. duodenalis in these rabbits was 3.54% (19/537). Giardia duodenalis infection was found in both breeds of rabbits, and in all farms and age groups, but with no statistically significant differences related to these factors (p > 0.05). Two assemblages, including B and E, were identified, with the former the predominant assemblage detected in both breeds, and in all age groups and farms. Sequence analysis revealed 2 (named as rbg1-2), 1 (named as rtpi1), and 2 (named as rgdh1-2) haplotypes at the gene loci of bg, tpi, and gdh, respectively, forming a multilocus genotype (MLG) of assemblage B (rbg1, rtpi1, and rgdh1). These findings reveal the significant zoonotic potential and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis in rabbits in Shaanxi Province, PR China.","Tang, Huan; Ye, Yonggang; Kang, Runmin; Yu, Jifeng; Cao, Ye",Parasite,104,23

METHODS The objective of this study was toevaluate the natural history of CSU in children and to identify predictors for remission. We performed an observational study, including patients aged 0 to 18 years with CSU diagnosed from January 2006 to July 2016. Disease activity was evaluated by the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) and the Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7); type of treatment and number of daily administrations were recorded. RESULTS Eighty patients were included in the study. At 1, 3, and 5 years from the onset of symptoms, 29%, 55%, and 72% of the patients with CSU were in remission, respectively. A higher hazard ratio of non-remission both at 3 years (HR=1.7, 95%CI=1.2-2.4, p-value 0.004) and at 5 years (HR=1.7, 95%CI=1.2-2.7, p-value 0.001), was related to higher severity of CSU at the baseline. Remission rates were significantly higher in patients who used a single dose of antihistamine drug (89% vs. 54% and 67% at 5 years, p-value=0.0003). During follow-up, four patients experienced a relapse (6.9%). The distance of relapses from remission varied from 2 to 5 years without evidence of a correlation between the age at the onset and the duration of the disease (Spearman's coefficient=0.02; p-value=0.9). CONCLUSION High UAS score at onset is a prognostic factor for the persistence of symptoms, as well as the need for multiple antihistamine drug doses per day or second-line treatments. Chronic urticaria (CU) is a relatively frequent disease with an estimated point prevalence of 0.7% around the world, subject to regional differences1 . Children seem to display a slightly higher frequency of the disease compared to adults, but to date, limited epidemiological data are available regardingthe paediatric age, with only a few studies specifically examining the Caucasian population Although it is considered a self-limited disease, CU often lasts for years. However, data on the natural historyof CU are lacking, particularly in children, and frequently are not specific to the different CU subtypes.Finally, management recommendations are mostly extrapolated from evidence in adults.","Cortellazzo Wiel, Luisa; Conversano, Ester; Giangreco, Manuela; Fagotto, Laura; Genovese, Maria Rita Lucia; Badina, Laura; Longo, Giorgio; Barbi, Egidio; Berti, Irene",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,104,16

There is little information concerning the imaging findings of arterioportal communications in small animals and no classification could be found for radiologists and surgeons. The aims of this retrospective descriptive multicentric study were to describe the computed tomographic characteristics of arterioportal communications in a group of cats and dogs, and to propose a classification based on computed tomography (CT) angiographic anatomy. Computed tomography databases from multiple veterinary hospitals were searched for cats and dogs with a diagnosis of arterioportal communication. A total of 36 animals (33 dogs, three cats) met the inclusion criteria. There were 32 intrahepatic arterioportal malformations and four extrahepatic fistulae. The intrahepatic arterioportal malformations were classified as right divisional (11/32) and left divisional (21/32), and the left divisional were subclassified as left medial (16/21) and left lateral (4/21). One patient showed multiple intrahepatic arterioportal communications with concomitant left medial and left lateral conformations. Two patients with intrahepatic arteriovenous malformation showed concomitant congenital intrahepatic shunts.

During surgery, a tack that had been used to secure mesh to the inferior aspect of the diaphragm was found to have penetrated the pericardium near the right ventricle. The offending foreign body was trimmed and reduced into the abdomen, and the patient recovered without further complication. A review of the literature reveals that, although rare, tamponade following diaphragmatic hernia repair and fundoplication surgery often results in fatal outcome.

During a unilateral TEP repair, 11-50% of patients have been found to have a hernia on the contralateral side. The extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair on the contralateral side, done at a later date after the previous TEP, is quite difficult. We compared the morbidity parameters in bilateral to unilateral hernia repairs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was carried out over a 3-year period in 929 patients in whom TEP was done. The recurrence rate, pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week, hospital stay, seroma formation, and urinary retention rates were noted. RESULTS In 929 patients, 825 underwent bilateral and 104 unilateral hernia repair. Follow-up range was 12-40 months. The mean operating time was more in the bilateral group (31.3 +/- 5.5 minutes), compared to the primary group (23.7 +/- 5.5 minutes) (P = 0.0001). Mean pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week were similar in both groups. Hospital stay was also comparable in both groups (1.07 +/- 0.3 days for bilateral vs. 1.09 +/- 0.3 days for unilateral). Urinary retention rates and seroma formation were similar in both groups. Recurrence and conversion to open were also similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Compared to unilateral inguinal hernia repair, bilateral TEP repair is associated with a similar length of hospital stay, postoperative pain scores at 24 hours and 1 week, seroma formation, urinary retention rates, recurrence, and conversion rates. Therefore, the morbidity parameters in bilateral laparoscopic hernia repair are similar to unilateral repair.","Ismail, Mohamed; Nair, Srijith; Garg, Pankaj",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The literature concerning the relationship with the pneumonia is scarce. At present, the coronavirus pandemic is a new cause of complicated pneumonias that can further affect the functionality of the most fragile patients. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to understand what characteristics are typical of patients affected by pneumonia, compared to other cases of delayed discharge. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted. All cases of delayed discharge were studied at the hospitalization units of a general university hospital in Northern Spain between 2007 and 2015. In order to compare the differential characteristics of the groups of patients with pneumonia with the total Student's T test and Pearson's chi-square test (χ²) were used. RESULTS 170 patients were identified with a diagnosis of pneumonia and delayed discharge for non-clinical reasons during the study period. These cases accumulated a total of 4,790 days of total stay, of which 1,294 days corresponded to the prolonged stay. The mean age of the patients was 80.23 years. The mean DRG weight was 2.28 [SD 0.579], and 14.12% of patients with pneumonia and delayed discharge died. So, patients with pneumonia were older (p =0.001), less complex (p =0.001) and suffered greater deaths compared to the remaining patients (p =0.001). CONCLUSIONS The sum of these factors has to do with comorbidities and complications associated with aging and the characteristics of conditions such as aspiration pneumonia.","Pellico-López, Amada; Fernández-Feito, Ana; Parás-Bravo, Paula; Herrero-Montes, Manuel; Cayón-De Las Cuevas, Joaquín; Cantarero, David; Paz-Zulueta, Maria",International journal of clinical practice,104,1

This paper reconsiders Rosenberg's seminal essay and the central question it addresses-what is an epidemic?-from the vantage of a historian in Hong Kong working on colonial and postcolonial Asia in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper begins by setting Rosenberg's essay in its historical context and then considers whether explanatory models developed in a Northern American context may be applicable (or not) to other non-Western settings. The paper makes the case for a re-interrogation of the ""epidemic"" as an epidemiological and social category, and it concludes by suggesting that COVID-19 is challenging underlying assumptions about what a ""crisis"" is to the extent that the pandemic may be understood as a crisis of crisis itself.","Peckham, Robert",Bulletin of the history of medicine,104,31

BACKGROUND To date, there have been no US Pre-Market Approval (PMA) bare metal renal stent device trials which have focused on improvement of blood pressure control as a primary effectiveness endpoint. METHODS Analysis of subject-level data from three large industry sponsored pre-market approval (PMA) trials was performed. Hypertensive patients (≥ 155 mmHg) with a ≥ 50% atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis were included. Thirty day and 9-month systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, renal function and 9-month duplex ultrasound assessment of renal artery patency were analyzed. RESULTS Initial data analysis of 600 patients from the 3 PMA trials identified 286 patients who met inclusion criteria. The mean baseline systolic blood pressure was 177.8 ± 19.3 mmHg with a mean 68.1% diameter renal artery stenosis. Nine months after successful stenting, the mean SBP was 156.7 ± 24.1 mmHg; the 9 month restenosis rate was 14.4%. CONCLUSION Based on the statistical modeling of these data and a priori established performance criteria, the co-primary endpoints of 9 month reduction in blood pressure and in-stent restenosis are proposed. The reduction in blood pressure will be analyzed as a continuous variable and will be compared to this performance goal.","Rocha-Singh, Krishna J; Novack, Victor; Pencina, Michael; D'Agostino, Ralph; Ansel, Gary; Rosenfield, Kenneth; Jaff, Michael R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,104,5

While the method is advantageous for better resolution, it suffers from grainy speckles and dark areas in the image mainly due to the interference of non-sinusoidal functions. In this Letter, we introduce a modified NL-p-DAS technique called nonlinear pth root spectral magnitude scaling (NL-p-SMS), which performs the pth root on the spectral magnitude instead of the temporal amplitude. We evaluated the US and PA images of NL-p-SMS against those of NL-p-DAS by comparing the axial and lateral line profiles, contrasts, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) in both phantom and in vivo imaging studies with various p values. As a result, we found that the NL-p-SMS has better axial resolution and CNR than the NL-p-DAS, and reduces the grainy speckles and dark area artifacts. We believe that, with this enhanced performance, our proposed approach could be an advancement compared to the existing nonlinear BF algorithms.","Cho, Seonghee; Jeon, Seungwan; Choi, Wonseok; Managuli, Ravi; Kim, Chulhong",Optics letters,104,16

The objective of the multicentre EWOLUTION registry was to obtain clinical data on procedural success and complications, and long-term patient outcomes, including bleeding and incidence of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Here, we report on the peri-procedural outcomes of up to 30 days. METHODS AND RESULTS Baseline/implant data are available for 1021 subjects. Subjects in the study were at high risk of stroke (average CHADS2 score: 2.8 ± 1.3, CHA2DS2-VASc: 4.5 ± 1.6) and moderate-to-high risk of bleeding (average HAS-BLED score: 2.3 ± 1.2). Almost half of the subjects (45.4%) had a history of TIA, ischaemic stroke, or haemorrhagic stroke; 62% of patients were deemed unsuitable for novel oral anticoagulant by their physician. The device was successfully deployed in 98.5% of patients with no flow or minimal residual flow achieved in 99.3% of implanted patients. Twenty-eight subjects experienced 31 serious adverse events (SAEs) within 1 day of the procedure. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.7%. The most common SAE occurring within 30 days of the procedure was major bleeding requiring transfusion. Incidence of SAEs within 30 days was significantly lower for subjects deemed to be ineligible for oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) compared with those eligible for OAT (6.5 vs. 10.2%, P = 0.042). CONCLUSION Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device has a high success rate in complete LAAC with low peri-procedural risk, even in a population with a higher risk of stroke and bleeding, and multiple co-morbidities.

METHODS In an observational, longitudinal study, peripapillary OCTA scans were collected to evaluate intrasession repeatability and intersession reproducibility using within-eye coefficient of variation (CVW) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Images were quantified using a custom research-oriented quantification software calculating vessel area density (VAD) and flux and a commercially developed, clinic-oriented quantification software (Cirrus 11.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec) calculating perfusion density (PD) and flux index (FI). Effect of signal strength on the reliability of OCTA parameters was also evaluated. RESULTS Among 120 non-glaucomatous eyes, intrasession CVW were 4.2% for VAD, 5.3% for flux, 1.5% for PD and 2.0% for FI. The intersession CVW were 6.5% for VAD, 8.0% for flux, 2.0% for PD and 3.2% for FI. The intrasession ICC ranged from 0.928 to 0.945, and intersession ICC ranged from 0.811 to 0.866. From 118 glaucomatous eyes, intrasession CVW was 9.0% for VAD, 10.3% for flux, 1.7% for PD and 2.3% for FI. The intersession CVW was 12.1% for VAD, 14.2% for flux, 2.3% for PD and 3.5% for FI. The intrasession ICC ranged from 0.904 to 0.972, and intersession ICC ranged from 0.855 to 0.955.

However, the term lacks a widely accepted quantitative definition. We show that, under alternative quantitative definitions of 'pandemic', an epidemiological metapopulation model produces different estimates of the probability of a pandemic. Critically, we show that using different definitions alters the projected effects on the pandemic risk of key parameters such as inter-regional travel rates, degree of pre-existing immunity, and heterogeneity of transmission rates between regions. Our analysis provides a foundation for understanding the scientific importance of precise language when discussing pandemic risk, illustrating how alternate definitions affect the conclusions of modelling studies. This serves to highlight that those working on pandemic preparedness must remain alert to the variability in the use of the term 'pandemic', and provide specific quantitative of analysis that we show to be sensitive to the pandemic definition.","Singer, B.

One of the main polluters is the energy sector, which includes transport. Despite the seemingly small share of aviation in emissions, its role as a polluter and CO2 emitter cannot be underestimated due to calculated specific rate and a number of factors that were researched. The purpose of this study was to analyze the aviation share in the polluters' structure and to study if Covid-19 restrictions influence on it, to investigate the share of CO2 emissions from air transport in Ukraine and to assess its impact, to forecast CO2 emissions in Ukraine by 2030 and to build scenarios of possible changes in the direction of decarbonization in the aviation industry. Analysis and synthesis, comparison, methods of pairwise regression and modelling scenarios were used for solving these tasks. The results show that the aviation industry could achieve the carbon reduction targets only by applying different types of carbon pricing with conducting the research and development in the sphere. The last significant improvement in aircraft design technologies and flight operations was achieved almost 60 years ago. Economic incentives at the international and local scales should be used to stimulate aviation manufacturers to invest significant money on R&D to find stable solutions to achieve decarbonization. Development of Ukrainian aviation industry should not stand aside from global trends and must meet modern challenges, including environmental issues. The created scenarios show solutions to achieve decarbonization goals that align with EU best practices. © 2021 Oksana Ovdiienko et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Ovdiienko, O.; Hryhorak, M.; Marchuk, V.; Bugayko, D.",Environmental and Socio-Economic Studies,104,1

Currently, there are no suitable tumour markers for early detection of CRC. In a retrospective study we previously found discriminative CRC serum protein profiles with surface enhanced laser desorption ionisation—time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). We now aimed at prospective validation of these profiles. Additionally, we assessed their applicability for follow-up after surgery and investigated tissue protein profiles of patients with CRC and adenomatous polyps (AP). Serum and tissue samples were collected from patients without known malignancy with an indication for colonoscopy and patients with AP and CRC during colonoscopy. Serum samples of controls (CON; n = 359), patients with AP (n = 177) and CRC (n = 73), as well as tissue samples from AP (n = 52) and CRC (n = 47) were analysed as described previously. Peak intensities were compared by non-parametric testing. Discriminative power of differentially expressed proteins was assessed with support vector machines (SVM). We confirmed the decreased serum levels of apolipoprotein C-1 in CRC in the current population. No differences were observed between CON and AP. Apolipoprotein C-I levels did not change significantly within 1 month post-surgery, although a gradual return to normal levels was observed. Several proteins differed between AP and CRC tissue, among which a peak with similar mass as apolipoprotein C-1. This peak was increased in CRC compared to AP. Although we prospectively validated the serum decrease of apolipoprotein C-1 in CRC, serum protein profiles did not yield SVM classifiers with suitable sensitivity and specificity for classification of our patient groups.","Engwegen, Judith Y.M.N.; Depla, Annekatrien C.T.M.; Smits, Marianne E.; Cats, Annemieke; Tuynman, Henriëtte; van Heukelem, Henk A.; Snel, Pleun; Meuleman, Wouter; Wessels, Lodewyk F.; Schellens, Jan H.M.; Beijnen, Jos H.",Biomark Insights,104,30

Eleven groups were housed in feedlots in Ontario, and 21 groups in feedlots in Alberta. Serum antibody titers to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), Mycoplasma dispar and M. bovis, plus data on bovine corona virus (BCV) from a previous study were investigated for their association with the risk of bovine respiratory disease (BRD), and with 28-day weight change, both before and after controlling for titers to Pasteurella haemolytica and Haemophilus somnus. Exposure to IBRV and M. bovis was infrequent, and although exposure to PIV-3 was more common, none of these agents had important associations with BRD. Higher titers to BVDV, BRSV, and BCV on arrival were associated with reduced risks of BRD and increased weight gains. However, there was some variation in these relationships and higher arrival titers to BVDV and BRSV in a subset of the calves were associated with increased risks of BRD. Titer increases to BVDV were associated with a higher risk of BRD and lower weight gains. Titer increases to BRSV were not usually associated with the occurrence of BRD, but titer increases to BRSV in a subset of calves that were vaccinated against BRSV, on arrival, were associated with an elevated risk of BRD. Of all the agents studied, BVDV had the most consistent associations with elevated risk of BRD and lower weight gains. Higher BRSV arrival titers were related to lower risk of BRD and higher weight gains; in some instances titer increases to BRSV were associated with higher BRD risk. Higher titers to BCV on arrival were related to reduced risks of BRD. Practical ways of adequately preventing the negative effects of these agents are still needed.","Martin, S W; Nagy, E; Armstrong, D; Rosendal, S",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,104,33

We conducted a survey on fifth year medical (M5) students pre- and peri-influenza A (H1N1-2009) pandemic, attempting to ascertain whether the pandemic had affected their knowledge, perception and practice of hand hygiene and other aspects of infection control. METHODS A self-administered anonymous survey of M5 students was performed between August 2008 and February 2010, corresponding to two successive classes: M5-2008 (Class of 2004/09) and M5-2009 (Class of 2005/10). Completed survey forms were collated and analysed centrally. RESULTS There were 191 and 123 respondents for M5-2008 and M5-2009, respectively, corresponding to 74.9% and 47.3% of the respective classes. More M5-2009 respondents recognised alcohol hand rub as the preferred mode of hand hygiene practice and felt that there were insufficient isolation facilities in hospitals. Otherwise, survey responses were consistent. The majority felt that few doctors practiced hand hygiene appropriately, with the major obstructing factor being lack of time during ward rounds. The most important factor for improving hand hygiene compliance among junior doctors and students was for senior clinicians to lead by example. A significant minority believed that it was necessary to isolate patients with chikungunya, malaria or HIV. CONCLUSION The 2009 H1N1 pandemic made little impact on medical students' knowledge and practice of infection control. Nonetheless, their responses have suggested avenues for improving infection control practice, including persuading senior clinicians to lead by example in hand hygiene practice and addressing gaps in knowledge on patient isolation policies.","Hsu, L Y; Jin, J; Ang, B S; Kurup, A; Tambyah, P A",Singapore medical journal,104,17

Parallel testing was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates prospectively collected at referral Children's Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (Barcelona, Spain) between June and November 2015. Agreement values between the two tests and kappa coefficients were assessed. Bidirectional sequencing was performed for the resolution of discordant results. A total of 319 samples were analyzed by both techniques. A total of 268 (84.0%) of them yielded concordant results. Positive percent agreement values ranged from 83.3 to 100%, while the negative percent agreement was more than 99% for all targets except for enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV; 94.4%). Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.83 to 1.00. Discrepancy analysis confirmed 66.0% of NxTAG RPP RUO results. A total of 260 viruses were detected, with EV/RV (n = 105, 40.4%) being the most prevalent target. Viral coinfections were found in 44 (14.2%) samples.

This study reviewed findings of upper endoscopy in symptomatic patients at a quaternary bariatric referral center. Further investigation included symptom constellation, potential etiologies, and efficacy of treatment for patients found to have marginal ulcer. METHODS Patients presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were included in this study. An institutional review board-approved database was queried for the period 1 June 2010 to 31 August 2011. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with marginal ulcer. Statistical analysis was performed using PASW version 18 for Windows. RESULTS During the study period, 455 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed for 328 consecutive symptomatic patients. Marginal ulcer, found in 112 patients (34 %), was diagnosed for 59 of the patients (53 %) within 12 months after surgery and for 53 of the patients (47 %) more than 12 months after surgery. In patients found to have marginal ulcer, the most common presenting symptoms were pain, dysphagia, nausea, and vomiting. All the patients with marginal ulcer underwent acid suppression and cytoprotective therapy. Using uni- and multivariate analyses for healing, nonhealing, and healing with recurrence, tobacco use was found to be the solitary significant risk factor for recurrence (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Patients with pain or dysphagia after gastric bypass warrant upper endoscopy given the high yield for abnormalities. Although the risk factors for the development of marginal ulcer remain multifactorial, a thorough investigation for potential etiologies including tobacco, alcohol, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) usage should be determined and eliminated. The presence of multiple risk factors may pose a higher challenge in ulcer resolution, leading to increased recurrence. In the current series, prior or current tobacco use remained the sole independent risk factor for ulcer persistence.","El-Hayek, K; Timratana, P; Shimizu, H; Chand, B",Surgical endoscopy,104,16

The manipulated mouse genome has become accepted as a model for understanding the genetic basis of human conditions and diseases. Consequently, biomedical research institutions have seen significant increases in the use of mice since the early 1980s, and these increases are largely attributable to the use of genetically modified mice.

METHODOLOGY: This study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of patients who presented to emergency department, between March 1 - May 1, 2020, without COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia on admission but were incidentally detected to have thoracic computerized tomography (CT) findings suggestive of COVID-19. The patients' sociodemographic and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory test results, clinical and radiological findings, treatment protocols, and prognoses were recorded. RESULTS: We incidentally diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia in 81 asymptomatic patients. All patients presented to emergency department with traumatic injuries. Of these, 38 (46%) were injured in in-vehicle traffic accidents; 27 (34%) out-of-vehicle traffic accidents; 14 (18%) simple falls; and 2 (2%) falls from a height. Only 42 (48%) patients had a history of suspected contact with a COVID-19 positive individual. The mean time to symptom onset of 81 patients was 5±2 days. An analysis based on thoracic computerized tomography findings showed that the common finding found in all patients was ground glass opacity (GGO). While 55 (68%) patients had GGO alone, 10 (12%) had additional fine reticulations; 6 (7%) had an additional halo sign; 6 (7%) had an additional air bronchogram; and 4 (5%) had an additional area of consolidation. None of the patients died during follow-up, and all of them were discharged. CONCLUSION: Early identification and isolation of asymptomatic patients is of great importance for reducing the speed of propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidentally diagnosed cases have made us to consider that there is a need to increase the number of screening tests. We also believe that healthcare staff should suspect COVID-19 pneumonia in every patient irrespective presentation type, place importance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and not examine any patient without wearing PPE.","Gormeli Kurt, Nazli; Gunes, Celal",Int J Clin Pract,104,16

A systematic review,12.978919,11.605252,2020,"BACKGROUND: After the 2002/2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, 30% of survivors exhibited persisting structural pulmonary abnormalities. The long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are yet unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, observational study, we systematically evaluated the cardiopulmonary damage in subjects recovering from COVID-19 at 60 and 100 days after confirmed diagnosis. We conducted a detailed questionnaire, clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, echocardiography and thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Data from 145 COVID-19 patients were evaluated, and 41% of all subjects exhibited persistent symptoms 100 days after COVID-19 onset, with dyspnoea being most frequent (36%). Accordingly, patients still displayed an impaired lung function, with a reduced diffusing capacity in 21% of the cohort being the most prominent finding. Cardiac impairment, including a reduced left ventricular function or signs of pulmonary hypertension, was only present in a minority of subjects. CT scans unveiled persisting lung pathologies in 63% of patients, mainly consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or reticulation in the lower lung lobes, without radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis. Sequential follow-up evaluations at 60 and 100 days after COVID-19 onset demonstrated a vast improvement of symptoms and CT abnormalities over time. CONCLUSION: A relevant percentage of post-COVID-19 patients presented with persisting symptoms and lung function impairment along with radiological pulmonary abnormalities &gt;100 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, our results indicate a significant improvement in symptoms and cardiopulmonary status over time.","Sonnweber, T.; Sahanic, S.; Pizzini, A.; Luger, A.; Schwabl, C.; Sonnweber, B.; Kurz, K.; Koppelstatter, S.; Haschka, D.; Petzer, V.; Boehm, A.; Aichner, M.; Tymoszuk, P.; Lener, D.; Theurl, M.; Lorsbach-Kohler, A.; Tancevski, A.; Schapfl, A.; Schaber, M.; Hilbe, R.; Nairz, M.; Puchner, B.; Huttenberger, D.; Tschurtschenthaler, C.; Ashoff, M.; Peer, A.; Hartig, F.; Bellmann, R.; Joannidis, M.; Gollmann-Tepekoylu, C.; Holfeld, J.; Feuchtner, G.; Egger, A.; Hoermann, G.; Schroll, A.; Fritsche, G.; Wildner, S.; Bellmann-Weiler, R.; Kirchmair, R.; Helbok, R.; Prosch, H.; Rieder, D.; Trajanoski, Z.; Kronenberg, F.; Woll, E.; Weiss, G.; Widmann, G.; Loffler-Ragg, J.; Tancevski, I.",European Respiratory Journal,104,33

However, the infection condition of the genital system is unknown. Our aim in this study was to determine if SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Ten women with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Tongji Zhongfa Hospital intensive care unit from 4 February 2020 through 24 February 2020 were included. Clinical records, laboratory results, and computed tomography examinations were retrospectively reviewed. The potential for genital infection was accessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluids obtained from vaginal swab samples. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaginal fluids. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of the 10 women were similar to those reported in other severe COVID-19 patients. All 10 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal fluid, and all samples tested negative for the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this small group of cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus does not exist in the vaginal fluids of severe COVID-19 patients.","Qiu, Lin; Liu, Xia; Xiao, Meng; Xie, Jing; Cao, Wei; Liu, Zhengyin; Morse, Abraham; Xie, Yuhua; Li, Taisheng; Zhu, Lan",Clin Infect Dis,104,20

Among the entire set of PT dependents, candidates with cardiovascular ailments are the major set of the population requiring lifelong anticoagulation therapy and supervised PT administration. Additionally, the increasing incidence of COVID affected by complications in coagulation dynamics has been strikingly evident. Prolonged PT along with sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC score > 3) has been found to be very common in critical COVID or CAC-affected cases. Considering the growing significance of an efficient point-of-care PT assaying platform to counter the increasing fatalities associated with cardio-compromised and coagulation aberrations propping up from CAC cases, the following review discusses the evolution of lab-based PT to point of care (PoC) PT assays. Recent advances in the field of PoC PT devices utilizing optics, acoustics, and mechanical and electrochemical methods in microsensors to detect blood coagulation are further elaborated. Thus, the following review holistically aims to motivate the future PT assay designers/researchers by detailing the relevance of PT and associated protocols for cardio compromised and COVID affected along with the intricacies of previously engineered PoC PT diagnostics.","Saha, Anubhuti; Bajpai, Ashutosh; Krishna, Vinay; Bhattacharya, Shantanu",Sensors (Basel),104,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The original population of this case series consisted of 75 patients with one crater-like defect and probing depth (PD) &#8805;6 mm. After flap elevation, defects were assigned to one characteristic class and treated by means of DBBMC. Following healing, patients were enrolled in an individualized supportive periodontal/peri-implant (SPT) program. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients reached the 5 years examination, as 11 patients were lost to follow-up and 13 implants were removed. Overall treatment success was registered in 29 patients (45.3%). Mean PD and BOP significantly decreased at one year and remained stable for the rest of observation period. No correlation was found between implant survival rate and defect configuration (p = 0.213). Patients, who did not fully adhere to the SPT, experienced more complications and implant loss than those who regularly attended recall appointments (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed reconstructive treatment resulted in a high 5 years implant survival rate in patients who fully adhered to SPT.

Coagulopathy is one of the major characteristics in the COVID-19 patients. A growing number of studies have found that the severe COVID-19 patients have thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolism. Coagulopathy associated with increased risk of death in the patients. Unfortunately, the mechanism of coagulopathy is not clearly addressed. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis and improving the coagulopathy through efficient treatment may help to stop disease progression, reduce mortality and sequelae. In severe COVID-19 patients, inflammation, cytokine storm, and coagulation are closely related, which together cause blood congestion and thrombosis. Many cytokines activate blood cells, expressing activating factors or releasing activated microparticles, and then accelerating thrombosis. However, the role of blood cells is not well understood in COVID-19 patients. In addition, cytokines stimulate endothelial cells, transforming them into a procoagulant phenotype. Therefore, determine their role and propose new strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 patients.

The disease COVID-19 is now spread worldwide and has tremendous socio-economic consequences. The origin of the virus can be reconstructed through epidemiological studies and, even more so, from genome comparisons. How the evolution of the virus and the transition to humans might have happened is the subject of much speculation. It is considered certain that the virus is of animal origin and very likely passed from bats to humans in a zoonotic event. An intermediate host was postulated, but many SARS-like bat viruses have the ability to infect human cells directly, which has been shown experimentally by scientists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology using collected specimens containing virus material from horseshoe bats. The propagation of SARS-like bat viruses in cell culture allowed experiments aimed at increasing the infectivity of the virus and adaptation to human cells. This article summarizes the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 and focusses on a specific sequence encoding the spike protein. Possible scenarios of virus evolution are discussed, with particular emphasis on the hypothesis that the virus could have emerged unintentionally through routine culture or gain-of-function experiments in a laboratory, where it was optimally adapted to human cells and caused cryptic infections among workers who finally spread the virus causing the pandemic.","Kaina, Bernd",In Vivo,104,13

We further define the additional data that should be collected in parallel without impacting the rapid path to clinical development. Accelerated paths for antivirals, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and other agents have been developed and can serve as ""roadmaps"" to support prioritization of compounds for clinical testing. These accelerated paths are fueled by a skewed risk-benefit ratio and are necessary to advance therapeutic agents into human trials rapidly and safely for COVID-19.

Public health authorities (PHAs) are increasingly adopting the use of social media such as Facebook to rapidly communicate and disseminate pandemic response measures to the public. Understanding of communication strategies across different PHAs and examining the public response on the social media landscapes can help improve practices for disseminating information to the public. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine COVID-19-related outreach efforts of PHAs in Singapore, the United States, and England, and the corresponding public response to these outreach efforts on Facebook. METHODS: Posts and comments from the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and Public Health England (PHE) in England were extracted from January 1, 2019, to March 18, 2020. Posts published before January 1, 2020, were categorized as pre-COVID-19, while the remaining posts were categorized as peri-COVID-19 posts. COVID-19-related posts were identified and classified into themes. Metrics used for measuring outreach and engagement were frequency, mean posts per day (PPD), mean reactions per post, mean shares per post, and mean comments per post. Responses to the COVID-19 posts were measured using frequency, mean sentiment polarity, positive to negative sentiments ratio (PNSR), and positive to negative emotions ratio (PNER). Toxicity in comments were identified and analyzed using frequency, mean likes per toxic comment, and mean replies per toxic comment. Trend analysis was performed to examine how the metrics varied with key events such as when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. RESULTS: The MOH published more COVID-19 posts (n=271; mean PPD 5.0) compared to the CDC (n=94; mean PPD 2.2) and PHE (n=45; mean PPD 1.4). The mean number of comments per COVID-19 post was highest for the CDC (mean CPP 255.3) compared to the MOH (mean CPP 15.6) and PHE (mean CPP 12.5). Six major themes were identified, with posts about prevention and safety measures and situation updates being prevalent across the three PHAs. The themes of the MOH's posts were diverse, while the CDC and PHE posts focused on a few themes. Overall, response sentiments for the MOH posts (PNSR 0.94) were more favorable compared to response sentiments for the CDC (PNSR 0.57) and PHE (PNSR 0.55) posts. Toxic comments were rare (0.01%) across all PHAs. CONCLUSIONS: PHAs' extent of Facebook use for outreach purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied among the three PHAs, highlighting the strategies and approaches that other PHAs can potentially adopt. Our study showed that social media analysis was capable of providing insights about the communication strategies of PHAs during disease outbreaks.","Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Tan, Soon Guan; Wee, Hwee Lin",J Med Internet Res,104,16

The ACTIV master protocols were designed with a portfolio approach to serve the following patient populations with COVID-19: mild to moderately ill outpatients, moderately ill inpatients, and critically ill inpatients. To facilitate the execution of these studies and minimize start-up time, ACTIV selected several existing networks to launch the master protocols. The master protocols were also designed to test several agent classes prioritized by ACTIV that covered the spectrum of the disease pathophysiology. Each protocol, either adaptive or pragmatic, was designed to efficiently select those treatments that provide benefit to patients while rapidly eliminating those that were either ineffective or unsafe.

We develop a stochastic model of over-collateralized stablecoins that helps explain such crises. In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by speculators who optimize the profitability of a leveraged position while incorporating the forward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which involves the endogenous price of the stablecoin. We formally characterize regimes that are interpreted as stable and unstable for the stablecoin. We prove bounds on the probabilities of large deviations and quadratic variation in the stable domain and distinctly greater price variance in the unstable domain. The unstable domain can be triggered by large deviations, collapsed expectations, or liquidity problems from deleveraging. We formally characterize a deflationary deleveraging spiral as a submartingale that can cause the system to behave in counterintuitive ways due to liquidity problems in a crisis. These deleveraging spirals, which resemble short squeezes, lead to faster collateral drawdown (and potential shortfalls) and are accompanied by higher price variance, as experienced on Black Thursday. We also demonstrate `perfect' stability results in idealized settings and discuss mechanisms which could bring realistic settings closer to such idealized stable settings.","Klages-Mundt, Ariah; Minca, Andreea",,104,16

We conducted a meta-analysis to provide an in-depth statistical analysis of the correlation between altmetric score and number of citations in the field of health sciences. Methods: Three online databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) were systematically searched, without language restrictions, from the earliest publication date available through February 29, 2020, using the keywords ""altmetric,"" ""citation,"" and ""correlation."" Grey literature was also searched via WorldCat, Open Grey, and Google Scholar (first 100 hits only). All studies in the field of health sciences that reported on this correlation were included. Effect sizes were calculated using Fisher's z transformation of correlations. Subgroup analyses based on citation source and sampling methods were performed. Results: From 27 included articles, 8 articles comprise several independent studies. The total sample size was 9,943 articles comprised of 35 studies. The overall pooled effect size was 0.19 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.26).

It has helped in diagnosing and treating critically ill patients. The added advantage of ultrasonography is that it is a fantastic diagnostic tool that is easily available at the bedside, repeatable, more objective, and has a steep learning curve. It has become fifth vital assessment along with inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. In the current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic, the disease caused by virus ranges from mild influenza-like illness to severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). Among the patients developing SARI, few require hospitalization and might need intensive care management.

Attempts to find an effective vaccine are challenging, time-consuming though interminable. Hence, re-proposing effective drugs is reliable and effective alternative. Taking into account the genome similarity of COVID-19 with SARS-CoV, drugs with safety profiles could be fast solution. Clinical trials encouraged the use of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 inhibition. One of the possible inhibition pathways is the competitive binding with the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), in particular with the cellular Sialic acid (Neu5Ac). Here, we investigate the possible binding mechanism of ClQ and ClQOH with sialic acid both in the gas phase and in water using density functional theory (DFT). We investigated the binding of the neutral, monoprotonated and diprotonated ClQs and ClQOHs to sialic acid to simulate the pH effect on the cellular receptor binding. DFT results reveals that monoprotonated ClQ+ and ClQOH+, which account for more than 66% in the solution, possess high reactivity and binding towards sialic acid. The Neu5Ac-ClQ and the analogues Neu5Ac-ClQOH adducts were stabilized in water than in the gas phase. The molecular complexes stabilize by strong hydrogen bonding and &#960; - &#960; stacking forces. In addition, proton-transfer in Neu5Ac-ClQOH+ provides more stabilizing power and cellular recognition binding forces. These results shed light on possible recognition mechanism and help future breakthroughs for COVID-19 inhibitors.","Altalhi, Tariq A; Alswat, Khaled; Alsanie, Walaa F; Ibrahim, Mohamed M; Aldalbahi, Ali; El-Sheshtawy, Hamdy S",J Mol Struct,104,32

Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020. METHODS: The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers. RESULTS: The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s &#8805;2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided deeper insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Kuwait and provided an important platform for rapid guidance of decisions related to intervention activities.","Alkhamis, Moh A; Al Youha, Sarah; Khajah, Mohammad M; Ben Haider, Nour; Alhardan, Sumayah; Nabeel, Ahmad; Al Mazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Sabah, Salman K",Int J Infect Dis,104,24

Emerging immunological phenomena such as Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Disorder Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children are now being observed, though the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Understanding the mechanisms through which pediatric patients are protected from severe novel coronaviruses infections will provide critical clues to the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and inform future therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

Methods: We analysed the effective reproductive number, underreporting of cases, burden of critical beds, case fatality ratio and number of diagnostic RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Results: After an accelerated onset, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be relatively controlled in Chile (late April 2020), with reproductive numbers close to 1.00. However, at this time, the load of infected patients was high, with an important number of underreported cases; the diagnostic effort was still limited and heterogeneous across regions. After 1 May up to 30 June a marked exponential increase in the number of cases was observed with a peak on June 14. In this last period the occupation of intensive care unit beds increased to saturation level (89% nationally; 95% in the Metropolitan Region). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the implemented public health interventions have been initially effective in decreasing the spread of the pandemic. Premature decisions to relax these interventions may have resulted in a rebound in cases with a rapid saturation of the health care system.","Canals, Mauricio; Cuadrado, Cristóbal; Canals, Andrea; Yohannessen, Karla; Lefio, Luis A; Bertoglia, Maria P; Eguiguren, Pamela; Siches, Izkia; Iglesias, Verónica; Arteaga, Oscar",Rev Panam Salud Publica,104,20

This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from 20 January to 8 February 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until 26 March 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In total, the median SARS-CoV-2 shedding period and clinical course were 12 (IQR: 9-17; mean: 13.4, 95% CI: 12.5, 14.2) and 20 (IQR: 16-24; mean: 21.2, 95% CI: 20.1, 22.3) days, respectively, and ICU patients had longer median viral shedding periods (21 [17-24] versus 11 [9-15]) and clinical courses (30 [22-33] vs. 19 [15.8-22]) than non-ICU patients (both p < .0001).

Of the replacements, 5/31 (16%) were placed via an IJV access and 10/33 (30.3%) were placed via a CVF access, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.18). The average time to malfunction/replacement was 7.8 ± 4.8 days for catheters placed via an IJ access versus 3.4 ± 3.3 days for catheters placed via a CFV access (P = 0.055), trending toward significance. Conclusions: A high incidence of temporary dialysis catheter lumen thrombosis was present in patients with COVID-19 infection. This may be due to COVID related thrombosis versus decreased level of catheter care. Catheters placed via a femoral vein access had more frequent malfunction and with shorter indwelling time, although not significant, which may be due to small sample size.","Kubiak, A.; Chauhan, N.; Haque, H.; Shrinet, A.; Shanmugasundaram, S.; Kumar, A.; Shukla, P.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,104,21

A Cohort Study From a German Insurance Claims Database,12.930922,11.812227,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is little information on how to prioritize testis cancer (TC) patients' care during COVID-19 pandemic in order to relieve its pressure on the health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To describe the recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with TC amidst COVID- 19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pubmed search and review of the main urological association guidelines on TC. RESULTS: The biology of TC requires immediate care of patients during diagnosis, initial surgical therapy and management of recurrent disease. Active surveillance is the first choice of management and should be offered to all compliant clinical stage I TC patients provided they understand the need to self-isolate. Active surveillance may also help decrease the demand for intensive care unit beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and other critical hospital and human resources by minimizing surgeries without compromising patient outcomes. Complications of therapy and symptomatic patients represent medical emergencies and should be treated immediately. Telemedicine may be useful during follow-up periods. CONCLUSIONS: Most stages of testis cancer require urgent care; however, all recommendations must be adapted to local health care priorities considering that most of these patients are at low risk of severe COVID-19 infection.","Secin, Fernando P",Int Braz J Urol,104,20

Four human coronaviruses (hCoVs)-229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43-circulate globally, commonly infect children and typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three novel coronaviruses of zoonotic origin have emerged during the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These novel coronaviruses are known to cause severe illness and death predominantly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Consistent with what has been observed during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or to have mild-to-moderate illness, with few deaths reported in children globally thus far. Clinical symptoms and laboratory and radiological abnormalities in children have been similar to those reported in adults but are generally less severe. A rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which has resulted in critical illness and some deaths has recently been described. Clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccine development should include paediatric considerations. Children may play an important role in the transmission of infection and outbreak dynamics and could be a key target population for effective measures to control outbreaks. The unintended consequences of the unprecedented scale and duration of pandemic control measures for children and families around the world should be carefully examined.

Xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability tests were used in investigating the anti-inflammatory activities. The anti-nociceptive effects of indigo were assessed through acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate test, and formalin test, and spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance were evaluated. The mechanisms of activities of indigo were explored by evaluating the expression levels of I&#954;B kinase (IKK)ß, p-IKKß, inhibitor &#954;B (I&#954;B)&#945;, p-I&#954;B&#945;, p65 nuclear factor (NF)-kB, p-p65 NF-&#954;B, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through western blotting and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that indigo significantly reduced xylene-induced ear edema, carrageenan-induced paw edema, and acetic acid-induced vascular permeation. In addition, indigo significantly inhibited nociception induced by acetic acid and formalin. However, the level of nociception was not decreased by indigo in the hot plate test, and indigo did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity and motor performance. The expression levels of p-IKKß, p-I&#954;B&#945;, p65 NF-kB, p-p65 NF-&#954;B, COX-2, iNOS, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, and PGE2 decreased, whereas the expression level of I&#954;B&#945; increased obviously after indigo treatment. In conclusion, indigo exerts significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in mice by inhibiting IKKß phosphorylation and reducing the production of important pain mediators, such as PGE2 and COX-2, via the IKKß/I&#954;B/NF-&#954;B pathway.","Liu, Ning; Zhang, Guo-Xin; Niu, Ya-Ting; Wang, Qing; Zheng, Jie; Yang, Jia-Mei; Sun, Tao; Niu, Jian-Guo; Yu, Jian-Qiang",Food Funct,104,24

The current article investigates this notion in four separate studies, and we also assess the mediating effect of face mask perceptions between age and face mask wearing using the eight-dimension Face Masks Perceptions Scale (FMPS). The sample-size weighted average correlation between age and face mask wearing was -.07 (95%C.I.[-.14, .001], Z-value = -1.928, P = .054, n = 824), indicating that older individuals are slightly less likely to wear face masks compared to younger individuals. Age did not have significant relations with any face mask perceptions, and the mediating effect of face mask perceptions was not robust or consistent. This indicates that the relation between age and face mask wearing is not explained by face mask perceptions, and researchers must turn to other explanatory mechanisms to understand this relation. We propose possible avenues, such as dual-system theories, to further investigate this research question as well as others associated with face mask perceptions, face mask wearing and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Howard, Matt C",J. public health (Oxf),104,29

METHODS: Data from 331 participants within the service and manufacturing sector in the Flemish Employees' Physical Activity (FEPA) study were used, with objective measures of OPA and subjective measures of physical and psychosocial work environment. A modified Nordic questionnaire collected data on LBP and NSP. RESULTS: LBP (> 30 days over a year) was reported by 25% of participants, NSP (> 30 days over a year) by 30% and the composite measure of LBP/NSP simultaneously by 17%. Objective measures of OPA were not significantly associated with any pain groups. In the final model, self-reported physical demands were associated with NSP (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.30-3.18) and LBP/NSP (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.16-3.45) but not LBP. Job control was negatively associated with LBP (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99) and LBP/NSP (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3-0.98). CONCLUSION: Objective measures were not associated with LBP or NSP. Self-reported measures provided insights into potential workplace hazards such as physical demands and job control which can be used to inform future strategies to prevent the development of LBP and NSP.","Oakman, Jodi; Ketels, Margo; Clays, Els",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,104,16

Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","Yang, Shuhang; Liu, Yu; Chen, Ke; Li, Tong; Huang, Yi; Chen, Xiaolei; Qi, Pengfang; Xu, Yazhi; Yu, Feifei; Yang, Yuling; Chen, Youhua",Medicine (Baltimore),104,15

Mouse aSyn contains a threonine residue at position 53 that mimics the human familial PD substitution A53T, yet in contrast to A53T patients, mice show no evidence of aSyn neuropathology even after aging. Here, we studied the neurotoxicity of human A53T, mouse aSyn, and various human-mouse chimeras in cellular and in vivo models, as well as their biochemical properties relevant to aSyn pathobiology. METHODS: Primary midbrain cultures transduced with aSyn-encoding adenoviruses were analyzed immunocytochemically to determine relative dopaminergic neuron viability. Brain sections prepared from rats injected intranigrally with aSyn-encoding adeno-associated viruses were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine nigral dopaminergic neuron viability and striatal dopaminergic terminal density. Recombinant aSyn variants were characterized in terms of fibrillization rates by measuring thioflavin T fluorescence, fibril morphologies via electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and protein-lipid interactions by monitoring membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle disruption. Statistical tests consisted of ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn's multiple comparisons test or a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mouse aSyn was less neurotoxic than human aSyn A53T in cell culture and in rat midbrain, and data obtained for the chimeric variants indicated that the human-to-mouse substitutions D121G and N122S were at least partially responsible for this decrease in neurotoxicity. Human aSyn A53T and a chimeric variant with the human residues D and N at positions 121 and 122 (respectively) showed a greater propensity to undergo membrane-induced aggregation and to elicit vesicle disruption. Differences in neurotoxicity among the human, mouse, and chimeric aSyn variants correlated weakly with differences in fibrillization rate or fibril morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Mouse aSyn is less neurotoxic than the human A53T variant as a result of inhibitory effects of two C-terminal amino acid substitutions on membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle permeabilization. Our findings highlight the importance of membrane-induced self-assembly in aSyn neurotoxicity and suggest that inhibiting this process by targeting the C-terminal domain could slow neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathy disorders.","Landeck, Natalie; Strathearn, Katherine E; Ysselstein, Daniel; Buck, Kerstin; Dutta, Sayan; Banerjee, Siddhartha; Lv, Zhengjian; Hulleman, John D; Hindupur, Jagadish; Lin, Li-Kai; Padalkar, Sonal; Stanciu, Lia A; Lyubchenko, Yuri L; Kirik, Deniz; Rochet, Jean-Christophe",Mol Neurodegener,104,33

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. Objective: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Design, Setting, and Participants: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1â¯017â¯720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. Exposures: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. Results: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2â¯231â¯134 (117â¯867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799â¯949 (60â¯279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527â¯409 (40â¯637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450â¯575 (32â¯716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed.","Patel, Mehul D; Rosenstrom, Erik; Ivy, Julie S; Mayorga, Maria E; Keskinocak, Pinar; Boyce, Ross M; Hassmiller Lich, Kristen; Smith, Raymond L; Johnson, Karl T; Delamater, Paul L; Swann, Julie L",JAMA Netw Open,104,12

Unfortunately, the Nigeria media is awash with images of misuse and abuse of face masks by the public, government officials, and healthcare workers. Medical masks are used widely in community settings amid reported scarcity within healthcare facilities. It is observed that some people wear face masks on their chin and neck, and mask wearers give no attention to covering their mouth and nose, especially when talking. Used face masks are kept with personal belongings or disposed indiscriminately in public spaces, leading to self and environmental contamination. Inappropriate use and disposal of face masks in Nigeria could promote the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country and negate the country's efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therapeutic class of IS medication, comorbidities, and demographic factors were combined into multivariate models to determine predictors of COVID-19 infection, admission, ventilation, and mortality. RESULTS: Of 213 patients with IMID, 36.2% tested positive for COVID-19, and they had no greater odds of being hospitalized or requiring ventilation relative to the general population. No IS therapeutic worsened the course of disease after multivariate correction, although multidrug regimens and biologics predicted an increased and decreased rate of hospitalization, respectively, with the latter driven by tumor necrosis factor &#945; inhibitors. LIMITATIONS: A single-center study somewhat limits the generalization to community-based settings. Only patients tested for COVID-19 were analyzed. CONCLUSION: IS therapies for IMIDs are not associated with a significantly greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 or severe sequelae when controlling for other factors, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; inhibitors may decrease the odds of severe infection.","Veenstra, Jesse; Buechler, Connor R; Robinson, Gabrielle; Chapman, Stephanie; Adelman, Madeline; Tisack, Aaron; Dimitrion, Peter; Todter, Erika; Kohen, Laurie; Lim, Henry W",J Am Acad Dermatol,104,1

We also compared levels of caregiver self-efficacy and burden pre-COVID-19 and early in the pandemic. We administered surveys via internet to a convenience sample of caregivers in January 2020 (pre-pandemic, n = 221) and in April-June 2020 (English, n = 177 and Spanish samples, n = 144) to assess caregiver self-efficacy, depression, pain, and stress. We used the early pandemic surveys to explore the validity of the CCLS-9. The pre-COVID-19 survey and the April English surveys were compared to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected caregivers. The CCLS-9 had strong construct and divergent validity in both languages. Compared to pre-COVID-19, caregiver stress (p = .002) and pain (p = .009) were significantly greater early in COVID-19, providing evidence of its validity.

The copper supply lines are fitted with lead-soldered connections and brass fixtures and faucets. The causes of excess lead are studied through field sampling on occupied households, experiments on prototype supply chains, and 3D numerical modeling. The tap water lead concentration of 129 households in the PRH estates was sampled using a specially designed protocol, revealing the highly variable lead concentration variations induced by sources along the supply chain. Lead concentration variation at consumer tap and its relation with various lead sources are studied in a full-scale test rig. A 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is successfully developed to interpret the time variation of lead concentrations at the consumer tap. Model predictions of the complex variation of dissolved lead are in good agreement with data and confirm lead solder in copper pipe connections as a major cause of the ""lead water"" episode in Hong Kong. The CFD calculations demonstrate the importance of turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion in the modeling of lead; the use of a ""plug flow"" approximation can result in significant overestimation of lead concentration. The findings provide a basis for lead risk assessment of different water sampling strategies in densely populated high-rise buildings in Megacities.","Chan, Shu Ning; Chang, Lu; Choi, King Wah; Lee, Joseph H W; Fawell, John K; Kwok, Kelvin Y T",Environ Sci Technol,104,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational study, conducted between 12 April and 10 June 2020 at Tata Memorial centre, Mumbai, in cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The objectives were to evaluate cumulative 30-day all-cause mortality, COVID-19 attributable mortality, factors predicting mortality, and time to viral negativity after initial diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 24 660 footfalls and 7043 patients evaluated, 230 patients on active systemic therapy with a median age of 42 (1-75) years were included. COVID-19 infection severity, as per WHO criteria, was mild, moderate, and severe in 195 (85%), 11 (5%), and 24 (11%) patients, respectively. Twenty-three patients (10%) expired during follow-up, with COVID-19 attributable mortality seen in 15 patients (6.5%). There were no mortalities in the pediatric cohort of 31 (14%) patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked to record the number of preoperative CT examinations performed in patients being considered for both emergency and elective surgical intervention over a 5-day period in May 2020. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of departments replied with data provided on >820 patients. Nineteen percent of additional preoperative CT was in patients undergoing elective intervention and 81% in patients presenting with surgical abdominal pain. There was a high rate of false positives in patients who tested negative for COVID-19, producing a sensitivity for thoracic CT of 68.4%. CONCLUSION: This UK-wide audit demonstrates that a large number of additional thoracic imaging examinations over a 5-day period were performed with a low sensitivity for the identification of COVID-19 in this preoperative group of patients.

However, they are associated with risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, prior to their clinical use, it is important to assess the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. In case of older anticoagulant drugs like heparin and warfarin, dose adjustment is required owing to narrow therapeutic ranges. The established monitoring methods for heparin and warfarin are activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)/anti-Xa assay and prothrombin time - international normalized ratio (PT-INR), respectively. Since 2008, new generation anticoagulant drugs, called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have been widely prescribed to prevent and treat several thromboembolic diseases. Although the use of DOACs without routine monitoring and frequent dose adjustment has been shown to be safe and effective, there may be clinical circumstances in specific patients when measurement of the anticoagulant effects of DOACs is required. Recently, anticoagulation therapy has received attention when treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of anticoagulant drugs-heparin, warfarin, and DOACs and describe the methods used for the measurement of their effects.

The aerated tank (AerT) was characterized by the highest respiratory fraction (RF) concentrations (861-1525 CFU/m3) and proportions (50.76%-65.96%) of aerosol particles. Fourteen core potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s were identified in aerosols. Mycobacterium was the genus that aerosolized most easily in fine grid, pre-anoxic tank, and AerT. High wastewater treatment efficiency may increase the emission of RF and core potential pathogens. The median size of activated sludge, richness of core potential pathogens in wastewater, and total suspended particulates were the most influential factors directly related to the RF proportions, core community of potential pathogens, and composition of toxic metal(loid)s in WWTP aerosols, respectively. Relative humidity, temperature, input and removal of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and mixed liquor suspended solids could also directly or indirectly affect the aerosol characteristics.

However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18-25, 2020 with 1630 Chinese participants (aged 18-68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.","Zhao, Xiaolin; Lan, Mengxue; Li, Huixiang; Yang, Juan",Sleep medicine,104,16

The mini review provides some insights into the role of supine and prone body positions and summarises the latest understanding of the responsible mechanisms. The scope for discussion is outside the neonatal period and entirely based on experimental and clinical experiences related to adults. The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.","Lindahl, Sten G E",Acta Paediatr,104,25

SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in late December 2019 and, since then, has become a global pandemic. Timely and accurate COVID-19 laboratory testing is an essential step in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Unfortunately, RT-PCR has several practical limitations. Consequently, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently required, both for alleviating the pressure on laboratories and healthcare facilities and for expanding testing capacity to enable large-scale screening and ensure a timely therapeutic intervention. To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.","Riccò, Matteo; Ferraro, Pietro; Gualerzi, Giovanni; Ranzieri, Silvia; Henry, Brandon Michael; Said, Younes Ben; Pyatigorskaya, Natalia Valeryevna; Nevolina, Elena; Wu, Jianhong; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Signorelli, Carlo",,104,10

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has led to a pandemic and has changed the lives many throughout the world. The mode of transmission of this virus is from person to person through the transfer of respiratory droplets. Therefore, non-essential healthcare services involving direct patient interactions, including deprescribing, has been on hiatus to reduce spread. Barriers to deprescribing before the pandemic include patient and system related factors, such as resistance to change, patient's knowledge deficit about deprescribing, lack of alternatives for treatment of disease, uncoordinated delivery of health services, prescriber's attitudes and/or experience, limited availability of guidelines for deprescribing, and lack of evidence on preventative therapy. Some of these barriers can be mitigated by using the following interventions:patient education, prioritization of non-pharmacological therapy, incorporation of electronic health record (EHR), continuous prescriber education, and development of research studies on deprescribing. Currently, deprescribing cannot be delivered through in person interactions, so virtual care is a reasonable alternative format. The full incorporation of EHR throughout Canada can add to the success of this strategy. However, there are several challenges of conducting deprescribing virtually in the elderly population. These challenges include, but are not limited, to their inability to use technology, lack of literacy, lack of assistance from others, greater propensity for withdrawal effects, and increased risk of severe consequences, if hospitalized. Virtual care is the future of healthcare and in order to retain the benefits of deprescribing, additional initiatives should be in place to address the challenges that elderly patients may experience in accessing deprescribing virtually. These initiatives should involve teaching elderly patients how to use technology to access health services and with technical support in place to address any concerns.","Elbeddini, Ali; Prabaharan, Thulasika; Almasalkhi, Sarah; Tran, Cindy; Zhou, Yueyang",Res. soc. adm. pharm,104,24

Method We conducted a rapid systematized review to identify telehealth adaptations during COVID-19, according to peer-reviewed articles published from January to August 2020. Of the 40 articles identified, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Full-text reviews were completed by three raters, followed by qualitative synthesis of the results and description of practical recommendations for the use of telehealth for dysphagia. Results Seven articles were guidelines articles, three were editorials, and one was a narrative review. One article focused on telehealth and dysphagia during COVID-19. The remaining 10 mentioned telehealth in varying degrees while focusing on dysphagia management during the pandemic. No articles discussed pediatrics in depth. The most common procedure for which telehealth was recommended was the clinical swallowing assessment (8/11), followed by therapy (7/11). Six articles characterized telehealth as a second-tier service delivery option. Only one article included brief guidance on telehealth-specific factors, such as legal safeguards, safety, privacy, infrastructure, and facilitators. Conclusions Literature published during the pandemic on telehealth for dysphagia is extremely limited and guarded in endorsing telehealth as an equivalent service delivery model. We have presented prepandemic and emerging current evidence for the safety and reliability of dysphagia telemanagement, in combination with practical guidelines to facilitate the safe adoption of telehealth during and after the pandemic.","Malandraki, Georgia A; Arkenberg, Rachel Hahn; Mitchell, Samantha S; Malandraki, Jaime Bauer",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,104,3

As we wait for the approved vaccines to become widely distributed, the best approach to fighting the spread of this disease is mostly preventative depending largely on individuals' compliance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in Lebanon. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed to describe the outcome measures of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 on a convenience sample from the Lebanese population in relation to socio-demographic characteristics and level of concern towards COVID-19. One thousand eight hundred sixty-one participants filled in an online survey (response rate: 18.5%) distributed by social media to social networks of the research team members. RESULTS: Participants were mainly young (49.4% between 18 and 24 years) and males (73.7%). Participants showed an overall appropriate knowledge of COVID-19 (67.1%) and positive attitude (around 90% were optimistic about treatment and vaccination) and had good preventive practices towards COVID-19 (around 75% washed hands and avoided public places). Knowledge and practices correlated positively with marriage, age, education, working in a healthcare field and with the level of concern about getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study found good overall levels of KAP among the studied Lebanese population. This can help in controlling the spread of COVID-19 if individuals were forced to adhere to social distancing and appropriate preventative practices.","Sakr, Samer; Ghaddar, Ali; Sheet, Imtithal; Eid, Ali H; Hamam, Bassam",BMC Public Health,104,26

We conducted a retrospective study to analyze S-2 positive (+) patients on CDT to describe the S-2 duration and its impact on CDT. METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients with cancer were tested with nasopharyngeal (NP) S-2 PCR assay at Columbia University Medical Irving Center (CUIMC), a Minority-NCI Community Oncology site, of which 77 (26%) tested positive. We retrospectively analyzed 26 S-2 (+) patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving CDT who consented to the study. NP PCR was repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until 2 successive negative (-) PCRs were obtained prior to restarting CDT. Time to 2 (-) PCR and serology results were recorded. Cycling thresholds (Ct) were obtained for S-2 specific targets and represented an indirect measure of viral load. RESULTS: Demographics of Nâ¯=â¯26 patients are: Hispanic (Nâ¯=â¯17, 65%), Black (Nâ¯=â¯1, 4%), White (Nâ¯=â¯7, 27%), and undeclared (Nâ¯=â¯1, 4%). Among the tumor histologies represented, gastrointestinal (Nâ¯=â¯9, 35%), breast (Nâ¯=â¯5, 19%), and sarcoma (Nâ¯=â¯3, 12%) were most common. Median time to 2 (-) PCR was 32 days. Twenty patients required greater than 14 days to achieve 2 sequential (-) swabs. CDT was delayed in 21 patients (81%) of whom three experienced disease progression, likely attributed to an interruption in CDT, which was delayed by a mean of 53 days. Interestingly, nine (41%) patients had Ct values greater than 34 for the pan SARS target and seven (32%) patients had Ct values greater than 34 for the SARS-COV-2 target. Sixteen of 16 patients on CDT, tested positive for IgG antibodies at the time of consent, despite protracted viral detectability by NP PCR. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving CDT appear to have prolonged detectable S-2 by PCR, which can lead to interruption of CDT and POD in patients. We believe and recommend that patients with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 and aggressive malignancies are at greatest risk for cancer related morbidity and mortality due to CDT cessation and should be considered for continued CDT without interruption. Ct values and serology testing are tools that can help identify those patients on CDT who may be at greatest risk of worsening COVID-19 or of spreading S-2.","Wong, Winston; Brieva, Claire; May, Michael; Gambina, Karen; Whittier, Susan; Hod, Eldad A; Pellicciotta, Ilenia; Pan, Samuel; Hu, Jianhua; Abbott, Maura; Schwartz, Gary K; Manji, Gulam A",Semin. oncol,104,1

SETTING: Laboratory DESIGN:: In this laboratory-based simulation, phacoemulsification cataract surgery was performed on porcine eyes. At a fixed distance, a DustTrak DRX Aerosol Monitor Model 8534 (DustTrak) was positioned to quantify particle generation during surgery. Experiments were run in triplicate for two wound sizes, 2.4 and 2.75mm. Positive controls were established by measuring particle generation from an aerosolizing spray-bottle. Negative controls were established while the phacoemulsification machine was not running. METHODS: The DustTrak was used to measure particulate matter (PM) mass fractions for each of three particle sizes, PM1, PM2.5, and PM4 (in microns), every 2 seconds during surgery and for one minute after. The main outcome measure was an increase in the mass fraction of aerosolized particles of various sizes. RESULTS: There was no significant aerosolization of particles during cataract surgery for both the 2.4 and 2.75mm wound sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Phacoemulsification cataract surgery was not found to be an AGMP. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, ophthalmologists can continue to use droplet precautions while performing this surgery.","Noureddin, Gelareh S; Iovieno, Alfonso; Eslami, Maryam; Weaver, Travers; Meadows, Howard; Yeung, Sonia N",J. cataract. refract. surg,104,1

In this regard, the chemokine receptor-ligand nexus has been reported as potentially important in severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and its treatment. Valuable genomic insights into the chemokine receptor-ligand nexus have been gained from HIV infection and disease progression studies.

Although rather low, such rates could have importance due to the uncommon fact that a large majority of the world population will be subjected to vaccination with the aforementioned vaccines in the following months and vaccination will most likely be necessary every season as for influenza vaccines. Health regulators have advised that any subject with a previous history of allergy to drugs or any component of the vaccines should not be vaccinated, however, certain misunderstanding exists since allergy to specific excipients in drugs and vaccines are in occasions misdiagnosed due to an absence of suspicion to specific excipients as allergenic triggers or due to inaccurate labeling or nomenclature.

However, their uptake has been low and slow due to privacy concerns, the lack of trust and motivational affordances, and their minimalist design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present a protocol for a systematic review of the main factors, including facilitators and barriers, that influence the adoption of contact tracing apps. METHODS: We searched seven databases, namely, Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed (MEDLINE), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for relevant publications between October 30, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Three authors were involved in removing duplicates, screening, and selection of relevant articles according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether, we retrieved 777 articles from the seven databases. As of May 14, 2021, we have completed the screening process and arrived at 13 eligible articles to be included in the systematic review. We hope to elicit, summarize, and report the main findings in the systematic review article by the end of August 2021. We expect to uncover facilitators and barriers related to app utility, data security, ease of use, and persuasive design that are deemed important to adoption of contact tracing apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the systematic review will help researchers to uncover the gaps in the adoption of contact tracing apps, and decision makers and designers to focus on the principal adoption factors necessary to create better and more effective contact tracing apps.

By analyzing patients with severe manifestations, it became apparent that 20 to 35% of patients who died had preexisting cardiovascular disease. This finding warrants the important need to discuss the influence of SARS-CoV2 infection on the cardiovascular system and hemodynamics in the context of clinical management, particularly during mechanical ventilation. The SARS-CoV2 enters human cells through the spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is important to cardiovascular modulation and endothelial signaling. As ACE2 is highly expressed in lung tissue, patients have been progressing to acute respiratory injury at an alarming frequency during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Moreover, COVID-19 leads to high D-dimer levels and prothrombin time, which indicates a substantial coagulation disorder. It seems that an overwhelming inflammatory and thrombogenic condition is responsible for a mismatching of ventilation and perfusion, with a somewhat near-normal static lung compliance, which describes two types of pulmonary conditions. As such, positive pressure during invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) must be applied with caution. The authors of this review appeal to the necessity of paying closer attention to assess microhemodynamic repercussion, by monitoring central venous oxygen saturation during strategies of IMV. It is well known that a severe respiratory infection and a scattered inflammatory process can cause non-ischemic myocardial injury, including progression to myocarditis. Early strategies that guide clinical decisions can be lifesaving and prevent extended myocardial damage. Moreover, cardiopulmonary failure refractory to standard treatment may necessitate the use of extreme therapeutic strategies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Rocco, Isadora S; Gomes, Walter J; Viceconte, Marcela; Bolzan, Douglas W; Moreira, Rita Simone L; Arena, Ross; Guizilini, Solange",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,104,2

The children face health risks, especially mental, behavioral, social and physical risks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential healthcare issues relating to the wellbeing of disabled children, continuity of rehabilitation and medical care, and parental concerns during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: The Enfant Confinement Handicap besOins (ECHO [child lockdown disability needs]) national survey was developed by a multidisciplinary group and disseminated in France from April 6, 2020 via email and social networks. This online survey was addressed to the parents of children with physical disabilities aged 0 to 18 years. It explored the experiences of children and their families during the lockdown. Information regarding children's wellbeing, rehabilitation and family organization was collected. The first 1000 eligible surveys were analyzed. RESULTS: The children (mean [SD] age 9.5 [4.8] years) mostly had cerebral palsy (42%) or neuromuscular diseases (11%). The lockdown had negative effects on morale (44% of children), behaviour (55% of children) and social interactions (55% no contact with other children). Overall, 44% of children stopped physical activities; 76% were educated at home; 22% maintained medical follow-up, and 48% and 27% continued physiotherapy and occupational therapy respectively. For more than 60% of children, parents performed the therapy.

This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Emil; Clayton, Ashley; Huh-Yoo, Jina",JMIR Ment Health,104,22

However, the magnitude of the disparity is unclear because race/ethnicity information is often missing in surveillance data. METHODS: We quantified the burden of SARS-CoV-2 notification, hospitalization, and case fatality rates in an urban county by racial/ethnic group using combined race/ethnicity imputation and quantitative bias analysis for misclassification. RESULTS: The ratio of the absolute racial/ethnic disparity in notification rates after bias adjustment, compared with the complete case analysis, increased 1.3-fold for persons classified Black and 1.6-fold for those classified Hispanic, in reference to classified White persons. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that complete case analyses may underestimate absolute disparities in notification rates. Complete reporting of race/ethnicity information is necessary for health equity. When data are missing, quantitative bias analysis methods may improve estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 burden.","Labgold, Katie; Hamid, Sarah; Shah, Sarita; Gandhi, Neel R; Chamberlain, Allison; Khan, Fazle; Khan, Shamimul; Smith, Sasha; Williams, Steve; Lash, Timothy L; Collin, Lindsay J",Epidemiology,104,1

We aimed at investigating whether and how the COVID-19 outbreak limited access to ED and affected urgent surgical activities during and immediately after the 2-month pandemic-related national lockdown. METHODS: Data regarding patients who accessed to the surgical ED were retrospectively collected. Analysed time-periods included: 'Pre-COVID-19 Era', 'COVID-19 Era' considered as the period of full national lockdown and 'Post-COVID-19 Era' after easing of lockdown measures. Consecutive emergency surgical procedures and ED admissions before, during and after COVID-19-lockdown were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in overall ED admissions and in all-specialty surgical consultations (P<0.01) throughout the outbreak. Once national lockdown was eased, we recorded a subsequent rebound 5-fold rise of emergency surgical procedures compared to COVID-19 group (P=0.011). Time-to-surgery was significantly greater in 'COVID-19 era' and 'post-COVID-19 era' compared to 'pre-COVID-19' group (22.56±4.78, 75.99±15.89 and 16.73 ±1.76 hours, respectively) (P<0.01). A raised incidence of postoperative complications emerged in the 'COVID-19 era' group (37.5%) compared to pre and post-COVID groups (9.1% and 12.5%, respectively; P<0.001). Mortality rate in the 'COVID-19 era' was 31.3% and 7.5% in 'post-COVID-19' group (<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the major reduction of emergency surgical procedures and overall ED admissions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The raised rate of postoperative complications and mortality might be likely due to the superior severity of surgical conditions observed in the 'COVID-19 era' subjects together with a probable deferred pursuit of medical attention.","Casella, Giovanni; Castagneto-Gissey, Lidia; Lattina, Ilario; Ferrari, Paolo; Iodice, Alessandra; Tesori, Chiara; Catani, Marco; Assenza, Marco; Mingoli, Andrea; LA Torre, Filippo",,104,29

To achieve this and considering that it is a current and multifactorial problem, its four pillars were analyzed: food availability, access, stability and use. As a result, it is observed that the misuse of food is the most likely cause of FI in the South American community, however, the lack of availability and inaccessibility of food causes great concern in certain states of the subregion. The most probable origin is the inadequate promotion of good eating habits, in addition to misguided policies that hinder the correct production and/or motivation of the peasants to continue carrying out their activities in agriculture. This problem needs to be addressed as soon as possible as, although it originates in not having the money and/or the necessary nutritional habits, it leads to serious health problems for the inhabitants. The consensus reached is that it is important to enhance policies to eradicate FI in South America, starting with support for food production, and following that up with nutritional interventions that improve the dietary habits of the inhabitants.","Aulestia-Guerrero, Edgar Manuel; Capa-Mora, Edwin Daniel",Cien Saude Colet,104,1

When face-to-face follow-up is unavailable or undesirable, telepsychiatry becomes a promising alternative. This study aimed to investigate hospital- and county-level characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. METHODS: Cross-sectional national data of 3475 acute care hospitals were derived from the 2017 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Generalized linear regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with telepsychiatry adoption. RESULTS: About one-sixth (548 [15.8%]) of hospitals reported having telepsychiatry with a wide variation across states. Rural noncore hospitals were less likely to adopt telepsychiatry (8.3%) than hospitals in rural micropolitan (13.6%) and urban counties (19.4%). Hospitals with both outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care services (marginal difference [95% CI]: 16.0% [12.1% to 19.9%]) and hospitals only with outpatient psychiatric services (6.5% [3.7% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than hospitals with neither psychiatric services. Federal hospitals (48.9% [32.5 to 65.3%]), system-affiliated hospitals (3.9% [1.2% to 6.6%]), hospitals with larger bed size (Quartile IV vs. I: 6.2% [0.7% to 11.6%]), and hospitals with greater ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total inpatient days (Quartile IV vs. I: 4.9% [0.3% to 9.4%]) were more likely to have telepsychiatry than their counterparts. Private non-profit hospitals (- 6.9% [- 11.7% to - 2.0%]) and hospitals in counties designated as whole mental health professional shortage areas (- 6.6% [- 12.7% to - 0.5%]) were less likely to have telepsychiatry. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, telepsychiatry adoption in US hospitals was low with substantial variations by urban and rural status and by state in 2017. This raises concerns about access to psychiatric services and continuity of care for patients discharged from hospitals.","Li, Zhong; Harrison, Sayward E; Li, Xiaoming; Hung, Peiyin",BMC Psychiatry,104,26

To summarize FDA updates applicable to neuro-oncology practitioners, we sought to review oncology product approvals and Guidances that were pertinent to the field in the past year. METHODS: Oncology product approvals between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were reviewed for clinical trial outcomes involving tumors of the nervous system. FDA Guidances relevant to neuro-oncology were also reviewed. RESULTS: Five oncology product approvals described outcomes for nervous system tumors in the year 2020. These included the first regulatory approval for neurofibromatosis type 1: selumetinib for children with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. Additionally, there were 4 regulatory approvals for non-central nervous system (CNS) cancers that described clinical outcomes for patients with brain metastases. These included the approval of tucatinib for metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer including patients with brain metastases, brigatinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and pralsetinib and selpercatinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Finally, two FDA Guidances for Industry, ""Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria: Brain Metastases"" and ""Evaluating Cancer Drugs in Patients with Central Nervous System Metastases"" were published to facilitate drug development for and inclusion of patients with CNS metastases in clinical trials.

It took place within a larger 2-year research project involving researchers in Senegal, Mali and Canada which examines the uses of artificial intelligence technologies in the fight against COVID-19. The study involved 1000 respondents in Senegal and 555 in Mali. The researchers found that overall, 55% of respondents in Senegal and 52% of respondents in Mali did not plan to be vaccinated. Hesitancy was much higher in youth aged 15-35 in both cases, with 70% of youth in Senegal and 57% of youth in Mali not planning to be vaccinated, compared to only 42% of elderly in Senegal and 37% of elderly in Mali. The researchers did not find disparities between male and female respondents in Senegal but found some in Mali. They also found that those who had a member of the family with chronic disease (diabetes or hypertension) were slightly more likely to want to be vaccinated. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy fell in several categories, including fear of vaccine side-effects, disbelief in vaccine efficacy or usefulness, and general distrust in the public health system.","Fournier-Tombs, Eleonore; Diouf, Massamba; Maiga, Abdine; Faye, Sylvain; Ndoye, Tidiane; Haidara, Lalla; Batchily, Moussa; Castets-Renard, Celine",,104,1

This has also compromised the capacity for application of specialized Parkinson's disease (PD) therapies to an unknown extent. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of PD receiving multimodal complex treatment (PD-MCT), initial setup of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) or continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI) in Germany. We compared case numbers and clinical characteristics of the pandemic (March 16th - May 15th, 2020) and post-lockdown (July 16th - September 15th, 2020) period with the pre-pandemic (January 16th - March 15th, 2020) and historical control period (March 16th - May 15th, 2019). RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for PD-MCT(-62.8%) and for the application of drug pump-based therapies (-69.4%) during the first peak phase of the pandemic as compared to the pre-pandemic period while specialized PD treatment procedures increased again in the post-lockdown phase. Advanced disease was a marker for PD-MCT patients during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Besides the marked decline in specialized PD treatments during the first peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found recuperative effects for these procedures in the post-lockdown period without reaching pre-pandemic levels. Strengthening treatment capacities for PD patients, even in the event of a persistent pandemic, is urgently needed in order to maintain the quality of care.","Richter, Daniel; Scherbaum, Raphael; Bartig, Dirk; Gold, Ralf; Krogias, Christos; Tönges, Lars",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,104,20

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range 20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of 57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the epidemic is not curtailed and localized.

Due to clinical worsening, she required urgent cesarean section with general anaesthesia and intubation for decubitus intolerance. After extubation, she presented altered mental state that required a differential diagnosis of encephalitis/meningitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2. CT and CT-angiography were normal, spinal fluid tests were non-specific, and magnetic resonance imaging reported posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (due to radiological features suggestive of white matter vasogenic edema affecting the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, along with altered mental state) secondary to gestational hypertension. Eleven days after the cesarean section the patient began to develop hypertension that required treatment.

Obesity is a common metabolic disease, affecting 42.4% of U.S. adults (5), and is a risk factor for other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices considers obesity to be a high-risk medical condition for COVID-19 vaccine prioritization (6). Using data from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR),§ CDC assessed the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] or stepdown unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death). Among 148,494 adults who received a COVID-19 diagnosis during an emergency department (ED) or inpatient visit at 238 U.S. hospitals during March-December 2020, 28.3% had overweight and 50.8% had obesity. Overweight and obesity were risk factors for invasive mechanical ventilation, and obesity was a risk factor for hospitalization and death, particularly among adults aged <65 years. Risks for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were lowest among patients with BMIs of 24.2 kg/m2, 25.9 kg/m2, and 23.7 kg/m2, respectively, and then increased sharply with higher BMIs. Risk for invasive mechanical ventilation increased over the full range of BMIs, from 15 kg/m2 to 60 kg/m2. As clinicians develop care plans for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs, especially for those with severe obesity. These findings highlight the clinical and public health implications of higher BMIs, including the need for intensive COVID-19 illness management as obesity severity increases, promotion of COVID-19 prevention strategies including continued vaccine prioritization (6) and masking, and policies to ensure community access to nutrition and physical activities that promote and support a healthy BMI.","Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Goodman, Alyson B; Belay, Brook; Freedman, David S; Sucosky, Marissa S; Lange, Samantha J; Gundlapalli, Adi V; Boehmer, Tegan K; Blanck, Heidi M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,104,20

The main question rose is related to the deployment strategy of the two doses with respect to the imposed NPIs and population age. In this study, an extended (SEIR) agent-based model on small-world networks was employed to identify the optimal policies against Covid 19 pandemic, including social distancing measures and mass vaccination. To achieve this, a new methodology is proposed to solve the inverse problem of calibrating an agent's infection rate with respect to vaccination efficacy. The results show that deploying the first vaccine dose across the whole population is sufficient to control the epidemic, with respect to deaths, even for low number of social contacts. Moreover, for the same range of social contacts, we found that there is an optimum ratio of vaccinating ages>65 over the younger ones of 4/5.","Spiliotis, Konstantinos; Koutsoumaris, Constantinos Chr.; Reppas, Andreas; Starke, Jens; Hatzikirou, Haralampos",,104,16

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic performance of hypocalcemia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase with keywords ""SARS-CoV-2â³ ORâ³COVID-19â³ OR â³2019-nCoV"" AND ""hypocalcemia"" up until 10 December 2020. The key exposure was hypocalcemia, defined as serum calcium below study-defined cut-off points. The main outcome was poor outcome, which was a composite of mortality and severity. The effect estimate of the main outcome was reported as odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We also generate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (PLR & NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under curve (AUC). RESULTS: There are 2032 patients from 7 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The incidence of poor outcome in this study was 26%. Serum calcium was lower in patients with poor outcome (mean difference -0.173 mmol/L [-0.259, -0.087], p < 0.001; I2: 31.3%). Hypocalcemia was associated with poor outcome (OR 3.19 [2.02, 5.06], p < 0.001; I2: 32.86%); with sensitivity of 0.74 [0.53, 0.88], specificity of 0.54 [0.29, 0.77], PLR of 1.6 [1.1, 2.3], NLR of 0.49 [0.35, 0.66], DOR of 3 [2, 5], and AUC of 0.70 [0.66, 0.74]. In this pooled analysis, the post-test probability was 36% in patients with hypocalcemia and 15% in patients without hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION: Hypocalcemia was associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. PROSPERO ID: CRD42020225506.","Martha, Januar Wibawa; Wibowo, Arief; Pranata, Raymond",Diabetes Metab Syndr,104,24

Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study. Method: Ultrasonographic measurements in 300 singleton pregnant women included biparietal diameter (cm), head circumference (cm), abdominal circumference (cm), femur length (cm) and transverse cerebellar diameter (cm). Reference chart with mean TCD for corresponding gestational age (GA) in weeks was developed. Results: Statistically significant relationship found between TCD and gestational age (R2=0.92, p=0.0006). Regression formulae based on TCD with other parameter can be used to predict gestational age of foetus. When TCD is compared with findings in other studies in different ethnic population, it is found that there is significant difference exists. Conclusion: In normally developing fetuses the TCD has linear correlation with advancing gestational age. A separate reference chart is required for every different population because ethnicity, nutrition and environmental factors can have impact on normal TCD values. This will help to avoid misinterpretation of data to determine gestational age.","Mishra, Sanjay; Ghatak, Surajit; Singh, Pratibha; Agrawal, Dushyant; Garg, Pawan",Afr Health Sci,104,22

Variations in the metabolic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the striking differences in the susceptibility to infection and the risk of severe disease. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine novel metabolic pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical severity using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CE-TOF-MS) in plasma samples. We included 27 patients with confirmed COVID-19 early after symptom onset who were prospectively followed and 29 healthcare workers heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but with low susceptibility to infection ( nonsusceptible). We found that the metabolite profile was predictive of the study group. We identified a total of 55 metabolites as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 clinical severity. We report the discovery of new plasma biomarkers for COVID-19 that provide mechanistic explanations for the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including mitochondrial and liver dysfunction as a consequence of hypoxemia (citrulline, citrate, and BAIBA), energy production and amino acid catabolism (L-glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid and L-histidine), endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (citrulline, L-ADMA, 2-AB, and Neu5Ac), and we found interconnections between these pathways. In summary, in this first report of the metabolomic profile of individuals with severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility by CE-MS, we define several metabolic pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical progression that could be developed as biomarkers of COVID-19.","Albóniga, Oihane E.; Jiménez, Daniel; Sánchez-Conde, Matilde; Vizcarra, Pilar; Ron, Raquel; Herrera, Sabina; Martínez-Sanz, Javier; Moreno, Elena; Moreno, Santiago; Barbas, Coral; Serrano-Villar, Sergio",,104,26

MethodsAll persons with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result from a combined nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab (first samples from unique persons only) that was collected between March 17, 2020, and March 31, 2021, in Public Health testing facilities in the region Kennemerland, province of North Holland, the Netherlands were included. Data on hospital (and ICU) admission were collected from the two large teaching hospitals in the region Kennemerland. ResultsIn total, 20,207 SARS-CoV-2 positive persons were included in this study, of whom 310 (1.5%) were hospitalized in a regional hospital within 30 days of their positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. When persons were categorized in three SARS-CoV-2 viral load groups, the high viral load group (Cp < 25) was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization as compared to the low viral load group (Cp > 30) (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 1.57 [1.11-2.26], p-value=0.012), adjusted for age and sex. The same association was seen for ICU admission (ORadjusted [95%CI]: 7.06 [2.15-43.57], p-value=0.007). For a subset of 243 of the 310 hospitalized patients, the association of initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value with in-hospital mortality was analyzed. The initial SARS-CoV-2 Cp-value of the 17 patients who deceased in the hospital was significantly lower (indicating a higher viral load) compared to the 226 survivors: median Cp-value [IQR]: 22.7 [3.4] vs. 25.0 [5.2], OR[95%CI]: 0.81 [0.68-0.94], p-value = 0.010. ConclusionsOur data show that higher initial SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. We believe that our findings emphasize the added value of reporting SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on Cp-values to identify persons who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes such as hospital or ICU admission and who therefore may benefit from more intensive monitoring.","Souverein, Dennis; Stralen, Karlijn van; Lelyveld, Steven van; Gemeren, Claudia van; Haverkort, Milly; Snijders, Dominic; Soetekouw, Robin; Kapteijns, Erik; Jong, Evelien de; Hermanides, Gonneke; Aronson, Sem; Wagemakers, Alex; Euser, Sjoerd",,104,16

Occupational health and safety concepts should take the individual risk profile of the employees into account. This is necessary to maintain the operational capability of the emergency medical services and ensure personal health protection. Objectives: How do emergency physicians and rescue personnel perceive their personal security during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic? How high is the percentage of rescue staff at particular risk for serious COVID-19 cases and what personal protection measures are being provided to the staff? Materials and methods: An online-based survey with 20 questions on demography, risk profile and occupational health and safety was sent to all medical directors of emergency medical services. In addition, the survey was shared via Facebook ®and Twitter Inc. and included emergency medical keywords. Single and multiple-choice questions, evaluations using school grades from 1-6 (very good - unsatisfactory) and free text comments were used for the survey. Results: A total of 1055 employees from the rescue and emergency medical services participated in the survey (21.0% emergency medical personnel and 79.0% rescue service personnel). The personal perception of security was rated 1-2 in 60.3% of cases. There was no significant difference between the occupational groups (emergency doctors MRang=449.98; paramedics MRang=491.87), U=68125.0; Z=1.93; p=0.054; r=-0.06). Potential predisposing factors for a severe COVID-19 course were reported by 53.5% of the participants. Personal protective equipment was provided daily to most workers, but there was a lack of face shields (48.0%) and FFP3 masks (51.5%). Contact with SARS-CoV-2 was suspected to have occurred in 41.3% of respondents not guarded by adequate protective devices. Conclusion: In the context of the SARSCoV-2 pandemic, the quantity and quality of protective material available to emergency personnel is not always sufficient. Overall, the personnel feels well protected. Multiple unprotected contacts with COVID-19 patients underline the need for basic personal protection during every rescue service mission.","Friedrichson, B.; Lotz, G.; Naujoks, F.; Zacharowski, K.; Piekarski, F.",Anasthesiol.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: PTC TPC-1 cells and human normal thyroid follicular epithelial cells Nthy-ori 3-1 were collected to identify the expression of RET in PTC. Seven groups were divided according to different transfection protocols, including blank group, negative control group, si-RET group, oe-RET group, AG-490 group, NSC 228155 group, and si-RET + NSC 228155 group. After transfection, qRT-PCR was used to identify whether the transfection was successful or not. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of RET, EGFR signaling pathway related genes, and EMT related genes. Cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis abilities were further detected by CCK8, cell scratch, transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. RESULTS: RET gene was highly expressed in PTC cells (p<0.05). Compared with blank group, oe-RET group and NSC 228155 group had activated EGFR signaling pathway manifesting in the increased expression of EGFR, p-Src, p-FAK, accelerated EMT showing in the increased expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but decreased E-cadherin expression, increased cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while decreased apoptosis (all p<0.05); si-RET group and AG-490 group had inhibited activation of EGFR signaling pathway, suppressed EMT, decreased cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while increased apoptosis (all p<0.05); while no evident difference was found in si-RET + NSC 228155 group (all p>0.05). Meanwhile, compared with si-RET group, si-RET + NSC 228155 group showed activated EGFR signaling pathway, accelerated EMT, increased abilities of cell migration, invasion and proliferation, while decreased apoptosis (all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RET gene is highly expressed in PTC acting as an oncogene. Silencing RET gene expression may inhibit the invasion and promote the apoptosis of PTC cells by inhibiting the activation of EGFR signaling pathway and mediating the process of EMT. It suggests that RET may offer the possibility of a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PTC on the basis of the explored mechanism.","Zhao, Y-L; Yuan, B-Q; Shen, G-S",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,104,3

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the impact of COVID-19 emergency on pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists during the first wave of the pandemic. Issues related to pharmacist's involvement in the pandemic management were: changes in activities, support received by authorities and pharmacists' own perceived role in the Health System. METHODS: A cross-sectional study based on a web survey was conducted between May and June 2020 collecting information from pharmacists, members of Italian Society of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics. 113 (11.4%) completed the questionnaire. The cohort was divided in 2 arms: pharmacists who worked in severely COVID-19 affected areas (High Spread Regions) and those employed in less affected areas (Low Spread Regions). RESULTS: The changes in pharmacy work settings reflected the increase of logistics area and non-sterile clinical galenic, and reduction of clinical tasks. The most demanding challenge was referred to shortages of medical devices and drugs, 61/113 pharmacists reported difficulty in obtaining products compliant to quality standards. National Institutions and Regional Governments provided a greater perceived support. More than 50% of participants felt that their role did not change if compared to other health professionals.

The study aimed to measure teachers' and students' satisfaction and adoption levels towards e-learning in KSAand India due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a nutshell, we intended to address three primary research questions: What were the factors affecting the satisfaction and adoption level of teachers & students towards e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic? Does choice moderate the associations between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, satisfaction, and behavioral intention to use? Does satisfaction mediate the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention to use? Methodology: Four hundred seventy-six faculty members and students from KSA and India were considered as the sample. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the same.Findings : The findings suggested that Perceived Usefulness (PU) had a significant impact on Satisfaction (SAT) and Behavioural Intention to Use (BIU). Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) did not have a substantial effect on Satisfaction (SAT), but had a significant impact on Behavioural Intention to Use (BIU). Further, Satisfaction (SAT) and Choice (CHO) too had a substantial effect on Behavioural Intention to Use (BIU). Satisfaction (SAT) mediated the relationship between Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) and Behavioural Intention to Use (BIU).

Clinical trials have reported improved outcomes resulting from an effective reduction or absence of viral load when patients were treated with chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In addition, the effects of these drugs were improved by simultaneous administration of azithromycin (AZM). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to the cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, allowing virus entry and replication in host cells. The viral main protease (Mpro) and host cathepsin L (CTSL) are among the proteolytic systems involved in SARS-CoV-2 S protein activation. Hence, molecular docking studies were performed to test the binding performance of these three drugs against four targets. The findings showed AZM affinity scores (&#916;G) with strong interactions with ACE2, CTSL, Mpro and RBD. CQ affinity scores showed three low-energy results (less negative) with ACE2, CTSL and RBD, and a firm bond score with Mpro. For HCQ, two results (ACE2 and Mpro) were firmly bound to the receptors, however CTSL and RBD showed low interaction energies. The differences in better interactions and affinity between HCQ and CQ with ACE2 and Mpro were probably due to structural differences between the drugs. On other hand, AZM not only showed more negative (better) values in affinity, but also in the number of interactions in all targets. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the antiviral properties of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Braz, Helyson Lucas Bezerra; Silveira, João Alison de Moraes; Marinho, Aline Diogo; de Moraes, Maria Elisabete Amaral; Moraes Filho, Manoel Odorico de; Monteiro, Helena Serra Azul; Jorge, Roberta Jeane Bezerra",Int J Antimicrob Agents,104,20

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey of regional child health offices in Sweden between 10 September and 9 October 2020. It explored the organisation of child health services during the early stages of the pandemic, focusing on routine child immunisation. RESULTS: All 21 Swedish regional child health offices responded. They stated that child immunisation had been prioritised, communication with families had been intensified and there was greater flexibility at all organisational levels of child health services. In addition, the vaccine supply was sustained and child health centres remained open. However, there were periodic staff shortages, increased numbers of health visits cancelled by parents and most parent-education groups were paused. CONCLUSION: The Swedish immunisation programme was resilient during the early COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to sustainable organisation co-ordinated by Sweden's network of regional child health offices.","Falkenstein Hagander, Kathy; Aronsson, Bernice; Danielsson, Madelene; Lepp, Tiia; Kulane, Asli; Schollin Ask, Lina",Acta paediatr. scand,104,16

METHODS: We reviewed clinical histories of 276 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and extracted data on patients who met the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 severe/fatal pneumonia and had an acute exacerbation starting with mild or common pneumonia. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included. Of these, 8% were smokers, 54% had been to Wuhan, and 46% had comorbidities. Before acute exacerbation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (232.9 ± 88.7) was present, and chest CT scans showed the number of involved lobes was 4 (2-5) and total CT score was 6 (2-8). Following acute exacerbation, patients were likely to have more clinical symptoms (p < 0.01) and abnormal laboratory changes (p < 0.01). The number of involved lobes and CT score after an exacerbation significantly increased to 5 (5-5) and 12 (9-14), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that, when the cutoff value of CT score was 5, the sensitivity and specificity for severe pneumonia were 90% and 70%, respectively. CT findings of ground glass opacity with consolidations (91.7%), bilateral distribution (100.0%), and multifocal lesion (100.0%) were features in found in patients after exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant changes in clinical, laboratory, and CT findings in patients from disease onset to exacerbation. An increase in the number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict poor clinical outcomes. Combining an assessment of CT changes with clinical and laboratory changes could help clinical teams evaluate the prognosis. KEY POINTS: â¢ The common chest CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia after exacerbation were ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, bilateral distribution, and multifocal lesions. â¢ An increase in number of involved lobes or an increased CT score from the baseline may predict a poor clinical outcome. â¢ Worsened symptoms and abnormal laboratory results are also associated with poor prognosis.","Liu, Jiayi; Chen, Taili; Yang, Haitao; Cai, Yeyu; Yu, Qizhi; Chen, Juan; Chen, Zhu; Shang, Quan-Liang; Ma, Cong; Chen, Xiangyu; Xiao, Enhua",Eur Radiol,104,11

Knowledge of possible symptoms and their distribution allows for the early identification of infected patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution pattern of COVID-19 symptoms as well as possible unreported symptoms, we created an app-based self-reporting tool. METHODS: The COVID-19 Symptom Tracker is an app-based daily self-reporting tool. Between April 8 and May 15, 2020, a total of 22,327 individuals installed this app on their mobile device. An initial questionnaire asked for demographic information (age, gender, postal code) and past medical history comprising relevant chronic diseases. The participants were reminded daily to report whether they were experiencing any symptoms and if they had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants who sought health care services were asked additional questions regarding diagnostics and treatment. Participation was open to all adults (&#8805;18 years). The study was completely anonymous. RESULTS: In total, 11,829 (52.98%) participants completed the symptom questionnaire at least once. Of these, 291 (2.46%) participants stated that they had undergone an RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test for SARS-CoV-2; 65 (0.55%) reported a positive test result and 226 (1.91%) a negative one. The mean number of reported symptoms among untested participants was 0.81 (SD 1.85). Participants with a positive test result had, on average, 5.63 symptoms (SD 2.82). The most significant risk factors were diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 8.95, 95% CI 3.30-22.37) and chronic heart disease (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.43-5.69). We identified chills, fever, loss of smell, nausea and vomiting, and shortness of breath as the top five strongest predictors for a COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio for loss of smell was 3.13 (95% CI 1.76-5.58). Nausea and vomiting (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.61-5.00) had been reported as an uncommon symptom previously; however, our data suggest a significant predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported symptom tracking helps to identify novel symptoms of COVID-19 and to estimate the predictive value of certain symptoms. This aids in the development of reliable screening tools. Clinical screening with a high pretest probability allows for the rapid identification of infections and the cost-effective use of testing resources. Based on our results, we suggest that loss of smell and taste be considered cardinal symptoms; we also stress that diabetes is a risk factor for a highly symptomatic course of COVID-19 infection.","Zens, Martin; Brammertz, Arne; Herpich, Juliane; Südkamp, Norbert; Hinterseer, Martin",J Med Internet Res,104,27

We investigated temporal transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with longitudinal faecal microbiome alterations in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: We performed RNA shotgun metagenomics sequencing on serial faecal viral extractions from 15 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Sequencing coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was quantified. We assessed faecal microbiome composition and microbiome functionality in association with signatures of faecal SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. RESULTS: Seven (46.7%) of 15 patients with COVID-19 had stool positivity for SARS-CoV-2 by viral RNA metagenomic sequencing. Even in the absence of GI manifestations, all seven patients showed strikingly higher coverage (p=0.0261) and density (p=0.0094) of the 3' vs 5' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome in their faecal viral metagenome profile. Faecal viral metagenome of three patients continued to display active viral infection signature (higher 3' vs 5' end coverage) up to 6 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples. Faecal samples with signature of high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of bacterial species Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei, Streptococcus infantis, Morganella morganii, and higher functional capacity for nucleotide de novo biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis and glycolysis, whereas faecal samples with signature of low-to-none SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_1_57FAA. CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides evidence for active and prolonged 'quiescent' GI infection even in the absence of GI manifestations and after recovery from respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiota of patients with active SARS-CoV-2 GI infection was characterised by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens, loss of salutary bacteria and increased functional capacity for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism.","Zuo, Tao; Liu, Qin; Zhang, Fen; Lui, Grace Chung-Yan; Tso, Eugene Yk; Yeoh, Yun Kit; Chen, Zigui; Boon, Siaw Shi; Chan, Francis Kl; Chan, Paul Ks; Ng, Siew C",Gut,104,1

We aimed to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and to compare the performance of different prognostic models for predicting mortality. PATIENTS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 2211 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through October 1, 2020 in 38 Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with and without cirrhosis. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We evaluated the prognostic performance of different scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis using ROC curves. RESULTS: Overall, 4.6% (CI 3.7-5.6) subjects had cirrhosis (n = 96). Baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class was assessed: CTP-A (23%), CTP-B (45%) and CTP-C (32%); median MELD-Na score was 19 (IQR 14-25). Mortality was 47% in patients with cirrhosis and 16% in patients without cirrhosis (P < .0001). Cirrhosis was independently associated with death [OR 3.1 (CI 1.9-4.8); P < .0001], adjusted by age, gender, and body mass index >30. The areas under the ROC curves for performance evaluation in predicting 28-days mortality for Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C), North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD), CTP score and MELD-Na were 0.85, 0.75, 0.69, 0.67; respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis. CLIF-C had better performance in predicting mortality than NACSELD, CTP and MELD-Na in patients with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The lack of effective treatment strategy and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 poses a threat to human health. An extremely high infection rate and multi-organ secondary infection within a short period of time makes this virus more deadly and challenging for therapeutic interventions. Despite high sequence similarity and utilization of common host-cell receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. Structure-based sequence comparison of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 illustrate three divergent loop regions in SARS-CoV-2, which is reminiscent of MERS-CoV sialoside binding pockets. Comparative binding analysis with host sialosides revealed conformational flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 divergent loop regions to accommodate diverse glycan-rich sialosides. These key differences with SARS-CoV and similarity with MERS-CoV suggest an evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein reciprocal interaction with host surface sialosides to infect host cells with wide tissue tropism.","Awasthi, Mayanka; Gulati, Sahil; Sarkar, Debi P; Tiwari, Swasti; Kateriya, Suneel; Ranjan, Peeyush; Verma, Santosh Kumar",Viruses,104,16

Existing heatmap-based interpretability methods such as GradCAM only highlight the location of predictive features but do not explain how they contribute to the prediction. In this paper, we propose a new interpretability method that can be used to understand the predictions of any black-box model on images, by showing how the input image would be modified in order to produce different predictions. A StyleGAN is trained on medical images to provide a mapping between latent vectors and images. Our method identifies the optimal direction in the latent space to create a change in the model prediction. By shifting the latent representation of an input image along this direction, we can produce a series of new synthetic images with changed predictions. We validate our approach on histology and radiology images, and demonstrate its ability to provide meaningful explanations that are more informative than GradCAM heatmaps. Our method reveals the patterns learned by the model, which allows clinicians to build trust in the model's predictions, discover new biomarkers and eventually reveal potential biases.","Schutte, Kathryn; Moindrot, Olivier; H'erent, Paul; Schiratti, Jean-Baptiste; J'egou, Simon",,104,16

These included clinical management of active cases, rapid development of treatment strategies, vaccines computational modelling and statistical tools to name a few. This article presents a mathematical model for a time series prediction and analyzes the impact of the lockdown. METHODS: Several existing mathematical models were not able to account for asymptomatic patients, with limited testing capability at onset and no data on serosurveillance. In this study, a new model was used which was developed on lines of susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) to assess the impact of the lockdown and make predictions on its future course. Four parameters were used, namely β, γ, η and ε. β measures the likelihood of the susceptible person getting infected, and γ denotes recovery rate of patients. The ratio β/γ is denoted by R(0) (basic reproduction number). RESULTS: The disease spread was reduced due to initial lockdown. An increase in γ reflects healthcare and hospital services, medications and protocols put in place. In Delhi, the predictions from the model were corroborated with July and September serosurveys, which showed antibodies in 23.5 and 33 per cent population, respectively. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The SAIR model has helped understand the disease better. If the model is correct, we may have reached herd immunity with about 380 million people already infected. However, personal protective measures remain crucial. If there was no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at close to 14.7 million, resulted in more than 2.6 million deaths, and the peak would have arrived by June 2020.

Moreover, it also has relevance for the design and use of viruses as gene delivery vehicles with altered properties as well as for the identification of target viral epitopes of new vaccines.","Stehle, Thilo; Casasnovas, José M",Curr Opin Struct Biol,104,16

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, implementation of special projects for major infectious diseases, interdisciplinary and international cooperation, exotic disease surveillance, and health education. These strategies and measures can serve as models for the surveillance and response to continuing threats from emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in other countries.","Liu, Quan; Cao, Lili; Zhu, Xing-Quan",Int J Infect Dis,104,3

The aim of this study was to derive and validate risk prediction models for poor outcome and death in adult inpatients with COVID-19. Methods Model derivation using data from Wuhan, China used logistic regression with death and poor outcome (death or severe disease) as outcomes. Predictors were demographic, comorbidity, symptom and laboratory test variables. The best performing models were externally validated in data from London, UK. Findings 4.3% of the derivation cohort (n=775) died and 9.7% had a poor outcome, compared to 34.1% and 42.9% of the validation cohort (n=226). In derivation, prediction models based on age, sex, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein and creatinine had excellent discrimination (death c-index=0.91, poor outcome c-index=0.88), with good-to-excellent calibration. Using two cut-offs to define low, high and very-high risk groups, derivation patients were stratified in groups with observed death rates of 0.34%, 15.0% and 28.3% and poor outcome rates 0.63%, 8.9% and 58.5%. External validation discrimination was good (c-index death=0.74, poor outcome=0.72) as was calibration. However, observed rates of death were 16.5%, 42.9% and 58.4% and poor outcome 26.3%, 28.4% and 64.8% in predicted low, high and very-high risk groups. Interpretation Our prediction model using demography and routinely-available laboratory tests performed very well in internal validation in the lower-risk derivation population, but less well in the much higher-risk external validation population. Further external validation is needed. Collaboration to create larger derivation datasets, and to rapidly externally validate all proposed prediction models in a range of populations is needed, before routine implementation of any risk prediction tool in clinical care.","Zhang, H.; Shi, T.; Wu, X.; Zhang, X.; Wang, K.; Bean, D.; Dobson, R.; Teo, J.

These women were interviewed in three time points (1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after the event) to consider the possible evolution of their experience. The third phase was concurrent with the COVID-19 pandemic and particularly with Pope Francis's Easter declaration against abortion. All the interviews were conducted and analysed through qualitative research in psychology. Results showed that the abortion experience led to physical, relational, and psychological suffering, similar to perinatal grief. Participants were non-practising Catholics and religiosity did not help them to overcome their sorrow. Though religiosity is a possible resilience factor in other stressful conditions, in this case it is a factor that aggravated suffering. Finally, we discuss the difficulties experienced by Catholic women who choose to have an abortion and assert the necessity of psychological and spiritual interventions to support these women.","Testoni, Ines; Finco, Nicoletta; Keisari, Shoshi; Orkibi, Hod; Azoulay, Bracha",Front Psychiatry,104,20

Potential for COVID-19 spread through aerosols and droplets characterizes dentistry as having a high risk of experiencing viral transmission, with necessity for aerosol and droplet mitigation. METHODS: Simulations of restorative treatment were completed on a dental manikin with a high-speed handpiece and high-volume evacuation suction. Variable experimental conditions with use of an extraoral vacuum suction at different distances from the simulated patient's mouth and different vacuum settings were tested to evaluate extraoral suction ability for droplet reduction. RESULTS: Using the extraoral suction unit during dental procedure simulations reduced droplet spatter at the dentist’s eye level, as well as the level of the simulated patient's mouth. When the extraoral suction unit was used at level 10 and 4 inches from the simulated patient's mouth, less spatter was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Extraoral suction units are an effective method of reducing droplet spatter during operative dental procedures and can be useful in helping reduce risk of experiencing COVID-19 spread during dental procedures. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: During the pandemic, dentistry and its aerosol-generating procedures were placed on hold. The process to getting back to patient care is multifactorial, including personal protective equipment, patient screening, and mitigating aerosol spread.","Chavis, Sydnee E.; Hines, Stella E.; Dyalram, Donita; Wilken, Nicholas Cole; Dalby, Richard N.",J Am Dent Assoc,104,11

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. This was a prospective cohort study of 701 patients with COVID-19 admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital that also encompassed three affiliates following this major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020 of whom 113 (16.1%) died in hospital. Median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range, 50-71), including 367 men and 334 women. On admission, 43.9% of patients had proteinuria and 26.7% had hematuria. The prevalence of elevated serum creatinine, elevated blood urea nitrogen and estimated glomerular filtration under 60 ml/min/1.73m(2) were 14.4, 13.1 and 13.1%, respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated baseline serum creatinine (hazard ratio: 2.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.36-3.26), elevated baseline blood urea nitrogen (3.97, 2.57-6.14), AKI stage 1 (1.90, 0.76-4.76), stage 2 (3.51, 1.49-8.26), stage 3 (4.38, 2.31-8.31), proteinuria 1+ (1.80, 0.81-4.00), 2+∼3+ (4.84, 2.00-11.70), and hematuria 1+ (2.99, 1.39-6.42), 2+∼3+ (5.56,2.58- 12.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity and leukocyte count. Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.","Cheng, Yichun; Luo, Ran; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Meng; Wang, Zhixiang; Dong, Lei; Li, Junhua; Yao, Ying; Ge, Shuwang; Xu, Gang",Kidney Int,104,30

Of course, the public health authorities in Japan have started to prepare control measures for such events. We report here our attempts, using a mathematical model, to estimate outbreak size and to examine the most effective measures; comparing ring vaccination (contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination among contacts) and mass vaccination of the susceptible population in the area. The basic framework of the mathematical model follows a model used in previous research. The initial susceptible population is assumed to be 30 million persons. Concerning the important parameters, such as the number of initial-exposure cases, R 0 (infectious power, or natural history) and, the starting day of intervention after the initial exposure, we checked the robustness of our conclusions by sensitivity analysis. We found that mass vaccination is preferable to ring vaccination when the values for the initial-exposure cases and R 0 are high and when the start of intervention by public health authorities is delayed. In the base-case situation, the mass vaccination strategy needs almost 30 million vaccine doses. On the other hand, though ring vaccination needs fewer doses, it needs fewer than 50â€‰000 doses in the worst-case scenario, that with larger first exposure, higher R 0, or later start of public health authority intervention. This mathematical model can measure the prevalence of an infectious disease and can evaluate control measures for it before an outbreak. Especially, it is useful for the planning of the outbreaks of emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or for bioterrorism attacks involving such diseases as smallpox. In further research, we will have to take into account the population people vaccinated of for smallpox, who account for about 70% of the total population in Japan.","Ohkusa, Yasushi; Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Okubo, Ichiro",Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy,104,1

METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study pooled data from 9171 primary school students (grades from 1 to 6) from four cities in the north and south of China. National Geomatics Center of China (NGCC) and China Meteorological Administration provided data about altitude, latitude, longitude, average annual temperature, and average annual sunshine duration. Non-cycloplegic refraction was recorded, and prevalence rates in primary school students and factors associated with myopia were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the independent association of risk factors of myopia. RESULTS: The overall myopia prevalence was 28.0%, from 7.5% to 50.6% for first and sixth grades, respectively. Low, moderate and high myopia significantly increased with school grades from 7.30% to 35.0%, 0.3% to 13.60% and 0.00% to 1.9%, respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that longer average cumulative daylight hours were connected to lower myopia prevalence in primary school students (OR, 0.721; 95% CI, [0.593–0.877]; P=0.001), whereas girls and higher grade was independently associated with higher myopia prevalence (girls: β=0.189; OR, 1.208; 95% CI, [1.052–1.387]; P=0.007; higher grade: β=0.502; OR, 1.652; 95% CI, [1.580–1.726]; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that myopia was highly prevalent in southern Chinese cities over northern ones, linked to shorter light exposure, higher education level, and female gender. Such findings reinforced the beneficial impact of daylight exposure with a protective role against myopia development.","Leng, Lin; Zhang, Jiafan; Xie, Sen; Ding, Wenzhi; Ji, Rongyuan; Tian, Yuyin; Long, Keli; Yu, Hongliang; Guo, Zhen",Int J Gen Med,104,16

Resveratrol is considered an anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. Herein, we used a network pharmacological approach and bioinformatic gene analysis to explore the pharmacological mechanism of Resveratrol in COVID-19 therapy. Potential targets of Resveratrol were obtained from public databases. SARS-CoV-2 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out via bioinformatic analysis Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE147507, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis; then, protein-protein interaction network was constructed. The common targets, GO terms, and KEGG pathways of Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs were confirmed. KEGG Mapper queried the location of common targets in the key pathways. A notable overlap of the GO terms and KEGG pathways between Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 DEGs was revealed. The shared targets between Resveratrol targets and SARS-CoV-2 mainly involved the IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Our study uncovered that Resveratrol is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 and we also revealed the probable key targets and pathways involved.

It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment for this study has yet to start. It is anticipated that recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in April 2022.

The replicase complex assembles on double membrane vesicles (DMVs). Here, we studied the role of a putative replicase anchor, nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4), in the assembly of murine coronavirus DMVs. We used reverse genetics to generate infectious clone viruses (icv) with an alanine substitution at nsp4 glycosylation site N176 or N237, or an asparagine to threonine substitution (nsp4-N258T), which is proposed to confer a temperature sensitive phenotype. We found that nsp4-N237A is lethal and nsp4-N258T generated a virus (designated Alb ts6 icv) that is temperature sensitive for viral replication. Analysis of Alb ts6 icv-infected cells revealed that there was a dramatic reduction in DMVs and that both nsp4 and nsp3 partially localized to mitochondria when cells were incubated at the non-permissive temperature. These results reveal a critical role of nsp4 in directing coronavirus DMV assembly.","Clementz, Mark A.; Kanjanahaluethai, Amornrat; O'Brien, Timothy E.; Baker, Susan C.",Virology,104,17

To understand the impact of contemplative practices on emotional and mental health during COVID-19, the Stanford WELL for Life Study (US component), incorporated a series of additional surveys into its ongoing study. A total of 1,097 participants residing in California who responded to at least one of three COVID-19 surveys were included in this analysis. Linear and generalized mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate relationships between individual contemplative practice behaviors (CPB) (embodied observing meditation, non-reactive mindfulness meditation, self-compassion cultivation, cultivation of compassion for others) and four psychosocial outcomes measured in the original WELL questionnaire (resilience, dealing with stress, positive emotions, and negative emotions). In addition, the associations between CPB and depression, distress, and compliance with local Shelter-In-Place orders were also investigated. Participants who engaged in any contemplative practice reported significantly more resilience and positive emotions, dealing better with stress, lower distress, and were less likely to report an experience with depression in the last week. Similar findings held when CPB was modeled as a continuous variable. Significant interactions between the duration of the SIP and CPB were also observed for resilience and SIP compliance outcomes, indicating that steeper declines were observed among participants with little or no CPB across the study period. Further investigation into the potential protective benefits of CPB during times of major disruption and uncertainty is warranted.","Chrisinger, Benjamin W.; Rich, Tia; Lounsbury, David; Peng, Katy; Zhang, Janice; Heaney, Catherine A.; Lu, Ying; Hsing, Ann W.",Prev Med Rep,104,9

Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, Abul Bashar Mir Md.

METHODS: After systematically searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 retrospective, 6 prospective observational, and 2 cross-sectional studies was performed according to the guidelines of PRISMA. RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Males accounted for significantly more patients than did females (OR 1.59; 95%CI 1.25-2.02) (P<.001). The total incidence of VTE among COVID-19 patients was 28.3 % (95%CI 21.6-35.4), with an incidence of 38.0% (95%CI 29.1-47.4) and 17.2% (95%CI 11.4-23.8) among severe COVID-19 cases and general cases, respectively. The total incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of lower extremities was 18.3% (95%CI 10.8-27.2), and the occurrence of DVT was 22.1% (95%CI 11.0-35.5) and 12.8% (95%CI 5.0-23.3) in severe and general cases, respectively. The total incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was 17.6% (95%CI 12.3-23.5), with a rate of 21.7% (95%CI 14.8-29.3) in severe cases and 12.5% (95%CI 6.1-23.5) in general cases. When COVID-19 severity is unclassified, mortality in patients with VTE was not significantly higher (25.2%; 95%CI 12.2-40.5) than that in those with no VTE (10.2%; 95%CI 3.4-19.5) (odd ratios:1.88(0.46, 7.64), P= .377). However, among patients with severe COVID-19, those who had VTE had a significantly higher mortality rate than did those without VTE (OR 2.02; (95%CI 1.15-3.53), P= .014). COVID-19 patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels than did patients with no VTE in multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of VTE, DVT, and PE is substantial among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially severe COVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 patients with VTE have significantly higher mortality rate than do patients without VTE. Increased values of D-dimer may be indicators of the occurrence of VTE in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Yandong; Cai, Jiawei; Wang, Chao; Jin, Jie; Qu, Lefeng",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,104,26

Antibiotics applications not only affect target pathogens but also intestinal beneficially microbes, inducing long-lasting changes in intestinal microbiota associated with diseases. The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues. Probiotics are considered the ideal antibiotic substitute; in recent years, probiotic research concerning their application during pathogenic infections in humans, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock industry, with emphasis on modulating the immune system of the host, has been attracting considerable interest. Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics. In this review, we mainly summarize recent discoveries and discuss two important aspects: (1) the application of probiotics during pathogenic infections; and (2) their modulatory effects on the immune response of the host during infectious and non-infectious diseases.","Raheem, Abdul; Liang, Lin; Zhang, Guangzhi; Cui, Shangjin",Front Immunol,104,32

Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission/recover rates change significantly are defined as ""break points"" in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of ""stay-at-home orders"" and some states' early ""re-openings"" by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model performed satisfactorily short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures. Finally, some theoretical results and empirical performance of the proposed methodology on synthetic data are reported which justify the good performance of the proposed method.","Bai, Y.; Safikhani, A.; Michailidis, G.",,104,1

As elective procedures and surgeries get scheduled, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) must implement some form of widespread testing in order to ensure the safety of both the ASC staff and the patients being seen. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced the approval of new serological testing for SARS-CoV-2, a test that can indicate the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum against viral particles. However, the possibility for reinfection raises questions about the utility of this new serological test, as the presence of IgG may not correspond to long-term immunity. SARS-CoV-2 has been known to form escape mutations, which may correspond to a reduction in immunoglobulin binding capacity. Patients who develop more robust immune responses with formation of memory CD8(+) T-cells and helper CD4(+) T-cells will be the most equipped if exposed to the virus, but, unfortunately, the serology test will not help us in distinguishing those individuals. Given the inherent disadvantages of serological testing, antibody testing alone should not be used when deciding patient care and should be combined with polymerase chain reaction testing.","Chaturvedi, Rahul; Naidu, Ramana; Sheth, Samir; Chakravarthy, Krishnan",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,104,3

The mixing between them is accomplished by means of time-dependent infection rate matrices. The model is calibrated with the curve of daily new infections in New York City and its boroughs, including census data, and the proportions of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for each age range.

The porcine intestinal epithelial cell is the PEDV target cell. In this study, we established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line which can stably express PEDV N protein. We also investigate the subcellular localization and function of PEDV N protein by examining its effects on cell growth, cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, and survival. The results show that the PEDV N protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inhibits the IEC growth and prolongs S-phase cell cycle. The S-phase is prolonged which is associated with a decrease of cyclin A transcription level and an increase of cyclin A degradation. The IEC expressing PEDV N protein can express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV N protein induces ER stress and activates NF-κB, which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. This is the first report to demonstrate that PEDV N protein can induce cell cycle prolongation at the S-phase, ER stress and up-regulation interleukin-8 expression.

Few studies have described the process that was used for engaging communities in AT research, particularly within low-income communities of older Hispanic with disabilities where limited access, culture, and mistrust must be navigated. We aimed to identify effective practices to enhance CE of low-income Hispanic communities in AT research. METHODS: The community stakeholders included community-based organizations, the community healthcare clinic, the local AT project, and residents of the Caño Martín Peña Community in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The CE procedures and activities during the Planning the Study Phase comprised working group meetings with stakeholders to cocreate the funding proposal for the study and address the reviewers’ critiques. During the Conducting the Study Phase, we convened a Community Advisory Board to assist in the implementation of the study. During the Disseminating the Study Results Phase, we developed and implemented plans to disseminate the research results. RESULTS: We identified seven distinct practices to enhance CE in AT research with Hispanic communities: (1) early and continuous input; (2) building trusting and warm relationships through personal connections; (3) establishing and maintaining presence in the community; (4) power sharing; (5) shared language; (6) ongoing mentorship and support to community members; and (7) adapting to the changing needs of the community. CONCLUSION: Greater attention to CE practices may improve the effectiveness and sustainability of AT research with low-income communities.","Orellano-Colón, Elsa M.; Rivero-Méndez, Marta; Boneu-Meléndez, Claudia X.; Solís-Báez, Solymar; León-Astor, Arelí; Juliá-Pacheco, Mariolga; Santiago-Cruz, María del Mar; Jutai, Jeffrey W.",Journal of clinical and translational science,104,12

This 16-membered ring plecomacrolide has potent antifungal and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitory activities. In our previous work, we identified a bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (baf) from the marine bacterium Streptomyces lohii ATCC BAA-1276, wherein a luxR family regulatory gene orf1 and an afsR family regulatory gene bafG were revealed based on bioinformatics analysis. In this study, the positive regulatory roles of orf1 and bafG for bafilomycin biosynthesis are characterized through gene inactivation and overexpression. Compared to the wild-type S. lohii strain, the knockout of either orf1 or bafG completely abolished the production of bafilomycins. The overexpression of orf1 or bafG led to 1.3- and 0.5-fold increased production of bafilomycins, respectively. A genetically engineered S. lohii strain (SLO-08) with orf1 overexpression and inactivation of the biosynthetic genes orf2 and orf3, solely produced bafilomycin A(1) with the titer of 535.1 ± 25.0 mg/L in an optimized fermentation medium in shaking flasks.

Objective To evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on all urologic activities over a 17-wk period in the three largest public hospitals in Lombardy located in the worst hit area in Italy, and to assess the applicability of the authorities’ recommendations provided for reorganising urology practice. Design, setting, and participants A retrospective analysis of all urologic activities performed at three major public hospitals in Lombardy (Brescia, Bergamo, and Milan), from January 1 to April 28, 2020, was performed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Join-point regression was used to identify significant changes in trends for all urologic activities. Average weekly percentage changes (AWPCs) were estimated to summarise linear trends. Uro-oncologic surgeries performed during the pandemic were tabulated and stratified according to the first preliminary recommendations by Stensland et al (Stensland KD, Morgan TM, Moinzadeh A, et al. Considerations in the triage of urologic surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eur Urol 2020;77:663–6) and according to the level of priority recommended by European Association of Urology guidelines. Results and limitations The trend for 2020 urologic activities decreased constantly from weeks 8–9 up to weeks 11–13 (AWPC range –41%, –29.9%; p < 0.001). One-third of uro-oncologic surgeries performed were treatments that could have been postponed, according to the preliminary urologic recommendations. High applicability to recommendations was observed for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients with intermediate/emergency level of priority, penile and testicular cancer patients, and upper tract urothelial cell carcinoma (UTUC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients with intermediate level of priority. Low applicability was observed for NMIBC patients with low/high level of priority, UTUC patients with high level of priority, prostate cancer patients with intermediate/high level of priority, and RCC patients with low level of priority. Conclusions During COVID-19, we found a reduction in all urologic activities. High-priority surgeries and timing of treatment recommended by the authorities require adaptation according to hospital resources and local incidence. Patient summary We assessed the urologic surgeries that were privileged during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the three largest public hospitals in Lombardy, worst hit by the pandemic, to evaluate whether high-priority surgeries and timing of treatment recommended by the authorities are applicable.

It is the only inhibitor of the MmpL3 mycolic acid transporter in clinical development. No SQ109-resistant mutant has been directly isolated thus far in vitro, in mice, or in patients, which is tentatively attributed to its multiple targets. It is considered a potential replacement for poorly tolerated components of multidrug-resistant TB regimens. To prioritize SQ109-containing combinations with the best potential for cure and treatment shortening, one must understand its contribution against different bacterial populations in pulmonary lesions. Here, we have characterized the pharmacokinetics of SQ109 in the rabbit model of active TB and its penetration at the sites of disease—lung tissue, cellular and necrotic lesions, and caseum. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described the plasma pharmacokinetics. At the human-equivalent dose, parameter estimates fell within the ranges published for preclinical species. Tissue concentrations were modeled using an “effect” compartment, showing high accumulation in lung and cellular lesion areas with penetration coefficients in excess of 1,000 and lower passive diffusion in caseum after 7 daily doses. These results, together with the hydrophobic nature and high nonspecific caseum binding of SQ109, suggest that multiweek dosing would be required to reach steady state in caseum and poorly vascularized compartments, similar to bedaquiline. Linking lesion pharmacokinetics to SQ109 potency in assays against replicating, nonreplicating, and intracellular M. tuberculosis showed SQ109 concentrations markedly above pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic targets in lung and cellular lesions throughout the dosing interval.","Egbelowo, Oluwaseun; Sarathy, Jansy P.; Gausi, Kamunkhwala; Zimmerman, Matthew D.; Wang, Han; Wijnant, Gert-Jan; Kaya, Firat; Gengenbacher, Martin; Van, Nhi; Degefu, Yonatan; Nacy, Carol; Aldridge, Bree B.; Carter, Claire L.; Denti, Paolo; Dartois, Véronique",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,104,16

Developing a robust and fast prediction method may facilitate the timely diagnosis of KD, significantly reducing the risk of CALs in KD patients. The levels of inflammatory serum proteins dramatically vary during the onsets of many immune diseases, including in KD. However, our understanding of their pathogenic roles in KD is behind satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate candidate diagnostic serum proteins and the potential mechanism in KD using iTRAQ gel-free proteomics. We enrolled subjects and conducted iTRAQ gel-free proteomics to globally screen serum proteins followed by specific validation with ELISA. Further in vitro leukocyte trans-endothelial model was also applied to investigate the pathogenesis roles of inflammatory serum proteins. We identified six KD protein biomarkers, including Protein S100-A8 (S100A8), Protein S100-A9 (S100A9), Protein S100-A12 (S100A12), Peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), Neutrophil defensin 1 (DEFA1) and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (ORM1). They enabled us to develop a high-performance KD prediction model with an auROC value of 0.94, facilitating the timely identification of KD. Further assays concluded that recombinant S100A12 protein treatment activated neutrophil surface adhesion molecules responsible for adhesion to endothelial cells. Therefore, S100A12 promoted both freshly clinically isolated neutrophils and neutrophil-like cells to infiltrate through the endothelial layer in vitro. Finally, the antibody against S100A12 may attenuate the infiltration promoted by S100A12. Our result demonstrated that evaluating S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PRDX2, DEFA1 and ORM1 levels may be a good diagnostic tool of KD. Further in vitro study implied that S100A12 could be a potential therapeutic target for KD.","Li, Sung-Chou; Tsai, Kuo-Wang; Huang, Lien-Hung; Weng, Ken-Pen; Chien, Kuang-Jen; Lin, Yuyu; Tu, Chi-Ying; Lin, Pei-Hsien",Sci Rep,104,13

We use simple mathematical models to describe this process with the aim to better understand the emergence of an epidemic resulting from such a mutation and the extent of measures that are needed to control it. The feared outbreak of a human–human transmissible form of avian influenza leading to a global epidemic is the paradigm for this study. We extend the SIR approach to derive a deterministic and a stochastic formulation to describe the evolution of two classes of susceptible and infected states and a removed state, leading to a system of ordinary differential equations and a stochastic equivalent based on a Markov process. For the deterministic model, the contrasting timescale of the mutation process and disease infectiousness is exploited in two limits using asymptotic analysis in order to determine, in terms of the model parameters, necessary conditions for an epidemic to take place and timescales for the onset of the epidemic, the size and duration of the epidemic and the maximum level of the infected individuals at one time. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number R 0 is determined from asymptotic analysis of a distinguished limit. Comparisons between the deterministic and stochastic model demonstrate that stochasticity has little effect on most aspects of an epidemic, but does have significant impact on its onset particularly for smaller populations and lower mutation rates for representatively large populations. The deterministic model is extended to investigate a range of quarantine and vaccination programmes, whereby in the two asymptotic limits analysed, quantitative estimates on the outcomes and effectiveness of these control measures are established.","Chen, C.

This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises. The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5). Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors. Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis. Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes. Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing. In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing. Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss per se, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health. These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.","Dawel, Amy; Shou, Yiyun; Smithson, Michael; Cherbuin, Nicolas; Banfield, Michelle; Calear, Alison L.; Farrer, Louise M.; Gray, Darren; Gulliver, Amelia; Housen, Tambri; McCallum, Sonia M.; Morse, Alyssa R.; Murray, Kristen; Newman, Eryn; Rodney Harris, Rachael M.; Batterham, Philip J.",Front Psychiatry,104,26

Due to inadequate research on spatial modelling of water – electricity consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study investigated geographical block-level variation in water and electricity consumption in Doha city of Qatar. Spatial analyses were performed to investigate the spatial differences in each sector. Five geospatial techniques in a Geographical Information System (GIS) context were used in the study. Moran’s I, Anselin Local Moran's I, and Getis-Ord [Formula: see text] statistics tools were used to identify the hot spots and cold spots of water and electricity consumption in each sector. Furthermore, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models were employed to investigate the spatial relationship between water and electricity consumption during the pandemic year. The findings show that there is a distinction in water and electricity consumption at the block level across all sectors and over time. Hot spot and spatial regression analysis reveal spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the study area across the six socioeconomic sectors. The intensity of hot spots of water and electricity consumption are found in the southern and western parts of the city due to high population density and the concentration of the commercial and industrial areas. Furthermore, analyzing the spatiotemporal correlation between the water and electricity consumption across the six sectors shows variation within and between these sectors over space and time. The results show a positive relationship between water and electricity consumption in some blocks and over time of each sector. During the lockdown phase, strong positive correlation between water and electricity consumption have exist in the residential sector due to extra water and electricity footprints in this sector. Conversely, the water and electricity consumption were positively correlated but declined in the industrial and commercial sector due to the curtailment in production, economic activities, and reduction in people’s mobility. Mapping the hot spot blocks and the blocks with high relationship between water and electricity consumption could provide useful insight to decision-makers for targeted interventions.","Abulibdeh, Ammar",Appl Energy,104,16

This brief report draws on a service evaluation undertaken immediately prior to and during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic creates a paradox when considering safety in the home, but it is important to recognise the dangers this presents to many victims of stalking. The information presented in this report is based on existing literature and early evidence from semi-structured interviews and discussions with 15 victims and six practitioners. Whilst lockdown measures might appear to be a time when victims are less accessible to their stalkers, early evidence from this study suggests that their vulnerability is increased. Technology has helped to facilitate stalking behaviours by providing stalkers with new approaches to control, humiliate, threaten and isolate their victims. Some lockdown restrictions have provided increased opportunities for stalkers to monitor their victims and the professional uncertainty and recognition around stalking has continued, coupled with delays in the criminal justice system. The COVID-19 crisis has reversed gains made by stalking victims and has imprisoned some victims in their homes making their whereabouts easier to monitor. Stalking behaviour has not ceased as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions and the risk of harm to victims remains significant.

The docking study reveals that withaferin-A mol 61 forms 5 polar H-bonds with the M(pro) where amino acids involved are GLU166, THR190, CYS145, MET165, and GLN152 and upon QSAR analysis showed a minimal predicted IC50 value of 7762.47 nM. Furthermore, the in silico cytotoxicity predictions, pharmacophore modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation studies have resulted in predicting the highly potent small molecule derivative from withaferin-A (phytocompound from Withania somnifera) to be the potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV 2 protease (M(pro)) and a promising future lead candidate against COVID-19. The rationale of choosing withaferin-A from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) was propelled by the innumerous applications of Ashwagandha for the treatment of various antiviral diseases, common cold, and fever since time immemorial.

We tested whether this can be quantified into an inverted-U relationship between motivation and success frequency. Participants played a game in which they navigated a scene to catch targets. In Experiment 1 (N = 101), play duration was free and the motivating value of success frequency was measured from the probability that a player would continue at that frequency. In Experiment 2 (N = 70), play duration was fixed, and motivation was measured using repeated self-reports. In Experiment 1, the probability to continue increased linearly with the success frequency whereas play duration did show the inverted-U relationship with success frequency. In Experiment 2, self-reported motivation showed the inverted-U relationship with success frequency. Together, this shows that motivation depends on success frequency. In addition, we provide tentative evidence that the concept of intermediate challenge being most motivating can be quantified into an inverted-U relationship between motivation and success frequency.","van der Kooij, Katinka; in ‘t Veld, Lars; Hennink, Thomas",Motiv Emot,104,21

The objective of this study is to evaluate the public health impact of reopening schools on the spread of COVID19. An agent-based simulation model was adapted and used to project the number of infections and deaths under multiple school reopening dates and scenarios, including different cohorts receiving in-person instruction on alternating days, only younger children returning to in-person instruction, regular schedule (all students receiving in-person instruction), and school closure (all students receiving online instruction). The study period was February 18th-November 24th, 2020 and the state of Georgia was used as a case study. Across all scenarios, the number of COVID19-related deaths ranged from approximately 17 to 22 thousand during the study period, and on the peak day, the number of new infections ranged from 43 to 68 thousand. An alternating school day schedule performed: (i) almost as well as keeping schools closed, with the infection attack rate ranging from 38.5% to 39.8% compared to that of 37.7% under school closure; (ii) slightly better than only allowing children 10 years or younger to return to in-person instruction.

At first, it was about course finishing; later, the issues moved to assessment. This scourge increases mental issues, stress, dissatisfaction, sorrow, and nervousness. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the mental health and behaviour of Mizoram University students during the Covid-19 lockdown period. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, and a snowball method sampling technique was utilised for obtainging information from the students. RESULTS: There were 65.2% of students who revealed that they were giving more consideration to their emotional wellbeing during this pandemic. More than half of the participants (67.2%) reported no expanded worry of stress from scholastic work, and 65.2% reported that they were paying more attention to their emotional wellbeing and mental health following the pandemic. Further, 69.7% reported that they were spending more time exercising. Nearly 55% of students took part in Zoom classes, with a length of 35 to 40 min. About 65.7% of students gained proficiency in their course by means of a learning management system. Students performed activities at home during the lockdown period, watching TV (75.4%), reading books (38.7%), and on writing assignments (34.8%); and 34.5% of the students viewed news from TV, newspapers, and social media about the Covid-19 pandemic each day. CONCLUSION: The positive effects on psychological wellbeing may have helped the students adapt to other negative effects and expanded pressure on emotional wellbeing.

We compared hearing screening outcomes in neonates born to women with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy with healthy controls. METHODS: Neonates born between April and December 2020 in our hospital to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were included in this study. Neonates with risk factors for universal newborn hearing screening (NHS) were excluded. Neonates born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results during pregnancy were compared with healthy controls in terms of newborn hearing screening results and independent variables. RESULTS: Neonates in the COVID-19 group were more likely to have a “refer” result in auditory brainstem responses (ABR) compared with the control group (53/118 and 28/118, respectively; p = 0.001). The second ABR test results did not differ significantly between the groups (p = 0.618). Logistic regression revealed that birth week and type of birth were not associated with the “refer” result. PCR positivity in the second trimester was more likely to produce the “refer” result in the first ABR test (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity in pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk of abnormal NHS results. Also, the timing of PCR positivity in pregnancy (trimester) may be related to abnormal NHS results.","Alan, Mehmet Akif; Alan, Cemre",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,104,16

Consecutive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens is essential for determining duration of virus shedding and providing evidence to optimize the clinical management of COVID-19. Research Question What are the shedding durations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens respectively? What are their associated risk factors? Study Design and Methods: A total of 68 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were recruited. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from paired specimens of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and sputum were carried out. The clinical characteristics of patients were recorded for further analysis. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from NPS in 48 (70.6%) patients, and from sputum specimens in 30 (44.1%) patients. The median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens (34 days, IQR 24-40 days) was significantly longer than from NPS (19 days, IQR 14-25 days; P<0.001). Elderly age was an independent factor associated with prolonged virus shedding time of SARS-CoV-2 (HR 1.71, 1.01-2.93). It was noteworthy that in 9 patients the viral RNA was detected in sputum after NPS turned negative. Chronic lung disease and steroids were associated with virus detection in sputum, and diabetes mellitus was associated with virus detection in both NPS and sputum. Interpretation These findings may impact a test based clearance discharge criteria given patients with COVID-19 may shed virus longer in their lower respiratory tracts, with potential implication for prolonged transmission risk. In addition, more attention should be given to elderly patients who might have prolonged viral shedding duration.","Wang, Kun; Zhang, Xin; Sun, Jiaxing; Ye, Jia; Wang, Feilong; Hua, Jing; Zhang, Huayu; Shi, Ting; Li, Qiang; Wu, Xiaodong",Chest,104,16

Thus, patients with hypertension with COVID‐19 could have worse prognosis. Indeed, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers may interfere with angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 expression/activity. Thus, patients with hypertension undergoing angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blockers drug therapy may be at a higher risk of contracting a serious COVID‐19 infection and should be monitored. Moreover, in the present study we investigated the effects of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor versus angiotensin receptor blockers versus calcium channel blockers on clinical outcomes as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admissions, heart injury, and death in 62 patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID‐19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The multicenter study was prospectively conducted at Department of Infectious Diseases of Sant'Anna Hospital of Caserta, and of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" of Naples, at Department of Advanced Surgical and Medical Sciences of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli,"" Naples, and at General Medical Assistance Unit ""FIMG,"" Naples, Italy. Lowest values of left ventricle ejection fraction predicted deaths (1.142, 1.008–1.294, P<0.05), while highest values of interleukin‐6 predicted the admission to intensive care unit (1.617, 1.094–2.389), mechanical ventilation (1.149, 1.082–1.219), heart injuries (1.367, 1.054–1.772), and deaths (4.742, 1.788–8.524). CONCLUSIONS: Anti‐hypertensive drugs didn't affect the prognosis in patients with COVID‐19.

We assessed socio-demographic, professional, health and behavior parameters. The primary goal was to evaluate changes in urologists’ clinical practice and income after two months of COVID-19. We also looked at geographical differences based on the incidence rates of COVID-19 in different states. RESULTS: Among 766 urologists who completed the survey, a reduction ≥ 50% of patient visits, elective and emergency surgeries was reported by 83.2%, 89.6% and 54.8%, respectively. An income reduction of ≥ 50% was reported by 54.3%. Measures to reduce costs were implemented by most. Video consultations were performed by 38.7%. Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (32.9%), reduced physical activity (60.0%), increased alcoholic intake (39.9%) and reduced sexual activity (34.9%). Finally, 13.5% of Brazilian urologists were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and about one third required hospitalization. Urologists from the highest COVID-19 incidence states were at a higher risk to have a reduction of patient visits and non-essential surgeries (OR=2.95, 95% CI 1.86 – 4.75; p< 0.0001) and of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (OR=4.36 95%CI 1.74-10.54, p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 produced massive disturbances in Brazilian urologists’ practice, with major reductions in patient visits and surgical procedures. Distressing consequences were also observed on physicians’ income, health and personal lives. These findings are probably applicable to other medical specialties.","Gomes, Cristiano M.; Favorito, Luciano A.; Henriques, João Victor T.; Canalini, Alfredo F.; Anzolch, Karin M.

While the CCoV-II genome has been completely sequenced, to date there are no complete genomic sequence data available publicly for CCoV-I. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the full-length genome of a CCoV-I prototype strain that had been recovered from a dog with diarrhea in Italy. CCoV-I strain 23/03 has a genome of 30,000 nucleotides, excluding the 3′ poly(A) tail, displaying the typical Alphacoronavirus-1 organization and the highest genetic relatedness to CCoV-II. However, two distinct features were observed in the CCoV-I genome: (i) the presence of an additional ORF between the spike (S) protein gene and ORF3a; (ii) the diversity of the S protein, which is more closely related to that of feline coronavirus type I and presents a furin cleavage site. The present study may contribute to a better understanding of the Alphacoronavirus-1 evolutionary pattern and may be paradigmatic of how coronaviruses evolve through gene losses, acquisition and exchanges among different members.","Decaro, Nicola; Mari, Viviana; Elia, Gabriella; Lanave, Gianvito; Dowgier, Giulia; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio",Virus Res,104,12

To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, two shRNA-expressing plasmids (pEGFP-U6/P1 and pEGFP-U6/P2) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of TGEV were constructed and transfected into swine testicular (ST) cells. The cytopathic effect (CPE) and MTS assays demonstrated that both shRNAs were capable of protecting cells against TGEV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with the two plasmids were reduced by 95.2% and up to 100%, respectively.

There are no data about parents’ SM practices for their children’s dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to evaluate parents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding self-medication for their children’s dental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Turkey. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in the pediatric dental clinic at Ondokuz Mayis University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown ended. A total of 389 parents who agreed to participate in the study completed the questionnaire from July 1 to October 1. A questionnaire with 18 items was designed to collect information on the parents’ knowledge and attitudes regarding when, why, and how to use drugs and on their practices on medicating their children. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics (chi-square test). RESULTS: The majority of parents (n = 273; 70.2%) practiced self-medication for their children's dental problems. Self-medication with a previously prescribed medications was usually preferred by parents (n = 179; 62.2%). Analgesics (98%) were the most commonly used medicines by parents in their self-medication for their children's dental problems. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication practices for children's dental problems is high in Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, new healthcare services, such as teledentistry, may be useful to overcome problems related to the self-medication of children during times when the ability to reach healthcare providers is limited, such as during pandemics.

As SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs, particularly alveolar type II-like cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in COVID-19 patients. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes(1). We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high throughput screen of FDA-approved drugs and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid (MPA), and quinacrine dihydrochloride (QNHC). Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.","Han, Yuling; Duan, Xiaohua; Yang, Liuliu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Wang, Pengfei; Duan, Fuyu; Tang, Xuming; Yaron, Tomer M.; Zhang, Tuo; Uhl, Skyler; Bram, Yaron; Richardson, Chanel; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhao, Zeping; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T.; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Jessurun, Jose; Borczuk, Alain; Huang, Yaoxing; Johnson, Jared L.; Liu, Yuru; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Cantley, Lewis C.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Ho, David D.; Pan, Fong Cheng; Evans, Todd; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Schwartz, Robert E.; Chen, Shuibing",Nature,104,20

We present the case of a 31-year-old woman who was admitted to hospital at 35 weeks gestation with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 and required ECMO during the postpartum period. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient had obvious dyspnea, accompanied by chills and fever. Her dyspnea worsened and her arterial oxygen saturation decreased rapidly. DIAGNOSIS: ARDS secondary to COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Emergency bedside cesarean section. Medications included immunotherapy (thymosin α 1), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin), antibiotics (imipenem-cilastatin sodium and vancomycin), and methylprednisolone. Ventilatory support was provided using invasive mechanical ventilation. This was replaced by venous-venous ECMO 5 days postpartum. ECMO management focused on blood volume control, coagulation function adjustment, and airway management. OUTCOMES: The patient was successfully weaned for ECMO and the ventilator and made a good recovery.

In the lung, constitutive cytokines such as IL-1α are released together with other cell contents. A cascade of inflammatory cytokines ensues, including chemokines and IL-1β, triggering both local as well as systemic inflammation. This cascade of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19 is termed “Cytokine Release Syndrome” (CRS), and is associated with poor outcomes and death. Many studies reveal that blocking IL-1 activities in COVID-19 patients reduces disease severity and deaths. Here we report highly significant circulating levels of IL-1β, IL-1 Receptor antagonist, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10 and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor in COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms. We also report that in circulating myeloid cells from the same patients, there is increased expression of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) early in the infection. We observed increased NLRP3 gene expression in myeloid cells correlated with IL-1β gene expression and also with elevated circulating IL-1β levels. We conclude that early in SARS-CoV-2 infection, NLRP3 activation takes place and initiates the CRS. Thus, NLRP3 is a target to reduce the organ damage of inflammatory cytokines of the CRS.","Marchetti, Carlo; Mould, Kara; Tengesdal, Isak W.; Janssen, William J; Dinarello, Charles A.",bioRxiv,104,20

A mathematical model was formulated based on non-linear ordinary differential equations considering young (60 years old or less) and elder (60 years old or more) subpopulations, aiming to describe the introduction and dissemination of the new coronavirus in São Paulo. This deterministic model used the data collected from São Paulo to estimate the model parameters, obtaining R(0) = 6.8 for the basic reproduction number. The model also allowed to estimate that 50% of the population of São Paulo was in isolation, which permitted to describe the current epidemiological status. The goal of isolation implemented in São Paulo to control the rapid increase of the new coronavirus epidemic was partially succeeded, concluding that if isolation of at least 80% of the population had been implemented, the collapse in the health care system could be avoided. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the proportions of the release of young and elder persons. We also evaluated three different strategies of release: All isolated persons are released simultaneously, two and three releases divided in equal proportions. The better scenarios occurred when young persons are released, but maintaining elder persons isolated for a while. When compared with the epidemic without isolation, all strategies of release did not attain the goal of reducing substantially the number of hospitalisations due to severe CoViD-19. Hence, we concluded that the best decision must be postponing the beginning of the release.","Yang, H. M.; Lombardi Junior, L. P.; Castro, F. F. M.; Yang, A. C.",Epidemiology and infection,104,28

Several over the counter products are available which provide symptomatic, not causal relief. For such lozenges, containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol (HR), recently an additional virucidal effect was published. Therefore, we tested a set of Strepsils(®) lozenges, containing either HR (Max [#2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [#3], Extra Strong [#4], Warm [#5], Orange and Vitamin C [#6], Sugar free Lemon [#7], Children/Strawberry [#8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [#9]) for their antiviral efficiency against representatives of respiratory viruses known to cause sore throat: human rhinovirus (HRV) 1a, HRV8, influenza virus A H1N1n, Coxsackievirus A10, and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43. The lozenges were tested head to head with Coldamaris(®) lozenges (#1), which contain the patented antiviral iota-carrageenan. None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges shows any antiviral effectiveness against HRV8 at the tested concentrations, whereas all are moderately active against HRV1a. Only lozenge #5 shows any activity against hCoV OC43 and Coxsackievirus A10 at the tested concentrations. Similarly, only lozenge #3 is moderately active against influenza A H1N1n virus. The data indicates that neither the isolated effect of the active ingredients nor the pH but rather one or more of the excipients of the specific formulations are responsible for the antiviral effect of some of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges. In contrast, carrageenan-containing lozenges are highly active against all viruses tested. In another experiment, we showed that binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective. During the residence time of the lozenge in the mouth, the viral titer is reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza A virus and hCoV OC43, respectively.

By adopting the steps and other components of organizational learning, healthcare institutions can convert themselves into learning organizations and ultimately strengthen the overall healthcare system of the country. The present study aimed to examine the influence of several organizational learning dimensions on organization culture in healthcare settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: During COVID-19 crisis in 2020, an online cross-sectional study was performed. Data were collected via official emails sent to 1500 healthcare professionals working in front line at four sets of hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Basic descriptive analysis was constructed to identify the variation between the four healthcare organizations. A multiple regression was employed to explore how hospitals can adopt learning process during pandemics, incorporating several Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire (DLOQ) developed by Marsick and Watkins (2003) and Leufvén and others (2015). RESULTS: Organizational learning including system connections (M = 3.745), embedded systems (M = 3.732), and team work and collaborations (M = 3.724) tended to have major significant relationships with building effective learning organization culture. Staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, internal learning culture, and continuous learning had the lowest effect on building health organization culture (M = 3.680, M = 3.3.679, M = 3.673, M = 3.663, respectively).

These variables statistically significantly predicted learning organization, F (6, 1124) = 168.730, p < .0005, R(2) = 0.471, (p < .05). DISCUSSION: The findings concluded that although intrinsic factors like staff empowerment, dialogues and inquiry, and internal learning culture, revealed central roles, still the most crucial factors toward the development of learning organization culture were extrinsic ones including connections, embed system and collaborations. CONCLUSIONS: Until knowledge-sharing is embedded in health organizational systems; organizations may not maintain a high level of learning during crisis.","Alonazi, Wadi B.",BMC Health Serv Res,104,20

The emergence of these diseases shows that the existing concepts of pathogenicity and virulence do not take into account the fact that both the microorganism and the host contribute to microbial pathogenesis. To address this impediment to studies of host–microorganism interactions, we propose a new theoretical approach to understanding microbial pathogenesis, known as the 'damage-response' framework.","Casadevall, Arturo; Pirofski, Liise-anne",Nat Rev Microbiol,104,13

Study Design Descriptive. Methods Records of general and subspecialty outpatient attendance, ward admissions, ward bed occupancy, and elective and emergency surgery were obtained for the period since the SARS outbreak and for an equivalent period before the outbreak. The changes in these parameters were determined against the background of new SARS cases. Results Since the outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the weekly outpatient clinic attendance has declined by 59%, the number of operations performed by 79%, the average ward bed occupancy rate by 79% and the daily admission rate by 84%. A dramatic increase of 300% in the number of patients defaulting on their outpatient appointments was recorded. Conclusion The substantial decrease in otorhinolaryngological services at an academic tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong has been multifaceted. The decrease in attendance at the outpatient clinics reflects the increased number of patients defaulting on their appointments. Nonessential elective surgery was suspended soon after the outbreak, accounting for the decrease in the number of surgical procedures performed and partially for the decrease in ward bed occupancy and ward admissions. The temporary closure of the accident and emergency department contributed to the decrease in ward admissions and emergency surgical procedures. The reduced service offered by the hospital is having an impact on the quality of care available to patients with non–life‐threatening otorhinolaryngological conditions.","Vlantis, Alexander C.; Tsang, Raymond K.

The goal of the study is to compare the severity of rhinological symptoms of COVID-19 between patients with nasal steroid use (NSU) and the control group (CG) using the sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT-22) questionnaire. METHODS: A face-to-face survey was conducted at a second referral state hospital between. Patients with a complete recovery from COVID-19 were included in NSU and CG groups. Two subscales of the SNOT-22 were filled by the patients. The frequency and duration of smell and taste loss and SNOT-22 scores were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included in the study. Thirty-one patients were in CG and 16 patients in the NSU group. Twenty-four (51.1%) patients were females and 23 (48.9%) were males. The mean age was 41.4 ± 8.6 years. Olfactory dysfunction was detected in 12 (75%) patients in the NSU group, and 31 (93.3%) patients in the control group (CG). Gustatory dysfunction was seen in 10 (62.5%) patients in the NSU group and 24 (77.4%) patients NSU group. (p = 0.071, 0.279, respectively). The duration of the olfactory (6.6 ± 2.5 days) and gustatory dysfunction (6.1 ± 2.6 days) and the mean SNOT-22 total score (11.9 ± 1.6) was significantly lower in the NSU group (p < 0.001, CI 11.1–5.1, CI 9.9–4.6, CI 9.3–5.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although nasal steroid use does not prevent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, it may reduce the severity and duration of these symptoms.","İşlek, Akif; Balcı, Mustafa Koray",Pharmacol Rep,104,28

This prospective study aimed to evaluate the results of a follow-up program for patients discharged from a nonintensive COVID-19 ward. METHODS: 3–6 months after hospital discharge, 59 of 105 COVID-19 patients (31 males, aged 68.2 ± 12.8 years) were recruited in the study. Forty-six patients were excluded because of nontraceability, refusal, or inability to provide informed consent. The follow-up consisted of anamnesis (including a structured questionnaire), physical examination, blood tests, ECG, lower limb compression venous ultrasound (US), thoracic US, and spirometry with diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). RESULTS: 22% of patients reported no residual symptoms, 28.8% 1 or 2 symptoms and 49.2% 3 or more symptoms. The most frequently symptoms were fatigue, exertional dyspnea, insomnia, and anxiety. Among the inflammatory and coagulation parameters, only the median value of fibrinogen was slightly above normal. A deep vein thrombosis was detected in 1 patient (1.7%). Thoracic US detected mild pulmonary changes in 15 patients (25.4%), 10 of which reported exertional dyspnea. DLCO was mildly or moderately reduced in 19 patients (37.2%), 13 of which complained of exertional dyspnea. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that a substantial percentage of COVID-19 patients (77.8%) continue to complain of symptoms 3–6 months after hospital discharge. Exertional dyspnea was significantly associated with the persistence of lung US abnormalities and diffusing capacity alterations. Extended follow-up is required to assess the long-term evolution of postacute sequelae of COVID-19.","Fortini, Alberto; Torrigiani, Arianna; Sbaragli, Serena; Lo Forte, Aldo; Crociani, Andrea; Cecchini, Paolo; Innocenti Bruni, Giulia; Faraone, Antonio",Infection,104,26

This is more pronounced in the spread of airborne diseases. In this study, the effect of some local weather variables (average temperature, average relative humidity, average wind speed and average atmospheric pressure) on the risk of Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ghana is investigated. The daily confirmed new COVID-19 cases were compiled from the Ghana Health Service and the weather data extracted from Weatherbase. The type of relationship between the climatic variable and risk of spread were explored using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM). RESULTS: Results obtained showed that wind speed and atmospheric pressure have positive linear relationship with the spread of infection an increase in the risk of COVID-19 spread. In addition, the risk of spread fluctuates for temperature between 24 and 29 °C but sharply decreases when average temperature exceeds 29 °C. The risk of spread of COVID-19 significantly decrease for relative humidity between 72 and 76% and leveled afterwards. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that wind speed and pressure have a positive linear relationship with the risk of spread of COVID-19 whilst temperature and humidity have a non-linear relationship with the spread of COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for policy makers to design effective countermeasures for controlling the spread as we are still within the low temperature season.","Aidoo, Eric N.; Adebanji, Atinuke O.; Awashie, Gaston E.; Appiah, Simon K.",Bull Natl Res Cent,104,22

We aimed to quantify the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. The websites of WHO, CDC, and major journals were also searched. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and the prevalence of gastrointestinal findings in infected patients, and excluded preprints, duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, single case reports, studies pertaining to other coronavirus-related illnesses, and small case series (<10 cases). Extracted data included author; date; study design; country; patient demographics; number of participants in severe and non-severe disease groups; prevalence of clinical gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and belching; and digestive system comorbidities including liver disease and gastrointestinal diseases. Raw data from studies were pooled to determine effect estimates. FINDINGS: We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2–5; range 0–15; I(2)=74%). The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10–21; range: 2–57; I(2)=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms. The pooled prevalence of abnormal liver functions (12 studies, n=1267) was 19% (9–32; range 1–53; I(2)=96%). Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1·60 [95% CI 1·09–2·36]; p=0·0020; I(2)=44%) and liver injury (2·20 [1·60–3·02]; p<0·00001; I(2)=36%) compared with those with non-severe disease. Patients in Hubei province, where the initial COVID-19 outbreak occurred, were more likely to present with abnormal liver functions (p<0·0001) compared with those outside of Hubei. Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients. 10% (95% CI 4–19; range 3–23; I(2)=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features.

The mechanism of action involves nucleophilic attack by Cys145 present in the active site on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile amide bond of the substrate and the intermediate product is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the residues of the oxyanion hole. Based on the X-ray structure of 3CL(Pro) co-crystallized with a trans-α,β-unsaturated ethyl ester (Michael acceptor), a set of QM/QM and QM/MM calculations were performed, yielding three models with increasingly higher the number of atoms. A previous validation step was performed using classical theoretical calculation and PROCHECK software. The Michael reaction studies show an exothermic process with −4.5 kcal/mol. During the reaction pathway, an intermediate is formed by hydrogen and water molecule migration from a histidine residue and solvent, respectively. In addition, similar with experimental results, the complex between N3 and 3CL(Pro) is 578 kcal/mol more stable than N1-3CL(Pro) using Own N-layer Integrated molecular Orbital molecular Mechanics (ONIOM) approach. We suggest 3CL(Pro) inhibitors need small polar groups to decrease the energy barrier for alkylation reaction.

Studies on Canadian take-home naloxone programs are promising, but research beyond these programs is limited. Our study is the first to focus on women’s experiences and perspectives on the opioid crisis in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, since the opioid crisis began in 2010. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to address research knowledge gaps involving Canadian women with criminal justice involvement who use opioids, and identify flaws in current policies, responses, and practices. While the opioid overdose crisis persists, this lack of research inhibits our ability to determine whether overdose prevention efforts, especially involving naloxone, are meeting their needs. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews from January to April 2018 with 10 women with experience of opioid use. They were recruited through the study’s community partner in Toronto. Participants provided demographic information, experiences with opioids and naloxone, and their perceptions of the Canadian government’s responses to the opioid crisis. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and inductive thematic analysis was conducted to determine major themes within the data. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified seven major concerns despite significant differences in participant life and opioid use experiences. Participants who had used illicit opioids since naloxone became available over-the-counter in 2016 were much more knowledgeable about naloxone than participants who had only used opioids prior to 2016. The portability, dosage form, and effects of naloxone are important considerations for women who use opioids. Social alienation, violence, and isolation affect the wellbeing of women who use opioids. The Canadian government’s response to the opioid crisis was perceived as inadequate. Participants demonstrated differing needs and views on ideal harm reduction approaches, despite facing similar structural issues surrounding stigma, addiction management, and housing. CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced with naloxone use found it to be useful in preventing fatal overdose, however many of their needs with regards to physical, mental, and social health, housing, harm reduction, and access to opioid treatment remained unmet.

Failure to distinguish the 2 diseases may increase the risk of transmission. A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits. We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data. MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza. All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared. We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

RESULTS: We preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer. The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza. Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza. This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza.

This cross‐sectional study aims to investigate the psychological health of Italian healthcare professionals during the COVID‐19 outbreak. We assessed participants’ current psychological distress and coping strategies in the midst of the COVID outbreak (March–April 2020), and also asked them to retrospectively report how they remember feeling before the COVID‐19 outbreak (December 2019). We examined associations between psychological distress and coping strategies with mental health and infection perceptions. METHODS: Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed online to healthcare professionals (N = 580) residing in different Italian regions from 26 March to 9 April 2020. The questionnaire measured changes in psychological states, coping strategies, and demographic variables testing variations in mental health and infection risk perception among Italian healthcare workers. RESULTS: Overall, approximately 33.5 per cent of healthcare professionals in our sample meet the threshold for psychiatric morbidity. Participants perceive their current psychological health to be worse during the COVID‐19 emergency outbreak as compared to before the outbreak, and this was especially true among women.

PARTICIPANTS: 337 patients admitted to hospital with blunt thoracic injuries were recruited between June 2018–October 2020. METHODS: Participants completed a bank of two quality of life surveys (Short Form-12 (SF-12) and EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels) and two pain questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory and painDETECT Questionnaire) at four time points over the first 6 months after discharge from hospital. A total of 211 (63%) participants completed the outcomes data at 6 months after hospital discharge. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Three outcomes were measured using pre-existing and validated patient-reported outcome measures. Outcomes included: Poor physical function (SF-12 Physical Component Score); chronic pain (Brief Pain Inventory Pain Severity Score); and neuropathic pain (painDETECT Questionnaire). RESULTS: Despite a trend towards improving physical functional and pain at 6 months, outcomes did not return to participants perceived baseline level of function.

However, different tumor types have differing susceptibility to the infection and COVID-19 phenotypes. Thus, the risk and prevalence of COVID-19 is not uniform across the different tumor types. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the risk and prevalence of COVID-19 infection in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed up to July 25, 2020, thorough PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, CNKI, CBM, China Science, Wan Fang, and SciELO databases. The risk of COVID-19 infection in CRC patients was performed based on the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of six studies with 204 different cancer patients with COVID-19 and 92 CRC infected patients with COVID-19 were selected. Our results showed that the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in CRC patients was 45.1% in the global population. The pooled data showed that there is no a significant risk of infection with COVID-19 in CRC patients in the global population (OR = 0.261, 95% CI 0.099–0.533, p = 0.082).

The antibody positivity was highest in the >=50 and female age-group during all rounds of the serosurvey, while the decline was maximum among the younger age-group (5-17 years). On adjusted analysis, participants with lower per capita income, living in slums or overcrowded households, and those with diabetes comorbidity had significantly higher statistical odds of antibody positivity. Conclusions Despite high IgG seroprevalence, there was evidence for waning of antibody positivity with the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, implying a potential reduction in population immunity, especially if also associated with the lack of trained T cell immunity.","Sharma, N.; Sharma, P.; Basu, S.; Saxena, S.; Chawla, R.; Dushyant, K.; Mundeja, N.; Marak, Z.

Personality traits of 248 Slovak persons were assessed twice before the pandemic using the Big Five Inventory 2. Behavioral and emotional responses to the pandemic were collected during the first and second pandemic wave (April and September 2020). The results showed a statistically significant decrease in all response domains and in COVID-19 fear between the first and the second pandemic wave, suggesting that psychological adaptation to the pandemic occurred during the interim period. The results identified several meaningful links between the traits and pandemic-related behavior and emotions, especially for neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. However, the effects of personality were higher for the first pandemic wave, suggesting that these effects vary across time probably because of changes in pandemic perception in the society.","Kohút, Michal; Kohútová, Veronika; Halama, Peter",Pers Individ Dif,104,9

PURPOSE: Integrating smart pumps with an electronic health record (EHR) reduces medication errors by automating pump programming and EHR documentation. This study describes the patient safety and financial impact of pump-EHR interoperability at a community hospital. METHODS: A 316-bed community hospital in Sugar Land, TX, went live with pump-EHR interoperability in October 2019. Data were collected from April 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019 (before implementation) and from April 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020 (after implementation). Rates of drug library compliance, alert firing, alert override, override within 2 seconds, high-risk alert override, and alert resulting in pump reprogramming were measured. Financial impact was measured by Current Procedural Terminology code capture per kept appointment in the infusion center. RESULTS: Drug library compliance increased from 73.8% to 82.9% with pump-EHR interoperability (P < 0.001). Infusions generating alerts among all infusions programmed with the drug library decreased from 3.5% to 2.6% (P < 0.001), overridden alerts increased from 64.8% to 68.9% (P < 0.001), alerts overridden within 2 seconds decreased from 17.3% to 13.8% (P < 0.001), and reprogrammed alerts decreased from 20.7% to 18.3% (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Pump-EHR interoperability leads to safer administration of intravenous medications based on improved drug library compliance and more accurate smart pump programming.","Wei, Wenfei; Coffey, William; Adeola, Mobolaji; Abbasi, Ghalib",Am. j. health system pharm,104,16

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) was used to evaluate parents’ use of coercive, indulgent, structured, and autonomy supportive food parenting practices before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among a diverse racial/ethnic sample (n = 72) of parents of preschool-aged children. The impact of parent and child mood/behavior on use of specific food parenting practices was also evaluated during both time periods. Results revealed that most parents of preschoolers use a variety of food parenting practices, including coercive control, indulgence, structure, and autonomy support practices. The use of structured and autonomy supportive practices, however, decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the types of practices used by parents were contextually associated with the mood of the parent as well as child mood. Parent negative mood during COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of coercive control and indulgence and lower levels of structure, whereas child positive child mood was associated with greater use of autonomy supportive practices. These findings suggest that effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on family dynamics around feeding young children include shifts away from theoretically supportive approaches to parenting and highlight the roles of parent and child mood/behavior as potentially important momentary influences on food parenting during this time. Public health practitioners and clinicians working with parents of young children during COVID-19, and in years to come, should consider the potential impact of parental mood and stress, as well as child mood and behaviors. Additional research is needed to better understand how to best help parents maintain supportive feeding practices in the face of challenging situations.","Loth, K.A.; Ji, Z.; Wolfson, J.; Berge, J.M.; Neumark-Sztainer, D.; Fisher, J.O.",Appetite,104,16

Exercises provide an opportunity for multiple sectors to practice, test and evaluate their response to all types of public health emergencies. The information from these exercises can be used to refine and improve preparedness plans. There is a growing body of literature about the use of exercises among local, state and federal public health agencies in the United States. There is much less information about the use of exercises among public health agencies in other countries and the use of exercises that involve multiple countries. RESULTS: We developed and conducted 12 exercises (four sub-national, five national, three sub-regional) from August 2006 through December 2008. These 12 exercises included 558 participants (average 47) and 137 observers (average 11) from 14 countries. Participants consistently rated the overall quality of the exercises as very good or excellent. They rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identifying key gaps in performance. The vast majority of participants noted that they would use the information they gained at the exercise to improve their organization’s preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic. Participants felt the exercises were particularly good at raising awareness and understanding about public health threats, assisting in evaluating plans and identifying priorities for improvement, and building relationships that strengthen preparedness and response across sectors and across countries. Participants left the exercises with specific ideas about the most important actions that they should engage in after the exercise such as improved planning coordination across sectors and countries and better training of health workers and response personnel. CONCLUSIONS: These experiences suggest that exercises can be a valuable, low-burden tool to improve emergency preparedness and response in countries around the world. They also demonstrate that countries can work together to develop and conduct successful exercises designed to improve regional preparedness to public health threats. The development of standardized evaluation methods for exercises may be an additional tool to help focus the actions to be taken as a result of the exercise and to improve future exercises. Exercises show great promise as tools to improve public health preparedness across sectors and countries.","Dausey, David J; Moore, Melinda",BMC Res Notes,104,20

Autoreactive T lymphocytes directed against myelin components seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that molecular mimicry between viral and self‐antigens might be one of the mechanisms that determine the onset of several autoimmune diseases. Following this hypothesis, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate if HHV‐6 could play a role in activating T cells capable of cross‐reaction with an important myelin component, the myelin basic protein. T cell lines were established from 22 multiple sclerosis patients and from 16 healthy controls, and their capability to react to both virus and myelin basic protein antigens was compared. The analysis of T cell cross‐reactivity in patients and controls did not show significant differences in the HHV‐6 ability to activate myelin basic protein‐reactive T cells. Similarly, the evaluation of the humoral immune response to HHV‐6 in patients and controls did not mirror any abnormality in the HHV‐6 status in multiple sclerosis patients. Therefore, although the findings of activity in vitro of T cell lines with dual specificity are consistent with the hypothesis of molecular mimicry, the lack of differences in cross‐reactivity between patients and controls do not support molecular mimicry as an important mechanism in the physiopathology of this disease.

Leukocytes activated in an adaptive immune response access brain tissue by passing through the blood–brain barrier. The chemokine CCL5/RANTES is involved in recruitment of these cells to the brain acting via the receptors CCR1, CCR3 and mainly CCR5. Here, we evaluated the role of CCR5 on traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature, cellular and cytokines profile in a severe form of herpetic encephalitis. RESULTS: Wild type and mice lacking CCR5 (CCR5(-/-)) were inoculated intracerebrally with 10(4) PFU of neurotropic HSV-1. We evaluated the traffic of leukocytes in the brain microvasculature using intravital microscopy and the profile of cytokines by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay at 1 day post infection. Flow cytometry and histopathological analyses were also carried out in brain tissue. Absence of CCR5 leads to lower viral load and an increased leukocyte adhesion in brain microvasculature, predominantly of neutrophils (CD11(+) Ly6G(+) cells). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of MIP-1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, KC/CXCL1 and MIG/CXCL9 in the brain of infected CCR5(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the absence of CCR5 may boost the immune response with a high neutrophil recruitment which most likely helps in viral clearance. Nonetheless, the elevated immune response may be detrimental to the host.","Vilela, Márcia Carvalho; Lima, Graciela Kunrath; Rodrigues, David Henrique; Lacerda-Queiroz, Norinne; Pedroso, Vinicius Sousa Pietra; Miranda, Aline Silva; Rachid, Milene Alvarenga; Kroon, Erna Geessien; Campos, Marco Antônio; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Sellner, Johann; Teixeira, Antonio Lucio",BMC Neurosci,104,8

[32P]-complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were prepared by transcription of genomic RNA 1 and RNA 2 nucleotide sequences that had been cloned in a bacteriophage M13 vector. Probes that correspond to unique sequences near the 3′ ends of RNA 1 and RNA 2 revealed over 20 smaller RNAs. The subgenomic RNAs derived from each genomic RNA were analyzed more definitively by hybrid selection from total encapsidated RNA, using minus DNA clones derived from sequences in either RNA 1 or RNA 2, and a cDNA probe for the 3′ sequence conserved among all the genomic RNAs. Different patterns of over 20 minor RNA species, which were 3′-coterminal with RNAs 1 and 2, were detected, and they were reproducible irrespective of the host, cucumber orNicotiana clevelandii, from which the virus was isolated. The same RNA patterns were found in RNA extracted from the particulate fraction of CMV-infected cucumber orN. clevelandii. In order to determine whether the subgenomic RNAs could function as messenger RNAs, hybrid-selected RNAs were tested byin vitro translation, using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The subgenomic RNAs from RNA 1 produced over 10 major polypeptides from Mr 27,000 to Mr 90,000 all of which could be translated from a few RNA species over about 2,300 nucleotides long. The 3′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs derived from RNA 2 gave less than 10 products from Mr , 17,000 toMr 85,000. The smallest product (Mr 17,000) was produced by an RNA about 880 nucleotides long, whereas longer RNAs from 1400 to 2500 nucleotides were efficient mRNAs for polypeptides from Mr 30,000 up to the largest translation products consistent with the size of the RNA.","Gordon, Karl H.J.; Symons, Robert H.",Virology,104,1

The virus enters the host cell through molecular interaction with its enzymatic receptors i.e., ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which, if, synergistically blocked can lead to the development of novel drug candidates. In this study, 1503 natural bioactive compounds were screened by HTVS, followed by SP and XP docking using Schrodinger Maestro software. Bio-0357 (protozide) and Bio-597 (chrysin) were selected for dynamics simulation based on synergistic binding affinity on S1 (docking score −9.642 and −8.78 kcal/mol) and S2 domains (-5.83 and −5.3 kcal/mol), and the RMSD, RMSF and Rg analyses showed stable interaction. The DFT analysis showed that the adsorption of protozide/chrysin, the band gap of protozide/chrysin-F/G reduced significantly. From SERS, results, it can be concluded that QDs nanocluster will act as a sensor for the detection of drugs.

Our institution has treated over 2000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics including the persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52% of patients were male and 63% were non-White. Hypertension (64%), hyperlipidemia (62%), obesity (37%), diabetes mellitus (28%), chronic kidney disease (24%), and lung disease (21%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24%) died. Older age (> 70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p < 0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-White race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. The median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19–68) days from initial positive PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia was associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.

The subsequent loneliness and concerns of the pandemic during social distancing, quarantine, and lockdown are psychosocial stressors that negatively affect the immune system. These effects occur through mechanisms controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis that alter immune regulation, namely the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), which promotes inflammation and diminishes antiviral responses, leading to inadequate protection against viral disease. Unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and mental health consequences of COVID-19 add to the pathological effects of loneliness, making immunity against this lethal virus an even tougher fight. Therefore, social isolation, with its unintended consequences, has inherently paradoxical effects on immunity in relation to viral disease. Though this paradox can present a challenge, its acknowledgment can serve as an opportunity to address the associated issues and find ways to mitigate the adverse effects. In this review, we aim to explore, in detail, the pathological effects of the new social norms on immunity and present suggested methods to improve our physical, psychological, and healthcare abilities to fight a viral infection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pourriyahi, Homa; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",J Neuroimmunol,104,16

While gNO has been shown, in vitro, to be an effective antibacterial agent (at 160 ppm), NO-donor compounds have been shown to inhibit a variety of viruses at varying stages of replication. This research was done in order to determine whether gNO at 80 or 160 ppm possesses an antiviral effect on influenza viruses. Three strains of influenza (A and B) were exposed to gNO for up to 180 min, before and after infection of MDCK cells. In search for possible mechanism of antiviral action, Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay of H1N1 that was exposed to gNO was performed. Results show that when virions were exposed to gNO prior to infection a complete inhibition of infectivity was achieved for all three strains. Post infection exposure of influenza with gNO resulted in about 30% inhibition of infectivity. Further testing showed that when eliminating the pH effect by exposing a dried virus to gNO, 90% inhibition was found after 2 h exposure. NA activity, of whole dried H1N1 virus, was found to be inhibited by gNO (80%). These results suggest that 80 and 160 ppm gNO have a time dependent antiviral effect on influenza strains of viruses during various stages of cellular infection, which are not due to concomitant changes in pH in the surrounding milieu. Viral NA inhibition by gNO was shown and may be responsible for this antiviral effect.","Regev-Shoshani, Gilly; Vimalanathan, Selvarani; McMullin, Bevin; Road, Jeremy; Av-Gay, Yossef; Miller, Chris",Nitric Oxide,104,16

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed in nasopharyngeal swab samples from 12 patients with age < 60 years-old admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) in February 2021. RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2021, the median age of patients admitted in the ICU decreased from 66 to 58 years (p<0.05), accompanied by an increased proportion of patients without comorbidities (15.32% vs 32.20%, p<0.0001). A significant reduction in the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests was observed in the second wave (p<0.0001). Sequencing analysis detected lineage Gamma in all 12 ICU patients sampled in February 2021. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an increased proportion of younger adults without comorbidities with severe disease during the second COVID-19 wave, shortly after the confirmation of local Gamma circulation.","Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; Gräf, Tiago; Barcia, Camila Araújo de Lorenzo; Costa, Vanessa Ferreira; de Oliveira, Janderson Lopes; Passos, Rogério da Hora; Bastos, Iasmin Nogueira; de Santana, Maria Clara Brito; Santos, Ian Marinho; de Sousa, Karoline Almeida Felix; Weber, Thamires Gomes Lopes; de Siqueira, Isadora Cristina; Rocha, Clarissa Araújo Gurgel; Mendes, Ana Verena Almeida; Souza, Bruno Solano de Freitas",Int J Infect Dis,104,1

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 547 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were used to calibrate the model parameters using non-linear least squares methods. We analyze the changes on the TR and effective reproduction number as a function of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states as well as population movement. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions, and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","Jorge, D.

A diagnosis of hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis is made ultimately via histopathologic evaluation of hepatic tissue. • The mechanisms of hepatocellular injury in animals with hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis are poorly understood. Elucidation of these mechanisms may provide the basis for future therapeutic options. • Successful treatment of the patient with hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis involves addressing the underlying disease or inciting cause and providing aggressive symptomatic therapy and supportive care.","Rondeau, Mark P.",Small Animal Critical Care Medicine,104,1

The intestinal tract is the only extrapulmonary site where viable viruses have been detected. This study examined seven established human intestinal cell lines, DLD‐1, HCT‐116, HT‐29, LoVo, LS‐180, SW‐480 and SW‐620, for their permissiveness to SARS‐CoV infection. The results showed that only LoVo cells were permissive to SARS‐CoV infection as evident by positive findings from indirect immunofluorescence staining for intracellular viral antigens, in situ hybridization for intracellular viral RNA, and electron microscopy for intracellular viral particles. In contrast to Vero cells, SARS‐CoV did not produce cytopathic effects on LoVo cells. However, LoVo cells were found to be highly permissive for productive infection with a high viral titre (>3 × 10(7) viral copies/ml) produced in culture supernatant following a few days of incubation. SARS‐CoV established a stable persistent chronic infection that could be maintained after multiple passages. Being a cell line of human origin, LoVo cells could be a useful in vitro model for studying the biology and persistent infection of SARS‐CoV. Our results on the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently identified cellular receptor for SARS‐CoV, in these cell lines indicated that it might not be the sole determinant for cells to be susceptible to SARS‐CoV infection.

Nevertheless, recent evidence found that a subset of children then developed a significant systemic inflammatory response that resembles atypical/typical Kawasaki’s disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome. This novel clinical syndrome later identified as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). In contrast with KD, PIMS-TS appears to occur in children at an older age with a predominance of gastrointestinal symptoms, hemodynamic instability, and myocardial dysfunction. However, the exact pathomechanism remains to be understood. Nevertheless, the post-viral immunological reaction is postulated to be the underlying mechanistic underpinnings. The multifaceted nature of the PIMS-TS’ course underlines the need for early recognition and multispecialty care and management.","Lawrensia, Sherly; Henrina, Joshua; Wijaya, Ellen; Suciadi, Leonardo Paskah; Saboe, Aninka; Cool, Charlotte Johanna",SN Compr Clin Med,104,16

This inter-species crossing is promoted by various circumstances: environmental and climatic variations, bioterrorism, evolutive potential of the virus, etc. Screening for the animal reservoir is extremely important to prevent re-emergence and to eradicate the disease.
