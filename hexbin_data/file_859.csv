64488,"Beyond flu: Trends in respiratory infection outbreaks in Ontario healthcare settings from 2007 to 2017, and implications for non-influenza outbreak management.",2021-06-09,"In 2020, research entities at the Institut Pasteur (IP) in Paris, as elsewhere around the world, were closed because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, IP core facilities, laboratories, services, and departments working on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and priority projects were authorized to continue working both on site and remotely. Given the importance of its role in SARS-CoV-2 genome-sequencing initiatives, the IP Biomics core facility was fully functional during the first (i.e., March-June 2020) and second (i.e., November-December 2020) national lockdowns. We describe here how Biomics successfully implemented an emergency management plan to deal with this health crisis. We highlight the internal deployment of the institutional business continuity plan (BCP) through a series of actions. We also address the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Biomics staff and collaborators. The added value of quality management and the limitations of risk management systems are discussed. Finally, we suggest that the Biomics infrastructure and the BCP described here could be used for benchmarking purposes, for other next-generation sequencing core facilities wishing to implement/improve their processes, and for future major crisis management.","Najjar, Imène; Motreff, Laurence; Ma, Laurence; Lemée, Laure; Briolat, Valérie; Monot, Marc",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,https://doi.org/10.7171/jbt.21-3202-004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140839/,859

Cholesterol cannot pass the blood brain barrier and be imported or exported, instead it is synthesised in situ and metabolised to oxysterols, oxidised forms of cholesterol, which can pass the blood brain barrier. 24S-Hydroxycholesterol is the dominant oxysterol in brain after parturition but during development a myriad of other oxysterols are produced which persist as minor oxysterols after birth. During both development and in later life, oxysterols and other sterols interact with a variety of different receptors, including nuclear receptors, membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors, the oxysterol/sterol sensing proteins INSIG and SCAP, and the ligand-gated ion channel N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors found in nerve cells. In this review we summarise the different oxysterols and sterols found in the central nervous system whose biological activity is transmitted via these different classes of protein receptors.","Wang, Yuqin; Yutuc, Eylan; Griffiths, William J",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621622/,859
70629,Fake news and science denier attacks on vaccines. What can you do?,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND This study investigated the characteristics of corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) of the anterior surface, posterior surface, and total cornea in adolescents with mild to moderate myopia. METHODS A total of 183 patients with myopia (183 eyes) aged 8 to 18 years were enrolled in this study. The axial length (AL) of the eyes was measured by an IOL-Master, and corneal curvatures (K-values) and HOAs were measured by a Pentacam anterior segment diagnostic analyzer. RESULTS Results of this study showed that the anterior, posterior and total corneal horizontal coma Z31 were - 0.1249 ± 0.105 μm, 0.0009 ± 0.001 μm, and - 0.1331 ± 0.116 μm, respectively; the anterior, posterior and total corneal vertical coma Z3- 1 were - 0.0212 ± 0.164 μm, 0.0003 ± 0.043 μm, and - 0.0216 ± 0.168 μm, respectively; and spherical aberration (SA) Z40 values were 0.2244 ± 0.091 μm, 0.1437 ± 0.029 um, and 0.1889 ± 0.090 μm, respectively. Total corneal Z31 was statistically correlated with posterior corneal astigmatism (K2b - K1b) (p = 0.038). Total corneal Z3- 1 was correlated with anterior corneal astigmatism (K2f - K1f) (p = 0.027). Anterior, posterior, and total corneal Z40 were correlated with anterior and posterior corneal curvature (K1f, K2f, K1b, K2b) (p = 0.001). Posterior corneal Z40b was also significantly correlated with AL. CONCLUSIONS In adolescents with mild to moderate myopia, the posterior corneal surface shape may play a compensatory role in the balance of corneal aberrations, and the posterior corneal SA tended to become less negative as the AL increased. The corneal coma may also play a compensatory role in posterior corneal surface astigmatism, which was valuable for the treatment for improving visual quality. This conclusion still needs to be verified.","Zhang, Xu; Ma, Jin-Hui; Xi, Xin; Guan, Lin",BMC ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12886-020-01727-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243174/,859

This exploratory study is part of a larger mixed methods survey project, reporting the qualitative data from an on-line survey of clinical staff working at one acute hospital between April 16th and May 13th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to five free-text questions were analysed using inductive content analysis. 321 medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff responded to the survey. Respondents reported anxiety, fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, from the perspectives of work, home, family and community. They reported feeling confused by inconsistent messages received from government, hospital executive, managers and media. Seven themes were identified: (i) worrying about patient care, (ii) changed working conditions, (iii) working in the changed hospital environment, (iv) impact of the pandemic, (v) personal isolation and uncertainty, (vi) leadership and management and (vii) additional support needed for staff. Despite the pandemic being comparatively well-controlled in Australia, all disciplines reported a high degree of anticipatory anxiety. Staff working in healthcare require both managerial and psychological support to minimise anxiety and promote well-being and resilience in order to deal with the health crisis. Regular unambiguous communication directing the way forward is crucial.","Digby, Robin; Winton-Brown, Toby; Finlayson, Felicity; Dobson, Hannah; Bucknall, Tracey",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098222/,859

It was shown that recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-S) downregulates ACE2 expression and thereby promotes lung injury. Whether NL63-S exerts a similar activity is yet unknown. We found that recombinant SARS-S bound to ACE2 and induced ACE2 shedding with higher efficiency than NL63-S. Shedding most likely accounted for the previously observed ACE2 downregulation but was dispensable for viral replication. Finally, SARS-CoV but not NL63 replicated efficiently in ACE2-positive Vero cells and reduced ACE2 expression, indicating robust receptor interference in the context of SARS-CoV but not NL63 infection.","Glowacka, Ilona; Bertram, Stephanie; Herzog, Petra; Pfefferle, Susanne; Steffen, Imke; Muench, Marcus O; Simmons, Graham; Hofmann, Heike; Kuri, Thomas; Weber, Friedemann; Eichler, Jutta; Drosten, Christian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01248-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19864379/,859

100015,Ethics check-up of public health immunization programs in Canada.,2021-05-07,"Implementation of lung screening (LS) programs is challenging even among health care organizations that have the motivation, the resources, and more importantly, the goal of providing for life-saving early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. We provide a case study of LS implementation in different healthcare systems, at the Mount Sinai Healthcare System (MSHS) in New York City, and at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System (PVAHCS) in Phoenix, Arizona. This will illustrate the commonalities and differences of the LS implementation process in two very different health care systems in very different parts of the United States. Underlying the successful implementation of these LS programs was the use of a comprehensive management system, the Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) Management SystemTM. The collaboration between MSHS and PVAHCS over the past decade led to the ELCAP Management SystemTM being gifted by the Early Diagnosis and Treatment Research Foundation to the PVAHCS, to develop a ""VA-ELCAP"" version. While there remain challenges and opportunities to continue improving LS and its implementation, there is an increasing realization that most patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer as a result of annual LS can be cured, and that of all the possible risks associated with LS, the greater risk of all is for heavy cigarette smokers not to be screened. We identified 10 critical components in implementing a LS program. We provided the details of each of these components for the two healthcare systems. Most importantly, is that continual re-evaluation of the screening program is needed based on the ongoing quality assurance program and database of the actual screenings. At minimum, there should be an annual review and updating. As early diagnosis of lung cancer must be followed by optimal treatment to be effective, treatment advances for small, early lung cancers diagnosed as a result of screening also need to be assessed and incorporated into the entire screening and treatment program.","Henschke, Claudia I; Yankelevitz, David F; Jirapatnakul, Artit; Yip, Rowena; Reccoppa, Vivian; Benjamin, Charlene; Llamo, Tserling; Williams, Angel; Liu, Simon; Max, Daniel; Aguayo, Samuel M; Morales, Providencia; Igel, Brian J; Abbaszadegan, Hamed; Fredricks, Peter A; Garcia, Daniel P; Permana, Paska A; Fawcett, Janet; Sultan, Samir; Murphy, Lorenza A",Translational lung cancer research,https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-20-761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718045/,859
100117,Increased risk of endemic mosquito-borne diseases in Canada due to climate change.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Molecular testing such as nasopharyngeal viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (NVP) is available now in most hospitals and widely used to identify respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective multicenter study at 8 hospitals from March 1, 2016, to April 30, 2019. We included all adult SOT recipients who were admitted to the hospitals and had their first NVP post transplantation. RESULTS A total of 102 adult SOT recipients were enrolled. NVP test was positive in 33 (32.4%) SOT recipients and negative in 69 (67.6%). Median age was more than 60 years old with female predominance in both groups. The majority of patients who had positive NVP were hospitalized either in fall or winter seasons (91%). RVI symptoms were documented in about 73% of the positive NVP group. Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (48.4%). On logistic regression analysis, clinical presentation in fall or winter seasons, presenting with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms and taking prednisone ≥10 mg/d were significantly associated with positive NVP. This model classified patients into 3 categories of risk for RVIs-low (none of the variables), 0%; intermediate (1 variable), 6.5%; and high (≥2 variables), 55.4% with P < .001 for all predictors. CONCLUSION SOT recipients who are taking prednisone (≥10 mg) and have URI symptoms in fall or winter seasons are more likely to have RVIs.","Samannodi, Mohammed; Vaghefi-Hosseini, Reza; Nigo, Masayuki; Guevara, Eduardo Yepez; Hasbun, Rodrigo",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272649/,859
121646,Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute cancer-related stroke: is the stent retriever alone effective?,2020-06-25,"BACKGROUND Lobectomy using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) still is a controversial operation despite its many observed benefits. The controversy may be due to difficulties performing the procedure. This study addresses a standardized anterior approach facilitating the operation. METHODS This report describes 156 VATS lobectomies performed with a uniform anterior three-port technique. The surgeon and the assistant stand on the abdominal side of the patient, and the setup is independent of the lobe to be resected. RESULTS From 2005 to 2007, 156 VATS lobectomies and 13 conversions (7.7%) were performed with an anterior three-port technique. No mortality occurred among the VATS lobectomies during a 30-day period. The major comorbidity rate was 78%. The comorbidities included former thoracic surgery (9%) or a history of another cancer (22%), indicating potentially difficult surgery and a nonselected population. The majority (92%) of the patients had lung cancer. The major postoperative problem was air leakage, which usually prolongs the tube time and the in-hospital stay, but a ""no-touch fissure"" technique significantly reduced the median tube time to 4 days and the postoperative hospital stay to 5 days. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that VATS lobectomies can be performed using a standardized anterior approach with low rates of conversion and morbidity. A ""no-touch fissure"" technique lowers the postoperative tube time, the in-hospital stay, and the number of patients with prolonged air leakage. A uniform anterior approach facilitates VATS lobectomy and makes this advanced procedure more easily adaptable by many surgeons familiar with an open anterior approach. The findings show that VATS lobectomy can be performed safely for a large proportion of lung cancer patients.","Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Petersen, René Horsleben; Christensen, Merete",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1355-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20927543/,859
136338,Managing pain and fear: Playing your CARDs to improve the vaccination experience.,2021-01-29,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often leads to aggressive local recurrence and increased metastasis, and vascular integrity and platelets are implicated in tumor metastasis. However, whether interactions between endothelial cells and platelets induce endothelial permeability in HCC after insufficient RFA remains unclear. Here, significantly increased CD62P-positive platelets and sP-selectin in plasma are observed in HCC patients after RFA, and tumor-associated endothelial cells (TAECs) activate platelets and are susceptible to permeability after heat treatment in the presence of platelets in vitro. In addition, tumors exhibit enhanced vascular permeability after insufficient RFA in mice; heat treatment promotes platelets-induced endothelial permeability through vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and ICAM-1 upregulation in TAECs after heat treatment results in platelet activation and increased endothelial permeability in vitro. Moreover, the binding interaction between upregulated ICAM-1 and Ezrin downregulates VE-cadherin expression. Furthermore, platelet depletion or ICAM-1 inhibition suppresses tumor growth and metastasis after insufficient RFA in an orthotopic tumor mouse model, and vascular permeability decreases in ICAM-1-/- mouse tumor after insufficient RFA. The findings suggest that ICAM-1 activates platelets and promotes endothelial permeability in TAECs through VE-cadherin after insufficient RFA, and anti-platelet and anti-ICAM-1 therapy can be used to prevent progression of HCC after insufficient RFA.","Kong, Jian; Yao, Changyu; Dong, Shuying; Wu, Shilun; Xu, Yangkai; Li, Ke; Ji, Liang; Shen, Qiang; Zhang, Qi; Zhan, Rui; Cui, Hongtu; Zhou, Changping; Niu, Haigang; Li, Guoming; Sun, Wenbing; Zheng, Lemin",Advanced science,https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202002228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643788/,859
144711,Climate change and infectious diseases: What can we expect?,2019,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To provide an overview of available electrical stimulation devices in neurogenic patients with lower urinary tract disease. RECENT FINDINGS It is advocated to do more studies in neurogenic patients as results seem promising and useful but most studies did not include neurogenic patients or neurogenic patients were not analyzed or reported separately. Most studies included a small heterogenous neurogenic group with multiple pathophysiologic origin focusing on effect of a treatment instead of results of a treatment in a specific neurogenic group. Neuromodulation or stimulation has the advantage that it acts on different organs, like bladder and bowel, so can treat neurogenic patients, who mostly suffer from multiple organ failure. SUMMARY Brindley procedure, sacral neuromodulation (SNM) and posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) are available for a while already. The Brindley procedure (including sacral anterior root stimulation in combination with a rhizotomy of posterior sacral roots) is developed for selected spinal cord injury patient with a complete spinal injury, and has shown results for many years in neurogenic patients. An alternative to the rhizotomy is not established yet. SNM and PTNS are other modalities that are used in nonneurogenic patients, but are not yet indicated and much studied in neurogenic patients.","Martens, F M J; Sievert, K-D",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427629/,859

METHODS This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 ) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was ≤100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 μg/dL. RESULTS A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly. The median BMI was 30.1 (24.7-32.1) kg/m2 , with 59.9% (161 of 269) of patients having overweight and obesity. The prevalence of low zinc levels was 79.6% (214 of 269) and severe ARDS was 56.5% (152 of 269). There was an association of low zinc levels and severe ARDS (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% CI, 6.2-33.5; P < .001), even after adjusting for baseline variables (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 6.5-36.3; P < .001).

Women from a mid-sized Canadian university women (N = 248, Mage = 21.52) completed measures of menstrual pain severity, chronic pain severity, somatic symptoms severity, and the presence of comorbid CSS. Pearson's correlations assessed the relationship between severity of dysmenorrhea, chronic pain, and somatic symptoms. MANOVA procedures assessed the interaction between dysmenorrhea and chronic pain and χ2 analyses were used to test the frequency of CSS among women with dysmenorrhea. Higher ratings of menstrual symptom severity were associated with increased chronic pain severity (r =.66, p <.001), and somatic symptom severity (r =.66, p <.001). Women with dysmenorrhea were not more likely to experience chronic pain, but were more likely to report a CSS, χ2 (1) = 5.12, p <.05.

Design/methodology/approach: It considers the range of frauds and their reporting lags and examines what is known about current frauds against individuals, businesses and government, principally using public and private sector data from Australia and the UK. Findings: The study identifies some novel crime types and methodologies arising during the current pandemic that were not seen in previous pandemics. These changes may result from public health measures taken in response to COVID-19, the current state of technologies and the activities of law enforcement and regulatory guardians. It shows that many frauds would occur anyway, but some specific – mainly online – frauds occur during pandemics, and because of large scale government assistance programmes to businesses and individuals, far more opportunities were created from COVID-19 than in previous eras. Social implications: The study concludes with a discussion of the policy implications for prevention, resilience and for private and public policing and criminal justice. It stresses that plans for future pandemics must include provisions for better early monitoring and control of fraud and associated procurement corruption and notes that these require greater political will and organisation. It recommends a more serious analysis of the impact of prevention communications outreach to citizens, businesses and government.

Analysis of the sequences around 40 unique recombination sites reveals several features that differ significantly from those expected of randomly located sites. These features, which include a broad zone of elevated homology on the 3' side of the cross-over, support the theory that RNA recombination occurs by a template-switching mechanism during synthesis of the complementary strand, and that sites are chosen to minimise the adverse free energy change involved in switching to a heterotypic template. There is also a strong sequence bias, almost two-thirds of cross-overs, according to a computer simulation, occurring immediately after synthesis of UU.

CoVs enter target cells through fusion of viral and cellular membranes mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein S. We have determined by x-ray crystallography the structure of a proteolytically stable core fragment from the heptad repeat (HR) regions HR1 and HR2 of the SARS-CoV S protein. We have also determined the structure of an HR1-HR2 S core fragment, containing a shorter HR1 peptide and a C-terminally longer HR2 peptide that extends up to the transmembrane region. In these structures, three HR1 helices form a parallel coiled-coil trimer, whereas three HR2 peptides pack in an oblique and antiparallel fashion into the coiled-coil hydrophobic grooves, adopting mixed extended and alpha-helical conformations as in postfusion paramyxoviruses F proteins structures. Our structure positions a previously proposed internal fusion peptide adjacent to the N-terminus of HR1. Peptides from the HR2 region of SARS-CoV S have been shown to inhibit viral entry and infection in vitro. The structures presented here can thus open the path to the design of small-molecule inhibitors of viral entry and candidate vaccine antigens against this virus.","Supekar, Vinit M; Bruckmann, Chiara; Ingallinella, Paolo; Bianchi, Elisabetta; Pessi, Antonello; Carfí, Andrea",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15604146/,859

Additionally, because several different electrode montages were used in previous studies, it is difficult to know how stimulation should be applied to achieve this effect. Our objective was to determine whether active-tDCS alters cortical excitability of the LE and ankle tracking accuracy relative to sham-tDCS in healthy participants. The efficacy of two electrode montages and two conductance mediums were compared. Methods A triple-blind, fully randomized, within-subjects study was conducted with healthy participants (N=18, 24.2 (6.6) years). Cortical recruitment curves and measures of ankle tracking accuracy for the dominant lower extremity were obtained before and after participants received active-tDCS at 2 milliamps for 20 minutes using montage-medium combinations of M1-SO:Saline, M1-SO:Gel, C1-C2:Saline, and C1-C2:Gel and a sham-tDCS condition (M1-SO: Saline). Results The motor evoked potential maximum of the recruitment curve was significantly lower for active than sham-tDCS, but only for the M1-SO:Saline combination. No other significant differences in the recruitment curve parameters or in ankle tracking were found. Conclusions This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate a significant difference in cortical excitability of the LE between active and sham-tDCS conditions. Given the order in which the experimental procedures occurred, the result is consistent with the concept of a homeostatic plasticity response.","Floyd, John Tyler; Lairamore, Chad; Garrision, Mark Kevin; Woods, Adam J; Rainey, Jacqueline L; Kiser, Thomas; Padala, Prasad R; Mennemeier, Mark",Frontiers in neurology and neuroscience research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274350/,859

190790,[Clinical features of 96 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome from a hospital outbreak].,2003,"The aim of this study was to further investigate the pathogenesis and epidemiology of feline coronavirus (FCoV)-infections and among others to determine the prognostic value of a positive result in the RT-PCR for FCoV in serum samples collected from cats with abdominal signs. Viral RNA was isolated from 100 microl of serum and subsequently amplified by a nested RT-PCR using primers binding to a highly conserved region of the 3'-end of the FCoV-genome. Sixty-three serum samples collected from 62 cats with abdominal signs were examined by RT-PCR and the clinical outcome was followed up. Four of these cats with a positive PCR-result are healthy more than 70 months after the collection of the blood sample. It can be concluded that viremia with FCoV does not necessarily lead to FIP and death. With respect to diagnosing FIP, a positive FCoV-RT-PCR is of low prognostic and diagnostic value. It can not be recommended to use this assay as sole indication to euthanize cats. Further studies will have to be carried out to demonstrate if the prognostic and diagnostic value of this PCR-assay in other samples such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells is more reliable. However, this method was found to be an important tool to further study the pathogenesis and epidemiology of FIP.","Fehr, D; Bolla, S; Herrewegh, A A; Horzinek, M C; Lutz, H",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8720731/,859

To get further insight into the replicase gene-encoded functions, we characterized the coronavirus X domain, which is part of nsp3 and has been predicted to be an ADP-ribose-1""-monophosphate (Appr-1""-p) processing enzyme. Bacterially expressed forms of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus X domains were shown to dephosphorylate Appr-1""-p, a side product of cellular tRNA splicing, to ADP-ribose in a highly specific manner. The enzyme had no detectable activity on several other nucleoside phosphates. Guided by the crystal structure of AF1521, an X domain homolog from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, potential active-site residues of the HCoV-229E X domain were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that the HCoV-229E replicase polyprotein residues, Asn 1302, Asn 1305, His 1310, Gly 1312, and Gly 1313, are part of the enzyme's active site. Characterization of an Appr-1""-pase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer, and no reversion to the wild-type sequence was observed when the mutant virus was passaged in cell culture. The apparent dispensability of the conserved X domain activity in vitro indicates that coronavirus replicase polyproteins have evolved to include nonessential functions. The biological significance of the novel enzymatic activity in vivo remains to be investigated.","Putics, Akos; Filipowicz, Witold; Hall, Jonathan; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16188975/,859

This information is fundamental to husbandry and management practices for captive animals and for support of in situ conservation efforts. Serial blood samples were collected over an 8-yr period to evaluate patterns in hematology and serum biochemistry values among five Sumatran rhinoceroses housed at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Way Kambas National Park, Lampung, Indonesia. Understanding the basis for variance in analytes both within and between subjects can allow use of more sensitive subject-based reference values, and is particularly suitable for small populations of endangered animals. Both intra- and intersubject variability was computed for each analyte and the associated index of individuality was determined. Previously published cutoff points for index of individuality indicate where population-based reference intervals can be used with confidence (index > 1.4) or with caution (0.6 < index < 1.4). Interrhino variability was small for the majority of analytes, with 12 of 19 analytes having an index of individuality greater than 1.4 and none having an index of individuality less than 0.6. With the high within-individual variability of most anayltes in the Sumatran rhinoceroses at the sanctuary, subject-based reference intervals offer little advantage over standard population-based reference intervals for monitoring the health of these endangered animals. Differences were noted (but not tested for statistical significance) in serum urea, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cholesterol between young and old rhinoceroses, and in hematocrit, AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), LDH, and glucose between male and female rhinoceroses. Husbandry practices, animal management, nutrition and habitat factors may also impact hematology and biochemistry results, and these relationships deserve more careful investigation. This study represents the most comprehensive hematology and serum biochemistry comparison of Sumatran rhinoceroses held in natural rainforest conditions outside a traditional zoological setting.","Andriansyah,; Candra, Dedi; Riyanto, Marcellus A C T; Barry, Jason; Radcliffe, Robin W",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805545/,859
193888,MERS-CoV- Low risk to Canadians.,2014,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the ultrastructure of rat thymus tissues with rat coronavirus (RCV) infection for clarifying the mechanism responsible for the morphological changes of the cells infected by RCV. METHODS Routine electron microscopy was performed for observing RCV-infected rat thymus tissues. RESULTS Following RCV infection, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pools of different dimensions were observed in the cytoplasm of the thymic epithelial reticular cells, merging subsequently with each other into larger ER lakes filled with particles of mature RCV, or viral inclusion bodies. After germination on the ER membrane, the viruses entered the matrix of the ER lake to mature and were eventually excreted to the extracellular space. The RCV particles were spherical in shape with a diameter of 100-130 nm and two distinct membranes, the outer one being the envelope and the inner one the nuclear capsid to enclose the viroplasm. Between the envelop and nuclear capsid was a electron-lucent middle layer comprising one to two thin membranous structures. Large quantity of short spike-like projections starting from the nucleus capsid penetrated the middle layer and the envelop to reach the glycoprotein coat and formed a corona-like structure. Mature RCV particles were distributed around the ER pools, cytoplasm, and intercellular space, and the RCVs in the endosome/lysosome were devoid of the envelop and nuclear capsid. CONCLUSION The ER lakes are involved in the maturation of the viruses, and the envelop and nuclear capsid of the virus entering the cells from extracellular space are removed and degraded in the endosome/lysosome. Replications of virus occurs in plasma of the thymic epithelial reticular cells, and no RCV can be detected in the thymocytes.","Piao, Ying-jie; Xu, Xi-jin; Piao, Zhong-xiao",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12754115/,859

Primary outcomes were safety, patient satisfaction, reduction of hospital stay, and cost-effectiveness. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHOD All COVID-19 patients who were discharged with home telemonitoring and oxygen therapy between June 1st and November 1st 2020 were included. Eligible patients had a maximum oxygen requirement of 2 liters per minute during the 24 hours prior to discharge with a minimal peripheral oxygen saturation of 94%. A mobile application for telemonitoring was used, which patients or relatives had to be able to use independently. Patient demographics, clinical parameters, data on telemonitoring and readmissions were extracted from the electronic patient records. A survey for patient satisfaction and a cost-effectiveness analysis were performed. RESULTS Out of 619 admissions, 49 patients were discharged with home telemonitoring and oxygen therapy. Median duration of home oxygen therapy was 11 days with a potential reduction in hospitalization of 616 days. Six patients were readmitted and were significantly more febrile on discharge (67% versus 14%, p=0.01) and had lower oxygenation (95%, (IQR 93-96) versus 96%, (IQR 95-97), p=0.02) with similar levels of oxygen administration. Patient satisfaction was high with a mean score of 5 to 6 on a scale measuring satisfaction from 1 to 7. Estimated total cost reduction was € 146.736. CONCLUSION This study shows that home telemonitoring and oxygen administration can be safely applied in COVID-19 patients resulting in a high patient satisfaction and reduction in hospital stay and costs.","van Herwerden, Michael C; van Steenkiste, Job; El Moussaoui, Rachida; den Hollander, Jan G; Helfrich, Gea; J A M Verberk, Iris",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720552/,859

We sought to understand the determinants of bystander CPR and the factors associated with successful training. METHODS For this systematic review, we searched 11 electronic databases, 1 trial registry and 9 scientific websites. We performed hand searches and contacted 6 content experts. We reviewed without restriction all communications pertaining to who should learn CPR, what should be taught, when to repeat training, where to give CPR instructions and why people lack the motivation to learn and perform CPR. We used standardized forms to review papers for inclusion, quality and data extraction. We grouped publications by category and classified recommendations using a standardized classification system that was based on level of evidence. RESULTS We reviewed 2409 articles and selected 411 for complete evaluation. We included 252 of the 411 papers in this systematic review. Differences in their study design precluded a meta-analysis. We classified 22 recommendations; those with the highest scores were 1) 9-1-1 dispatch- assisted CPR instructions, 2) teaching CPR to family members of cardiac patients, 3) Braslow's self-training video, 4) maximizing time spent using manikins and 5) teaching the concepts of ambiguity and diffusion of responsibility. Recommendations not supported by evidence include mass training events, pulse taking prior to CPR by laymen and CPR using chest compressions alone. CONCLUSION We evaluated and classified the potential impact of interventions that have been proposed to improve bystander CPR rates. Our results may help communities design interventions to improve their bystander CPR rates.","Vaillancourt, Christian; Stiell, Ian G; Wells, George A",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226319/,859

There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label. Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition. OBJECTIVES: In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use. Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility. RESULTS: The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific. All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements. There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice. CONCLUSION: There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive. Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational. Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.","Shojaei, Amirahmad; Salari, Pooneh",,,859

492015,Real-world assessment of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal swab testing in a region with a high burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"BACKGROUND : The International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) consensus guideline advises prophylactic gastrectomy in early adulthood to prevent gastric cancer development in CDH1 germline mutation carriers; psychosocial reasons may postpone gastrectomy. We analyzed the yield of signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) during surveillance gastroscopy in CDH1 mutation carriers. METHODS : A retrospective analysis on surveillance gastroscopies in CDH1 mutation carriers was performed. The yield of SRCC in both targeted and random biopsies was studied. Endoscopic (biopsy) results were compared with the histopathologic outcomes in gastrectomy specimens. RESULTS : 42 CDH1 mutation carriers (18 men; mean age 43, range 20-82 years) underwent 96 surveillance gastroscopies. SRCC lesions were identified on surveillance gastroscopy in 21 patients (50â%), by either targeted biopsies only (nâ=â11), random biopsies only (nâ=â3), or both random and targeted biopsies (nâ=â7). SRCC was detected in 41â/377 targeted biopsies (11â%), whereas random biopsies revealed SRCC in 14/1563 biopsies (0.9â%). At least one SRCC lesion was found in 26 of 30 gastrectomy specimens. In 18 of these 26 specimens (69â%), SRCC had been identified by endoscopic biopsies. Missed lesions were all small superficial SRCC foci, mainly in the body of the stomach. CONCLUSION : In our cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers, SRCC lesions were identified by an extensive endoscopic surveillance protocol in 69â% of SRCC-positive patients who underwent a gastric resection. The low number of SRCC detected through random sampling demands a critical reappraisal of random biopsy sampling in the IGCLC guideline.","van Dieren, Jolanda M; Kodach, Liudmila L; den Hartog, Peggy; van der Kolk, Lizet E; Sikorska, Karolina; van Velthuysen, Marie-Louise F; van Sandick, Johanna W; Koemans, Willem J; Snaebjornsson, Petur; Cats, Annemieke",Endoscopy,,859
502659,"Letter by Ren et al Regarding Article, ""Acute Heart Failure in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children in the Context of Global SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic""",2021,"Glutaredoxin, Grx, is a small protein containing an active site cysteine pair and was discovered in 1976 by Arne Holmgren. The Grx system, comprised of Grx, glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH, was first described as an electron donor for Ribonucleotide Reductase but, from the first discovery in E.coli, the Grx family has impressively grown, particularly in the last two decades. Several isoforms have been described in different organisms (from bacteria to humans) and with different functions. The unique characteristic of Grxs is their ability to catalyse glutathione-dependent redox regulation via glutathionylation, the conjugation of glutathione to a substrate, and its reverse reaction, deglutathionylation. Grxs have also recently been enrolled in iron sulphur cluster formation. These functions have been implied in various physiological and pathological conditions, from immune defense to neurodegeneration and cancer development thus making Grx a possible drug target. This review aims to give an overview on Grxs, starting by a phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate Grxs, followed by an analysis of the mechanisms of action, the specific characteristics of the different human isoforms and a discussion on aspects related to human physiology and diseases.","Ogata, Fernando T; Branco, Vasco; Vale, Filipa F; Coppo, Lucia",Redox Biol,,859

METHODS: We describe the key considerations of policies and processes that have been implemented in our nuclear medicine service since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Singapore General Hospital on 23 January 2020, up to the present time. RESULTS: Infection control, screening of patients and visitors, segregation of risk groups, segregation of staff and service continuity plans, communication and staff welfare, using electronic platforms for multi-disciplinary meetings and tele-reporting are discussed. CONCLUSION: Since our hospital received the first patient with COVID-19 in Singapore, our centre has managed 16 COVID-19 cases to date. There has not been any healthcare worker in our institution who has contracted COVID-19 through patient contact. We have highlighted for discussion some of the policies and processes to prepare a nuclear medicine service for the COVID-19 threat.","Lam, Winnie Wing-Chuen; Loke, Kelvin Siu-Hoong; Wong, Wai Yin; Ng, David Chee-Eng",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,,859

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1 × 10(9) and 1 × 10(10) VP elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers that was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these preclinical data confirm efficacy of a one-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.","van der Lubbe, Joan E.

668405,COVID-19 patients in earlier stages exhaled millions of SARS-CoV-2 per hour,2020-08-28,"Artificial intelligence surveillance can be used to diagnose individual cases, track the spread of Covid‐19, and help provide care. The use of AI for surveillance purposes (such as detecting new Covid‐19 cases and gathering data from healthy and ill individuals) in a pandemic raises multiple concerns ranging from privacy to discrimination to access to care. Luckily, there exist several frameworks that can help guide stakeholders, especially physicians but also AI developers and public health officials, as they navigate these treacherous shoals. While these frameworks were not explicitly designed for AI surveillance during a pandemic, they can be adapted to help address concerns regarding privacy, human rights, and due process and equality. In a time where the rapid implementation of all tools available is critical to ending a pandemic, physicians, public health officials, and technology companies should understand the criteria for the ethical implementation of AI surveillance.","Shachar, Carmel; Gerke, Sara; Adashi, Eli Y.",Hastings Cent Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596887/,859
