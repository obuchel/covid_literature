1628,Achieving compliance with the International Health Regulations by overseas territories of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,2014-11-01,"The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force for all Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2007 and the deadline for achieving compliance was June 2012. The purpose of the IHR is to prevent, protect against, control – and provide a public health response to – international spread of disease. The territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that of several other Member States, such as China, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United States of America, include overseas territories, which cover a total population of approximately 15 million people. Member States have a responsibility to ensure that all parts of their territory comply with the IHR. Since WHO has not provided specific guidance on compliance in the special circumstances of the overseas territories of Member States, compliance by these territories is an issue for self-assessment by Member States themselves. To date, no reports have been published on the assessment of IHR compliance in countries with overseas territories. We describe a gap analysis done in the United Kingdom to assess IHR compliance of its overseas territories. The findings and conclusions are broadly applicable to other countries with overseas territories which may have yet to assess their compliance with the IHR. Such assessments are needed to ensure compliance across all parts of a Member States’ territory and to increase global health security.","Hamblion, Esther L; Salter, Mark; Jones, Jane",Bull World Health Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4221769/,313

8421,Hajj: preparations underway,2013-10-16,"In this study, a comparative analysis of the codon usage bias was performed in Aeropyrum pernix K1 and two other phylogenetically related Crenarchaeota microorganisms (i.e., Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2 and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639). The results indicated that the synonymous codon usage in A. pernix K1 was less biased, which was highly correlated with the GC(3S) value. The codon usage patterns were phylogenetically conserved among these Crenarchaeota microorganisms. Comparatively, it is the species function rather than the gene function that determines their gene codon usage patterns. A. pernix K1, P. aerophilum str. IM2, and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 live in differently extreme conditions. It is presumed that the living environment played an important role in determining the codon usage pattern of these microorganisms. Besides, there was no strain-specific codon usage among these microorganisms. The extent of codon bias in A. pernix K1 and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 were highly correlated with the gene expression level, but no such association was detected in P. aerophilum str. IM2 genomes.","Jiang, Peng; Sun, Xiao; Lu, Zuhong",J Genet Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129909/,313
16044,The state inoculates: vaccines as soft power,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the long-term functional and structural pulmonary development in children with repaired congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and to identify the associated perinatal-neonatal risk factors. METHODS: Children with repaired CDH through corrective surgery who were born at gestational age ≥ 35 weeks were included in this analysis. Those who were followed for at least 5 years were subjected to spirometry and chest computed tomography for evaluation of their functional and structural growth. Main bronchus diameters and lung volumes (total, left/right) were measured. According to total lung volume (TLV) relative to body surface area, children were grouped into TLV ≥ 50 group and TLV < 50 group and the associations with perinatal-neonatal factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 28 children (mean age, 6.2 ± 0.2 years) with left-sided CDH, 7 (25%) had abnormal pulmonary function, of whom 6 (87%) showed restrictive patterns. All pulmonary functions except FEF25–75% were worse than those in matched healthy control group. Worse pulmonary function was significantly associated with small head and abdominal circumferences at birth. The mean TLV was 1339.1 ± 363.9 mL and LLV/TLV was 47.9 ± 2.5 mL. Children with abnormal pulmonary function were more likely to have smaller lung volumes. In multivariate analysis, abdominal circumference at birth was significantly associated with abnormal lung volume. CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of children with repaired CDH showed abnormal pulmonary function. Small abdominal circumference at birth was associated with abnormal pulmonary function and lower TLV.

56318,In this month’s Bulletin,2021-08-01,"As global temperatures continue to increase and human activities continue to expand, many countries and regions are witnessing the consequences of global climate change. Mongolia, a nomadic and picturesque landlocked country, has battled with ongoing desertification, recurring droughts, and increasingly frequent sandstorms in recent decades. Here we review the abrupt changes in the climate regime of Mongolia over the recent few decades, by focusing on atmospheric events, land degradation and desertification issues, and the resulted sandstorms. We found that between mid-March to mid-April 2021, the country encountered violent gusts of wind, the Mongolia cyclone, and the largest sandstorms in a decade, causing extensive damages nationwide and trans-regional impact in East Asia including northern China, Japan, and most parts of South Korea. A multitude of factors have contributed to this current ecological crisis. Since 1992, the country has transformed to a market economy with high economic growth driven by mineral and agricultural exports. Overgrazing along with intensified human activities such as coal mining has contributed to the widespread land degradation in Mongolia, while climate change has become a major driving factor for recurring droughts. Annual mean air temperature in Mongolia increased by 2.24 °C between 1940 and 2015, while annual precipitation decreased by 7%, resulting in a higher aridity across the country. A positive feedback loop between soil moisture deficits and surface warming has led to a hotter and drier climate in the region, with over a quarter of lakes greater than 1.0-km(2) dried up in the Mongolian Plateau between 1987 and 2010. Increased temperatures, decreased precipitation coupled with land degradation have resulted in a persisting drying trend, with more than three-quarters of land in Mongolia being affected by drought and desertification. The 2021 East Asia sandstorms drew international attention to ecological issues that have culminated for decades in Mongolia. Collaborative efforts from policy makers, local residents, and scientists from both its local and the global research community are urgently needed to address the grand and rapidly aggravating ecological challenges in Mongolia.","Han, Jie; Dai, Han; Gu, Zhaolin",Environ Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8302971/,313

121478,Slow progress in preparing for radiological and nuclear emergencies.,2011,"Hurricane Harvey (Harvey), a slow-moving storm, struck the Texas coast as a category 4 hurricane. Over the course of 53 days, the floodwaters of Harvey delivered 14 × 109 m3 of freshwater to Galveston Bay. This resulted in record flooding of Houston bayous and waterways, all of which drained into the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE,) with its main tributaries being Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. The lower SJE and lower Buffalo Bayou has experienced up to 3 m of land subsidence in the past 100 years and, as a result, prior to Hurricane Harvey, up to 2 m of sediment within the upper seabed contained an archive of high concentrations of Total Hg (HgT) and other particle-bound and porewater contaminants. Within the SJE, Harvey eroded at least 48 cm of the sediment column, resulting in the transport of an estimated 16.4 × 106 tons of sediment and at least 2 tons of Hg into Galveston Bay. This eroded sediment was replaced by a Harvey storm deposit of 7.73 × 106 tons of sediment and 0.96 tons within the SJE, mostly sourced from Buffalo Bayou. Considering that the frequency of slow-moving tropical cyclones capable of delivering devastating rainfall may be increasing, then one can expect that delivery of Hg and other contaminants from the archived sediment within urbanized estuaries will increase and that what happened during Harvey is a harbinger of what is to come.","Dellapenna, Timothy M; Hoelscher, Christena; Hill, Lisa; Al Mukaimi, Mohammad E; Knap, Anthony",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818899/,313
129536,"Using Twitter to Track Unplanned School Closures: Georgia Public Schools, 2015-17.",2020-05-14,"INTRODUCTION Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was recently reported to be associated with increased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and worse clinical outcomes. The underlying mechanism(s) for this association are unclear. METHODS We performed a prospective study of hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and COVID-negative controls to understand how PPI use may affect angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Analysis of a retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 15, 2020 to August 15, 2020 in 6 hospitals was performed to evaluate the association of PPI use and mortality. Covariates with clinical relevance to COVID-19 outcomes were included to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Control PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 mRNA levels than nonusers, 2.39 ± 1.15 vs 1.22 ± 0.92 (P = 0.02), respectively. Salivary ACE2 levels and stool SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates were comparable between users and nonusers of PPI. In 694 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (age = 58 years, 46% men, and 65% black), mortality rate in PPI users and nonusers was 30% (68/227) vs 12.1% (53/439), respectively. Predictors of mortality by logistic regression were PPI use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.72, P < 0.001), age (aOR = 1.66 per decade, P < 0.001), race (aOR = 3.03, P = 0.002), cancer (aOR = 2.22, P = 0.008), and diabetes (aOR = 1.95, P = 0.003). The PPI-associated mortality risk was higher in black patients (aOR = 4.16, 95% confidence interval: 2.28-7.59) than others (aOR = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-3.19, P = 0.04 for interaction). DISCUSSION COVID-negative PPI users had higher salivary ACE2 expression. PPI use was associated with increased mortality risk in patients with COVID-19, particularly African Americans.","Liu, Julia J; Sloan, Meredith E; Owings, Anna H; Figgins, Erika; Gauthier, Josee; Gharaibeh, Raad; Robinson, Tanya; Williams, Haley; Sindel, Campbell B; Backus, Fremel; Ayyalasomayajula, Krishna; Parker, Adam; Senitko, Michal; Abraham, George E; Claggett, Brian; Horwitz, Bruce H; Jobin, Christian; Adelman, Robert M; Diamond, Gill; Glover, Sarah C",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.14309/ajg.0000000000001311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047305/,313
139129,Animal genomics and infectious disease resistance in poultry.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Portal pressure can be used to identify subjects with chronic liver disease who have progressed to cirrhosis. Portal pressure can also provide accurate prognostication for patients with cirrhosis. However, there are no practical means for assessment of portal pressure. Although it is well-established that gastric mucosal blood supply increases in patients with cirrhosis, this has been difficult to reproducibly quantify. Our group developed a novel spectroscopic technology called spatially resolved subdiffuse reflectance spectroscopy (SRSRS) that enables quantification of mucosal microcirculation. We aim to ascertain if quantification of the gastric mucosal microcirculation with SRSRS correlates with clinical evidence of portal hypertension. METHODS Patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy for clinical indications had 10 measurements taken in the endoscopically normal gastric fundus via SRSRS probe to assess microcirculation. Cases were defined as patients with cirrhosis (n=18) and controls were those without evidence liver disease (n=18); this was corroborated with transient elastography. RESULTS Blood volume fraction (p = 0.06) and subdiffuse reflectance (p = 0.02) from shallow depth in gastric fundus were higher in patients with cirrhosis than those without. These markers were combined to yield an overall optical marker that can differentiate patients with cirrhosis from controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 94% (area under receiver operating curve =0.82). CONCLUSIONS Spectroscopic quantification of gastric fundal mucosal microcirculation is a promising surrogate of clinical correlates of portal hypertension. This approach may represent a less-intrusive surrogate biomarker for liver disease prognostication and potentially response to therapy.","Mohanty, Arpan; Eshein, Adam; Kamineni, Phanisyam; Avissar, Uri; Bliss, Charles M; Long, Michelle T; Lowe, Robert C; Moore, T Carlton; Nunes, David P; Backman, Vadim; Roy, Hemant K",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.12.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385462/,313
192139,Panzootics and the poor: devising a global livestock disease prioritisation framework for poverty alleviation.,2009,"Diarrheal feces from three sambar deer and one waterbuck in a wild animal habitat and one white-tailed deer on a wildlife farm in Ohio contained coronavirus particles which were agglutinated by antiserum to bovine coronavirus (BCV) in immune electron microscopy. Three coronavirus strains were isolated in human rectal tumor cells from the feces of the sambar and white-tailed deer and the waterbuck, respectively. Hemagglutination, receptor-destroying enzyme activity, indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization, and Western blot (immunoblot) tests showed close biological and antigenic relationships among the isolates and with selected BCV strains. Gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves inoculated with each of these isolates developed diarrhea and shed coronavirus in their feces and from their nasal passages. In a serological survey of coronavirus infections among wild deer, 8.7 and 6.6% of sera from mule deer in Wyoming and from white-tailed deer in Ohio, respectively, were seropositive against both of the isolates and selected BCV isolates by indirect immunofluorescence tests. These results confirm the existence of coronaviruses in wild ruminants and suggest that these species may harbor coronavirus strains transmissible to cattle.","Tsunemitsu, H; el-Kanawati, Z R; Smith, D R; Reed, H H; Saif, L J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8586714/,313

METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive patients (74 adolescents and 81 adults) were admitted to a 20-week intensive CBT-E program (13 weeks of inpatient followed by 7 weeks of day-hospital treatment). All patients had responded poorly to previous outpatient treatments and were assessed at admission, end of treatment (EOT), and 20- and 60-week follow-ups. RESULTS: About 70% of eligible patients began the program, and more than 85% completed it. Body mass index (BMI) in adults and BMI-for-age percentile in adolescents improved significantly from baseline to EOT, remained stable until 20-week follow-up, and slightly decreased from 20-week follow-up to 60-week follow-up, while remaining in the lower normal range. Eating disorder psychopathology, general psychopathology, and clinical impairment scores decreased significantly at EOT and showed only a slight increase from EOT to follow-ups. No difference was found between adolescent and adult patients in treatment acceptance, dropout, or any outcome measure. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that intensive CBT-E seems to be an effective treatment for severely ill adolescent and adult patients with anorexia nervosa.","Dalle Grave, Riccardo; Conti, Maddalena; Calugi, Simona",Int. j. eat. disord,,313

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study based on electronic health record data. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals &#8805;14 years old with a positive PCR or serology test, between 28 February and 31 May 2020, belonging to the Basque Country (Spain) public health system. Institutionalised and individuals admitted to a hospital at home unit were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Three severity categories were established: primary care, hospital/intensive care unit admission and death. RESULTS: A total of n=14 197 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most variables presented statistically significant associations with the outcome (p<0.0001). The Classification and Regression Trees recursive partitioning methodology (based on n=13 792) suggested that among all associations, those with, age, sex, stratification of patient healthcare complexity, chronic consumption of blood and blood-forming organ, and nervous system drugs, as well as the total number of chronic Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical types were the most relevant. Psychosis also emerged as a potential factor. CONCLUSIONS: Older cases are more likely to experience more severe outcomes. However, the sex, underlying health status and chronic drug consumption may interfere and alter the ageing effect. Understanding the factors related to the outcome severity is of key importance when designing and promoting public health intervention plans for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vrotsou, Kalliopi; Rotaeche, Rafael; Mateo-Abad, Maider; Machón, Mónica; Vergara, Itziar",BMJ Open,,313

MethodsWe conducted a dose-escalation, open label trial (phase 1) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase 2) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Nanocovax vaccine (in 25 microgram (mcg), 50 mcg, and 75 mcg doses, aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted). In phase 1, 60 participants received two intramuscular injection of the vaccine following dose-escalation procedure. The primary outcomes were reactogenicity and laboratory tests to evaluate the vaccine safety. In phase 2 which involved in 560 healthy adults, the primary outcomes are vaccine safety; and anti-S IgG antibody response. Secondary outcomes were surrogate virus neutralization, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and T-cell responses by intracellular staining (ICS) for interferon gamma (IFNg). We performed primary analyses at day 35 and day 42. ResultsFor phase 1 study, no serious adverse events (SAE) were observed for all 60 participants. Most adverse events (AE) were grade 1 and disappeared shortly after injection. For phase 2 study, after randomization, 480 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant, and 80 participants were assigned to receive placebo. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants and of short duration (mean, [≤]3 days). Unsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants. There were no serious adverse events related to Nanocovax. Regarding the immunogenicity, Nanocovax induced robust anti-S antibody responses. There was no statistical difference in antibody responses among dose strengths on Day 42, in terms of anti S-IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer. ConclusionsUp to 42 days, Nanocovax vaccine was safe, well tolerated and induced robust immune responses. We propose using Nanocovax 25 mcg for Phase 3 to evaluate the vaccine efficacy.

289857,"Calling for improved quality in the registration of traditional Chinese medicine during the public health emergency: a survey of trial registries for COVID-19, H1N1, and SARS (vol 22, 188, 2021)",2021,"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are the most prevalent mental health concern among older adults (possibly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic), which raises questions about how such symptoms can be lowered in this population. Existing research shows that offline social connectedness is a protective factor against depression in older adults; however, it is unknown whether web-based social connectedness can have similar effects. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether social connectedness on a support website protects older adults against depressive symptoms over the course of a year, above and beyond the protective effect of offline social connectedness. The secondary aim is to determine whether older adults with increased depressive symptoms are more likely to engage in social connectedness on this website. Thus, we examine depressive symptoms as both an outcome and predictor of web-based social connectedness to fully understand the chain of causality among these variables. Finally, we compare web-based social connectedness with offline social connectedness in their ability to lower depressive symptoms among older adults. METHODS: A total of 197 adults aged 65 years or older were given access to a social support website, where they were able to communicate with each other via a discussion forum for a year. Participants' social connectedness on the web-based platform, conceptualized as message production and consumption, was measured using behavioral log data as the number of messages participants wrote and read, respectively, during the first 6 months (t1) and the following 6 months (t2) of the study. Participants self-reported their offline social connectedness as the number of people in their support networks, and they reported their depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 both at baseline (t1) and at 12-month follow-up (t2). To ascertain the flow of causality between these variables, we employed a cross-lagged panel design, in which all variables were measured at t1 and t2. RESULTS: After controlling for the effect of offline support networks at t1, web-based message consumption at t1 decreased older adults' depressive symptoms at t2 (ß=-.11; P=.02), but web-based message production at t1 did not impact t2 depressive symptoms (ß=.12; P=.34). Web-based message consumption had a larger effect (ß=-.11; P=.02) than offline support networks (ß=-.08; P=.03) in reducing older adults' depressive symptoms over time. Higher baseline depressive symptoms did not predict increased web-based message consumption (ß=.12; P=.36) or production (ß=.02; P=.43) over time. CONCLUSIONS: The more messages older adults read on the web-based forum for the first 6 months of the study, the less depressed they felt at the 1-year follow-up, above and beyond the availability of offline support networks at baseline. This pinpoints the substantial potential of web-based communication to combat depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a key player in COVID-19 due to its pivotal role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This enzyme is expressed throughout the body and the studies conducted so far have shown that its expression varies according to several factors, including cell type, sex, age, disease states and probably SARS-CoV-2 infection. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and microRNAs, impact ACE2 expression and may explain structural variation. The understanding of how genetic variants and epigenetic markers act to control ACE2 expression in health and disease states may contribute to comprehend several aspects of COVID-19 that are puzzling researchers and clinicians. This review collects and appraises the literature regarding some aspects in the ACE2 biology, the expression patterns of this molecule, SNPs of the ACE2 gene and epigenetic mechanisms that may impact ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19.","Lima, Rafael Silva; Rocha, Luiz Paulo Carvalho; Moreira, Paula Rocha",Cell biochem. funct,,313

In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) and cyclic phosphate cDNA sequencing to identify the RNA targets of EndoU. EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3' side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for U &#8595; A and C &#8595; A sequences (endoY &#8595; A). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5' NTR to the 3' NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggests a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2'-5' phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation. Coronavirus EndoU cleaves U &#8595; A and C &#8595; A sequences (endoY &#8595; A) within viral (+) strand RNA to evade dsRNA-activated host responses.","Ancar, Rachel; Li, Yize; Kindler, Eveline; Cooper, Daphne A; Ransom, Monica; Thiel, Volker; Weiss, Susan R; Hesselberth, Jay R; Barton, David J",RNA,,313

We find robust reactivity to spike-derived epitopes, comparable to influenza, but highly variable abundance and functional potential across subjects, depending on age and viral antigen specificity. To explore the potential of these memory cells to be recruited in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined the same subjects for cross-reactive recognition of epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, membrane/envelope, and spike. The functional potential of these cross-reactive CD4 T cells was highly variable, with nucleocapsid-specific CD4 T cells, but not spike-reactive cells showing exceptionally high levels of granzyme production upon stimulation. These results are considered in light of recruitment of hCoV-reactive cells into responses of humans to SARS-CoV infections or vaccinations.","Richards, Katherine A; Glover, Maryah; Crawford, Jeremy C; Thomas, Paul; White, Chantelle; Sant, Andrea J",J. infect. dis,,313

Against this backdrop, this paper addresses the variegated dynamics of real estate dispossession in the tourist conurbation Los Cristianos/Las Américas on an intra-urban scale. First, I will present the spatio-temporal patterns of dispossession for the period 2001–2015 using the ATLANTE database (CGPJ). Specifically, I analyze mortgage foreclosures and tenant evictions, both for residential and commercial spaces. Second, I delve deeper into local experiences of dispossession of the resident population and their housing and income conditions by means of questionnaires that I conducted in 2018. The data shows that mortgage foreclosures and dispossessions of residential spaces predominate the initial years after the crisis, albeit with varied spatial incidence. However, the increase in tenant evictions from 2014 onwards points to a reconfiguration of displacement dynamics. Indeed, as stated by the interviewees, staggeringly high rent burdens have become the main driver for displacement from both living and working spaces in recent years. Given the ongoing global pandemic, further and more nuanced research is necessary to grasp how these prevailing housing insecurities are shaped during and beyond the coronavirus crisis.","Hof, Dennis",Urban Science,,313

452286,Certifying the interruption of wild poliovirus transmission in the WHO African region on the turbulent journey to a polio-free world,2020,"Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has infected more than ten million persons worldwide. Therefore, researchers are trying to address various aspects that may help in diagnosis this pneumonia. Image segmentation is a necessary pr-processing step that implemented in image analysis and classification applications. Therefore, in this study, our goal is to present an efficient image segmentation method for COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed image segmentation method depends on improving the density peaks clustering (DPC) using generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The DPC is faster than other clustering methods, and it provides more stable results. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal number of clustering centers automatically without visualization.

483503,Changes in preventive behavior during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fluid-repellent surgical masks (FRSMs) are recommended by the UK government for healthcare workers as personal protective equipment (PPE) against SARS-COV-2. UK Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) national guidelines states that 'masks must be well-fitting and fit for purpose, fully covering the mouth and nose'. AIM: To review the fit of the FRSM supplied to the NHS front line workers against the national IPC guidelines and, through re-audit, assess for improvements in fit with FRSM worn with a plastic strap (intervention A) and FFP3 mask (intervention B). METHOD: A three-part closed-loop audit was carried out comprising controlled observation, observation in the clinical area and questionnaire. Re-audit was carried out following interventions A and B. RESULTS: FRSMs slipped below the nose in 43% and below the mouth of 10% of participants during the controlled observation and below the nose (above or below the mouth) in 30% of staff in the clinical area. No masks slipped below the nose or mouth with intervention A or B. 86% of participants reported touching the FRSM to keep it in the correct position and 66% reported touching the FFP3. CONCLUSION: The current supply of FRSMs are poorly fitting for many users and do not meet the UK IPC guideline standard. These issues were not evident when worn with a plastic strap or with FFP3 masks.","Russell, Lorna; Campani, Leyla; Jones, Jack; Healy, Brendan",Clin Med (Lond),,313

491884,Public Education and Electronic Awareness of the New Coronavirus (COVID-19): Experiences From Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating pandemic that has spread to many parts of the world. As such, there is urgent need to identify predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 patients. This may be useful for early identification of patients who may require life-saving interventions. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated whether malignancies are associated with a significantly enhanced odds of COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHOD: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, to May 26th, 2020 on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify studies reporting data on cancers in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome of interest was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity, while the secondary outcome was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 mortality. Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies (n = 4549 patients) were included. Overall, malignancies were found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.47-3.196; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.18-4.85; p = 0.016). No heterogeneity was observed for both outcomes (Cochran's Q = 6.558, p = 0.922, I2 = 0% and Cochran's Q = 2.91, p = 0.71, I2 = 0% respectively). CONCLUSION: Malignancies were significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease, as well as mortality. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings. These patients should be closely monitored for any signs of unfavorable disease progression.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Kipkorir, Vincent; Ngure, Brian; Misiani, Musa; Munguti, Jeremiah",Am. j. emerg. med,,313

501144,In this month’s Bulletin,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global crisis, and medical systems in many countries are overwhelmed with supply shortages and increasing demands to treat patients due to the surge in cases and severe illnesses. This study aimed to assess COVID-19-related essential clinical resource demands in China, based on different scenarios involving COVID-19 outbreaks and interventions. We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized/isolated-removed (SEIHR) transmission dynamics model to estimate the number of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations with corresponding essential healthcare resources needed. We found that, under strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) or mass vaccination of the population, China would be able to contain community transmission and local outbreaks rapidly. However, under scenarios involving a low intensity of implemented NPIs and a small proportion of the population vaccinated, the use of a peacetime-wartime transition model would be needed for medical source stockpiles and preparations to ensure a normal functioning healthcare system. The implementation of COVID-19 vaccines and NPIs in different periods can influence the transmission of COVID-19 and subsequently affect the demand for clinical diagnosis and treatment. An increased proportion of asymptomatic infections in simulations will not reduce the demand for medical resources; however, attention must be paid to the increasing difficulty in containing COVID-19 transmission due to asymptomatic cases. This study provides evidence for emergency preparations and the adjustment of prevention and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides guidance for essential healthcare investment and resource allocation.","Zhang, Ting; Wang, Qing; Leng, Zhiwei; Yang, Yuan; Yang, Jin; Chen, Fangyuan; Jia, Mengmeng; Zhang, Xingxing; Qi, Weiran; Xu, Yunshao; Chen, Siya; Dai, Peixi; Ma, Libing; Feng, Luzhao; Yang, Weizhong",,,313

There is only limited data about the clinical features of COVID-19 during pregnancy, especially in first trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a COVID-19 infection in a 35 years-old patient in first trimester of pregnancy and its consequent medical care. At 7 weeks of pregnancy, the patient, who did not have any pregestational comorbidities, complained of intense nausea and asthenia. An important liver cytolysis was discovered with biological perturbations of transaminases levels. No respiratory symptoms were recorded. Classical viral aetiologies and drug-related toxicity were discarded. Because of the aggravation of the symptoms and the occurrence of the breathlessness, the patient was tested for the COVID-19 in a nasopharyngeal swab. The RTq-PCR assay indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the absence of severe symptoms, the patient was monitored at home according to the French government guidelines. After a few days, the symptoms resolved without any complications. The pregnancy is still ongoing without any visible sequelae on the foetus so far. CONCLUSIONS: This first case illustrated the difficulty of COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with isolated digestive symptoms in first trimester of pregnancy that could be confused with gravida hyperemesis. Monitoring of pregnancy after an episode of COVID-19 should be strengthened with bimonthly foetal growth ultrasounds and doppler assessments because of the risks for intrauterine growth restriction. Comprehensive data on larger numbers of first trimester gravid women with COVID-19 are required to better understanding the overall impact of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.","Lamazou, F.; Oger, P.; Dieli-crimi, R.; Guerin, A.; Letouzey, V.; Octernaud, S.; Place, V.; Calès, P.; Descamps, P.; Delaroche, L.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198681/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05551-0,313

Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy, excessive and dysregulated immune responses, and autoimmunity by COVID-19 patients is considerable. The pathogenesis of infection entails the entry of the virus via receptors on cells, principally angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. Direct virus damage coupled with indirect effects of viral infection including thromboinflammation, dysfunction of the immune system, and dysregulation of the renin–angiotensin system leads to multiple organ failure.

Participants held more positive vaccination attitudes and greater likelihood to get vaccinated or vaccinate their child when they were frequently exposed to positive attitudes and frequently discussing vaccinations with family and friends. We also observed that vaccination uptake was decreased when family and friends were hesitant to take the vaccine. Homophily—the tendency of similar individuals to be connected in a social network—was identified as a significant factor that drives the results, especially with respect to race and ethnicity.

A strategy for COVID-19 screening was presented and then suspected cases were monitored and analysed until they were confirmed as cases or excluded. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of COVID-19. FINDINGS: We enrolled patients visiting fever clinics from Jan 17 to Feb 16, 2020. Among 53 617 patients visiting fever clinics, 1004 (1·9%) were considered as suspected cases, with 188 (0·4% of all patients, 18·7% of suspected cases) eventually diagnosed as confirmed cases. 154 patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Exposure history (odds ratio [OR] 4·16, 95% CI 2·74–6·33; p<0·0001), fatigue (OR 1·56, 1·01–2·41; p=0·043), white blood cell count less than 4 × 10(9) per L (OR 2·44, 1·28–4·64; p=0·0066), lymphocyte count less than 0·8 × 10(9) per L (OR 1·82, 1·00–3·31; p=0·049), ground glass opacity (OR 1·95, 1·32–2·89; p=0·0009), and having both lungs affected (OR 1·54, 1·04–2·28; p=0·032) were independent risk factors for confirmed COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The screening strategy was effective for confirming or excluding COVID-19 during the spread of this contagious disease. Relevant independent risk factors identified in this study might be helpful for early recognition of the disease.

The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive with an epidemiologic link 72 hours before onset of symptoms. Methods: The patient was referred to Gutierrez Children’s Hospital intensive care unit (ICU), where she was diagnosed with TEN, bibasal pneumonia and MIS, gammaglobulin and corticosteroids therapy was indicated. She had severe ocular compromise, with bilateral bullous lesions on eyelids and extensive corneal ulcer. We performed amniotic membrane transplantation and placed a symblepharon ring in order to minimize the destructive inflammation and damage of the ocular surface during acute phase. Results: Patient evolution was favorable. She was transferred to the COVID-19 unit after 10 days. Complete reabsorption of amniotic membrane was confirmed in 15 days, symblepharon ring was removed and continued with preservative-free lubricant, cyclosporine 0.05% and serum tears drops. After 35 days of hospitalization, she was discharged with regulated multidisciplinary controls. The patient achieved best-corrected visual acuity 20/20 in both eyes, with moderate dry eye symptoms and localized trichiasis. Conclusion/Relevance: In this case, a strong correlation of COVID-19 with TEN was suspected. TEN is a potentially devastating disease that involves permanent painful visual problems. We emphasize early and intensive treatment because the management of the sequelae is extremely challenging, many of the chronic problems are impossible to repair completely.","Jara, Andrea; Negrete-Ramos, Gabriel; Gutierrez, Susana Gamio",Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1091853121003633; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaapos.2021.08.147; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1091853121003633,313

Our study encompasses several different phases since the National Lockdown in Italy. The primary outcome is (I) to analyze the prevalence of positive NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) among the largest Italian Pediatric cohort admitted to a single regional PED Hub for COVID-19 during an eight-month period. Secondary outcomes are: (II) the description of trend of admissions in our PED and (III) the categorization of the positive patients according to clinical manifestations and epidemiological link. METHODS: We described 316 patients with a positive NST for SARS-CoV2, on a total of 5001 nasopharyngeal swabs performed among 13,171 admissions at our PED, over a period starting from March 17th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020. Age, epidemiological link, clinical features and hospitalizations were analyzed according to different lockdown phases. Data were collected anonymously from electronic records and analyzed using SPSS 22.00 statistics software (Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of total admissions have been tested. During the post lockdown period, we performed the highest percentage of NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) 49.7%, and among them 7.9% were positive. The prevalence of infection during a 10-month period was 2.3%. Mean age was 6.5 years old. Familial Link accounted for the 67.7% of infection, while Extrafamilial and Unknown link accounted for 17 and 14.9%, respectively. Familial link is predominant during all phases. Seventeen patients showed an intra-scholastic link, and the highest prevalence was observed in the 7–10 years age group, with a prevalence of 12.8% (5 patients). Fever was the most frequent symptom (66%), in particular among preschooler children aged 0–6 years (71.9%). Older children were more frequently symptomatic. Seven patients were admitted with MIS-C diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Different levels of containment measures caused important changes in number of positive NST for SARS-CoV2. Familial link was predominant in our cohort, during all phases of Lockdown. The risk of being infected at home is four time greater than the risk of being infected from an extra familial individual. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clear impact of intra-scholastic link. The constant improvement in knowledge on onset symptoms and risk factor for SARS-CoV2 infection and its complications (e.g. MIS-C), can impact on number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and early management.","Crea, Francesca; Panfili, Filippo Maria; Amodeo, Maria Elisa; Fintini, Danilo; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Trenta, Italo; Menichella, Alessandra; Ossella, Chiara; Deidda, Andrea; Lidano, Roberta; Macchiarulo, Giulia; Lambiase, Caterina; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Raponi, Massimiliano",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078423/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-01081-w,313

668635,In this month’s Bulletin,2020-07-01,"In the last three decades, Early Intervention for psychosis services have been established worldwide and have resulted in superior symptomatic and functional outcomes for people affected by psychotic disorders. These improved outcomes are a result of reducing delays to treatment and the provision of specialized, holistic interventions. The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment. Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic will likely increase the mental health needs of communities, including the incidence of psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we provide suggestions as to how early intervention for psychosis services can adapt within this environment, such as utilizing novel technologies. Finally, we argue that despite the economic consequences of the pandemic, the funding for mental health services, including early intervention services, should be increased in line with the need for these services during and beyond the pandemic.","O'Donoghue, Brian; O'Connor, Karen; Thompson, Andrew; McGorry, Patrick",Irish journal of psychological medicine,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5FCA76294D236271680B3B5B0FD6F0C5/S0790966720000567a.pdf/div-class-title-the-need-for-early-intervention-for-psychosis-to-persist-throughout-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-beyond-div.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434611/,313
