7425,7425,7425,AN “OUTBREAK” OF JUVENILE DIABETES MELLITUS: CONSIDERATION OF A VIRAL ETIOLOGY,19.356081,8.838641,1974-10-11,"Surface antigen one (Sao) is a newly identified protein from the major zoonotic pathogen, Streptococcus suis. In search of functional proteins related to the pathogenesis of Chinese S. suis 2 (SS2), unexpectedly, a variant of Sao protein was obtained. To test its prevalence in S. suis, PCR assay was adopted to address the coding genes systematically. It was found that there are three allelic variants of sao gene, namely sao-S, sao-M, and sao-L based on the different lengths of the genes (∼1.5, ∼1.7, and ∼2.0 kb, respectively). These differences were determined to be caused by heterogeneity within the number of C-terminal repeat sequences (R), which had been seen as a pathogenicity-related domain in the plant pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae. Two variants (sao-M and sao-L) were only found in SS2. All three variant proteins were prepared in vitro and their biochemical and biophysical properties were characterized. A soluble form of Sao-M protein was then used as a capture antigen to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to detect antibodies against SS2 in convalescent pig sera. Taken together, the results exhibit the properties of Sao proteins and provide an efficient Sao-M-based method for monitoring SS2 infection.","Feng, Youjun; Zheng, Feng; Pan, Xiuzhen; Sun, Wen; Wang, Changjun; Dong, Yaqing; Ju, Ai-ping; Ge, Junchao; Liu, Di; Liu, Cuihua; Yan, Jinghua; Tang, Jiaqi; Gao, George F.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,524,1

Very few etiological studies assessed the appropriateness of empiric guideline recommendations at a multinational level. This study aims at the following: (i) describing the bacterial etiologic distribution of CAP and (ii) assessing the appropriateness of the empirical treatment recommendations by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for CAP in light of the bacterial pathogens diagnosed as causative agents of CAP. Secondary analysis of the GLIMP, a point-prevalence international study which enrolled adults hospitalized with CAP in 2015. The analysis was limited to immunocompetent patients tested for bacterial CAP agents within 24 h of admission. The CAP CPGs evaluated included the following: the 2007 and 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA), the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and selected country-specific CPGs. Among 2564 patients enrolled, 35.3% had an identifiable pathogen. Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.2%) was the most frequently identified pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4%). CPGs appropriately recommend covering more than 90% of all the potential pathogens causing CAP, with the exception of patients enrolled from Germany, Pakistan, and Croatia. The 2019 ATS/IDSA CPGs appropriately recommend covering 93.6% of the cases compared with 90.3% of the ERS CPGs (p < 0.01). S. pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen in patients hospitalized with CAP. Multinational CPG recommendations for patients with CAP seem to appropriately cover the most common pathogens and should be strongly encouraged for the management of CAP patients.

Subsequently, it tests whether the gene exhibits functional variability between individuals that correlates with the phenotype of interest. PWAS can capture complex modes of heritability, including recessive inheritance. A comparison with GWAS and other existing methods proves its capacity to recover causal protein-coding genes and highlight new associations.

Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR22-5p targets ten-eleven translocation (TET2) 3′-untranslated region. This study aimed to determine the regulation and roles of miR22-5p in the pathogenesis of minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility. MiR22-5p and TET2 expression in the mid-luteal endometrium from women with or without minimal/mild endometriosis was analyzed. After transfection with miR22-5p mimics or inhibitor, TET2 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT-q) PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was determined by immunofluorescence and dot blotting. Expression and promoter methylation of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting, and by bisulfite sequencing, respectively. We first established that miR22-5p expression decreased and TET2 expression increased in minimal/mild endometriosis during implantation window. TET2 was found to be a direct target of miR22-5p. MiR22-5p regulated the expression of ESR2, but did not directly affect methylation of its promoter region (–197/+359). Our results suggest that an imbalance in miR22-5p expression in the mid-luteal endometrium may be involved in minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility.","Xiao, Li; Pei, Tianjiao; Huang, Wei; Zhou, Min; Fu, Jing; Tan, Jing; Liu, Tingting; Song, Yong; Yang, Shiyuan",PLoS One,524,1

Digital network technologies are currently overwhelmingly effective in proletarianizing and disempowering the cognitariat and only an active technopolitics of deproletarianization could reverse this hegemonic situation. In my response to Verbeek, I attempt to correct his misinterpretation (shared by Milberry) of the Stieglerian approach as being dialectical in nature and show that, far from reinstating the humanist dichotomy between human beings and technologies, my analysis assumes their original, albeit fundamentally ambiguous and even ‘uncanny’ [unheimlich] interconnection.

The capnodynamic method continuously calculates cardiac output (CO) based on effective pulmonary blood flow (CO(EPBF)) and could provide CO monitoring complementary to mechanical ventilation during surgery and intensive care. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the ability of a revised capnodynamic method, based on short expiratory holds (CO(EPBFexp)), to estimate CO during acute respiratory failure (LI) with high shunt fractions before and after compliance-based lung recruitment. Ten pigs were submitted to lung lavage and subsequent ventilator-induced lung injury. CO(EPBFexp), without any shunt correction, was compared to a reference method for CO, an ultrasonic flow probe placed around the pulmonary artery trunk (CO(TS)) at (1) baseline in healthy lungs with PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (HL(P5)), (2) LI with PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (LI(P5)) and (3) LI after lung recruitment and PEEP adjustment (LI(Padj)). CO changes were enforced during LI(P5) and LI(Padj) to estimate trending. LI resulted in changes in shunt fraction from 0.1 (0.03) to 0.36 (0.1) and restored to 0.09 (0.04) after recruitment manoeuvre. Bias (levels of agreement) and percentage error between CO(EPBFexp) and CO(TS) changed from 0.5 (− 0.5 to 1.5) L/min and 30% at HL(P5) to − 0.6 (− 2.3 to 1.1) L/min and 39% during LI(P5) and finally 1.1 (− 0.3 to 2.5) L/min and 38% at LI(Padj). Concordance during CO changes improved from 87 to 100% after lung recruitment and PEEP adjustment. CO(EPBFexp) could possibly be used for continuous CO monitoring and trending in hemodynamically unstable patients with increased shunt and after recruitment manoeuvre.

This justifies the expansion of the LFS concept to a wider cancer predisposition syndrome designated heritable TP53-related cancer (hTP53rc) syndrome; (ii) the interpretation of germline TP53 variants remains challenging and should integrate epidemiological, phenotypical, bioinformatics prediction, and functional data; (iii) the penetrance of germline disease-causing TP53 variants is variable, depending both on the type of variant (dominant-negative variants being associated with a higher cancer risk) and on modifying factors; (iv) whole-body MRI (WBMRI) allows early detection of tumours in variant carriers and (v) in cancer patients with germline disease-causing TP53 variants, radiotherapy, and conventional genotoxic chemotherapy contribute to the development of subsequent primary tumours. It is critical to perform TP53 testing before the initiation of treatment in order to avoid in carriers, if possible, radiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies. In children, the recommendations are to perform clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound every 6 months, annual WBMRI and brain MRI from the first year of life, if the TP53 variant is known to be associated with childhood cancers. In adults, the surveillance should include every year clinical examination, WBMRI, breast MRI in females from 20 until 65 years and brain MRI until 50 years.","Frebourg, Thierry; Bajalica Lagercrantz, Svetlana; Oliveira, Carla; Magenheim, Rita; Evans, D.

Inadequacies in current diagnostic procedures mean that early diagnosis of the disease, critical to patient survival, remains a major clinical challenge, and is leading to the empiric use of antifungal drugs and emergence of azole resistance. A non-invasive procedure that allows both unambiguous detection of IPA and its response to azole treatment is therefore needed. Here, we show that a humanised Aspergillus-specific monoclonal antibody, dual labelled with a radionuclide and fluorophore, can be used in immunoPET/MRI in vivo in a neutropenic mouse model and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy ex vivo in the infected mouse lungs to quantify early A. fumigatus lung infections and to monitor the efficacy of azole therapy. Our antibody-guided approach reveals that early drug intervention is critical to prevent complete invasion of the lungs by the fungus, and demonstrates the power of molecular imaging as a non-invasive procedure for tracking IPA in vivo.","Henneberg, Sophie; Hasenberg, Anja; Maurer, Andreas; Neumann, Franziska; Bornemann, Lea; Gonzalez-Menendez, Irene; Kraus, Andreas; Hasenberg, Mike; Thornton, Christopher R.; Pichler, Bernd J.; Gunzer, Matthias; Beziere, Nicolas",Nat Commun,524,1

This increase in digitalization at the workplace brings many new aspects of working life to light, such as working in virtual teams, mobile working, expectations of being constantly available, and the need for support in adapting and learning new digital tools. These changes to the workplace can contain risks that might harm the well-being of employees. Leaders can support the well-being of their employees in terms of protecting and replenishing their work-related resources to cope with critical work demands. This so-called health-promoting leadership could serve as a buffer between risk at the workplace and critical outcomes, such as stress, by amplifying work-related resources. OBJECTIVE: This study’s aims were twofold. First, we wanted to investigate if risk factors related to higher digitalization at the workplace can be identified and if these risk factors have an impairing effect on the well-being of employees (eg, higher stress and lower resources). Second, we wanted to investigate if the health-impairing effects of these risk factors can be reduced by health-promoting leadership. METHODS: A total of 1412 employees from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland took part in this online study and provided information on their perceived risks at the workplace, their leaders’ health-promoting behaviors, and their work-related stress and resources. RESULTS: The results of a hierarchical regression analysis showed that all four risk factors of digital work (distributed team work, mobile work, constant availability, and inefficient technical support) were related to higher stress at the workplace. In addition, distributed team work and inefficient technical support were associated with lower work-related resources. A possible buffer effect of health-promoting leadership between these risks and employee well-being was visible for inefficient technical support. In particular, in the case of having fewer support opportunities in learning and using digital tools, leaders could weaken the potential critical effects on stress. As for the other risk factors, leaders might engage in a different leadership behavior to improve their employees’ well-being, as the physical distance between leaders and employees in virtual team work or mobile work could make health-promoting leadership more difficult. CONCLUSIONS: In a digitalized working world, solutions are needed to create working conditions that benefit employees. The results of this study strongly support the importance of investigating risk factors associated with an increase in digitalization at the workplace in addition to traditional risk factors. As for leadership, leaders need to show leadership behavior adapted to a digitalized workplace in order to reduce employee stress and increase work-related resources.","Bregenzer, Anita; Jimenez, Paulino",J Med Internet Res,524,1

These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles species mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, nosocomial exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to provide information on its occurrence (e.g., temporal, geographic, and demographic), guide prevention and treatment recommendations for travelers and patients, and facilitate rapid transmission control measures if locally acquired cases are identified. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes confirmed malaria cases in persons with onset of illness in 2017 and trends in previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are reported to local and state health departments through electronic laboratory reports or by health care providers or laboratory staff members. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consultations. CDC reference laboratories provide diagnostic assistance and conduct antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health departments. This report summarizes data from the integration of all cases from NMSS and NNDSS, CDC reference laboratory reports, and CDC clinical consultations. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 2,161 confirmed malaria cases with onset of symptoms in 2017, including two congenital cases, three cryptic cases, and two cases acquired through blood transfusion. The number of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States has been increasing since the mid-1970s; in 2017, the number of cases reported was the highest in 45 years, surpassing the previous peak of 2,078 confirmed cases reported in 2016. Of the cases in 2017, a total of 1,819 (86.1%) were imported cases that originated from Africa; 1,216 (66.9%) of these came from West Africa. The overall proportion of imported cases originating from West Africa was greater in 2017 (57.6%) than in 2016 (51.6%). Among all cases, P. falciparum accounted for the majority of infections (1,523 [70.5%]), followed by P. vivax (216 [10.0%]), P. ovale (119 [5.5%]), and P. malariae (55 [2.6%]). Infections by two or more species accounted for 22 cases (1.0%). The infecting species was not reported or was undetermined in 226 cases (10.5%). CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 9.5% of confirmed cases and tested 8.0% of specimens with P. falciparum infections for antimalarial resistance markers. Most patients (94.8%) had symptom onset <90 days after returning to the United States from a country with malaria transmission. Of the U.S. civilian patients who reported reason for travel, 73.1% were visiting friends and relatives. The proportion of U.S. residents with malaria who reported taking any chemoprophylaxis in 2017 (28.4%) was similar to that in 2016 (26.4%), and adherence was poor among those who took chemoprophylaxis. Among the 996 U.S. residents with malaria for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region were known, 93.3% did not adhere to or did not take a CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen. Among 805 women with malaria, 27 reported being pregnant. Of these, 10 pregnant women were U.S. residents, and none reported taking chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria. A total of 26 (1.2%) malaria cases occurred among U.S. military personnel in 2017, fewer than in 2016 (41 [2.0%]). Among all reported cases in 2017, a total of 312 (14.4%) were classified as severe malaria illnesses, and seven persons died. In 2017, CDC analyzed 117 P. falciparum-positive and six P. falciparum mixed-species samples for antimalarial resistance markers (although certain loci were untestable in some samples); identification of genetic polymorphisms associated with resistance to pyrimethamine were found in 108 (97.3%), to sulfadoxine in 77 (69.4%), to chloroquine in 38 (33.3%), to mefloquine in three (2.7%), and to atovaquone in three (2.7%); no specimens tested contained a marker for artemisinin resistance. The data completeness of key variables (species, country of acquisition, and resident status) was lower in 2017 (74.4%) than in 2016 (79.4%). INTERPRETATION: The number of reported malaria cases in 2017 continued a decades-long increasing trend, and for the second year in a row the highest number of cases since 1971 have been reported. Despite progress in malaria control in recent years, the disease remains endemic in many areas globally. The importation of malaria reflects the overall increase in global travel to and from these areas. Fifty-six percent of all cases were among persons who had traveled from West Africa, and among U.S. civilians, visiting friends and relatives was the most common reason for travel (73.1%). Frequent international travel combined with the inadequate use of prevention measures by travelers resulted in the highest number of imported malaria cases detected in the United States in 4 decades. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: The best way to prevent malaria is to take chemoprophylaxis medication during travel to a country where malaria is endemic. Adherence to recommended malaria prevention strategies among U.S. travelers would reduce the numbers of imported cases; reasons for nonadherence include prematurely stopping after leaving the area where malaria was endemic, forgetting to take the medication, and experiencing a side effect. Travelers might not understand the risk that malaria poses to them; thus, health care providers should incorporate risk education to motivate travelers to be adherent to chemoprophylaxis. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient’s age, medical history, the likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Antimalarial use for chemoprophylaxis and treatment should be informed by the most recent guidelines, which are frequently updated. In 2018, two formulations of tafenoquine (i.e., Arakoda and Krintafel) were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Arakoda was approved for use by adults for chemoprophylaxis; the regimen requires a predeparture loading dose, taking the medication weekly during travel, and a short course posttravel. The Arakoda chemoprophylaxis regimen is shorter than alternative regimens, which could possibly improve adherence. This medication also might prevent relapses. Krintafel was approved for radical cure of P. vivax infections in those aged >16 years and should be co-administered with chloroquine (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/new_info/2020/tafenoquine_2020.html). In April 2019, intravenous artesunate became the first-line medication for treatment of severe malaria in the United States. Artesunate was recently FDA approved but is not yet commercially available. The drug can be obtained from CDC under an investigational new drug protocol. Detailed recommendations for preventing malaria are available to the general public at the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Health care providers should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC’s Malaria Hotline for case management advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) and from the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free 855-856-4713). Persons submitting malaria case reports (care providers, laboratories, and state and local public health officials) should provide complete information because incomplete reporting compromises case investigations and efforts to prevent infections and examine trends in malaria cases. Molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) enables CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both domestically and internationally. More samples are needed to improve the completeness of antimalarial drug resistance analysis; therefore, CDC requests that blood specimens be submitted for any case of malaria diagnosed in the United States.","Mace, Kimberly E.; Lucchi, Naomi W.; Tan, Kathrine R.",MMWR Surveill Summ,524,1

Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) subjected to frequent antibiotics and oxygen therapies, which may give rise to local and systemic inflammatory reactions and progression of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This study aimed to investigate the role of intestinal dysbacteriosis by antibiotic therapy before hyperoxia exposure in the progression of BPD. METHODS: Mice had been exposed to hyperoxia (85% O(2)) since postnatal day 3 until day 16 for the BPD model establishment, treated with antibiotics from postnatal day 2 until day 8. Treated mice and appropriate controls were harvested on postnatal day 2 or 10 for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, or postnatal day 17 for assessment of alveolar morphometry and macrophages differentiation. RESULTS: Antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis before hyperoxia exposure gave rise to deterioration of BPD evidenced by reduced survival rates and alveolarization. Moreover, antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis resulted in increased M1 macrophage maker (iNOS) and decreased M2 macrophage maker (Arg-1) levels in lung homogenates. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbacteriosis may participate in BPD pathogenesis via alteration of the macrophage polarization status. Manipulating the gut microbiota may potentially intervene the therapy of BPD.

We performed flow cytometry-based measurements of SIGLEC1 expression on monocytes in 86 MS patients, 41 NMOSD patients and 31 healthy controls. Additionally, we histologically evaluated the presence of SIGLEC1(+) myeloid cells in acute and chronic MS brain lesions as well as other neurological diseases. We found elevated SIGLEC1 expression in 16/86 (18.6%) MS patients and 4/41 (9.8%) NMOSD patients. Almost all MS patients with high SIGLEC1 levels received exogenous interferon beta as an immunomodulatory treatment and only a small fraction of MS patients without interferon treatment had increased SIGLEC1 expression. In our cohort, SIGLEC1 expression on monocytes was—apart from those patients receiving interferon treatment—not significantly increased in patients with MS and NMOSD, nor were levels associated with more severe disease.

Duloxetine, a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is a widely prescribed antidepressant. The effects of duloxetine have, however, not been sufficiently assessed in earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses. METHODS/DESIGN: A systematic review will be performed including randomised clinical trials comparing duloxetine with ‘active’ placebo, placebo or no intervention for adults with major depressive disorder. Bias domains will be assessed, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed. We will conduct meta-analyses. Trial sequential analysis will be conducted to control random errors, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed using GRADE. To identify relevant trials, we will search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Science and Conference Proceedings Citation Index—Social Science & Humanities. We will also search Chinese databases and Google Scholar. We will search all databases from their inception to the present. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. Primary outcomes will be the difference in mean depression scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale between the intervention and control groups and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be suicide, suicide-attempts, suicidal ideation, quality of life and non-serious adverse events. DISCUSSION: No former systematic review has systematically assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of duloxetine taking into account both the risks of random errors and the risks of systematic errors. Our review will help clinicians weigh the benefits of prescribing duloxetine against its adverse effects and make informed decisions.

Here we present a genetically confirmed case of a South Asian baby girl with severe, early-onset form of very long-chain acyl-coenzyme-A dehydrogenase deficiency due to a novel mutation in ACADVL gene. CASE PRESENTATION: Index case was the second baby girl of second-degree consanguineous South Asian parents. She had an uncomplicated antenatal period and was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at term with a birth weight of 2910 g. She had been noted to have fair skin complexion, hypotonia, and 3 cm firm hepatomegaly. Since birth, the baby developed grunting, poor feeding, and recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia and convulsions with multiple semiology. Her septic screening and urine ketone bodies were negative. The baby had high anion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated transaminases and serum creatine phosphokinase levels. Echocardiogram at 4 months revealed bilateral ventricular hypertrophy. Acylcarnitine profile revealed elevated concentrations of tetradecanoylcarnitine (C14), tetradecanoylcarnitine C14:1, and C14:1/C16. Unfortunately, the baby died due to intercurrent respiratory illness at 4 months of age. Sequence analysis of ACADVL gene in perimortem blood sample revealed homozygous frame shift novel variant NM_001270447.1, c.711_712del p.(Phe237Leufs*38), which confirmed the diagnosis of very long-chain acyl-coenzyme-A dehydrogenase deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis and management of very long-chain acyl-coenzyme-A dehydrogenase deficiency in improving the outcome of the patients. Implementation of newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry in Sri Lanka will be beneficial to reduce the morbidity and mortality of treatable disorders of inborn errors.","Arunath, Visvalingam; Liyanarachchi, Manoj Sanjeewa; Gajealan, Sundararajah; Jasinge, Eresha; Weerasekara, Kumudu; Moheb, Lia Abbasi",J Med Case Rep,524,1

This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients’ residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients’ residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. RESULTS: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. CONCLUSIONS: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients’ residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy.

This resulted in many older adults staying at home for long periods of time in relative isolation. Because there is little prior evidence of the emotional impact that this has on older adults, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study on how older adults felt during the first three to five weeks of the CDC recommendations. We fielded a web-based cross-sectional survey. Our analytic sample consisted of 673 respondents aged 60 and older who respondent to the prompt: “How are you feeling during this time of social distancing?”. We used a thematic bottom-up qualitative analysis, via MAXQDA, to analyze segments into general affect codes and detailed emotion subcodes, as well as coping mechanisms. Results showed that while many older adults reported neutral (9%) or positive (9%) affect, a larger proportion reported negative affect (42%) or reported mixed affect (35%). The most common negative emotions mentioned were anxiety and loneliness/boredom, while the most common positive emotions mentioned were optimism and feeling grateful. The most common coping mechanisms reported by participants included making life adjustments, keeping busy, prayer/spirituality, and mediation/mindfulness. This study provides an initial understanding into how older adults experienced and coped with the first stages of restricting social interactions. If social distancing continues to be a recommended disease-containment strategy, information about how older adults are coping can be critical for public health interventions.

In an authentic, situated, and personalized learning platform, giving and receiving WCF were made possible only through the mobile-mediated application of WhatsApp. Before participants wrote on selected elicitation topics, they had taken part in a 2004 version of Oxford Preliminary Test in order to be screened for their initial differences in writing performance. After receiving metalinguistic WCF on their scripts, participants were required to work on the coded feedback and try to eliminate the DM errors in their revised writing assignment. After collecting the scripts over an eight-week period, the content of written assignment was thematically analyzed using NVivo 21 Software for the additive, adversative, causal and temporal DMs, following Halliday and Hasan’s (Cohesion in English., 1976) typology. In a convergent mixed-methods design, the content analysis of the qualitative data showed a larger distribution of additive DM than adversative, causal, and temporal DMs in all participants’ written scripts. Exploring the possible impact of metalinguistic WCF on improving the DMs accuracy, analysis of the frequency count data with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) multivariate Chi-square test reported the fluctuation and unsystematic patterns of distribution for four types of DMs with no sign of significant long-term improvement in DMs accuracy after receiving metalinguistic WCF. These findings implied further research on practicing alternative WCF strategies focused on variety of error types in actual and virtual L2 writing environments.","Pourdana, Natasha; Nour, Payam; Yousefi, Fariba",Asian,524,9

At our institution, a regional comprehensive open‐access university in the Midwest, campus was open for in‐person courses with specific COVID precautions in place. Faculty were given substantial flexibility in how they restructured their courses, within constraints of socially distanced classrooms and accessibility for students. In prior semesters, our upper‐division undergraduate animal physiology course met fully in‐person for three 50‐minute lecture periods and one 3‐hour lab period per week. In fall 2020, a previously planned shift to a 4‐day class week had led to a change to two 80‐minute lecture periods and one 3‐hour lab period per week. To align with COVID mitigation policies, the class was further restructured to a hybrid format as follows: For lecture, half of the students attended the first in‐person class meeting of the week, and the other half attended the second in‐person class meeting of the week. The same topics were covered in both in‐person sessions in a given week and all in‐person classes were recorded for asynchronous viewing by students who did not attend in person that week. The remaining lecture content was posted online via instructor‐produced video lectures, outside videos or animations, and online homework. For lab sessions, half of the students attended in‐person each week, and the other half were assigned activities to complete remotely, such as PhysioEx lab simulations, online documentary videos, or low‐tech hands‐on activities that could be completed at home. In the 8(th) week of the semester, students were surveyed about use of course resources and attitudes about the course and the fall semester in general. A high percentage of survey respondents reported that they “frequently” accessed recordings of live class sessions (14/20 respondents) and online‐only video lectures (17/21 respondents). Technology issues such as slow internet or device incompatibility were reported by 57% of respondents. In response to open‐ended questions about positives and negatives of the course structure, examples of positives included accessibility of class recordings and other materials, flexibility, and “COVID‐friendly”. The majority of negative comments about the course structure involved a general dislike of online learning. The course grade distribution was within the range of grade distributions from prior offerings of the course by the same instructor, suggesting that student learning was not significantly impaired by the change in course structure, although negative impacts on individual students cannot be ruled out. Course structure‐related comments on university student evaluation forms included “easy to maintain studies during quarantine” and “I actually really enjoyed the format”. In conclusion, the hybrid format for this course was generally well‐received by this group of upper‐division biology majors and represents a viable strategy for adapting a biology majors course to the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Walton, Kristen; Baker, Jason; Grantham, Michael",FASEB J,524,1

The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of physical education programs on the physical activity and emotional well-being of primary school children. (2) Methods: The experimental group comprised 45 girls and 44 boys aged 6–7 years (First Grade) and 48 girls and 46 boys aged 8–9 years (Second Grade), while the control group comprised 43 girls and 46 boys aged 6–7 years (First Grade) and 47 girls and 45 boys aged 8–9 years (Second Grade). All children attended the same school. The Children’s Physical Activity Questionnaire was used, which is based on the Children’s Leisure Activities Study Survey questionnaire, which includes activities specific to young children (e.g., “playing in a playhouse”). Emotional well-being status was explored by estimating three main dimensions: somatic anxiety, personality anxiety, and social anxiety. The Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) was used. (3) Results: When analysing the pre-test results of physical activity of the 6–7- and 8–9-year-old children, it turned out that both the First Grade (92.15 MET, min/week) and Second Grade (97.50 MET, min/week) participants in the experimental group were physically active during physical education lessons. When exploring the results of somatic anxiety in EG (4.95 ± 1.10 points), both before and after the experiment, we established that somatic anxiety in EG was 4.55 ± 1.00 points after the intervention program, demonstrating lower levels of depression, seclusion, somatic complaints, aggression, and delinquent behaviours (F = 4.785, p < 0.05, P = 0.540). (4) Conclusions: We established that the properly constructed and purposefully applied eight-month physical education program had positive effects on the physical activity and emotional well-being of primary school children (6–7 and 8–9 years) in three main dimensions: somatic anxiety, personality anxiety, and social anxiety. Our findings suggest that the eight-month physical education program intervention was effective at increasing levels of physical activity. Changes in these activities may require more intensive behavioural interventions with children or upstream interventions at the family and societal levels, as well as at the school environment level.

OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence, severity, nature, and clinical consequences of in-stent stenosis on angiographic follow-up after treatment with the PED. METHODS A retrospective study of patients who underwent aneurysm treatment with the PED was conducted. In-stent stenosis was assessed on subsequent follow-up angiography. Intimal hyperplasia was defined as a uniform growth process beyond the limits of the metallic mesh at <25%. In-stent stenosis represented an area of parent vessel narrowing, most often focal, graded as mild (25%-50%), moderate (50%-75%), or severe (>75%). RESULTS Between June 2011 and April 2015, 80 patients were treated with the PED. Angiographic follow-up was available for 51 patients (representing 76% of available or 64% of all patients). Mean follow-up was 12.5 months. In-stent stenosis was detected in 5 patients (9.8%) at a median of 6 months. Stenosis was mild in 4 of 5 (80%) and moderate in 1 of 5 (20%) patients.

Additional follow-up angiography was available in 2 of 5 stenosis patients showing marked improvement. Sixteen patients (31%) had intimal hyperplasia, and 28 patients (55%) had no stenosis. Asymptomatic stent occlusion occurred in 2 patients (4%) related to medication noncompliance. CONCLUSION Treatment with the PED was associated with a 9.8% rate of in-stent stenosis, detected on first angiographic follow-up, at a median of 6 months. None were symptomatic or required re-treatment, and they showed significant improvement on follow-up.

We aimed to evaluate the existing evidence that maternal exposures during pregnancy have an impact on the subsequent bone health among offspring in young adults aged between 16 and 30 years. The protocol is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID: CRD42019126890). The search was conducted up to 2 April 2019. We included seven observational prospective cohort studies that examined the association between maternal dietary factors, vitamin D concentration, age, preeclampsia, and smoking with any bone indices among offspring. The results indicated that high concentrations of maternal vitamin D; low fat intake; and high intakes of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium may increase the bone mineral density in offspring at age 16. Evidence also suggests that the offspring of younger mothers may have a higher peak bone mass. It remains inconclusive whether there is an influence of preeclampsia or maternal smoking on bone health among young adults. Our assessment of internal validity warrants a cautious interpretation of these results, as all of the included studies were judged to have serious risks of bias. High-quality studies assessing whether prenatal prognostic factors are associated with bone health in young adults are needed.","Jensen, Karina H; Riis, Kamilla R; Abrahamsen, Bo; Händel, Mina N",Nutrients,524,20

In randomized controlled trials, Heplisav-B demonstrated seroprotection rates (SPR) of 90-95% versus 65-80% for Engerix-B. No studies have included people with HIV (PWH), and the SPR and its predictors in this population are unknown. SETTING Quaternary care center HIV clinic. METHODS This retrospective cohort study evaluated PWH aged >18 years without current HBV seroprotection (anti-HBV surface antibody level <10 mIU/mL) who were administered Heplisav-B. Patients without post-immunization titers were excluded. The primary outcome was the SPR, the proportion of participants with HBV seroprotection at any point following the first vaccination. RESULTS Among 64 PWH included, median time to anti-HBs measurement after vaccination was 13 weeks. Median age was 58 years, 81% were men, and 95% had a viral load <200. The SPR was 81% in the entire cohort (and 86% in those without significant non-HIV immunosuppression), 79% in those with no prior HBV vaccination and no anti-HBc positivity, and 84% in those with prior vaccine non-response. Lower current and nadir CD4+ counts were associated with progressively lower seroprotection. CONCLUSION In the first single-center retrospective study of Heplisav-B in PWH, the SPR compared favorably to the SPR seen among PWH from prior HBV vaccines across key subgroups. Given these findings, Heplisav-B should be considered for expanded use for HBV vaccination in PWH. Further research on the effectiveness of a repeat vaccination series or higher dosing in non-responders is needed.","Schnittman, Samuel R; Zepf, Roland; Cocohoba, Jennifer; Sears, David",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,524,1

BACKGROUND The impact of SPLC on improving cosmesis, body image, pain, and QoL has not been evaluated in double-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCT). This approach therefore remains controversial. METHODS Between October 2011 and February 2014, 110 patients from 2 centers were randomly assigned to SPLC (n = 55) or 4PLC (n = 55). Primary endpoints were a validated cosmesis (3-24 points) and body image (5-20 points) score after 3 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included operative duration, postoperative pain, complications, QoL, and length of hospital stay. Patients, physicians, and nurses were blinded until the seventh postoperative day. RESULTS Demographics were equally distributed between both groups (mean age: 46 years, SD: 14, 62 females, 34 males). The SPLC-group showed superior mean cosmesis and body image compared with the 4PLC-group at 12-weeks (21 vs 16, P < 0.001 and 5 vs 6, P = 0.013, respectively) and at 1-year (24 vs 16, P < 0.001 and 5 vs 6, P < 0.017, respectively). Operation duration was longer in the SPLC-group (mean 101 vs 90 minutes, p = 0.031). Although postoperative pain was less in the SPLC-group (mean VAS 1 vs 2, p = 0.005), there were no differences in complications, and length of hospital-stay. CONCLUSIONS This is the first multicenter double-blinded RCT reporting superior short- and long-term cosmetic and body image, postoperative pain, and QoL in SPLC compared with 4PLC. Although cost-effectiveness is still a subject of ongoing debate, SPLC should be offered to patients undergoing surgery for benign gallbladder disease.","Lurje, Georg; Raptis, Dimitri Aristotle; Steinemann, Daniel Christian; Amygdalos, Iakovos; Kambakamba, Patryk; Petrowsky, Henrik; Lesurtel, Mickaël; Zehnder, Adrian; Wyss, Roland; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Breitenstein, Stefan",Annals of surgery,524,20

Since the development and role out of NEWS2, its ability to predict mortality has been assessed in several settings, although to date not within an undifferentiated ED population. METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study of all adult ED attendees at two EDs in Northern England, between March and November 2019. Multilevel multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted on patient episode data to assess the relationship between mortality at 2, 7 and 30 days from attendances; and maximum NEWS2, adjusting for age, sex, arrival mode and triage priority. RESULTS Data were collected from 91 871 valid patient episodes associated with 64 760 patients. NEWS2 was a significant predictor of mortality at 2 days (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.58 to 1.93); at 7 days (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.59 to 1.80); at 30 days (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.52 to 1.64). For the analyses of categorised NEWS2, NEWS2 of 2-20 was significantly associated with mortality at 2, 7 and 30 days compared with none assigned: OR 3.54 (95% CI 2.15 to 5.85) at 2 days; OR 6.05 (95% CI 3.92 to 9.34) at 7 days; OR 12.4 (95% CI 7.91 to 19.3) at 30 days. Increasing age, male sex, arrival by ambulance and higher triage categories were also associated with significantly increased mortality. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.963, 0.946 and 0.915, respectively, were recorded for mortality outcomes, with optimum likelihood ratios associated with a trigger of 4 NEWS2 points. CONCLUSIONS NEWS2 is an effective predictor of mortality for patients presenting to the ED. Findings suggest that maximum NEWS2 of 4 and over may be the best trigger point for escalation of treatment. Findings also suggest a NEWS2 of 0-1 can identify a very low-risk group within the ED.","Masson, Huw; Stephenson, John",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,524,7

The majority of individuals infected are multiplying. The government takes aggressive steps to quarantine people, people exposed to infection, and clinical trials for treatment. Subsequently recommends critical care for the aged, children, and health-care personnel. While machine learning methods have been previously used to augment clinical decisions, there is now a demand for ""Emergency ML."" With rapidly growing datasets, there also remain important considerations when developing and validating ML models. METHODS This paper reviews the recent study that applies machine-learning technology addressing Corona virus-related disease issues' challenges in different perspectives. The report also discusses various treatment trials and procedures on Corona virus-related disease infected patients providing insights to physicians and the public on the current treatment challenges. RESULTS The paper provides the individual with insights into certain precautions to prevent and control the spread of this deadly disease.

64528,64528,64528,Are Eating Disorders Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,19.515896,9.132868,2017,"CONTEXT Advance care planning (ACP) conversations represent an important physician skill, a need further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most resident ACP training occurs in inpatient, settings, often featuring goals of care (GOC) conversations during a crisis. Outpatient clinics are valuable but underutilized settings to provide skills training for residents, yet little research has been done in these spaces. OBJECTIVE We sought to (1) create an ACP curriculum harnessing the principles of a community of practice in a virtual format, and (2) obtain residents' perspectives regarding their skills and confidence in having early GOC conversations in the outpatient setting. METHODS We interviewed 48 internal medicine residents using questionnaires, reflective narratives, and transcripts of debrief conversations. We created a virtual curriculum during the ambulatory week which included didactics, virtual role plays, ACP phone conversations with five patients, and group debriefs. Quantitative data were analyzed for changes in resident confidence. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis, guided by instructor field notes. RESULTS Residents reported decreased confidence in navigating advance directive conversations following training [Z=2.24, p=0.03, r = 0.33]. Resident reflections indicated that they felt more practiced at inpatient late GOC conversation skills, and that these skills were not fully transferable to the outpatient early GOC setting. Residents also endorsed the ambulatory environment as the best space for ACP conversations. CONCLUSIONS This study illustrates the feasibility of a virtual format for ACP curriculum. The virtual community of practice created space for a metacognitive unmasking of prior resident unconscious incompetence. Also, inpatient, crisis-oriented late GOC conversation skills may translate poorly to the outpatient setting requiring early and ongoing GOC skills. Residents need more training to navigate ACP conversations in ambulatory environments.","Mills, Sarah; Cioletti, Anne; Gingell, Gareth; Ramani, Subha",Journal of pain and symptom management,524,7
64571,64571,64571,Outpatient kidney recovery after acute kidney injury requiring dialysis: a systematic review protocol.,19.254135,8.981458,2019,"BACKGROUND Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub-Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a ""lure and kill"" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide-based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person-years; low-certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from -0.46 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low-certainty evidence). Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.","Furnival-Adams, Joanna; Olanga, Evelyn A; Napier, Mark; Garner, Paul",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,524,31

Endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) is a replication-defective provirus found in species belonging to the Felis genus, which includes the domestic cat (Felis catus). There have been few studies examining interaction between enFeLV genotype and FeLV progression. We examined point-in-time enFeLV and FeLV viral loads, as well as occurrence of FeLV/enFeLV recombinants (FeLV-B), to determine factors relating to clinical disease in a closed breeding colony of cats during a natural infection of FeLV. Coinfections with feline foamy virus (FFV), feline gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV-1), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) were also documented and analyzed for impact on cat health and FeLV disease. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used to measure interactions among disease parameters. Progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B presence were associated with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral loads. Female cats were more likely to have progressive disease and FeLV-B. Conversely, enFeLV copy number was higher in male cats and negatively associated with progressive FeLV disease. Males were more likely to have abortive FeLV disease. FFV proviral load was found to correlate positively with higher FeLV proviral and plasma viral load, detection of FeLV-B, and FCoV status. Male cats were much more likely to be infected with FcaGHV-1 than female cats. This analysis provides insights into the interplay between endogenous and exogenous FeLV during naturally occurring disease and reveals striking variation in the infection patterns among four chronic viral infections of domestic cats.IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses are harbored by many animals, and their interactions with exogenous retroviral infections have not been widely studied. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a relevant model system to examine this question, as endogenous and exogenous forms of the virus exist. In this analysis of a large domestic cat breeding colony naturally infected with FeLV, we documented that enFeLV copy number was higher in males and inversely related to FeLV viral load and associated with better FeLV disease outcomes. Females had lower enFeLV copy numbers and were more likely to have progressive FeLV disease and FeLV-B subtypes. FFV viral load was correlated with FeLV progression. FFV, FcaGHV-1, and FeLV displayed markedly different patterns of infection with respect to host demographics. This investigation revealed complex coinfection outcomes and viral ecology of chronic infections in a closed population.","Powers, Jordan A; Chiu, Elliott S; Kraberger, Simona J; Roelke-Parker, Melody; Lowery, Isabella; Erbeck, Katelyn; Troyer, Ryan; Carver, Scott; VandeWoude, Sue",Journal of virology,524,26

However, it should be noted that very limited data are available for any of the modified suture designs used in this field, and much of what has been published is based on the experience of a single user. The author has used the bidirectionally barbed Quill Knotless Tissue-Closure Device (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), the most common barbed suture in both facial and other aesthetic plastic surgery procedures, with considerable success in various open aesthetic facial procedures, including suspension of the brow and midface, platysmaplasty, and lateral neck suspension. It is the author's experience that completion of 1 to 2 cases with this technology is sufficient to achieve competency in the closure techniques discussed in this article and that time savings can be realized using this device in various breast and body contouring procedures, including mastopexy, reduction mammoplasty, abdominoplasty, bodylift, and brachioplasty.","Paul, Malcolm D",Aesthetic surgery journal,524,16

This has led to controversy on the choice between a forward-viewing and side-viewing endoscope for performing the procedure. A previous case series from Asia reported a high rate of success with a cap-fitted ERCP technique. To our knowledge, the utility of cap-assisted ERCP with a forward-viewing gastroscope when other techniques fail has not been reported. We describe and demonstrate a novel rescue approach using a cap-fitted, forward-viewing gastroscope in patients with Billroth II anatomy, when attempts with duodenoscopes, pediatric colonoscopes, and gastroscopes previously failed. METHODS Retrospective case series. Inclusion criteria were: (a) documented Billroth II anatomy; and (b) use of cap-assisted ERCP as a rescue intervention on the first endoscopic encounter after failed attempts to perform ERCP with a duodenoscope. Patients were excluded if they successfully underwent ERCP with a duodenoscope. One advanced endoscopist and one advanced endoscopy fellow performed all but one of the procedures. RESULTS Five cap-assisted ERCP procedures were performed in three patients with Billroth II anatomy. A wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic maneuvers were technically feasible and successful, including the endoscopic treatment of an afferent limb perforation caused by a duodenoscope. CONCLUSIONS Cap-assisted ERCP is a novel and underutilized technique that adds to the armamentarium of experienced therapeutic endoscopists. This approach may help ensure a successful endoscopic outcome and spare patients with Billroth II anatomy a percutaneous or surgical approach when ERCP with a duodenoscope, pediatric colonoscope or non-cap-fitted gastroscope fails.","Anastassiades, Constantinos P; Salah, Wajeeh; Pauli, Eric M; Marks, Jeffrey M; Chak, Amitabh",Surgical endoscopy,524,8

The exponential increase of global aquaculture has raised the number of research studies aimed at demonstrating the sensitivity of aquatic animals in confined environments. The development of a real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry methods were investigated to evaluate the presence, localization, and quantity of biomarkers of oxidative stress in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). In particular, stress tests such as manipulation and temperature changes were conducted through molecular methods to identify the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in stressed animals compared with a control group. The immunohistochemical technique was also applied to locate and study the trends-levels of nitrotyrosine (NT), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in different tissues from stressed animals and control group. The presence of the rodlet cell (RCs) was evaluated by histology in both a control and stressed group. Our results show that the real-time PCR method developed is specific for the evaluated target gene and that manipulation and temperature increase are strong stressors for animals. Relative quantification data revealed a gene expression increase of HSP70 in the stressed group of animals compared to the control group. The antibodies used for the immunohistochemical staining were efficient, and it was possible to appreciate the increase of immunoprecipitates in European sea bass either manipulated or stressed by temperature increase. The present study can be a starting point to allow the quantification of HSP70 and the identification of other stress biomarkers in D. labrax.","Fiocchi, Eleonora; Civettini, Michele; Carbonara, Pierluigi; Zupa, Walter; Lembo, Giuseppe; Manfrin, Amedeo",Fish physiology and biochemistry,524,1

METHODS Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry between the years of 1975 and 2016 were analyzed, which included 19,048 women with cancer of the anal canal. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression (HRs) was performed to examine the relative risk of dying among women with anal cancer. Multivariable odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to examine odds of highly fatal disease (death within 12 months from diagnosis). RESULTS Non-Hispanic Black women (n = 1694) had greater risk of dying when compared with non-Hispanic White women (n = 15,821) with anal cancer (HR = 1.26, CI: 1.17-1.35), independent of other prognostic indicators. Stratifying by age at diagnosis, risk of death was highest for non-Hispanic Black women diagnosed younger than age 50 years compared with non-Hispanic White women of similar age (HR = 1.60, CI: 1.34-1.89), and lowest for Hispanic women (n = 1533) older than 74 years at diagnosis (HR = 0.80, CI: 0.69-0.92). Stratifying by stage at diagnosis, disparities were not observed. When comparing across years of diagnoses, non-Hispanic Black women consistently had poorer survival compared with non-Hispanic White women diagnosed in the same year intervals. Finally, non-Hispanic Black women had greater odds of highly fatal disease (OR = 1.23, CI: 1.08-1.40) compared with non-Hispanic White women. CONCLUSION Non-Hispanic Black women with anal cancer continue to experience poorer survival compared with non-Hispanic White women, whereas disparities were not identified for Hispanic women.","Stenzel, Ashley E; Schlecht, Nicolas F; Moysich, Kirsten B",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,524,1

BACKGROUND FMT through colonoscopy is established as effective and safe in treating multiple recurrences of CDI, but consensus has not been established on delivery through oral capsules. STUDY A systematic literature search was performed with multiple databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify original studies including at least 10 patients that investigated the role of oral FMT capsules to treat rCDI. Cure rates were pooled by a random effects model and publication bias was assessed with the Egger test. Secondary analyses assessed for differences between capsule preparation (frozen vs. lyophilized stool) and delivery modality (capsule vs. colonoscopy). RESULTS Fifteen studies (12 case series and 3 randomized controlled trials) encompassing 763 patients were identified for inclusion. Significant variability existed in baseline patient characteristics and protocols. Meta-analysis of proportions showed efficacy of oral FMT capsules to be 0.821 (95% confidence interval: 0.762-0.874). No evidence for publication bias was found (P=0.51). Secondary analyses did not find significant differences in efficacy. Fourteen adverse events leading to death or hospitalization were noted, none of which were attributed to FMT. CONCLUSIONS Oral FMT capsules for rCDI are promising because of ease of administration and noninvasive delivery. We found an overall efficacy of 82.1% with a low rate of serious adverse events. Further studies are needed to optimize protocols and outcomes.","Du, Charles; Luo, Yuying; Walsh, Samantha; Grinspan, Ari",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,524,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS The original population of this case-series consisted of 75 patients with one crater-like defect and probing depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm. After flap elevation, defects were assigned to one characteristic class and treated by means of DBBMC. Following healing, patients were enrolled in an individualized supportive periodontal/peri-implant (SPT) program. RESULTS Fifty-one patients reached the 5-year examination, as 11 patients were lost to follow-up and 13 implants were removed. Overall treatment success was registered in 29 patients (45.3%). Mean PD and BOP significantly decreased at one year and remained stable for the rest of observation period. No correlation was found between implant survival rate and defect configuration (p=0.213). Patients, who did not fully adhere to the SPT, experienced more complications and implant loss than those who regularly attended recall appointments (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS The proposed reconstructive treatment resulted in a high 5-year implant survival rate in patients who fully adhered to SPT.

While some more obviously untrustworthy sources may be easier for social media filters to identify and remove, an early feature was the cobranding of COVID-19 misinformation with other types of misinformation. To examine this, the top 10 Instagram posts (in English) were collected every day for 10 days (April 21-30th, 2020) for each of the hashtags #hoax, #governmentlies, and #plandemic. The #hoax was selected first as it is commonly used in conspiracy theory posts, and #governmentlies because it was the most commonly cotagged with #hoax. For comparison, we selected #plandemic as the most popular cotagged hashtag that was clearly COVID-19-related. This resulted in 300 Instagram posts available for our analysis. We conducted a content analysis by coding the themes contained in the posts, both for the images and the text caption shared by the Instagram users (including hashtags). The broad theme of general mistrust was the most common, including the idea that the government and/or media has fabricated or hidden information pertaining to COVID-19. Conspiracy theories were the second-most frequent theme among posts. Overall, COVID-19 was frequently presented in association with authority-questioning beliefs. Developing an understanding of how the public shares misinformation on COVID-19 alongside conspiracy theories and authority-questioning statements can aid public health officials and policymakers in limiting the spread of potentially life-threatening health misinformation.","Quinn, Emma K; Fazel, Sajjad S; Peters, Cheryl E","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",524,19

Clinical symptoms include progressive paraparesis, paresthesias, bladder, and bowel disturbances. The pathophysiology of SDAVFs is not well elucidated. Microneurosurgery and endovascular techniques are established treatment modalities for permanent fistula occlusion, which are oftentimes accompanied by an amelioration of neurological deficits in the long run. Here, we report our interdisciplinary neurosurgical/neuroradiological management strategy of SDAVFs in 32 patients who were evaluated retrospectively. We focused on clinical presentation, microneurosurgical and interventional technique, early, and late neurological results. Quality of life (QoL) was additionally assessed in 12 patients at last follow-up. We discuss the results against the background of the current literature. Our series and the literature indicate that clinical outcome after treatment of SDAVF is favorable in general. Both neurosurgical and neurointerventional therapies appear to be safe and effective, but short-term neurological deterioration after the intervention constitutes an as-of-yet unsolved problem. Beyond age and preoperative neurological state, presence of comorbidities had a significant influence on neurological outcome in our study sample. Self-assessed physical and mental QoL at long-term follow-up was reduced in quite a number of patients and was associated with a poorer neurological result as well as presence of comorbidities.

Being resource-intensive, judicious use and optimising the outcomes of this precious resource is important. This retrospective, explanatory, observational study aimed to quantify associations between factors and outcome after pulmonary ECMO in children. METHODS This study included 39 consecutive ECMO runs in 38 children performed for pulmonary indications at our hospital from 2008 to 2018. Indications included acute respiratory distress syndrome, infection, drowning, meconium aspiration and pulmonary hypertension, among others. Depending on the need for haemodynamic support, 21 patients (53.8%) received veno-venous ECMO, while 18 (46.2%) received veno-arterial ECMO. We sought to compare the 11 non-survivors with the 27 survivors with respect to time-independent and time-dependent variables. Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards models were used. Threshold analysis was done using the “minimum p-value approach”. RESULTS 27/39 (69%) ECMO runs could be weaned; 27/38 (71%) patients were discharged. 20/27 (74%) survivors had unremarkable neurological status, six (22%) had mild findings (convulsions, muscular hypotony, neuropathy) and one (4%) had a hemi-syndrome at discharge. Univariate analyses showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.48 for log(pH) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 1.02, p = 0.055) and an HR of 4.48 for log(lactate) (95% CI 1.92 to 10.48, p = 0.0005). Multivariate models showed an HR of 0.99 for log(pH) (95% CI 0.43 to 2.26, p = 0.98) and an HR of 4.44 for log(lactate) (95% CI 1.65 to 11.95, p = 0.003). Threshold analysis showed lactate >4.1 to be associated with mortality, with an HR of 32.7 (95% CI 4.8 to 221.7, p = 0.0002). This threshold should, however, be interpreted very cautiously. Evidence of an association between serum lactate at 24 hours and mortality was found (difference between survivors and non-survivors: −2.78, 95% CI −5.36 to −0.20, p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS The results of ECMO for pulmonary indications are very good. Serum lactate may be an early prognostic indicator.","Amodeo, Antonio; Erdil, Tugba; Vanetta, Chiara; Steigmiller, Klaus; Schmiady, Martin; Schweiger, Martin; Pretre, Rene; Dave, Hitendu",Swiss medical weekly,524,27

The main goal of this study was to analyze the differences in self-reported physical activity of people with complete spinal cord injuries between the time prior to the COVID-19 lockdown and the lockdown period itself. METHODS A sample of 20 participants with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries completed the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS The results showed differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown measurements in total self-reported PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.28), recreational PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.18) and occupational PA (z=-2.03; P=0.042; d=0.55). Nevertheless, no differences were found in housework PA between the two time periods. Furthermore, the results showed differences in total minutes (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.75), minutes spent on recreational activities (z=-3.82; P<0.001; d=1.56) and minutes spent on occupational activities (z=-2.032; P=0.042; d=0.55) of moderate/vigorous intensity. CONCLUSIONS Individuals with thoracic spinal cord injuries who were full-time manual wheelchair users displayed lower levels of PA during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The results suggest that the prohibition and restrictions on carrying out recreational and/or occupational activities are the main reasons for this inactivity. Physical activity promotion strategies should be implemented within this population to lessen the effects of this physical inactivity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marco-Ahulló, Adrià; Montesinos-Magraner, Lluïsa; González, Luis-Millán; Morales, José; Bernabéu-García, Jose Antonio; García-Massó, Xavier",The journal of spinal cord medicine,524,24

Alkaline phosphatase (AP) from the psychrophilic marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus (VAP) is characterized by an analogous large surface loop in each monomer, referred to as the large-loop, that hovers over the active site of the other monomer. It presumably has a role in the high catalytic efficiency of VAP which accompanies its extremely low thermal stability. Here, we designed several different variants of VAP with the aim of removing inter-subunit interactions at the dimer interface. Breaking the inter-subunit contacts from one residue in particular (Arg336) reduced the temperature stability of the catalytically potent conformation and caused a 40% drop in catalytic rate. The high catalytic rates of enzymes from cold-adapted organisms are often associated with increased dynamic flexibility. Comparison of the relative B-factors of the R336L crystal structure to that of the wild-type confirmed surface flexibility was increased in a loop on the opposite monomer, but not in the large-loop. The increase in flexibility resulted in a reduced catalytic rate. The large-loop increases the area of the interface between the subunits through its contacts and may facilitate an alternating structural cycle demanded by a half-of-sites reaction mechanism through stronger ties, as the dimer oscillates between high affinity (active) or low phosphoryl-group affinity (inactive).","Hjörleifsson, Jens Guðmundur; Helland, Ronny; Magnúsdóttir, Manuela; Ásgeirsson, Bjarni",FEBS open bio,524,31

METHODS In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0 %, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0 %, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8 % (11/16), 77.8 % (7/9), 100.0 % (2/2), specificity of 85.7 % (12/14), 76.2 % (16/21), 92.9 % (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 % (23/30), 76.7 % (23/30), 93.3 % (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","Lu, Wuzhu; Zhang, Shushan; Chen, Binghui; Chen, Jiaxin; Xian, Jianzhong; Lin, Yuhong; Shan, Hong; Su, Zhong Zhen",Ultraschall in der Medizin,524,1

We analyzed the following parameters for all the patients: age, body mass index, operative time, blood loss, change in hemoglobin level, vaginal stump suture time and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The general characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in blood loss, hemoglobin change, length of postoperative hospital stay and complication rate. However, the mean operative time of the single-port group was significantly longer than that of the four-port group (93.5±24.0min vs. 78.7±17.4min; P=0.011). The operative time for vaginal stump suture was profoundly decreased with experience in the single-port group.

OBJECTIVE We examined whether maternal plasma concentrations of nicotinamide, tryptophan or nine related tryptophan metabolites during pregnancy were associated with risk of development of infant eczema, wheeze, rhinitis or allergic sensitization. METHODS In the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study, we analysed the associations between maternal plasma levels of nicotinamide, tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites at 26-28 weeks gestation and allergic outcomes collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires at multiple timepoints and skin prick testing to egg, milk, peanut and mites at age 18 months. Multivariate analysis was undertaken adjusting for all metabolites measured, and separately adjusting for relevant demographic and environmental exposures. Analyses were also adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery method. RESULTS Tryptophan metabolites were evaluated in 976/1247 (78%) women enrolled in GUSTO. In multivariate analysis including all metabolites, maternal plasma 3-hydrokynurenine was associated with increased allergic sensitization at 18 months (AdjRR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.2 for highest quartile) but the association with nicotinamide was not significant (AdjRR 1.8, 95% CI 0.9-3.6). In analysis adjusting for other exposures, both 3-hydrokynurenine and nicotinamide were associated with increased allergic sensitization (AdjRR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6 for both metabolites). High maternal plasma nicotinamide was associated with increased infant eczema diagnosis by 6 and 12 months, which was not significant when adjusting for all metabolites measured, but was significant when adjusting for relevant environmental and demographic exposures. Other metabolites measured were not associated with allergic sensitisation or eczema, and maternal tryptophan metabolites were not associated with offspring rhinitis and wheeze. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Maternal tryptophan metabolism during pregnancy may influence the development of allergic sensitization and eczema in infants.","Lau, Hui Xing; El Heis, Sarah; Yap, Qai Ven; Chan, Yiong Huak; Tan, Cheryl Pei Ting; Karnani, Neerja; Tan, Karen Mei Ling; Tham, Elizabeth Huiwen; Goh Eng Neo, Anne; Oon Hoe, Teoh; Tan, Kok Hian; Johan, Gunnar Eriksson; Chong, Yap Seng; Chong, Mary Foong-Fong; Van Bever, Hugo; Lee, Bee Wah; Shek, Lynette P; Godfrey, Keith M; Loo, Evelyn Xiu Ling",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,524,1

Airway management is an essential skill for both physicians and nurses who may be confronted with a critically ill patient, because in the emergency department the airway is not exclusively managed by medical personnel. Several studies have shown that other healthcare professionals are not any less efficient in securing the airway. METHODS Ninety-six graduates from medical and nursing faculties comprised our study population. After a brief educational session, participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups to secure the airway in manikins with 3 techniques: LMA (The Laryngeal Mask Company Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK) insertion and intubation with the Macintosh blade and with a videolaryngoscope (GlideScope, Verathon Inc, Bothell, WA). The number of attempts until the first successful intubation, time required for the first successful attempt, and severity of dental trauma were assessed. RESULTS No statistically significant difference was observed between physicians and nurses in the number of attempts and in the time required for the first successful attempt with any of the 3 techniques studied. From the 3 techniques studied, LMA placement was the fastest (P < .001). No significant difference was observed between physicians and nurses in the severity of dental trauma. CONCLUSION Nurses are as efficient as physicians in managing the airway safely and adequately with the 3 different techniques in manikins.","Xanthos, Theodoros; Bassiakou, Eleni; Koudouna, Eleni; Stroumpoulis, Konstantinos; Vlachos, Ioannis; Johnson, Elizabeth O; Vasileiou, Panagiotis; Papalois, Apostolos; Iacovidou, Nicoletta",Heart & lung : the journal of critical care,524,16

The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of MI among physicians and nurses in mainland China during the pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was performed via an online survey conducted from March 27, 2020 to April 26, 2020. The 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional version (MISS-HP) was administered along with measures of clinician mental health and burnout. A total of 3,006 physicians and nurses who completed the questionnaire were included in the final analysis. Unconditional logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the associations, including that between COVID-19 patient exposure and the risk of moral injury. Results: MISS-HP scores strongly and positively correlated with depression, anxiety, low well-being, and burnout symptoms. The estimated prevalence of MI in the total sample was 41.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [39.3%, 43.0%]. HCPs providing medical care to COVID-19 patients experienced a 28% greater risk of MI than those providing medical care to patients without the coronavirus (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI [1.05, 1.56], p = .01). Conclusions: A significant proportion of HCPs in mainland China are at risk for significant MI symptoms as well as mental health problems and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. MI symptoms are strongly correlated with higher clinician burnout, greater psychological distress, and lower level of subjective well-being. Effective strategies are needed to address MI and other mental health problems in frontline health care workers treating those with and without COVID-19 disease.

It is likely that an impaired autonomic vasomotor response to the hemodynamic stress of tachycardia is the determinant of hemodynamic changes leading to cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope. In this regard, tilt-table test may detect abnormalities in the autonomic nervous function and predict the occurrence of syncope during SVT. Electrophysiology studies may reproduce the SVT, distinguish it from other life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and exclude other causes of syncope. Not infrequently mixed syncope mechanisms are revealed during the above diagnostic workup raising doubts about the operating mechanism in the clinical setting. In such cases of uncertainty, an implantable loop recorder, providing long-term cardiac monitoring, may play a pivotal role in the establishment of the diagnosis, confirming the association of an arrhythmic event with the symptom. Herein, we present four such cases with recurrent unexplained syncope finally attributed to paroxysmal SVT guiding them to a potentially radical treatment through radiofrequency catheter ablation.","Soulaidopoulos, Stergios; Arsenos, Petros; Doundoulakis, Ioannis; Tsiachris, Dimitrios; Antoniou, Christos-Konstantinos; Dilaveris, Polychronis; Fragakis, Nikolaos; Sotiriadou, Melani; Sideris, Skevos; Kordalis, Athanasios; Laina, Ageliki; Tousoulis, Dimitrios; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Gatzoulis, Konstantinos A","Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc",524,8

The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7 %) and B (23.7 %) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7 %) being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis.","Mitra, Namita; Cernicchiaro, Natalia; Torres, Siddartha; Li, Feng; Hause, Ben M",The Journal of general virology,524,16

In addition, we sought to reveal the relationship between myocardial injury and clinical outcomes such as death, intensive care unit uptake and hospital stay, and the relationship between inflammatory parameters and cardiac biomarkers in a cardiovascular perspective. METHODS Patients admitted to the emergency department in the Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, with laboratory or clinically and radiologically confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study, which was conducted from 11 March to 10 April 2020. The demographic (age and gender) and clinical (symptoms, co-morbidities, treatments, complications and outcomes) characteristics, laboratory findings, and results of cardiac examinations (cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiography) of patients during hospitalisation were collected from their medical records by two investigators. Data were analysed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM). A two-sided p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis began on 11 April 2020. RESULTS Mortality and intensive care unit admission rates were statistically significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than in those without. There was a positive correlation between levels of high-sensitivity TNT and fibrinogen, D-dimer, ferritin, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (r = 0.24, p < 0.01; r = 0.37, p < 0.01; r = 0.25, p < 0.01, r = 0.34, p < 0.01; r = 0.31, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The first general data of our 309 patients regarding low mortality and intensive care admission rates, and particular treatment algorithms specific to our centre should be helpful in determining better treatment strategies in the future. Our study emphasises the importance and frequency of cardiovascular outcomes, and the significance of some cardiac biomarkers in predicting COVID-19 prognosis.","Medetalibeyoglu, Alpay; Emet, Samim; Senkal, Naci; Aydogan, Mehmet; Kose, Murat; Tukek, Tufan",Cardiovascular journal of Africa,524,28

There is no standardized approach for integration with hospitals for outbreak response. Previously, we described collaboration between a hospital and regional facilities. As a component of our COVID-19 Outbreak Response, we describe the impact of virtual daily rounds as an efficient and effective tool for facility outbreak in Central Virginia. Methods: At this facility, 82 (60%) residents were infected. Our team rapidly deployed technology to support staff at the facility. Virtual daily rounds created a systematic approach for patient care. The goals of virtual daily rounds include (1) efficiently facilitating HIPAA-compliant communication between nursing and all licensed independent providers, (2) rapid identification of clinical decline, (3) facilitation of care escalation, (4) facilitating bidirectional transfers, and (5) rapid and efficient identification of patients appropriate for telemedicine pulmonary consultation. Results: The outbreak remained active 6 weeks; 82 of 136 (60%) residents were infected, and 36 (44%) COVID-19 positive residents were seen by telemedicine consultation. Fifty-seven (70%) residents remained in-facility for treatment. Twenty-one residents died (15%); 10 in facility, 11 in hospital. Of those seen in telemedicine consultation, 24 (69%) remained on the treat-in-place protocol with goal-concordant care. These hospitalization and mortality rates are significantly lower than similar outbreaks reported. Discussion and Conclusion: We have since instituted this system at seven other facilities. A model of virtual daily rounding holds promise for decreasing mortality/hospitalization in this vulnerable population through systematically identifying patients most appropriate for telemedicine and cultivating close collaboration between hospitals and nursing homes.","Archbald-Pannone, Laurie; Harris, Drew; Steele, Rebecca; Kaur, Jasveen; Albero, Kim; Mutter, Justin; Cattell-Gordon, David; Rheuban, Karen",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,524,0

The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer – BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech's activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","Amanpour, S",Archives of Razi Institute,524,8

We conducted time-resolved sampling during a storm event at the Ammer River, Southwest Germany, which is representative for small river systems in densely populated areas of temperate climate. From two sampling sites suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water were separately analyzed by a multi-analyte LC-MS-MS method for 97 environmentally relevant organic micropollutants and with two in-vitro bioassays. Oxidative stress response (AREc32) may become activated by various stressors covering a broad range of physico-chemical properties and aryl hydrocarbon receptor induction (AhR-CALUX) by hydrophobic compounds such as dioxins and dioxin-like molecules. Compound numbers, concentrations, their mass fluxes and associated effect fluxes increased substantially during the storm event. Micropollutants detected in water and on SPM pointed towards inputs from combined sewer overflow (e.g., caffeine, paracetamol), urban runoff (e.g., mecoprop, terbutryn) and agricultural areas (e.g., azoxystrobin, bentazone). Particle-facilitated transport of triphenylphosphate and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate accounted for up to 34 and 33% of the total mass flux despite SPM concentrations below 1 g L-1 . Effect fluxes attributed to SPM were similar or higher than in the water phase. The important role of SPM-bound transport emphasizes the need to consider not only concentrations but also mass and effect fluxes for surface water quality assessment and wastewater/stormwater treatment options.

On the contrary, there is no specific recommendation for the use of statin in patients with non-atherosclerotic stroke, e.g. strokes related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated whether statin treatment in patients with AF-related stroke is associated with improved survival and reduced risk for stroke recurrence and future cardiovascular events. METHODS All consecutive patients registered in the Athens Stroke Registry with AF-related stroke and no history of coronary artery disease nor clinically manifest peripheral artery disease were included in the analysis and categorized in two groups depending on whether statin was prescribed at discharge. The primary outcome was overall mortality; the secondary outcomes were stroke recurrence and a composite cardiovascular endpoint comprising of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm rupture or sudden cardiac death during the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS Among 1602 stroke patients, 404 (25.2%) with AF-related stroke were included in the analysis, of whom 102 (25.2%) were discharged on statin. On multivariate Cox-proportional-hazards model, statin treatment was independently associated with a lower mortality (hazard-ratio (HR): 0.49, 95%CI:0.26-0.92) and lower risk for the composite cardiovascular endpoint during the median 22 months follow-up (HR: 0.44, 95%CI:0.22-0.88), but not with stroke recurrence (HR: 0.47, 95%CI:0.22-1.01, p: 0.053). CONCLUSIONS In this long-term registry of patients with AF-related stroke, statin treatment was associated with improved survival and reduced risk for future cardiovascular events.","Ntaios, G; Papavasileiou, V; Makaritsis, K; Milionis, H; Manios, E; Michel, P; Lip, G Y H; Vemmos, K",International journal of cardiology,524,5

Apelin is a second catalytic substrate for ACE2 and functions as an inotropic and cardioprotective peptide. While an antagonistic relationship between the RAS and apelin has been proposed, such functional interplay remains elusive. Here we found that ACE2 was downregulated in apelin-deficient mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) rescued the impaired contractility and hypertrophy of apelin mutant mice, which was accompanied by restored ACE2 levels. Importantly, treatment with angiotensin 1-7 rescued hypertrophy and heart dysfunctions of apelin-knockout mice. Moreover, apelin, via activation of its receptor, APJ, increased ACE2 promoter activity in vitro and upregulated ACE2 expression in failing hearts in vivo. Apelin treatment also increased cardiac contractility and ACE2 levels in AT1R-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that ACE2 couples the RAS to the apelin system, adding a conceptual framework for the apelin-ACE2-angiotensin 1-7 axis as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.","Sato, Teruki; Suzuki, Takashi; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Kadowaki, Ayumi; Fukamizu, Akiyoshi; Liu, Peter P; Kimura, Akinori; Ito, Hiroshi; Penninger, Josef M; Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji",The Journal of clinical investigation,524,26

The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency, safety and the consumption of desflurane in LFA using constant FGF (1 L/min) and conventional LFA using high FGF (4 L/min) during the wash-in period. Eighty patients, who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, were enrolled in the study. Wash-in was accomplished with 1 L/min FGF (50% O2, 50% air) and 18% desflurane in group 1; and by 4 L/min FGF (50% O2, 50% air) and 6% desflurane in group 2. Throughout the surgery, the vaporizer was adjusted to maintain 0.6 to 0.8 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). The time required to reach 0.7 MAC was shorter in group 1 (160 seconds [135-181] vs 288 seconds [240-500], P < .001). In 6 patients in group 1 and 13 in group 2, vaporizer settings were adjusted to maintain 0.6 to 0.8 MAC (P = .048). Desflurane consumption in the first hour and total desflurane consumption were higher in group 2 (P < .001 and P = .012, respectively). The efficiency of anesthesia in both the first hour and in total was higher in group 1 (P < .001). It is safe, more efficient, and economical to use 1 L/min FGF during the wash-in period in LFA.","Arslan, Mahmut; Gişi, Gökçe; Öksüz, Gözen; Öksüz, Hafize; Bilal, Bora; Boran, Ömer Faruk; Çalışır, Feyza",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,524,20

These movements yield abrupt luminance changes on the retina, which elicit robust neural discharges at fixation onsets. Yet little is known about the spatial content of saccade transients. Here, we show that saccades redistribute spatial information within the temporal range of retinal sensitivity following two distinct regimes: saccade modulations counterbalance (whiten) the spectral density of natural scenes at low spatial frequencies and follow the external power distribution at higher frequencies. This redistribution is a consequence of saccade dynamics, particularly the speed/amplitude/duration relation known as the main sequence. It resembles the redistribution resulting from inter-saccadic eye drifts, revealing a continuum in the modulations given by different eye movements, with oculomotor transitions primarily acting by regulating the bandwidth of whitening. Our findings suggest important computational roles for saccade transients in the establishment of spatial representations and lead to testable predictions about their consequences for visual functions and encoding mechanisms.","Mostofi, Naghmeh; Zhao, Zhetuo; Intoy, Janis; Boi, Marco; Victor, Jonathan D; Rucci, Michele",Current biology : CB,524,16

This entry event is mediated by a set of essential entry glycoproteins, including glycoprotein D (gD), gHgL, and gB. gHgL and gB are conserved among herpesviruses, but gD is unique to the alphaherpesviruses and is not encoded by all alphaherpesviruses. gD is a receptor-binding protein, the heterodimer gHgL serves as a fusion regulator, and gB is a class III viral fusion protein. Sequential interactions among these glycoproteins are thought to trigger the virus to fuse at the right place and time. Structural studies of these glycoproteins from multiple alphaherpesviruses has enabled the design and interpretation of functional studies. The structures of gD in a receptor- bound and in an unliganded form reveal a conformational change in the C terminus of the gD ectodomain upon receptor binding that may serve as a signal for fusion. By mapping neutralizing antibodies to the gHgL structures and constructing interspecies chimeric forms of gHgL, interaction sites for both gD and gB on gHgL have been proposed. A comparison of the post fusion structure of gB and an alternative conformation of gB visualized using cryo- electron tomography suggests that gB undergoes substantial refolding to execute membrane fusion. Although these structures have provided excellent insights into the entry mechanism, many questions remain about how these viruses coordinate the interactions and conformational changes required for entry.","Cairns, Tina M; Connolly, Sarah A",Current issues in molecular biology,524,1

In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, an enhanced surveillance system of hospitalised COVID-19 patients was established by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Victorian Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance System Coordinating Centre. The system aimed to reduce workforce capacity constraints and increase situational awareness on the status of hospitalised patients. Methods The system was evaluated, using guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, against eight attributes: acceptability; data quality; flexibility; representativeness; simplicity; stability; timeliness; and usefulness. Evidence was generated from stakeholder consultation, participant observation, document review, systems review, issues log review and audits. Data were collected and analysed over a period of up to three months, covering pre- and post-implementation from March to June 2020. Results This system was rapidly established by leveraging established relationships and infrastructure. Stakeholders agreed that the system was important but was limited by a reliance on daily manual labour (including weekends), which impeded scalability. The ability of the system to perform well in each attribute was expected to shift with the severity of the pandemic; however, at the time of this evaluation, when there were an average 23 new cases per day (0.3 cases per 100,000 population per day), the system performed well. Conclusion This enhanced surveillance system was useful and achieved its key DHHS objectives during the COVID-19 public health emergency in Victoria. Recommendations for improvement were made to the current and future systems, including the need to plan alternatives to improve the system's scalability and to maintain stakeholder acceptability.","Curtis, Stephanie J; Cutcher, Zoe; Brett, Judith A; Burrell, Simon; Richards, Michael J; Hennessy, Daneeta; Gang, Rebecca F; Lau, Colleen L; Rowe, Stacey",Communicable diseases intelligence,524,1

There are several criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma to be eligible for liver transplantation, and it depends on main transplantation centers worldwide. Locoregional treatments and downstaging protocols are used for either to achieve these criteria or to prevent drop outs on the transplant waiting lists. But who can benefit from these bridging therapies effectively for the main purpose of curative treatment? Main contraindications are known for locoregional treatments like cirrhosis or low hepatic function, total main portal vein occlusion, and extrahepatic metastasis. HCCs, which are confined to liver but have high tumor burden, remains the main controversial issue. AIM On this aspect, we reviewed the literature for downstaging protocols for hepatocellular carcinoma with their effect on survival and recurrence rates after liver transplantation. CONCLUSION Although candidates for downstaging is still controversial, with the absence of main contraindications, LRT can be applied to selected HCCs, which have a certain degree of tumor burden.","Dirican, Abuzer; Karakas, Serdar",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,524,1

OBJECTIVE The objective was to examine changes in vitamin status after 2 bariatric surgical techniques. DESIGN A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 Scandinavian hospitals. The subjects were 60 superobese patients [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 50-60]. The surgical interventions were either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. All patients received multivitamins, iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements. Gastric bypass patients also received a vitamin B-12 substitute. The patients were examined before surgery and 6 wk, 6 mo, and 1 y after surgery. RESULTS Of 60 surgically treated patients, 59 completed the follow-up. After surgery, duodenal switch patients had lower mean vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and a steeper decline in thiamine concentrations than did the gastric bypass patients. Other vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin C, and vitamin E adjusted for serum lipids) did not change differently in the surgical groups, and concentrations were either stable or increased. Furthermore, duodenal switch patients had lower hemoglobin and total cholesterol concentrations and a lower BMI (mean reduction: 41% compared with 30%) than did gastric bypass patients 1 y after surgery. Additional dietary supplement use was more frequent among duodenal switch patients (55%) than among gastric bypass patients (26%). CONCLUSIONS Compared with gastric bypass, duodenal switch may be associated with a greater risk of vitamin A and D deficiencies in the first year after surgery and of thiamine deficiency in the initial months after surgery. Patients who undergo these 2 surgical interventions may require different monitoring and supplementation regimens in the first year after surgery.

We therefore wanted to estimate the ""true"" incidence of PJI in THA using several data sources. PATIENTS AND METHODS We searched the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register (DHR) for primary THAs performed between 2005 and 2011. Using the DHR and the Danish National Register of Patients (NRP), we identified first revisions for any reason and those that were due to PJI. PJIs were also identified using an algorithm incorporating data from microbiological, prescription, and clinical biochemistry databases and clinical findings from the medical records. We calculated cumulative incidence with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS 32,896 primary THAs were identified. Of these, 1,546 had first-time revisions reported to the DHR and/or the NRP. For the DHR only, the 1- and 5-year cumulative incidences of PJI were 0.51% (0.44-0.59) and 0.64% (0.51-0.79). For the NRP only, the 1- and 5-year cumulative incidences of PJI were 0.48% (0.41-0.56) and 0.57% (0.45-0.71). The corresponding 1- and 5-year cumulative incidences estimated with the algorithm were 0.86% (0.77-0.97) and 1.03% (0.87-1.22). The incidences of PJI based on the DHR and the NRP were consistently 40% lower than those estimated using the algorithm covering several data sources. INTERPRETATION Using several available data sources, the ""true"" incidence of PJI following primary THA was estimated to be approximately 40% higher than previously reported by national registries alone.","Gundtoft, Per Hviid; Overgaard, Søren; Schønheyder, Henrik Carl; Møller, Jens Kjølseth; Kjærsgaard-Andersen, Per; Pedersen, Alma Becic",Acta orthopaedica,524,1

The observed nitrate aerosols have not exhibited a significant decreasing trend and constituted a major fraction (about 20%) of the total PM2.5, although the surface-measured NO2 concentration has decreased by over 20%. The contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions mitigation to the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations and how to alleviate nitrate aerosols efficiently under the current situation still remains elusive. The WRF-Chem model simulations of a persistent and heavy PM pollution episode in January 2019 in the BTH reveal that NOX emissions mitigation does not help lower wintertime nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations under current conditions in the BTH. A 50% reduction in NOX emissions only decreases nitrate mass by 10.3% but increases PM2.5 concentrations by 3.2%, because the substantial O3 increase induced by NOX mitigation offsets the HNO3 loss and enhances sulfate and secondary organic aerosols formation. Our results are further consolidated by the occurrence of severe PM pollution in the BTH during the COVID-19 outbreak, with a significant reduction in NO2 concentration. Mitigation of NH3 emissions constitutes the priority measure to effectively lower the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH under current conditions, with 35.5% and 12.7% decrease, respectively, when NH3 emissions are reduced by 50%.","Li, Xia; Bei, Naifang; Hu, Bo; Wu, Jiarui; Pan, Yuepeng; Wen, Tianxue; Liu, Zirui; Liu, Lang; Wang, Ruonan; Li, Guohui",Environmental pollution,524,27

Orthopaedic podcasts, a burgeoning e-learning platform, continue to gain traction; however, there is a paucity of information regarding their coverage of topics and their distribution over time. Therefore, our analysis sought to (1) characterize podcast content related to orthopaedic surgery, and (2) evaluate the changes in the prevalence of orthopaedic podcasts over the past 15 years. METHODS Three common podcasting platforms (Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify) were queried using the key terms ""orthopaedic,"" ""orthopedic,"" and ""ortho"" in order to identify a list of podcasts that are related to orthopaedic surgery. For each unique orthopaedic podcast, the title, the show description, the number of episodes, the date of the first episode, the date of the most recent episode, and episode frequency were collected. Podcasts were then classified based on a predetermined list of podcast domains. The number of existing active (released within the last 3 months) orthopaedic podcasts was then trended on a monthly basis from 2011 to 2020. RESULTS Ninety-four unique podcasts met inclusion criteria, 62 of which remained active as of October 25, 2020. The most common podcast domains were ""general"" (38 [40.4%]) and ""clinical knowledge"" (20 [21.3%]). Among the assessed podcasts, 90 (95.7%) utilized an exclusively audio format. The majority of podcasts were based in the United States (89.4%), included introductory music (72.3%), and included interviews (63.8%). Most podcast hosts were practicing orthopaedic surgeons (52.1%). Between January 2016 and October 2020, the number of active orthopaedic surgery podcasts grew more than twelvefold (1,240%) at an average rate of roughly 1 new podcast each month (average, 1.0 podcast; standard deviation, 1.8).

Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells.","Flosbach, Markus; Oberle, Susanne G; Scherer, Stefanie; Zecha, Jana; von Hoesslin, Madlaina; Wiede, Florian; Chennupati, Vijaykumar; Cullen, Jolie G; List, Markus; Pauling, Josch K; Baumbach, Jan; Kuster, Bernhard; Tiganis, Tony; Zehn, Dietmar",Cell reports,524,1

For bacteriologists, the proteome of bacteria is much less complex than that of eukaryotic organisms. However, not all the different cell ""compartments"" are easily accessible, and the analysis of cell envelope proteins is particularly challenging. For the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, one of the main foodborne pathogen microorganisms, the study of surface proteins is crucial to better understand the mechanisms of pathogenicity, as well as adaptation/resistance to and persistence in hostile environments. The evolution of proteomic techniques, and particularly the possibility of separating and analyzing complex protein samples by off-gel (LC-MS/MS) versus in-gel (two-dimensional electrophoresis) approach, has opened the doors to new extraction and preparation methods to target the different subproteomes. Here, we describe three procedures to prepare and analyze intracellular, exocellular, and cell surface proteins: (1) the cell fractionation, based on cell broken and separation of protein subfractions by differential centrifugation; (2) the biotinylation, based on the labeling of cell surface proteins and their selective extraction; and (3) the enzymatic shaving by the action of trypsin on intact cells. These complementary methods allow to encompass all L. monocytogenes subproteomes for general profiling or target studies and could be applicable to other Gram-positive bacteria.","Santos, Tiago; Hébraud, Michel",Methods in molecular biology,524,1

It is generally accepted that a new procedure will undergo technical changes during its evolution; however, quantitative accounts of the process are limited. METHODS Multiple groups, including our own, have recently described a minimally-invasive approach to conventional kidney transplantation (KT) operation. Unique to our experience is a structured development of the technique within the confines of a safe surgical innovation framework - the IDEAL framework (idea, development, exploration, assessment, long-term monitoring; stages 0-4). We here provide a first-hand narrative of the progress of robotic KT operation from preclinical trial to clinical application. RESULTS Overall, 54 patients underwent robotic KT with regional hypothermia successfully. Major technical changes including selection of optimal patient position (flank vs. lithotomy), robotic instrumentation, vascular occlusion method (bulldog vs. tourniquet) and suture material (prolene vs. GoreTex) occurred early during the procedure development (IDEAL stage 0, preclinical). Minor technical changes such as utilization of the aortic punch for arteriotomy (case 3), use of barbed suture during ureteroneocystostomy (case 6) and extraperitonealization of the graft kidney (case 6) that increased the efficiency and safety of the procedure continued throughout procedure development (IDEAL stages 1-2, clinical stages). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that a surgical technique evolves continually; although, the majority of technical alterations occur early in the life-cycle of the procedure. Development of a new technique within the confines a structured surgical innovation framework allows for evidence based progression of the technique and may minimize the risk of harm to the patient.","Sood, Akshay; McCulloch, Peter; Dahm, Philipp; Ahlawat, Rajesh; Jeong, Wooju; Bhandari, Mahendra; Menon, Mani",International journal of surgery,524,1

These represent prototypical tumor suppressor syndromes where loss of a tumor suppressor gene-protein impairs the cell's ability to regulate cell proliferation. While clinical manifestations vary widely for each of these syndromes, tumors arising in the peripheral nerve sheath are a unifying feature. Clinical clues should prompt the clinician to recognize the underlying genetic syndrome and screen for associated tumors including, among others, plexiform neurofibromas and gliomas in NF1 and vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and spinal ependymomas in NF2. Improvements in mechanistic understanding of how the genetic mutations that underlie these syndromes contribute to tumor formation have led to new advances in targeted therapies. MEK inhibitors have shown promise for treating progressive plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. Bevacizumab has been shown to improve hearing and treat vestibular schwannomas in NF2.

This article aims to 1) bring together available long-term data of oral health birth cohort studies from the low, middle, and high-income countries worldwide and 2) describe similarities and differences among these studies. This work comprises 15 studies from all 5 continents. The most studied dental conditions and exposures are identified; findings are summarized; and methodological differences and similarities among studies are presented. Methodological strengths and weaknesses are also highlighted. Findings are summarized in 1) the negative impact of detrimental socioeconomic status on oral health changes over time, 2) the role of unfavorable patterns of dental visiting on oral health, 3) associations between general and oral health, 4) nutritional and dietary effects on oral health, and 5) intergenerational influences on oral health.

The concept was adopted in other hospitals and published as a case series. This is the first prospectively controlled randomized study comparing DCS and conventional treatment (Group C) in this setting. METHODS All consecutive patients from 2013 to 2018 with indication for surgery were screened and randomized to Group DCS or Group C. The primary outcome was the rate of reconstructed bowel at discharge and at 6 month. Informed consent was obtained. The trial was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at CinicalTrials.gov: NCT04034407. RESULTS A total of 56 patients were screened; 41 patients gave informed consent to participate and ultimately 21 patients (9 female) with intraoperatively confirmed Hinchey III (n = 14, 67%) or IV (n = 7, 33%), and a median (range) age of 66 (42-92), Mannheim Peritonitis Index of 25 (12-37) and Charlson Comorbidity Index of 3 (0-10) were intraoperatively randomized and treated as Group DCS (n = 13) or Group C (n = 8). Per protocol analysis: A primary anastomosis without ileostomy (PA) was performed in 92% (11/12) patients in Group DCS at the second-look operation, one patient died before second look, and one underwent a Hartmann procedure (HP). In Group C 63% (5/8) patients received a PA and 38% (3/8) patients a HP. Two patients in Group C, but none in Group DCS experienced anastomotic leakage (AI). ICU and hospital stay was median (range) 2 (1-10) and 17.5 (12-43) in DCS and 2 (1-62) and 22 (13-65) days in group C. In Group DCS 8% (1/12) patients was discharged with a stoma versus 57% (4/7) in Group C (p = 0.038, n.s., α = 0.025); one patient died before discharge. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for discharge with a stoma is 0.068 (0.005-0.861). Intent to treat analysis: A PA was performed in 90% (9/10) of patients randomized to DCS, one patient died before the second look, and one patient received a HP. In group C, 70% (7/10) were treated with PA and 30% (3/10) with HP. 29% (2/7) experienced AI treated with protective ileostomy. In group DCS, 9% (1/11) were discharged with a stoma versus 40% (4/10) in group C (p = 0.14, n.s.). The odds ratio for discharge with a stoma is 0.139 (0.012-1.608). CONCLUSION This is the first prospectively randomized controlled study showing that damage control surgery in perforated diverticulitis Hinchey III and IV enhances reconstruction of bowel continuity and can reduce the stoma rate at discharge.","Kafka-Ritsch, Reinhold; Zitt, Matthias; Perathoner, Alexander; Gasser, Elisabeth; Kaufman, Claudia; Czipin, Sasha; Aigner, Felix; Öfner, Dietmar",World journal of surgery,524,16

We grouped sites into organisational tertiles by number of patients arriving ≤2.5 h and treated ≤3 h, percentage arriving ≤2.5 h and treated ≤3 h, and numbers treated ≤3 h. We assigned scores of 1-3 (lower/middle/upper) per variable and 2 for onsite thrombectomy. We classified sites as lower efficiency (summed scores 3-5), medium efficiency (6-8) or higher efficiency (9-11). Sites were also grouped by adherence with European product label and ESO guideline: 'label adherent' (>95% on-label), 'guideline adherent' (≥5% off-label, ≥95% on-guideline) or 'guideline non-adherent' (>5% off-guideline). We cross-tabulated site-efficiency and adherence. We estimated the potential benefit of universally selecting by ESO guidance, using onset-to-treatment time-specific numbers needed to treat for day 90 mRS 0-1. Results A total of 56,689 patients at 597 sites were included: 163 sites were higher efficiency, 204 medium efficiency and 230 lower efficiency. Fifty-six sites were 'label adherent', 204 'guideline adherent' and 337 'guideline non-adherent'. There were strong associations between site-efficiency and adherence (P < 0.001). Almost all 'label adherent' sites (55, 98%) were lower efficiency. If all patients were treated by ESO guidelines, an additional 17,031 would receive alteplase, which translates into 1922 more patients with favourable three-month outcomes.

Despite differences in different healthcare settings and the significance of a person-centered approach, little research has investigated facilitators of community-based end-of-life care from the perspective of service recipients. In particular, there has been limited exploration of strategies to ensure positive outcomes at an operational level. AIM To explore factors facilitating positive end-of-life care provision in community-based settings and how these are achieved in practice, from the perspectives of patients and family caregivers. DESIGN A qualitative cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken through semi-structured interviews with patients and family caregivers subjected to thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Ten patients and 16 family caregivers were recruited from an end-of-life community care program provided by four non-governmental organizations in Hong Kong. RESULTS Seven core themes were identified: positive emotions about the relationship, positive appraisals of the relationship, care through inquiring about recipients' circumstances, instrumentality of care (i.e. information, coaching on care, practical help, psychological support, multiple activities), comprehensiveness of care (i.e. diversity, post-death care, family-level wellbeing), structure of care (i.e. timely follow-up, well-developed system), and qualities of workers. CONCLUSIONS Improvement in service quality might be achieved through alternating the perceptions or emotional reactions of care recipients toward care providers and increased use of sensitive inquiry. Comprehensive care and positive outcomes might be facilitated by addressing the dualities of care by providing diverse choices in pre-death and post-death care.","Jiao, Keyuan; Chow, Amy Ym; Wang, Juan; Chan, Iris Ik",Palliative medicine,524,24
117499,117499,117499,Open versus laparoscopic liver resection for colorectal liver metastases (the Oslo-CoMet Study): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,19.407312,9.164019,2015,"OBJECTIVES With endoscopic submucosal dissection and laparoscopic surgery, treatment for colorectal neoplasms has become minimally invasive. However, few studies have compared endoscopic submucosal dissection with laparoscopic surgery for colorectal neoplasms, excluding deeply invasive cancer on preoperative diagnosis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the files of patients who had undergone endoscopic submucosal dissection or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal neoplasms between November 2005 and December 2015. We limited patients who were not suspected preoperatively to have aggressive submucosal invasion >1,000 μm. RESULTS Ninety-five patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection and 37 underwent laparoscopic surgery. Cases of endoscopic submucosal dissection tended to involve rectal neoplasms more often than colonic neoplasms, shorter operative times, and shorter lengths of hospital stay compared with laparoscopic surgery. The perforation rate during colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection in the early period (November 2005 to December 2010) and late period (January 2011 to December 2015) was 14.8% and 2.9%, respectively. In all cases of perforation during colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection, the ability to maneuver the endoscope was compromised. Though tumors were larger in patients who underwent rectal endoscopic submucosal dissection compared with colonic endoscopic submucosal dissection, the perforation and postoperative bleeding rates with rectal endoscopic submucosal dissection were both 3.2%. The most common indication for laparoscopic surgery was difficulty performing endoscopic submucosal dissection. Serious complications were rare. CONCLUSIONS For colonic neoplasms, laparoscopic surgery should be considered when endoscopic submucosal dissection is technically difficult in the early period. For rectal neoplasms, endoscopic submucosal dissection is desirable even for those of large size.","Inoue, Takashi; Koyama, Fumikazu; Kuge, Hiroyuki; Ueda, Takeshi; Obara, Shinsaku; Nakamoto, Takayuki; Sasaki, Yoshiyuki; Nakamura, Yasuyuki; Sho, Masayuki","Journal of the anus, rectum and colon",524,1

To explore an alternate way to determine activity of brachytherapy plaques. METHODS The surface dose rates of 106Ru/106Rh plaque developed indigenously were measured by extrapolation chamber. To rule out possibility of any error in the activity distribution and quantity, same source was used in two different configurations namely planar and curved. EBT3 Gafchromic film was used for determination of uniformity in activity. Monte Carlo-based Codes EGSnrc and FLUKA were used to calculate dose rate in tissue, percentage depth dose and for determination of activity. Parameters and correction factors were estimated using simulations. RESULTS The measured reference absorbed dose rates for planar and curved 106Ru/106Rh eye plaques are found to be 589 ± 29 mGy/h and 560 ± 28 mGy/h, respectively. The difference in the reference absorbed dose rate of curved eye plaque is about ~5% as compared to planar configuration. The FLUKA-calculated dose values are almost independent of cavity length of the extrapolation chamber for both eye plaques. The FLUKA-based dose rates per μCi 106Ru/106Rh are about 17.28 ± 0.08 mGy/h and 16.48 ± 0.06 mGy/h, respectively for planar and curved eye plaques which match well with the measurements. The calculated activities for planar and curved eye plaques are 34.08 μCi and 33.98 μCi, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Surface dose rates for a prototype 106Ru/106Rh eye plaque with different configurations were estimated using simulations and measured experimentally.

As syndromic surveillance programs continue to adopt new technologies and expand, it is valuable to evaluate these syndromic surveillance systems and practices to ensure that they meet public health needs. OBJECTIVE This assessment's aim is to provide recent information about syndromic surveillance systems and practice characteristics among a group of state and local health departments. DESIGN/SETTING Information was obtained between November 2017 and June 2018 through a telephone survey using an Office of Management and Budget-approved standardized data collection tool. Participants were syndromic surveillance staff from each of 31 state and local health departments participating in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Questions included jurisdictional experience, data sources and analysis systems used, syndromic system data processing characteristics, data quality verification procedures, and surveillance activities conducted with syndromic data. MEASURES Practice-specific information such as types of systems and data sources used for syndromic surveillance, data quality monitoring, and uses of data for public health situational awareness (eg, investigating occurrences of or trends in diseases). RESULTS The survey analysis revealed a wide range of experiences with syndromic surveillance. Participants reported the receipt of data daily or more frequently. Emergency department data were the primary data source; however, other data sources are being integrated into these systems. All health departments routinely monitored data quality. Syndromes of highest priority across the respondents for health events monitoring were influenza-like illness and drug-related syndromes. However, a wide variety of syndromes were reported as priorities across the health departments. CONCLUSION Overall, syndromic surveillance was relevantly integrated into the public health surveillance infrastructure. The near real-time nature of the data and its flexibility to monitor different types of health-related issues make it especially useful for public health practitioners. Despite these advances, syndromic surveillance capacity, locally and nationally, must continue to evolve and progress should be monitored to ensure that syndromic surveillance systems and data are optimally able to meet jurisdictional needs.","Romano, Sebastian; Yusuf, Hussain; Davis, Cassandra; Thomas, Mathew J; Grigorescu, Violanda",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,524,1

While 90% of early GC is curable by resection, only about 5% of patients diagnosed in the late stages survive beyond five years. This provides strong impetus to push for early GC detection through the use of non-invasive biomarkers, before metastatic complications arise. It is also of strong medical interest to identify patients of the diffuse subtype at the earliest time possible, since the disease variant progresses very rapidly and is associated with much higher mortality rate. In this study, we compared quantitatively the gastric fluid proteome of 70 GC patients to 17 individuals with benign gastritis in search of potential biomarkers that aid in GC diagnosis, prognosis and subtype stratification. We report that as much as half of the gastric fluid proteome is subject to regulation in diseased states, and propose a simple biomarker panel scoring matrix for early GC detection with diagnostic sensitivity of 95.7%. We also demonstrate as proof-of-concept that a digitised record generated with SWATH-MS based on 380 protein abundance signatures from the gastric fluid could segregate patients with diffuse-type GC.","Wu, Wei; Yong, Wen Wei; Chung, Maxey C M",Proteomics,524,1

Materials and Methods We inoculated each BALB/c male mouse subcutaneously with one tumor in the axillae of the four limbs and divided them into four groups. We only selected the tumor-bearing part of the left lower limb for drug treatment. We measured the tumor-bearing volume of mice in each group. Then, we tested the organ coefficients of mice, the concentrations of IL-12 and IFN-γ in peripheral blood, the ratio of spleen Tregs and CD8+T cells, the spleen CTL killing activity, and the survival time of mice. Results We found that the tumor-bearing volume decreased significantly after the combination of CpG-ODN and anti-4-1BB antibody (P<0.001). The organ coefficients of treated mice were not significantly different from normal mice (P>0.05). The concentration of IL-12 and IFN-in serum and the ratio of CD8+T cells in spleen were increased, while the ratio of spleen Tregs was decreased. CTL activity of spleen was increased. The survival time of mice was significantly prolonged (P<0.001). Conclusion The treatment programme combining CpG-ODN with an anti-4-1BB antibody can significantly reduce tumor growth at the treatment site, slow the growth rate of metastases and improve host prognosis.","Ma, Shizhao; Yang, Xinying; Zhou, Huifang; Zhang, Chaoqun; Kang, Jiwen; Sun, Dianxing",OncoTargets and therapy,524,17

This study investigated whether a pneumoperitoneum during abdominal surgery influences the spread of local anesthetics. METHODS Nine fresh frozen cadavers were used for the study. Using an ultrasound-guided midaxillary technique, a unilateral TAP block-like injection with 20 mL of methylene blue dye was performed. After the injection, a pneumoperitoneum was immediately installed for 1 hour. After desufflation, this ipsilateral side was dissected, and a TAP block-like injection was performed on the contralateral side. One hour after injection, the contralateral side was also dissected. The anatomical dissection was used to determine the extent of dye spread and the nerves stained by the dye. RESULTS In none of the specimens did the dye reach the posterior origin of the transverse abdominal muscle. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of stained nerves and spread of the dye in the insufflated side compared with the noninsufflated side. In 4 of 9 cadavers, we found a variant course of a nerve preventing staining of that nerve. CONCLUSIONS The stretch of the abdominal wall caused by the insufflation of the abdomen does not influence the spread of dye in the abdominal wall. Because of the absence of posterior spread, regardless of the timing of a midaxillary ultrasound-guided approach, we believe that a posterior approach should be chosen if posterior spread is desired.","Desmet, Matthias; Helsloot, Dries; Vereecke, Evie; Missant, Carlo; van de Velde, Marc",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,524,11

The stiffness of the non-crosslinked hydrogen-bonded capsules was found to be proportional to the square of the wall thickness which is in agreement with previous observations on other multilayer capsules and continuum mechanical theory. The found elastic modulus of 610 MPa for low pH (= 2) is typical for a highly stable, glass-like structure similar to electrostatically bound multilayers. At pH > 6, (PMAA) capsules obtained through chemical crosslinking of hydrogen-bonded (PVPON/PMAA) multilayers, or crosslinked (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) capsules showed a sharp hundreds-fold stiffness decrease to ∼1 mN/m which was orders of magnitude lower than those reported earlier for polymeric multilayer systems. pH-Triggered softening was reversible and highly reproducible. Softening of both (PMAA) and (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) crosslinked capsules resulted from increased PMAA ionization, and additional dissociation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds occurred in the case of (PVPON-co-NH-20/PMAA) crosslinked system.","Elsner, Nils; Kozlovskaya, Veronika; Sukhishvili, Svetlana A; Fery, Andreas",Soft matter,524,1

Clinicians often rely on varied and intuitively disparate ways of evaluating rupture risk that may only partially take into account complex hemodynamic and morphologic factors. We developed a prototype of a clinically oriented, streamlined, computational platform, AView, for rapid assessment of hemodynamics and morphometrics in clinical settings. To show the potential clinical utility of AView, we report our initial multicenter experience highlighting the possible advantages of morphologic and hemodynamic analysis of IAs. METHODS AView software was deployed across 8 medical centers (6 in the United States, 2 in Japan). Eight clinicians were trained and used the AView software between September 2012 and January 2013. RESULTS We present 12 illustrative cases that show the potential clinical utility of AView. For all, morphology and hemodynamics, flow visualization, and rupture resemblance score (a surrogate for rupture risk) were provided. In 3 cases, AView could confirm the clinicians' decision to treat; in 3 cases, it could suggest which aneurysms may be at greater risk among multiple aneurysms; in 5 cases, AView could provide additional information for use during treatment decisions for ambiguous situations. In one stent-assisted coiling case, flow visualization predicted that the intuitive choice for stent placement could have resulted in sacrifice of an anterior cerebral artery due to blockage by coils and led clinicians to reconsider treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS AView has the potential to confirm decisions to treat IAs, suggest which among multiple aneurysms to treat, and guide treatment decisions. Furthermore, the flow visualization it affords can inform aneurysm treatment planning and potentially avoid poor outcomes.","Xiang, Jianping; Varble, Nicole; Davies, Jason M; Rai, Ansaar T; Kono, Kenichi; Sugiyama, Shin-Ichiro; Binning, Mandy J; Tawk, Rabih G; Choi, Hoon; Ringer, Andrew J; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui",World neurosurgery,524,1

Many patients with moderate-to-severe asthma have uncontrolled symptoms that lead to exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. There are many factors contributing to poor asthma control, including poor adherence to prescribed therapies, the under-prescribing of biologics and therapeutic inertia. We convened an eight-member panel from fields of primary care, pulmonology, immunology, health services and clinical research, behavioral science and pharmaceutical medical affairs, with the goal of identifying contributing factors and solutions to therapeutic inertia with asthma biologics. We used the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation (COM-B) model to classify patient and provider behavior towards therapeutic inertia. The model incorporates existing behavior theories and is driven by the interaction of capability, opportunity, and motivation. We used a Delphi method to identify and develop six primary solutions: 1) integration of patient-centered outcomes into asthma management practice; 2) provider education about asthma treatment; 3) moderate-to-severe asthma care delivery redesign; 4) harmonized, evidence-based protocol for the management of moderate-to-severe asthma; 5) designated coordinator approach for optimal asthma management; and 6) a case coordination digital support tool. Integration of patient-centered outcomes into asthma management practice and provider education were identified as having the highest potential to impact therapeutic and clinical inertia.

Urgent endoscopies are, however, intended to proceed as normal with additional personal protective procedures. A perceived reduction in hospital attendances may suggest a number of urgently indicated endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatographies (ERCPs) are being missed. Objectives and Methods: A review of all ERCPs carried out in a large tertiary referral endoscopy unit under healthcare restrictions was compared to the same time period in previous years. The intention was to determine if ERCPs are proceeding as normal or if there is a difference in referral characteristics. RESULTS Under service restrictions (13 March to the end of April 2020), 55 ERCPs were performed compared with 87 ERCPs in 2019. Similar numbers to 2019 were also recorded in the preceding years. One case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in a patient in the days following ERCP, with no cases notified among staff related to endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS A reduction in ERCP referrals raises concern that a cohort of patients with significant biliary disease remain undetected. Whether this results in later, and more severe, presentation remains to be seen but a potential surge in such cases could significantly burden all future endoscopy planning services.","O'Grady, John; Leyden, Jan; MacMathuna, Padraic; Stewart, Stephen; Kelleher, T Barry",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,524,16

In Nepal, there were frequent media reports of occurrences of road crashes, injuries, and deaths despite nationwide lockdown. This paper aims to describe the situation of road traffic crashes and casualties during the period of complete lockdown. Methods: This study used secondary data from two sources: Nepal Police and media reports between 24 March and 14 June 2020 (because the government lifted the nationwide lockdown from 15 June 2020). Available details of crashes, deaths, and injuries for this period were extracted from media reports and the summary data that was obtained from the Police. Narrative comparison is done between the data for the same period from both the sources, where possible. Results: Nepal Police recorded 1,801 incidents of road crashes during the 82 days of the COVID-19 lockdown with 256 deaths (on average 3.1 deaths daily) and 1,824 injuries (on average 22.2 injuries daily). Motorcycles comprised over 21% of all vehicles involved in crashes. Ambulances and other vehicles for essential services were also found to be involved in crashes. Speeding itself was the cause for almost a quarter of the incidents during the lockdown. Conclusions: Even when the movement restrictions were imposed in Nepal, the number of road crashes was not substantially reduced. Media reports were mainly found to be reporting the crashes where deaths occurred, but police records also included nonfatal injuries. The incidence of crashes in this period shows that it is important to work for road safety to save lives from road traffic crashes in Nepal.","Sedain, Bhagabati; Pant, Puspa Raj",F1000Research,524,1

Lack of access to services that are considered critical and life-saving such as food, drinkable water, and shelter, together with limited access to health services are turning an already serious crisis into a major human disaster. Meanwhile, there are concerns that Rohingya refugees are already in too poor health to ward off the COVID-19. Access to the abovementioned facilities and trustworthy information about COVID-19 are amongst their dire needs to combat this pandemic. The humanitarian organisations in collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh should urgently scale up their efforts to provide proper isolation centres, protective equipment, and trained health care representatives to avoid a potential catastrophe. Finally, immediate education intervention is desperately needed to protect the Rohingya refugees from this deadly COVID-19 pandemic.","Banik, Rajon; Rahman, Mahmudur; Hossain, Md Mahfuz; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Gozal, David",Global public health,524,1

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Systematic search of the literature for NSAIDs approved by the FDA (2000-2010). RESULTS One new orally-administered NSAID molecule (meloxicam), two orally-administered NSAID formulations (naproxen plus lansoprazole; oxycodone/ibuprofen), and three topical NSAID formulations (diclofenac patch, gel, and solution) were approved by the FDA (2000-2010). A systematic literature review found evidence to support efficacy in treating patients with OA for all agents except oxycodone/ibuprofen, which has not been studied in this patient population, although ibuprofen and immediate-release oxycodone have been studied individually for OA pain. Evidence quality was inconsistent, with several agents lacking long-term, controlled trials against active comparators, and functional end points inconsistently met. Although low-dose meloxicam and naproxen plus lansoprazole offer a reduced risk of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events, cardiovascular and renal risks remain similar to traditional oral NSAID therapy. Further, only lower doses of meloxicam appear to carry a reduced risk of GI events. Diclofenac patch, gel, and solution preparations offer the potential for reduced GI, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events. The level of evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of these agents for long-term treatment of patients with OA differs, with some having only short-term trials, while others have longer-duration trials with active comparators. CONCLUSIONS By expanding the treatment armamentarium, newly-approved NSAID agents may improve the ability of clinicians to tailor analgesic therapy for their diverse patient populations and to achieve realistic functional improvements. The comparisons in this article were limited to drugs that received approval after 2000 and should be considered accordingly.","Argoff, Charles E",Current medical research and opinion,524,6

However, design of active electrocatalysts faces grand challenges due to the insufficient understandings on how to overcome this thermodynamically and kinetically adverse process. Here we theoretically profile that the interfacial charge accumulation induces by the large work function difference between metal and support (∆Φ) and sequentially strong interfacial proton adsorption construct a high energy barrier for hydrogen transfer. Theoretical simulations and control experiments rationalize that small ∆Φ induces interfacial charge dilution and relocation, thereby weakening interfacial proton adsorption and enabling efficient hydrogen spillover for HER. Experimentally, a series of Pt alloys-CoP catalysts with tailorable ∆Φ show a strong ∆Φ-dependent HER activity, in which PtIr/CoP with the smallest ∆Φ = 0.02 eV delivers the best HER performance. These findings have conclusively identified ∆Φ as the criterion in guiding the design of hydrogen spillover-based binary HER electrocatalysts.","Li, Jiayuan; Hu, Jun; Zhang, Mingkai; Gou, Wangyan; Zhang, Sai; Chen, Zhong; Qu, Yongquan; Ma, Yuanyuan",Nature communications,524,12

This study analyzed the application of classic prescriptions in the diagnosis and treatment schemes based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Schemes for Coronavirus Disease at the country, provincial and municipal levels, and further explored its disrobing effect on COVID-19 disease severe phase network, and selected representative prescriptions for core target screening and gene enrichment analysis, so as to reveal its mechanism of action. Among them, 13 prescriptions were found to be used for 10 times or more, including Maxing Shigan Tang, Yinqiao San, Shengjiang San, Dayuan Drink, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. In addition, the COVID-19 efficacy prediction analysis platform(TCMATCOV platform) was used to calculate the network disturbances of the Chinese classic prescriptions involved. Based on the prediction results, 68 classic prescriptions were assessed on the COVID-19 disease network robustness disturbance. The average disturbance scores for the interaction confidence scores were ranked to be 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 from the highest to the lowest. There were 7 prescriptions with a score of 17 or more, and 50 prescriptions with a score of 13 or more. Among them, the top three prescriptions were Ganlu Xiaodu Dan(18.19), Lengxiao Wan(17.74), and Maxing Shigan Tang(17.62). After further mining the action targets of these three prescriptions, it was found that COVID-19 disease-specific factors Ccl2, IL10, IL6 and TNF were all the targets of three prescriptions. Through the enrichment analysis of the biological processes of the core targets, it was found that the three prescriptions may prevent the development of the disease by affecting cell-to-cell adhesion, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and chronic inflammatory responses to COVID-19 at the severe phase. This study showed that the TCMATCOV platform could evaluate the disturbance effect of different prescriptions on the COVID-19 disease network, and predict potential effectiveness based on the robustness of drug-interfered pneumonia disease networks, so as to provide a reference for further experiments or clinical verification.","Tang, Xuan; Tong, Lin; Guo, Fei-Fei; Tang, Shi-Huan; Yang, Hong-Jun",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,524,1

METHODS AND RESULTS We evaluated the outcomes of 67 patients who underwent non-cardiac (n=51) or cardiac (n=16) surgery after DES implantation at our institution between 2008 and 2010 and who underwent preoperative ""bridging"" with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Surgery occurred after a mean time of 13.9 ± 1.7 and 8.7 ± 2 months post stenting for non-cardiac (NCS) and cardiac surgery, respectively. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors were administered preoperatively for a mean of 7.1 ± 0.4 and 7.8 ± 0.7 days, respectively, then discontinued four to six hours before surgery. Most patients received aspirin through the perioperative period (33 NCS patients and 15 cardiac surgery patients). Clopidogrel was restarted as early as possible in the postoperative period. In the non-cardiac surgery group, two patients (3.9%, 95% confidence intervals 0.5% to 13.5%) suffered acute ST in the immediate postoperative period and four patients suffered major bleeding by the Global Utilisation of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) criteria. One cardiac surgery patient had probable ST one hour postoperatively.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in African American (AA) kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with COVID-19 is not well described. We report our experience with a predominantly AA cohort (79%) of KTRs with COVID-19 infections in the Detroit Metropolitan area. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center study, we identified 39 KTRs who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 16 and April 25th, 2020. Data from electronic medical records were retrieved and compared between KTRs without AKI and KTRs with AKI. RESULTS One pt was excluded due to DGF. Final analysis of AKI in KTRs with proven COVID-19 was done on 38 patients of which 30 were AA (79%). AKI occurred in 71.1% of COVID-19 KTRs (n=27), of whom 6 (22.2%) patients required HD. The incidence of AKI in our cohort was 71% (27/38). AKI rate among AA was 76.7% vs. 50% in non-AA cohort (p=0.195). In a univariate logistic regression analysis, AA race was not significantly associated with AKI OR (3.4, CI [0.68-17.4], p=0.14). After risk adjustment by race, patients with diabetes showed a significantly higher risk of AKI (adjusted OR 19.85 CI [1.65-58.66], p=0.012). KTRs with AKI had more preexisting RAAS inhibitor use than KTRs without AKI (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS KTRs infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a high incidence of AKI, with associated increased morbidity and mortality. Though no racial differences in mortality were noted in our KTRs with AKI, we await data from registries to help elucidate this difference.","Shrivastava, Pritika; Prashar, Rohini; Khoury, Nadeen; Patel, Anita; Yeddula, Sirisha; Kitajima, Toshihiro; Nagai, Shunji; Samaniego, Milagros",Transplantation,524,5

Here, we show that miR-146 is relevant for SC/CSC activity. MiR-146a/b expression is high in SCs/CSCs from human/mouse primary mammary tissues, correlates with the basal-like breast cancer subtype, which typically has a high CSC content, and specifically distinguishes cells with SC/CSC identity. Loss of miR-146 reduces SC/CSC self-renewal in vitro and compromises patient-derived xenograft tumor growth in vivo, decreasing the number of tumor-initiating cells, thus supporting its pro-oncogenic function. Transcriptional analysis in mammary SC-like cells revealed that miR-146 has pleiotropic effects, reducing adaptive response mechanisms and activating the exit from quiescent state, through a complex network of finely regulated miRNA targets related to quiescence, transcription, and one-carbon pool metabolism. Consistent with these findings, SCs/CSCs display innate resistance to anti-folate chemotherapies either in vitro or in vivo that can be reversed by miR-146 depletion, unmasking a ""hidden vulnerability"" exploitable for the development of anti-CSC therapies.","Tordonato, Chiara; Marzi, Matteo Jacopo; Giangreco, Giovanni; Freddi, Stefano; Bonetti, Paola; Tosoni, Daniela; Di Fiore, Pier Paolo; Nicassio, Francesco",The Journal of cell biology,524,12

To date no method can objectively measure and identify pulsating regions. METHOD Using high resolution video-recordings of the optic disk and retina we measured fluctuating light absorption by haemoglobin during pulsation. Pulsation amplitude was calculated from all regions of the retinal image video-frames in a raster pattern. Segmented retinal images were formed by objectively selecting regions with amplitudes above a range of threshold values. These were compared to two observers manually drawing an outline of the pulsating areas while viewing video-clips in order to generate receiver operator characteristics. RESULTS 216,515 image segments were analysed from 26 eyes in 18 research participants. Using data from each eye, the median area under the receiver operator curve (AU-ROC) was 0.95. With all data analysed together the AU-ROC was 0.89. We defined the ideal threshold amplitude for detection of any pulsating segment being that with maximal sensitivity and specificity. This was 5 units (95% confidence interval 4.3 to 6.0) compared to 12 units before any regions were missed. A multivariate model demonstrated that ideal threshold amplitude increased with increased variation in video-sequence illumination (p = 0.0119), but between the two observers (p = 0.0919) or other variables. CONCLUSION This technique demonstrates accurate identification of retinal vessel pulsating regions with no areas identified manually being missed with the objective technique. The amplitude values are derived objectively and may be a significant advance upon subjective ophthalmodynamometric threshold techniques.","Morgan, William H; Abdul-Rahman, Anmar; Yu, Dao-Yi; Hazelton, Martin L; Betz-Stablein, Brigid; Lind, Christopher R P",PloS one,524,24

The mean DISCERN score was 3.0 (SD 1.4) out of 5, indicating ""moderate"" quality; scores were significantly higher for 21 videos (21%) authored by academic hospitals (mean 3.7 vs. 2.8, p=0.02). Inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims were identified in 23 videos (23%); none of the videos authored by academic institutions contained inaccurate claims. Videos with inaccurate statements had more than double the viewer engagement (viewer-generated comments, ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" ratings) compared to videos without inaccuracies (p<0.001). Among viewer comments, 43 videos (43%) included comments with inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims, and a large majority (82 videos, 80%) had ""chatbot"" recommendations. CONCLUSIONS Interest in YouTube videos about nephrolithiasis has doubled since 2015. While highly-viewed videos vary widely in quality and accuracy, videos produced by academic hospitals have significantly fewer inaccurate claims. Given the high prevalence of stone disease and poor-quality videos, patients should be directed to evidence-based content online.","Huang, Mitchell M; Winoker, Jared S; Allaf, Mohamad E; Matlaga, Brian R; Koo, Kevin",BJU international,524,1

We describe a novel, innovative 2-port laparoscopic technique, in which intracorporeal appendectomy can be completed safely with standard instrumentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight consecutive patients were prospectively assigned to undergo 2-port laparoscopic appendectomies for presumed appendicitis. The technique involves the placement of one 12-mm infraumbilical port for the working instruments and one 5-mm left lower quadrant port for the camera. A suture is tied in a loop to the anterior abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant, which is subsequently used as an axle. A pretied suture placed on the appendix is passed through the loop suture and then through the port to the outside of the abdomen. This technique allows exposure of the base of the appendix and compensates for the lack of the third port usually required for the retraction of the appendix. The mesoappendix and appendix are stapled and removed from the abdomen in an extrication bag. RESULTS All 8 laparoscopic procedures were completed without difficulty. The mean operative time was 64.1 min. Length of hospitalization was 1 d or less. No major complications were encountered. One minor postoperative complication occurred in which the patient developed periumbilical cellulitis, which was completely resolved at the 1-wk postoperative visit. CONCLUSION In times where surgeons are focusing on transluminal approaches to access the abdominal cavity, we favor laparoscopy for the enhanced exposure, instrument diversity, and overall patient safety. Two-port laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe, novel laparoscopic technique, which minimizes minimally invasive surgery even further to a new level of decreased invasiveness and improved cosmesis.","Panait, Lucian; Bell, Robert L; Duffy, Andrew J; Roberts, Kurt E",The Journal of surgical research,524,31

Therefore, surgeons must inform patients about the expected functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function after surgery. METHODS The present study included a prospective cohort of 66 patients (85 neck dissection sides) who underwent neck dissection between December 2015 and July 2017 at a single institution. The active shoulder abduction angles of the affected side and the patient-reported shoulder-specific quality-of-life recovery score of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) questionnaire were examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, the association between these outcomes and risk factors for shoulder impairment were investigated. RESULTS The average active shoulder abduction angles were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months postoperatively compared with 1 month postoperatively (96.5 ± 4.3° at 1 month versus 110.1 ± 4.7° at 3 months, p = 0.035, and versus 142.0 ± 4.6° at 6 months, p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients who were unable to abduct their shoulders by 150° or more was significantly lower at 6 months postoperatively (41.5%) compared with 1 month postoperatively (82.4%, p < 0.0001). The WORC score significantly improved from 60.4 ± 2.4% at 1 month postoperatively to 67.9 ± 2.6% at 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for shoulder impairment at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively), and that level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were significant risk factors for a worse shoulder outcome at 6 and 9 months postoperatively (respective p values for level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were p = 0.049 and p = 0.030 at 6 months postoperatively, and p = 0.016 and p = 0.013 at 9 months postoperatively). CONCLUSION Satisfactory functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function was achieved at 6 months after neck dissection. Postoperative radiotherapy was a predictor of poor shoulder function in the early postoperative period; both level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were predictors of poor shoulder function at 6 and 9 months after neck dissection.","Imai, Takayuki; Sato, Yuki; Abe, Jun; Kumagai, Jun; Morita, Sinkichi; Saijo, Satoshi; Yamazaki, Tomoko; Asada, Yukinori; Matsuura, Kazuto","Auris, nasus, larynx",524,24

This scoring system has been designed to obtain predicted postoperative mortality rates before surgery and this study was performed to assess its usefulness in elective surgery for gastric carcinoma. METHODS We investigated seven variables for mE-PASS and evaluated the postoperative course in 3,449 patients who underwent elective surgery for gastric carcinoma in Japan between August 20, 1987 and April 9, 2007, in order to quantify the predicted in-hospital mortality rates (R). The calibration and discrimination power of R were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), respectively. The ratios of observed-to-estimated mortality rates (OE ratios) were quantified as a measure of quality. RESULTS The overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19.0 and 2.0%, respectively. R demonstrated good power in calibration (χ(2) value, 12.5; df 8; P = 0.89) as well as discrimination (AUC, 95% confidence intervals: 0.80, 0.75-0.85). The OE ratios between hospitals ranged from 0.44 to 1.8. Overall, the OE ratios seemed to improve with time (OE ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.3, 0.73-2.4 for the early period between 1987 and 2000; 1.0, 0.59-1.7 for the middle period between 2001 and 2004; and 0.65, 0.36-1.2 for the late period between 2005 and 2007). CONCLUSION Based on these findings, mE-PASS might be useful for medical decision-making and for assessing the quality of care in elective surgery for gastric carcinoma.","Haga, Yoshio; Wada, Yasuo; Takeuchi, Hitoshi; Ikejiri, Koji; Ikenaga, Masakazu; Kimura, Osamu",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,524,29

Players consequently seek strategies to reduce soreness and accelerate recovery, with an emerging method being cannabidiol (CBD), despite anti-doping risks. The prevalence and rationale for CBD use in rugby has not been explored; therefore, we recruited professional male players to complete a survey on CBD. Goodness of fit chi-square (χ2) was used to assess CBD use between codes and player position. Effects of age on use were determined using χ2 tests of independence. Twenty-five teams provided 517 player responses. While the majority of players had never used CBD (p < .001, V = 0.24), 26% had either used it (18%) or were still using it (8%). Significantly more CBD use was observed in rugby union compared with rugby league (p = .004, V = 0.13), but player position was not a factor (p = .760, V = 0.013). CBD use increased with players' age (p < .001, V = 0.28), with mean use reaching 41% in the players aged 28 years and older category (p < .0001). The players using CBD primarily used the Internet (73%) or another teammate (61%) to obtain information, with only 16% consulting a nutritionist. The main reasons for CBD use were improving recovery/pain (80%) and sleep (78%), with 68% of players reporting a perceived benefit. These data highlight the need for immediate education on the risks of CBD, as well as the need to explore the claims regarding pain and sleep.","Kasper, Andreas M; Sparks, S Andy; Hooks, Matthew; Skeer, Matthew; Webb, Benjamin; Nia, Houman; Morton, James P; Close, Graeme L",International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism,524,33

However, little is known about the effect of treating one condition on the control of the other. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression among Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and to assess the efficacy and feasibility of escitalopram treatment of depression on their metabolic control parameters. METHODS T2DM patients attending primary care clinics in the North of Jordan were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during the period from February to December 2019 (n=157). Depressive symptoms were screened utilizing the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) tool. Metabolic control was assessed by measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms by PHQ-9 (n=58) were interviewed by a psychiatrist to confirm a clinical diagnosis of depression. Eligible depressed patients were administered escitalopram 10 mg orally once daily for three months (n=12). Thereafter, depressive symptoms and metabolic control measures were reassessed. RESULTS The prevalence of moderate to severe depressive symptoms among T2DM patients, according to PHQ-9, was 36.94%, while the prevalence of clinical depression based on interview was 7.64%. Baseline PHQ-9 scores correlated significantly with baseline levels of HbA1c, HDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Escitalopram treatment intervention resulted in significant improvement of PHQ-9 scores without significantly improving any of the metabolic control measures. CONCLUSION The relationship between depression and T2DM in the context of metabolic syndrome is plausible. However, our results show that escitalopram treatment may not be associated with significant improvement in metabolic control parameters among these patients. Our study has laid the groundwork for future randomized clinical trials with larger sample size and longer follow-up.","Khassawneh, Adi H; Alzoubi, Abdallah; Khasawneh, Aws G; Abdo, Nour; Abu-Naser, Dania; Al-Mistarehi, Abdel-Hameed; Albattah, Malak F; Kheirallah, Khalid A",International journal of clinical practice,524,1

A major question during the last decades has centred on understanding whether new advances in developmental biology are compatible with the standard view or whether they compel a new theory. Here, I argue that the answer to this question depends on which concept of morphogenesis is held. Morphogenesis can be conceived as (1) a chemically driven or (2) a mechanically driven process. According to the first option, genetic regulatory networks drive morphogenesis. According to the second, morphogenesis results from an invariant tendency of embryonic tissues to restore changes in mechanical stress. While chemically driven morphogenesis allows an extension of the standard view, mechanically driven morphogenesis would deeply transform it. Which of these hypotheses has wider explanatory power is unknown.

Postoperative imaging demonstrated successful anatomical elevation of the optic apparatus, and the patient showed functional improvement in the visual field at 3 months postoperatively. Although rare, massive empty sellar and chiasmal descent from macroadenoma treatment can result in progressive visual loss. Here, a novel technique of endonasal endoscopic extradural cranioplasty aided by lumbar drainage is reported, which appears to be an effective technique for stabilizing and possibly reversing anatomical and visual deterioration.","Alvarez Berastegui, G Rene; Raza, Shaan M; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Journal of neurosurgery,524,1

However, the profiling of nascent transcripts, which often include nonpolyadenylated RNAs, can unveil novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here, we separately sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAseq) and mRNAs (mRNAseq) from the same HIV-1-infected human CD4(+) T cells. We found that many nonpolyadenylated RNAs were differentially expressed upon HIV-1 infection, and we identified 8 times more differentially expressed genes at 12 h postinfection by Total RNAseq than by mRNAseq. These expression changes were also evident by concurrent changes in introns and were recapitulated by later mRNA changes, revealing an unexpectedly significant delay between transcriptional initiation and mature mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. We computationally derived and validated the underlying regulatory programs, and we predicted drugs capable of reversing these HIV-1-induced expression changes followed by experimental confirmation. Our results show that combined total and mRNA transcriptome analysis is essential for fully capturing the early host response to virus infection and provide a framework for identifying candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS. IMPORTANCE In this study, we used mass sequencing to identify genes differentially expressed in CD4(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection. To our surprise, we found many differentially expressed genes early after infection by analyzing both newly transcribed unprocessed pre-mRNAs and fully processed mRNAs, but not by analyzing mRNAs alone, indicating a significant delay between transcription initiation and mRNA production early after HIV-1 infection. These results also show that important findings could be missed by the standard practice of analyzing mRNAs alone. We then derived the regulatory mechanisms driving the observed expression changes using integrative computational analyses. Further, we predicted drugs that could reverse the observed expression changes induced by HIV-1 infection and showed that one of the predicted drugs indeed potently inhibited HIV-1 infection. This shows that it is possible to identify candidate drugs for host-directed therapy against HIV/AIDS using our genomics-based approach.","Peng, Xinxia; Sova, Pavel; Green, Richard R; Thomas, Matthew J; Korth, Marcus J; Proll, Sean; Xu, Jiabao; Cheng, Yanbing; Yi, Kang; Chen, Li; Peng, Zhiyu; Wang, Jun; Palermo, Robert E; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,524,31

Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P<0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P<0.001). Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P>0.001. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8) and 17 days (IQR 13-25), respectively. CONCLUSION Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients. Lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate may be used as laboratory indicators of CT absorption.","Wu, Xiaoqing; Sun, Ruihong; Chen, Jianpu; Xie, Yuanliang; Zhang, Shutong; Wang, Xiang",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,524,16

The aim of this randomized, prospective study was to clarify the effects of tourniquet use on DVT in TKA. METHODS The subjects were 109 patients scheduled to undergo TKA from April 2008 to March 2009 before the establishment of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) practice guidelines. They were randomized into two groups: 51 patients in the tourniquet group (group T) and 52 patients in the control group without a tourniquet (group C). We investigated the thrombotic presence using ultrasonography one week after surgery and compared both groups. RESULTS There was no difference in the rate of proximal DVTs (P=0.63). However, the risk of distal DVT was significantly higher in group T than in group C (52.9% vs. 23.1%; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Use of the tourniquet in TKA increased the risk of distal DVT.","Mori, Noriaki; Kimura, Shoichi; Onodera, Tomohiro; Iwasaki, Norimasa; Nakagawa, Izumi; Masuda, Takeshi",The Knee,524,1

However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and elastic fibre fracture in the development of TAD in a rat model. METHODS The TAD rat model was induced by β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). TAD was investigated in 112 male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were equally divided into four groups of 28 rats (Control, BAPN, BAPN + IL-1β, and BAPN + IL-1β antibody). Systolic blood pressure, survival, and the development of TAD were measured after six weeks. Expression of IL-1β, MMP-2, and MMP-9 was measured by Western blot. Apoptosis, aortic elastin concentration, and biomechanical characteristics were measured by the TdT mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay, Victoria blue staining, and in vitro testing. RESULTS During six weeks, the mortality was 0% (0/28) in the control group, 53.6% (15/28) in the BAPN group (p < .001 compared with the control group), 75.0% (21/28) in the BAPN + IL-1β group (p = .007 compared with the BAPN group), and 35.7% (10/28) in the BAPN + IL-1β antibody group (p = .023 compared with BAPN group and p < .001 compared with the BAPN + IL-1β group). IL-1β treatment deteriorates BAPN induced mortality and aneurysm expansion, which were attenuated by anti-IL-1β treatment. In BAPN + IL-1β group, stress and strain parameters were decreased by 13.5%-53.5% and elastin content was decreased by 14%, and IL-1β, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were expressed higher by 117%, 108%, and 75% when compared with the rats in the BAPN group. Contrarily, in the BAPN + IL-1β antibody group, the above changes could be completely (strain, elastin content, and expression of MMP-2) or partly (elasticity modulus, stress, and expression of MMP-9) blocked by anti-IL-1β treatment. CONCLUSION IL-1β plays a critical role in TAD formation by altering the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, degrading the aortic wall matrix, causing elastic fibre rupture, and changing the stress or strain of the aortic wall. Anti-IL-1β reduces the later effects and could be one of the molecular targets for prognosis and drug treatment of TAD in the future.","Guo, Ling-Ling; Wu, Meng-Tao; Zhang, Li-Wei; Chu, Yong-Xin; Tian, Peng; Jing, Zai-Ping; Li, Jia-Si; Sun, Yu-Dong; Yeung, Kak K; Zhang, Lei",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,524,5

It is of utmost importance to understand their patterns and limits of homologous and non-homologous recombination, because such events may affect the emergence of novel CoV strains, alter their host range, infection rate, tissue tropism pathogenicity, and their ability to escape vaccination programs. Intratypic recombination among closely related CoVs of the same subgenus has often been reported; however, the patterns and limits of genomic exchange between more distantly related CoV lineages (intertypic recombination) needs further investigation. Here, we report computational/evolutionary analyses that clearly demonstrate a substantial ability for CoVs of different subgenera to recombine. Furthermore, we show that CoVs can obtain-through non-homologous recombination-accessory ORFs from core ORFs, exchange accessory ORFs with different CoV genera, with other viruses (i.e., toroviruses, influenza C/D, reoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses) and even with hosts. Intriguingly, most of these radical events result from double-crossovers surrounding the Spike ORF, thus highlighting both the instability and mobile nature of this genomic region. While many such events have often occurred during the evolution of various CoVs, the genomic architecture of the relatively young SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 lineage so far appears to be stable.","Nikolaidis, Marios; Markoulatos, Panayotis; Van de Peer, Yves; Oliver, Stephen G; Amoutzias, Grigorios D",Molecular biology and evolution,524,1

Although vaccination is highly efficacious in preventing disease, cases continue to occur and vaccination failures are well documented. Maternally derived antibody interference is the leading cause of vaccination failure and age at vaccine administration is a significant risk factor for failure. However, no studies have been performed on practicing veterinarians' usage of and compliance with published vaccination guidelines and label recommendations. Likewise, there are no published studies of veterinarian perceptions on CPV occurrence and mortality and its influence on case outcome. We report a study in which all Australian small companion animal (canine and feline) veterinary hospitals were surveyed, yielding a response rate of 23.5% (534 unique veterinary hospitals). Respondents overall perceived national CPV occurrence ten-times lower (median 2000 cases) than the estimated national caseload (20,000 cases). Respondents from hospitals that did not diagnose CPV perceived national occurrence twenty-times lower (median 1000 cases) than the estimated rate (p < 0.0001). Perceived disease mortality (50%) was 2.74 times higher than that reported (18.2%). In addition, 26.7% of veterinarians reported using serological titer testing to some degree, which some practitioners use in lieu of vaccination if a titer is perceived to reflect sufficient immunity. Based on this study veterinarians appear to be aware of the disease risk in their region but unaware of the burden of CPV disease nationally, and perceive mortality risk higher than it actually is. This might lead to an overestimation of cost to treat, and over-recommendation of euthanasia. Nearly half (48.7%) of respondents recommended final puppy vaccination earlier than guidelines recommend, while 2.8% of respondents recommended a puppy re-vaccination interval longer than supported by vaccine labels and guidelines. Both of these practices may put puppies at risk of CPV infection.","Kelman, M; Barrs, V R; Norris, J M; Ward, M P",Preventive veterinary medicine,524,1

While previous studies established an essential role of Ab and type I IFN, it is still unclear if the cell-mediated immune responses, through their direct antiviral effector functions, contribute to protection against the fatal disease. We report here that mice defective in both the granule exocytosis and death receptor pathways of cytotoxicity display increased susceptibility to JEV. The two cell contact-dependent cytotoxic effector mechanisms act redundantly within the CNS to reduce disease severity. We also demonstrate that IFN-γ is critical in recovery from primary infection with JEV by a mechanism involving suppression of virus growth in the CNS, and that T cells are the main source of the cytokine that promotes viral clearance from the brain. Finally, we show by in vivo depletion of NK cells that this innate immune cell population is dispensable for control of JEV infection in the periphery and in the CNS. Accordingly, cell contact-dependent cytolytic and IFN-γ-dependent noncytolytic clearance of virus mediated by T cells trafficking into the CNS help in recovery from lethal infection in a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis.","Larena, Maximilian; Regner, Matthias; Lobigs, Mario",European journal of immunology,524,6

The study was designed to detect circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor single cell genes by applying microfluidic chip technology. It was used to explore the clinical application value in breast cancer. METHODS We have developed a size-based CTCs sorting microfluidic chip, which contains a hexagonal array and a micro-pipe channel array to isolate and confirm both single CTCs and CTCs clusters. The sorting performance of the as-fabricated chip was tested by analyzing the clinical samples collected from 129 breast cancer patients and 50 healthy persons. RESULTS In this study, the chip can detect different immunophenotypes of CTCs in breast cancer patients. It was found that the new microfluidic device had high sensitivity (73.6%) and specificity (82.0%) in detecting CTCs. By detecting the blood samples of 129 breast cancer patients and 50 healthy blood donors, it was found that the number of CTCs was not associated with clinical factors such as age, gender, pathological type, and tumor size of breast cancer patients (P > 0.05), but was associated with TNM staging of breast cancer, with or without metastasis (P < 0.005). There was a statistically significant difference in the number of CTCs between luminal A (ER+/PR+/HER2-) and HER-2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+) (P < 0.05). The best cut-off level distinguished by CTC between the breast cancer patients and the healthy persons was 3.5 cells/mL, with 0.845 for AUC-ROC, 0.790-0.901 for 95% CI, 73.6% for sensitivity, and 82% for specificity (P = 0.000). The combination of CTC, CEA, CA125 and CA153 can provide more effective breast cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS The CTCs analysis method presented here doesn't rely on the specific antibody, such as anti-EpCAM, which would avoid the missed inspection caused by antibody-relied methods and offer more comprehensive biological information for clinical breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.","Zhang, Xiaofen; Lu, Xu; Gao, Wanlei; Wang, Yanmin; Jia, Chunping; Cong, Hui",Translational oncology,524,1

It is central to understanding treatment effects, especially for evaluations conducted outside of highly controlled research settings. Ensuring that promising interventions can be delivered adequately (ie, with fidelity) by real-world clinicians within real-world settings is an essential step in developing interventions that are both effective and 'implementable'. Whether this is the case for behaviour change counselling, a complex intervention developed specifically for maximising the effectiveness of real-world consultations about health behaviour change, remains unclear. To improve our understanding of treatment effects, best practice guidelines recommend the use of strategies to enhance, monitor and evaluate what clinicians deliver during patient consultations. There has yet to be a systematic evaluation of whether and how these recommendations have been employed within evaluations of behaviour change counselling, nor the impact on patient health behaviour and/or outcome. We seek to address this gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Methods are informed by published guidelines. Ten electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis; Wiley, ProQuest and Open Grey) will be searched for published and unpublished articles that evaluate behaviour change counselling within real-world clinical settings (randomised and non-randomised). Eligible papers will be rated against the National Institute of Health fidelity framework. A synthesis, evaluation and critical overview of fidelity practices will be reported and linear regression used to explore change across time. Random-effect meta-regression is planned to explore whether fidelity (outcomes reported and methods used) is associated with the impact of behaviour change counselling. Standardised effect sizes will be calculated using Hedges' g (continuous outcomes) and ORs (binary/dichotomous outcomes). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical issues are foreseen. Findings will be disseminated via journal publication and conference presentation(s).

SARS, MERS, Ebola, Nipah and an array of arenavirus infections sporadically spillover into human populations and are often contained only as a result of their poor transmission in human hosts, coupled with intense public health control efforts in the early stages of an emerging epidemic. It is now more apparent than ever that we need a better and more proactive approach. One possibility is to eliminate the threat of spillover before it occurs using vaccines capable of autonomously spreading through wild animal reservoirs. We are now poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines targeting a wide range of human pathogens, but important decisions remain about how they can be most effectively designed and used to target pathogens with a high risk of spillover and/or emergence. In this Perspective, we first review the basic epidemiological theory establishing the feasibility and utility of self-disseminating vaccines. We then outline a road map for overcoming remaining technical challenges: identifying high-risk pathogens before they emerge, optimizing vaccine design with an eye to evolution, behaviour and epidemiology, and minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.","Nuismer, Scott L; Bull, James J",Nature ecology & evolution,524,1

First, the spatio-temporal relationship was used to obtain the credibility of data sources. Then, the combined credibility of data was calculated based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and back propagation (BP) neural network. Finally, the comprehensive data reliability for evaluating data quality can be acquired based on the credibility of data sources and combined data credibility.

Normal GDP-Man biosynthesis plays a crucial role in support of a variety of cellular functions, including cell recognition, cell communication and immune responses against viruses. Here, we report the detection of GDP-Man in human brain for the first time, using 31 P MRS at 7 T. The presence of GDP-Man is evidenced by the detection of a weak 31 P doublet at -10.7 ppm that can be assigned to the phosphomannosyl group (Pβ) of the GDP-Man molecule. This weak but well-resolved signal lies 0.9 ppm upfield of UDP(G) Pβ-multiplet from a mixture of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. In reference to ATP (2.8 mM), the concentration of GDP-Man in human brain was estimated to be 0.02 ± 0.01 mM, about 15-fold lower than the total concentration of UDP(G) (0.30 ± 0.04, N = 17) and consistent with previous reports of UDP-Man in cells and brain tissue extracts measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The reproducibility of the measured GDP-Man between test and 2-week retest was 21% ± 15% compared with 5% ± 4% for UDP(G) (N = 7). The measured concentrations of GDP-Man and UDP(G) are linearly correlated ([UDP(G)] = 4.3 [GDP-Man] + 0.02, with R = 0.66 and p = 0.0043), likely reflecting the effect of shared sugar precursors, which may vary among individuals in response to variation in nutritional intake and consumption. Given that GDP-Man has another set of doublet (Pα) at -8.3 ppm that overlaps with NAD(H) and UDP(G)-Pα signals, the amount of GDP-Man could potentially interfere with the deconvolution of these mixed signals in composition analysis. Importantly, this new finding may be useful in advancing our understanding of glycosylation and its role in the development of cancer, as well as infectious and neurodegenerative diseases.","Ren, Jimin; Sherry, A Dean",NMR in biomedicine,524,24

Microglia are the major player of central innate immunity integrating peripheral signals arising from the circumventricular regions lacking the blood-brain barrier (BBB), via neural afferent pathways such as the vagal nerve and also by choroid plexus into the brain ventricles. Defective and/or unrestrained activation of central and peripheral immunity during embryonic development might set an aberrant connectome establishment and brain function, leading to major psychiatric disorders in postnatal stages. Molecular candidates leading to central and peripheral innate immune overactivation identified metabolic substrates and lipid species as major contributors of immunological priming, supporting the role of a metabolic flexibility node during trained immunity. Mechanistically, trained immunity is established by an epigenetic program including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, as the major molecular epigenetic signatures to set immune phenotypes. By definition, immunological training sets reprogramming of innate immune cells, enhancing or repressing immune responses towards a second challenge which potentially might contribute to neurodevelopment disorders. Notably, the innate immune training might be set during pregnancy by maternal immune activation stimuli. In this review, we integrate the most valuable scientific evidence supporting the role of metabolic cues assisting metabolic flexibility, leading to innate immune training during development and its effects on aberrant neurological phenotypes in the offspring. We also add reports supporting the role of methylation and histone acetylation signatures as a major epigenetic mechanism regulating immune training.","Cruz-Carrillo, Gabriela; Camacho-Morales, Alberto",Molecular neurobiology,524,1

METHODS We prospectively estimated the relative risk (RR) of hospital-acquired (HA) ILI during hospitalization according to in-hospital exposures to contagious individuals. Surveillance of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza was undertaken at Edouard Herriot Hospital (1100 beds) during 3 influenza seasons. A total of 21 519 patients and 2153 health care workers (HCWs) from 2004 to 2007 were included. The RR of HA-ILI in patients was calculated according to exposure to other contagious patients and HCWs. RESULTS For patients exposed to at least 1 contagious HCW compared with those with no documented exposure in the hospital, the RR of HA-ILI was 5.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09-14.37); for patients exposed to at least 1 contagious patient, the RR was 17.96 (95% CI, 10.07-32.03); and for patients exposed to at least 1 contagious patient and 1 contagious HCW, the RR was 34.75 (95% CI, 17.70-68.25).

We herein report our early experience with single-access transumbilical laparoscopic gastric banding. This approach to the procedure is performed mainly through a single incision in the umbilicus. This single incision is also utilized for the implantation of the port for subsequent band adjustments. METHODS Eight patients were carefully selected (body mass indices between 35 and 45 kg/m(2) with peripheral obesity), and each underwent laparoscopic gastric banding using this single-incision transumbilical technique. The same surgeon performed all surgical interventions. For each of the eight patients, the same perioperative protocol and operative techniques were implemented. RESULTS Seven out of eight attempted single-access transumbilical laparoscopic gastric banding procedures were successfully performed using this technique. Mean operative time was 105 min. One out of the eight patients required the insertion of an additional trocar. There were no mortalities or postoperative complications noted during the mean follow-up period of 2.6 months. CONCLUSION Single-access transumbilical laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is a safe and feasible evolving approach in a selected group of patients. The intraumbilical location of the implanted port facilitates access for subsequent adjustments and provides patients with an improved cosmetic outcome.","Saber, Alan A; El-Ghazaly, Tarek H",Obesity surgery,524,1

The use of multivariable prediction models could result in more efficient primary AF screening by selecting at-risk individuals. We aimed to determine which model may be best suitable for increasing efficiency of future primary AF screening efforts. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a systematic review on multivariable models derived, validated, and/or augmented for AF prediction in community cohorts using Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) through 1 August 2019. We performed meta-analysis of model discrimination with the summary C-statistic as the primary expression of associations using a random effects model. In case of high heterogeneity, we calculated a 95% prediction interval. We used the CHARMS (Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies) checklist for risk of bias assessment. We included 27 studies with a total of 2 978 659 unique participants among 20 cohorts with mean age ranging from 42 to 76 years. We identified 21 risk models used for incident AF risk in community cohorts. Three models showed significant summary discrimination despite high heterogeneity: CHARGE-AF (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) [summary C-statistic 0.71; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.66-0.76], FHS-AF (Framingham Heart Study risk score for AF) (summary C-statistic 0.70; 95% CI 0.64-0.76), and CHA2DS2-VASc (summary C-statistic 0.69; 95% CI 0.64-0.74). Of these, CHARGE-AF and FHS-AF had originally been derived for AF incidence prediction. Only CHARGE-AF, which comprises easily obtainable measurements and medical history elements, showed significant summary discrimination among cohorts that had applied a uniform (5-year) risk prediction window. CONCLUSION CHARGE-AF appeared most suitable for primary screening purposes in terms of performance and applicability in older community cohorts of predominantly European descent.","Himmelreich, Jelle C L; Veelers, Lieke; Lucassen, Wim A M; Schnabel, Renate B; Rienstra, Michiel; van Weert, Henk C P M; Harskamp, Ralf E","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",524,23

In addition, >9,000 suicide deaths occur among older adults each year (1). Deaths among older adults account for 33% of these unintentional injury deaths and 19% of suicide deaths among all age groups (1). Nonfatal injuries from these causes are more common in this age group and can lead to long-term health consequences, such as brain injury and loss of independence. This study included 2018 data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to determine the prevalence of selected nonfatal injuries among older adults treated in emergency departments (EDs) and hospitals. Injury mechanisms among the leading causes of injury death in older adults were studied, including unintentional falls, unintentional traffic-related motor vehicle crashes, unintentional opioid overdoses, and self-harm (suicidal and nonsuicidal by any mechanism). In 2018, an estimated 2.4 million ED visits and >700,000 hospitalizations from these injuries occurred among adults aged ≥65 years.

The mean concentrations of both PM1 and PM2.5 were 4.10 µg/m3 (47%) and 5.82 µg/m3 (33%) lower, respectively in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) period (January to April) than in the same period in 2019. Notably, the average concentrations of both classes of particulate matter (PM) in the COVID-19 period were the lowest for that period in all years since 2016. OC and EC also considerably lower (by 69 and 63%, respectively) during the COVID-19 period than during the same period in 2019. All pollutants were then started to increase after the resumption of the work in 2020. The pollutant variations correspond to the measure implemented during the COVID-19 period, including the nationwide lockdown and work resumption. Furthermore, the reductions in the ratios PM1/PM2.5 and OC/EC during COVID-19 period indicate lighter pollution and fewer emission sources. This analysis of the changes in the pollutant concentrations during the epidemic and non-epidemic periods illustrates the significance of the dominant pollution emissions at KUWAMS and the impact of pollution from China that undergoes long-range transport to KUWAMS.","Zhang, Hao; Zhang, Lulu; Yang, Lu; Zhou, Quanyu; Zhang, Xuan; Xing, Wanli; Hayakawa, Kazuichi; Toriba, Akira; Tang, Ning",Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,524,1

We identified a relatively small but rapidly increasing body of literature. The majority of publications were focused on public or livestock health and relatively few addressed wildlife health. Most studies that focused on human and livestock health were cross-sectional whereas wildlife health studies were mostly case reports. Fifteen diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health were identified and 21 diseases were identified as notifiable to either the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare or the Korea Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Two diseases were reported as occurring as epidemics; highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and virulent Newcastle disease. Six diseases or disease agents were described in the literature as emerging including HPAI, rabies, Babesia microti , avian coronaviruses, scrub typhus, and severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome virus. The diseases for which there were the largest number of publications were HPAI and rabies. The majority of wildlife-associated zoonotic disease publications focused on food-borne parasitic infections or rodent-associated diseases. Several publications focused on the potential of wildlife as reservoirs of livestock diseases; in particular, Korean water deer ( Hydropotes inermis argyropus ) and wild boar ( Sus scrofa ). In contrast, there were few publications on diseases of concern for wildlife populations or research to understand the impacts of these diseases for wildlife management. Increased focus on prospective studies would enhance understanding of disease dynamics in wildlife populations. For the high-consequence diseases that impact multiple sectors, a One Health approach, with coordination among the public health, agricultural, and environmental sectors, would be important.

Special attention is paid to near-patient surfaces but less so for sites outside the patient zone. This paper presents data on keyboard contamination and the risk of pathogen transmission from keyboards. METHODS Keyboards from nursing stations in three hospitals and a dental practice were analysed for bacterial contamination. Surfaces were pre-treated to remove planktonic bacteria so that any remaining bacteria were presumed to be associated with biofilm. Bacterial transfer from keyboard keys was studied following wiping with sterile water or sodium hypochlorite. The presence of multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) was sought using selective culture. RESULTS Moist swabbing did not detect bacteria from any keyboard samples. Use of enrichment broth, however, demonstrated MDRO from most samples. Gram-negative bacteria were recovered from almost half (45%) samples, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and MDR-Acinetobacter from 72%, 31% and 17% of samples, respectively. Isolates were transferred from 69% samples after wiping with sterile water, and from 54% samples after wiping with 1,000 ppm sodium hypochlorite. DISCUSSION While moist swabbing failed to detect bacteria from keyboards, pathogens were recovered using enrichment culture. Use of water or NaOCl-soaked wipes transferred bacteria from most samples tested. Our study implies that hospital keyboards situated outside the patient zone, commonly harbour dry surface biofilms (DSB) that offer a potential reservoir for transferable pathogens. While the role of keyboards in transmission is uncertain, we should pursue effective solutions for eliminating DSB from keyboards.","Ledwoch, K; Dancer, S J; Otter, J A; Kerr, K; Roposte, D; Maillard, J-Y",The Journal of hospital infection,524,1

We have identified 10,407 infants breastfed for at least 8-10 weeks from three large U.K. studies (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC; born 1990-1991], Southampton Woman's Survey [SWS; 1998-2008], and Infant Feeding Survey 2010 [IFS 2010]) to investigate the associations between early SF and breastfeeding cessation. In the earliest study (ALSPAC), 67% had started SF before the age of 4 months, but in the latest (IFS), only 23% had started before 4 months. Solid food introduction before 4 months was associated with stopping breastfeeding before 6 months in all three cohorts, with little effect of adjustment for maternal sociodemographic characteristics (Poisson regression, adjusted prevalence ratios: ALSPAC 1.55, [95% confidence interval 1.4, 1.8], SWS 1.13 [1.0, 1.3], IFS 1.10 [1.1, 1.3]). Using Cox regression, adjusted hazard ratios for breastfeeding cessation compared with SF after 5 months were 2.07 (1.8, 2.4) for SF before 4 and 1.51 (1.3, 1.8) at 4-5 months for ALSPAC and 1.25 (1.1, 1.5) and 1.15 (1.0, 1.3) for SWS. Earlier introduction of solids was associated with a shorter duration of breastfeeding, particularly in cohorts where earlier introduction of solids was the norm, with a dose-response relationship, which was not explained by background social characteristics. As mothers most commonly introduced solids in the month prior to the then recommended age, continuing to recommend deferring solids to the age of 6 months is important to support sustained breastfeeding.","Lessa, Angelina; Garcia, Ada L; Emmett, Pauline; Crozier, Sarah; Robinson, Sian; Godfrey, Keith M; Wright, Charlotte M",Maternal & child nutrition,524,1

Because these properties can be altered by variations in water content, shifts in sodium concentration, bleeding, and mass deformation, EIT has promise as a sensitive instrument for head injury monitoring to improve early recognition of deterioration and to observe the benefits of therapeutic intervention. This study presents a swine model of head injury used to determine the detection capabilities of an inexpensive bedside EIT monitoring system with a novel intracranial pressure (ICP)/EIT electrode combination sensor on induced intraparenchymal mass effect, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and cessation of brain blood flow. Conductivity difference images are shown in conjunction with ICP data, confirming the effects. METHODS Eight domestic piglets (3-4 weeks of age, mean 10 kg), under general anesthesia, were subjected to 4 injuries: induced intraparenchymal mass effect using an inflated, and later, deflated 0.15-mL Fogarty catheter; hemorrhage by intraparenchymal injection of 1-mL arterial blood; and ischemia/infarction by euthanasia. EIT and ICP data were recorded 10 minutes before inducing the injury until 10 minutes after injury. Continuous EIT and ICP monitoring were facilitated by a ring of circumferentially disposed cranial Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 intraparenchymal ICP/EIT sensor electrode combination. Data were recorded at 100 Hz. Two-dimensional tomographic conductivity difference (Δσ) images, rendered using data before and after an injury, were displayed in real time on an axial circular mesh. Regions of interest (ROI) within the images were automatically selected as the upper or lower 5% of conductivity data depending on the nature of the injury. Mean Δσ within the ROIs and background were statistically analyzed. ROI Δσ was compared with the background Δσ after an injury event using an unpaired, unequal variance t test. Conductivity change within an ROI after injury was likewise compared with the same ROI before the injury making use of unpaired t tests with unequal variance. RESULTS Eight animal subjects were studied, each undergoing 4 injury events including euthanasia. Changes in conductivity due to injury showed expected pathophysiologic effects in an ROI identified within the middle of the left hemisphere; this localization is reasonable given the actual site of injury (left hemisphere) and spatial warping associated with estimating a 3-dimensional conductivity distribution in 2-dimensional space. Results are shown as mean ± 1 SD. When averaged across all 8 animals, balloon inflation caused the mean Δσ within the ROI to shift by -11.4 ± 10.9 mS/m; balloon deflation by +9.4 ± 8.8 mS/m; blood injection by +19.5 ± 11.5 mS/m; death by -12.6 ± 13.2 mS/m. All induced injuries were detectable to statistical significance (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION This study confirms that the bedside EIT system with ICP/EIT combination sensor can detect induced trauma. Such a technique may hold promise for further research in the monitoring and management of traumatically brain-injured individuals.","Manwaring, Preston K; Moodie, Karen L; Hartov, Alexander; Manwaring, Kim H; Halter, Ryan J",Anesthesia and analgesia,524,19

To achieve this, the results need to be communicated effectively to several audiences. It is unclear how best to do this while not wasting scarce resources or causing avoidable distress or confusion. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the effectiveness, acceptability and resource implications of different methods of communication of clinical research results to lay or professional audiences, to inform practice. METHODS We will systematically review the published literature from 2000 to 2018 for reports of approaches for communicating clinical study results to lay audiences (patients, participants, carers and the wider public) or professional audiences (clinicians, policymakers, guideline developers, other medical professionals). We will search Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and grey literature sources. One reviewer will screen titles and abstracts for potential eligibility, discarding only those that are clearly irrelevant. Potentially relevant full texts will then be assessed for inclusion by two reviewers. Data extraction will be carried out by one reviewer using EPPI-Reviewer. Risk of bias will be assessed using the relevant Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, ROBINS-1, AXIS Appraisal Tool or Critical Appraisals Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist, depending on study design. We will decide whether to meta-analyse data based on whether the included trials are similar enough in terms of participants, settings, intervention, comparison and outcome measures to allow meaningful conclusions from a statistically pooled result. We will present the data in tables and narratively summarise the results. We will use thematic synthesis for qualitative studies. DISCUSSION Developing the search strategy for this review has been challenging as many of the concepts (patients, clinicians, clinical studies, and communication) are widely used in literature that is not relevant for inclusion in our review. We expect there will be limited comparative evidence, spread over a wide range of approaches, comparators and populations and, therefore, do not anticipate being able to carry out meta-analysis.

Antiviral drugs that inhibit influenza virus replication are the primary therapy used to diminish disease; however, there are two significant limitations to their effective use: (i) antiviral drugs exert selective pressure on the virus, resulting in the generation of more fit viral progeny that are resistant to treatment; and (ii) antiviral drugs do not directly inhibit immune-mediated pulmonary injury that is a significant component of disease. Here we show that dampening the host's immune response against influenza virus using an immunomodulatory drug, AAL-R, provides significant protection from mortality (82%) over that of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir alone (50%). AAL-R combined with oseltamivir provided maximum protection against a lethal challenge of influenza virus (96%). Mechanistically, AAL-R inhibits cellular and cytokine/chemokine responses to limit immunopathologic damage, while maintaining host control of virus replication.

The procedure was standardized, with the exception of the construction of the GJA, which was linear-stapled in 51 patients and hand-sewn in 53 other patients. A retrospective analysis was performed to compare the procedures. The series comprised 81 women and 23 men with a median age of 44 years, and a median BMI of 46.7 kg/m(2). There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients with respect to age, gender, BMI, ASA, and previously failed bariatric surgery. There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to mortality, conversion, early reoperation, surgical complications, GJA leakage or stricture, and bariatric results.

This trend cannot end the utility of cash but it may promote portable monetary administration toward a cashless world. MFS is anticipated to have a bright future as m-commerce increasingly becomes widely known. This study proposes the choice of making a trial and assessment research facility by using a fuzzy model as the most expository device. General forms of a triangular fuzzy number are subjective categories for a linguistic variable. Linguistic variables take on values defined in their term set, that is, the set of linguistic terms. The essential components, including personal innovativeness, transaction completeness, user-friendliness, anonymity, and privacy, are causal competitive advantages of the mobile payment system framework and may play a critical part in reacting to MFS. This study shows that transaction completeness, innovative interface design, privacy, and security facilitate MFS adoption. Furthermore, reliability is necessary to enhance trust in the MFS technology. This study draws on the outcomes of administrative suggestions and recommends a few observational strategies to improve the monetary administration in the MFS industry.","Sun, Chia-chi Chang Shih-chi",Mathematics,524,16

Here we present findings from an entomological surveillance study that began in Córdoba, Argentina, following the emergence of dengue in 2009. Methods From 2009 to 2017, larval surveys were conducted monthly, from November to May, in 600 randomly selected households distributed across the city. From 2009 to 2013, ovitraps (n=177) were sampled weekly to monitor the oviposition activity of Ae. aegypti. We explored seasonal and interannual dynamics of entomological variables and dengue transmission. Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant lag periods. Results Aedes aegypti were detected over the entire study period, and abundance peaked during the summer months (January to March). We identified a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with juvenile Ae. aegypti over the study period (from 5.7% of homes in 2009-10 to 15.4% of homes in 2016-17). Aedes aegypti eggs per ovitrap and larval abundance were positively associated with temperature in the same month. Autochthonous dengue transmission peaked in April, following a peak in imported dengue cases in March; autochthonous dengue was not positively associated with vector or climate variables. Conclusions This longitudinal study provides insights into the complex dynamics of arbovirus transmission and vector populations in a temperate region of arbovirus emergence. Our findings suggest that Córdoba is well suited for arbovirus disease transmission, given the stable and abundant vector populations. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of regional human movement. Author summary There is an increasing risk of arbovirus transmission in temperate regions. Argentina is located at the southern range of dengue virus transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In the last decade, epidemics of dengue fever have emerged for the first time in the city of Córdoba, Argentina. We present the study design and findings from an entomological surveillance study in Córdoba, which began following the emergence of dengue in 2009. We found that Ae. aegypti were most abundant from January to March, followed by a peak in local dengue transmission in April. Over the study period, we noted a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with Ae. aegypti. Vector indices were positively associated with warmer temperatures, which have been increasing in this region. However, the timing of local dengue transmission appears to be driven by the appearance of imported dengue cases associated with human movement. These results highlight the important role of long term surveillance studies in areas of disease emergence.","Estallo, Elizabet L.; Sippy, Rachel; Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.; Grech, Marta G.; Benitez, Elisabet M.; Ludueña-Almeida, Francisco F.; Ainete, Mariela; Frias-Cespedes, María; Robert, Michael; Romero, Moory M.; Almirón, Walter R.",bioRxiv,524,1

The program combines epidemiological modelling and surveillance (Target); fast and frequent testing using a novel and FDA Emergency Use Authorized low-cost and scalable saliva-based RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 that bypasses RNA extraction, called covidSHIELD (Test); and digital tools that communicate test results, notify of potential exposures, and promote compliance with public health mandates (Tell). These elements were combined with masks, social distancing, and robust education efforts. In Fall 2020, we performed more than 1,000,000 covidSHIELD tests while keeping classrooms, laboratories, and many other university activities open. Generally, our case positivity rates remained less than 0.5%, we prevented transmission from our students to our faculty and staff, and data indicate that we had no spread in our classrooms or research laboratories. During this fall semester, we had zero COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths amongst our university community. We also prevented transmission from our university community to the surrounding Champaign County community. Our experience demonstrates that multimodal transmission mitigation programs can enable university communities to achieve such outcomes until widespread vaccination against COVID-19 is achieved, and provides a roadmap for how future pandemics can be addressed.","Ranoa, D.

Schools were closed, and examinations were postponed indefinitely. Students of private schools were able to resume academic activities online. However, most public schools could not do so, due to lack of infrastructure. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the impacts of the novel coronavirus on final-year students of social work, at the University of Nigeria. Data was collected from 20 undergraduates using in-depth interviews. Findings showed that the pandemic had negative effects on different aspects of the students’ lives. It was also revealed that some of the students were resilient and were able to use various coping strategies to avoid being overwhelmed by the situation. A policy implication of this study is the need for revitalization of Nigerian public universities, as the continued lockdown of schools shows how public universities are poorly managed in the country. This poor management of public schools has made it impossible for a switch to virtual learning.

Power imbalances can occur in the supply chain when certain parties act opportunistically. These imbalances are analyzed through theories of Resource Dependence, Resource Orchestration, and Entrepreneurial Orientation and embellished through the business failure and crisis management literature. Using actual data, the study shows the power shifts in the supply chain. Using qualitative data, the responses taken by these small businesses to survive the crisis were reviewed. The sales data of these small businesses were then compared to a national transportation index. The results of the comparison show more volatility among these businesses than the index. Both small businesses utilized their entrepreneurial orientation (EO) by taking forward-looking actions to reduce their risk exposure and avoid failure. They also utilized resource orchestration theory by restructuring their resource portfolio to lower their cost structures via selected layoffs.

We show that publicly available data on human mobility -- collected by Google, Facebook, and other providers -- can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and forecast the spread of COVID-19. This approach relies on simple and transparent statistical models, and involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPolicymakers everywhere are working to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively contain the spread of COVID-19 without excessively stifling economic activity. In some contexts, decision-makers have access to sophisticated epidemiological models and detailed case data. However, a large number of decisions, particularly in low-income and vulnerable communities, are being made with limited or no modeling support. We examine how public human mobility data can be combined with simple statistical models to provide near real-time feedback on non-pharmaceutical policy interventions. Our objective is to provide a simple framework that can be easily implemented and adapted by local decision-makers. MethodsWe develop simple statistical models to measure the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and forecast the spread of COVID-19 at local, state, and national levels. The method integrates concepts from econometrics and machine learning, and relies only upon publicly available data on human mobility. The approach does not require explicit epidemiological modeling, and involves minimal assumptions about disease dynamics. We evaluate this approach using local and regional data from China, France, Italy, South Korea, and the United States, as well as national data from 80 countries around the world. FindingsWe find that NPIs are associated with significant reductions in human mobility, and that changes in mobility can be used to forecast COVID-19 infections. The first set of results show the impact of NPIs on human mobility at all geographic scales. While different policies have different effects on different populations, we observed total reductions in mobility between 40 and 84 percent. The second set of results indicate that -- even in the absence of other epidemiological information -- mobility data substantially improves 10-day case rates forecasts at the county (20.75% error, US), state (21.82 % error, US), and global (15.24% error) level. Finally, for example, country-level results suggest that a shelter-in-place policy targeting a 10% increase in the amount of time spent at home would decrease the propagation of new cases by 32% by the end of a 10 day period. InterpretationIn rapidly evolving disease outbreaks, decision-makers do not always have immediate access to sophisticated epidemiological models. In such cases, valuable insight can still be derived from simple statistic models and readily-available public data. These models can be quickly fit with a populations own data and updated over time, thereby capturing social and epidemiological dynamics that are unique to a specific locality or time period. Our results suggest that this approach can effectively support decision-making from local (e.g., city) to national scales.","Ilin, Cornelia; Annan-Phan, SÃ©bastien; Tai, Xiao Hui; Mehra, Shikhar; Hsiang, Solomon M; Blumenstock, Joshua E",,524,7

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of digital infrastructure in supporting compliance with travel restrictions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have issued “stay-at-home” orders and curtailed a variety of economic activities. As countries have adopted aggressive policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, varying levels of national infrastructure to provide internet access have limited some nations’ ability to reduce travel requirements. As national policies struggle to address public health issues, location analytics enabled by big data provide unique insights regarding the efficacy of digital infrastructure. These insights can provide valuable tools to public health officials and regulators in understanding how health recommendations are implemented within an economy.Design/methodology/approachThis study analyzes mobile phone movement data during the first half of 2020 and finds that countries that provided greater access to internet capabilities were better able to reduce work-related mobility.FindingsThis study’s findings indicate that greater levels of digital infrastructure may better prepare countries to adapt to societal disruptions such as COVID-19.Practical implicationsThis study’s findings demonstrate that public health controls regarding movement and person-to-person interaction are less likely to be effective in nations with weaker digital infrastructure, even after accounting for variation attributable to gross domestic product (GDP) and pandemic severity. This could limit public health options in developing countries when faced with future socially disruptive events and encourage national investment in digital infrastructure.Social implicationsThis study’s findings highlight positive externalities associated with reducing the digital divide. Developing better digital business infrastructure globally may reduce human exposure to future pandemic risks.Originality/valueThis research demonstrates the practical development implications of analysis of aggregate data widely available through mobile technology.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the gold standard. We compared two frequently used commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2-antigens, the SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche Diagnostics) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott Diagnostics), against rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Methods: We compared the tests in 2215 all-comers at a diagnostic centre between February 1 and March 31, 2021. rRT-PCR-positive samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 variants. Findings: 338 participants (15%) were rRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivities of Roche-RDT and Abbott-RDT were 60.4% and 56.8% (P<0.0001) and specificities 99.7% and 99.8% (P=0.076), respectively. Sensitivity inversely correlated with rRT-PCR-derived Ct values. Unadjusted, the RDTs had higher sensitivities in individuals referred by treating physicians and health departments than those tested for other reasons, in persons without comorbidities compared to those with comorbidities, in individuals with symptoms suggesting COVID-19, and in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to Alpha variant carriers. The associations of sensitivity with clinical symptoms and the SARS-CoV-2 genotype were robust against adjustment for Ct values. Assuming that 10 000 symptomatic individuals are tested, 500 of which are truly positive, the RDTs would generate 38 false-positive and 124 false-negative results. Assuming that 10 000 asymptomatic individuals are tested, including 50 true positives, 18 false-positives and 34 false- negatives would be generated. Interpretation: The sensitivities of the two RDTs are unsatisfactory. This calls into question whether their widespread use is effective in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Suspension of all elective surgical procedures and delays in processing of unemployment claims resulted in many Kentucky health care personnel abruptly experiencing financial uncertainty. We explored the experience of abrupt food insecurity in households with at least 1 unemployed health care provider and identified strategies used to provide nutrition for household members during the pandemic. The Theory of Planned Behavior's perceived behavioral control construct was used to guide analysis. In November 2020, virtual semi-structured interviews via Microsoft Teams or telephone were conducted with nurses and nurse practitioners (n = 8) who were recruited via print advertisement in the state board of nursing's quarterly publication. Inclusion criteria included unemployment specifically in response to COVID pandemic restrictions on hospital procedures during March-June of 2020. Each interview lasted 45-60 minutes and participants received reimbursement for their time. NVivo software was used to analyze themes. Two qualitative nurse researchers used the Spiegelberg 3-step process of intuiting, analyzing, and describing. Food security strategies that emerged from the interviews included stockpiling, reprioritization of household budget items, food preservation, changes in cooking techniques, shared responsibility for meals, creative employment opportunities, and the purchase/preparation of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. Abrupt unemployment of U.S. health care personnel, whose employment is usually less sensitive to supply-demand fluctuations, and the projected post-pandemic rise in food costs necessitate preparation for future shifts in employment status. Adaptive strategies used to enhance food security in these individuals have the potential for both positive and negative impact on health outcomes. While health care personnel reported some responses as beneficial to health, the perceived need to purchase and prepare calorie-dense foods reflects the fear of food insecurity. Most food security interventional programs target households with lower incomes and/or those receiving supplemental food assistance. The strategies implemented by these health care providers can inform existing and new food security programs. None.

Perhaps, common proteins are comorbid disease drivers. To understand the origin of disease comorbidity and to identify the essential proteins and pathways underlying comorbid diseases, we developed LeMeDISCO (Large-Scale Molecular Interpretation of Disease Comorbidity), an algorithm that predicts disease comorbidities from shared mode of action (MOA) proteins predicted by the AI-based MEDICASCY algorithm. LeMeDISCO was applied to predict the general occurrence of comorbid diseases for 3608 distinct diseases. To illustrate the power of LeMeDISCO, we elucidate the possible etiology of coronary artery disease and ovarian cancer by determining the comorbidity enriched MOA proteins and pathways and suggest hypotheses for subsequent scientific investigation.

Meanwhile, many of the world's richest people have seen their wealth increase substantially during the pandemic, despite the significant economic disruptions that it has caused on the whole. It is uncontroversial that these effects, which have exacerbated already unacceptable levels of poverty and inequality, call for robust policy responses from governments. In this paper, I argue that the disparate economic effects of the pandemic also generate direct obligations of justice for those who have benefitted from pandemic windfalls. Specifically, I argue that even if we accept that those who benefit from distributive injustice in the ordinary, predictable course of life within unjust institutions do not have direct obligations to redirect their unjust benefits to those who are unjustly disadvantaged, there are powerful reasons to hold that benefitting from pandemic windfalls does ground such an obligation.","Berkey, Brian",Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics,524,1

RSV largely disappeared in 2020 due to precautions taken because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Projecting the timing and intensity of the re-emergence of RSV and the age groups affected is crucial for planning for the administration of prophylactic antibodies and anticipating hospital capacity. Objective: To project the potential timing and intensity of re-emergent RSV epidemics in different age groups. Design, Setting, Participants: Mathematical models were used to reproduce the annual RSV epidemics before the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and California. These models were modified to project the trajectory of RSV epidemics in 2020-2025 under different scenarios with varying stringency of mitigation measures for SARS-CoV-2: 1) constant low RSV transmission rate from March 2020 to March 2021; 2) an immediate decrease in RSV transmission in March 2020 followed by a gradual increase in transmission until April 2021; 3) a decrease in non-household contacts from April to July 2020. Simulations also evaluated factors likely to impact the re-emergence of RSV epidemics, including introduction of virus from out-of-state sources and decreased transplacentally acquired immunity in infants. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of this study was defined as the predicted number of RSV hospitalizations each month in the entire population. Secondary outcomes included the age distribution of hospitalizations among children <5 years of age, incidence of any RSV infection, and incidence of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Results: In the 2021-2022 RSV season, we expect that the lifting of mitigation measures and build-up of susceptibility will lead to a larger-than-normal RSV outbreak. We predict an earlier-than-usual onset in the upcoming RSV season if there is substantial external introduction of RSV. Among children 1-4 years of age, the incidence of RSV infections could be twice that of a typical RSV season, with infants <6 months of age having the greatest seasonal increase in the incidence of both severe RSV LRIs and hospitalizations. Conclusions and Relevance: Pediatric departments, including pediatric intensive care units, should be alert to large RSV outbreaks. Enhanced surveillance is required for both prophylaxis administration and hospital capacity management.","Zheng, Z.; Pitzer, V. E.; Shapiro, E. D.; Bont, L. J.; Weinberger, D. M.",,524,27

The constructed pIC-PCV2 contained the whole PCV2 genome from a German isolate together with a partial duplication of 467 bp. PK-15 cells were transfected with pIC-PCV2 and an indirect immune fluorescence assay (IFA) was performed 7 days post-transfection. The PCV2 Cap gene was expressed in approximately 20 % of the cultured cells, and only the recombination product, and not pIC-PCV2, was subsequently detected by PCR and Southern blot. This result indicated that infection by pIC-PCV2 delivered genomic PCV2 DNA specifically into susceptible cells and led to the expression of a functional virus genome. Eighteen 30- to 40-day-old conventional pigs were distributed into three groups. Group 1 pigs (n=6) were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with a Spanish isolate of PCV2 propagated in cell culture; pigs from group 2 (n=6) were inoculated with pIC-PCV2 intramuscularly (i.m.), and the last group of pigs (n=6) was inoculated with pIC-PCV2 intraperitoneally (i.p.). All pigs remained clinically healthy during the whole experimental period (35 days). Pigs that received pIC-PCV2 i.p. and i.m., as well as those PCV2 i.n. inoculated, became infected based on an in situ hybridization (ISH), PCR, TaqMan PCR and serological results. The results of this study confirm that cloned PCV2 genomic DNA is infectious both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to cause PMWS-like lesions in i.p. and i.m. experimentally inoculated pigs.","Roca, M; Balasch, M; Segalés, J; Calsamiglia, M; Viaplana, E; Urniza, A; Hattermann, K; Mankertz, A; Plana-Durán, J; Domingo, M",The Journal of general virology,524,28

We aimed at investigating the effectiveness and safety of add-on EVT after IV tPA in AIS patients with ICAO. METHODS Between March 2010 and March 2013, 3,689 consecutive ischemic stroke patients who were hospitalized within 4.5 h of onset were identified using a prospective stroke registry at 11 centers in Korea. Among them, patients with persistent ICAO after receiving IV tPA and whose 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was available were finally enrolled. A propensity score analysis with inverse-probability of treatment weighting was used to eliminate baseline imbalances between those receiving add-on EVT and IV tPA alone. RESULTS Among 264 patients enrolled in this study (mean age 71.4; male 56.4%; median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score 15), 117 (44.3%) received add-on EVT. The add-on EVT group had a higher frequency of favorable outcome on the mRS ≤2 (35.0 vs. 18.4%; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.79; 95% CI 1.66-4.67) and lower mortality (17.9 vs. 35.4%; aOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13-0.42) at 3 months, when compared to the IV tPA-alone group. Add-on EVT did not significantly increase the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage (5.1 vs. 4.1%; aOR 1.01; 95% CI 0.37-2.70). The rate of successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade ≥2b) in the add-on EVT group was 69.2%. CONCLUSIONS Compared to an IV tPA alone, add-on EVT can improve clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic ICAO within 4.5 h of onset without a significant increase of symptomatic hemorrhage.","Hong, Jeong-Ho; Sohn, Sung-Il; Kang, Jihoon; Jang, Min Uk; Kim, Beom Joon; Han, Moon-Ku; Park, Tai Hwan; Park, Sang-Soon; Lee, Kyung Bok; Lee, Byung-Chul; Yu, Kyung-Ho; Oh, Mi Sun; Cha, Jae Kwan; Kim, Dae Hyun; Lee, Jun; Lee, Soo Joo; Ko, Youngchai; Kim, Jae Guk; Park, Jong-Moo; Kang, Kyusik; Cho, Yong-Jin; Hong, Keun-Sik; Cho, Ki-Hyun; Kim, Joon-Tae; Choi, Jay Chol; Lee, Juneyoung; Lee, Ji-Sung; Gorelick, Philip B; Bae, Hee-Joon",Cerebrovascular diseases,524,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional online study using a validated questionnaire was distributed to doctors (MD), assistant medical officers (AMO), and staff nurses (SN) at an urban tertiary Emergency Department. It comprised of 40 knowledge and 10 confidence-level questions related to resuscitation and airway management steps. RESULTS A total of 135 from 167 eligible EHCW were enrolled. 68.9% (n = 93) had high knowledge while 53.3% (n = 72) possessed high confidence level. Overall knowledge mean score was 32.96/40 (SD = 3.63) between MD (33.88±3.09), AMO (32.28±4.03), and SN (32.00±3.60), P= 0.025. EHCWs with a length of service (LOS) between 4-10 years had the highest knowledge compared to those with LOS <4-year (33.71±3.39 versus 31.21±3.19 P = 0.002). Airway-related knowledge was significantly different between the designations and LOS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively). Overall, EHCW confidence level against LOS showed significant difference [F (2, 132) = 5.46, P = 0.005] with longer LOS showing better confidence. MD showed the highest confidence compared to AMO and SN (3.67±0.69, 3.53±0.68, 3.26±0.64) P = 0.049. The majority EHCW were confident in performing high-quality chest-compression, and handling of Personal Protective Equipment but less than half were confident in resuscitating, leading the resuscitation, managing the airway or being successful in first intubation attempt. CONCLUSIONS EHCW possessed good knowledge in airway and resuscitation of COVID-19 patients, but differed between designations and LOS. A longer LOS was associated with better confidence, but there were some aspects in airway management and resuscitation that needed improvement.","Abd Samat, Azlan Helmy; Isa, Mohd Hisham; Sabardin, Dazlin Masdiana; Jamal, Shamsuriani Md; Jaafar, Mohd Johar; Hamzah, Faizal Amri; Mahmud, Alias; Sanip, Amirudin; Syed Ali, Syed Mohammad; Saiboon, Ismail Mohd","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",524,1

The N protein produced in Sf9 cells was phosphorylated whereas N protein from E. coli was not. Our data indicated that N protein purified from E. coli was more sensitive to anti-IBV serum than the protein from Sf9 cells. The recombinant N protein did not react with the antisera to other avian pathogens, implying that it was specific in the recognition of IBV antibodies. In addition, the data from the detection of field samples and IBV strains indicated that using the recombinant protein as coating antigen could achieve an equivalent performance to an ELISA kit based on infected material extracts as a source of antigen(s).

If left undetected and untreated, fear-based signs and symptoms may be extremely debilitating and lead to chronic problems with a risk of permanent damage to the brain's locus coeruleus and stress response circuits. The triage management of susceptible, exposed, and infectious victims seeking care must be sensitive and specific enough to identify individuals with excessive levels of fear in order to address the nuances of fear-based symptoms at the initial point of contact. These acute conditions, which include hyper-vigilant fear, are managed best by timely and effective information, rapid evaluation, and possibly medications that uniquely address the locus-coeruleus-driven noradrenalin over-activation. It is recommended that a Fear and Resilience (FR) Checklist be included as an essential triage tool to identify those most at risk. The use of this checklist facilitates an enhanced capacity to respond to limitations brought about by surge capacity requirements. Whereas the utility of such a checklist is evident, predictive validity studies will be required. In addition to identifying individuals who are emotionally, medically, and socially hypo-resilient, the FR Checklist simultaneously identifies individuals who are hyper-resilient and can be asked to volunteer, and thus, rapidly expand the surge capacity.","Bracha, H Stefan; Burkle, Frederick M",Prehospital and disaster medicine,524,17

Materials and Methods The present retrospective observational study, on 35 symptomatic and 35 asymptomatic patients, was carried out in SMS Medical College and Hospital, Jaipur comparatively assessing epidemiological history, clinical features and laboratory investigations. Results During the course of study, 35 symptomatic and 35 asymptomatic patients were assessed. All the patients were of Indian ethnicity and had a history of contact with a COVID 19 positive case. Male patients constituted of 67 % of the population. The median age of patients in symptomatic and asymptomatic group was 60 years and 30 years, respectively. Out of the 70 patients studied, 47 (67%) patients recovered and were discharged whereas 23 (32.8 %) succumbed to the disease process. Lymphopenia was observed in 80% of symptomatic patient population, though only 11.5% of asymptomatic patients documented lymphopenia. Among the patients who died of COVID 19 (n=23), lymphopenia was observed in 18 (82%) patients, with moderate lymphopenia present in 13 (59 %) and severe lymphopenia present in 5 (22.7%) patients. Neutrophilia was observed across both category of patients, symptomatic and asymptomatic. Neutrophilia featured prominently in the symptomatic COVID-19 group with a median nadir in ALC of 7 × 109/L as compared to that of 3.8 × 109/L so observed in asymptomatic sample population. Red cell distribution width was slightly raised in both groups with a median RDW of 15.3% in COVID 19 patients which was raised as compared to that observed in normal population (range: 12.8 ± 1.2 %). Conclusion Lymphopenia is an effective and reliable indicator of onset of symptoms and severity of disease in COVID-19 patients. RDW was found to be higher in COVID 19 patients in comparison to normal patients, however it had no significant relationship with appearance of symptoms or severity of the disease.","Sharma, Deepti; Dayama, Ashish; Banerjee, S; Bhandhari, Sudhir; Chatterjee, Aishwarya; Chatterjee, Debopriya",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,524,11

In that study, inapparent or mild disease was observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV or EPEC, whereas severe growth depression and high mortality were observed in dually inoculated turkeys. The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the pathogenesis of combined TCV/EPEC infection in young turkeys and determine the role of these agents in the observed synergistic interaction. Experiments were conducted to determine 1) effect of EPEC dose, with and without concurrent TCV infection, and 2) effect of TCV exposure, before and after EPEC exposure, on development of clinical disease. Additionally, the effect of combined infection on TCV and EPEC shedding was determined. No clinical sign of disease and no attaching and effacing (AE) lesions characteristic of EPEC were observed in turkeys inoculated with only EPEC isolate R98/5, even when turkeys were inoculated with 10(10) colony forming units (CFU) EPEC (high dose exposure). Only mild growth depression was observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV; however, turkeys inoculated with both TCV and 10(4) CFU EPEC (low dose exposure) developed severe disease characterized by high mortality, marked growth depression, and AE lesions. Inoculation of turkeys with TCV 7 days prior to EPEC inoculation produced more severe disease (numerically greater mortality, significantly lower survival probability [P < 0.05], increased frequency of AE lesions) than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to TCV or simultaneously inoculated with these agents. Coinfection of turkeys with TCV and EPEC resulted in significantly increased (P < 0.05) shedding of EPEC, but not TCV, in intestinal contents of turkeys. These findings indicate that TCV infection predisposes young turkeys to secondary EPEC infection and potentiates the expression of EPEC pathogenicity in young turkeys.","Pakpinyo, S; Ley, D H; Barnes, H J; Vaillancourt, J P; Guy, J S",Avian diseases,524,17

The immunogenicity of a first-generation, replication-competent Ad35-based vaccine was tested in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) rhesus macaque model by evaluating its capacity to boost immunity generated by Ad5-based vectors. A series of four immunizations with replication-defective Ad5 vectors expressing SIVmac239 gag induced high-frequency responses mediated by both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells directed against several epitopes. Ad5-specific neutralizing antibody responses that did not neutralize Ad35 were rapidly induced but waned over time. Subsequent immunization with Ad5-based vectors was minimally effective, whereas immunization with Ad35-based vectors generated a strong increase in the frequency of Gag-specific T cells with specificities that were unchanged. While this boosting response was relatively transient, challenge with the distinct pathogenic isolate SIV/DeltaB670 generated robust and selective recall responses to Gag with similar specificities as induced by vaccination that were elevated for 25 weeks relative to controls. Vaccination had measurable albeit minor effects on virus load. Unexpectedly, regional hypervariability within the Gag sequence of SIV/DeltaB670 was associated with mutation of the conserved CD8(+) T-cell epitope CM9 without concurrent flanking mutations and in the absence of immune pressure. These findings support the further development of Ad35 as a vaccine vector, and promote vaccine regimens that utilize serial administration of heterologous adenoviruses.","Barratt-Boyes, Simon M; Soloff, Adam C; Gao, Wentao; Nwanegbo, Edward; Liu, Xiangdong; Rajakumar, Premeela A; Brown, Kevin N; Robbins, Paul D; Murphey-Corb, Michael; Day, Richard D; Gambotto, Andrea",The Journal of general virology,524,16

Method The Australian healthcare system, mental health policy and governance for youth mental healthcare are contextually described. The structure and promulgation of the headspace NGO is detailed, as a parallel provider of primary mental healthcare outside of existing public and private mental health services. A review of the existing research on the evaluation of headspace was conducted. Results Headspace has expanded rapidly due to successful political advocacy on behalf of the youth early intervention model, with limited coordination in terms of governance, planning and implementation with existing mental health services. In spite of consuming considerable resources, there has been limited evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions Canadians should be wary of large youth programs that operate outside mainstream mental healthcare because of similar dangers such as poor co-ordination with existing government-funded services, duplication of care, the substantial consumption of resources, and limited evaluation of outcomes.

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be further clarified. Here, we have identified that M1, an alphavirus isolated in 1960s, targeted C6 malignant glioma cells for apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that more cells enter S-phase post M1 infection, and subsequently undergo a classic apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism of S-phase arrest and its relationship to apoptosis, we tested the expression of several critical cell cycle regulatory proteins and found elevated phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), decreased expression of cyclin A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Notably, the protein level of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was downregulated earliest and most effectively among all tested changes of cell cycle regulators, though its mRNA level was strongly upregulated. To evaluate the role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in S-phase accumulation and subsequent apoptosis, we confirmed that exogenous p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression or treatment with roscovitine (a selective chemical inhibitor of CDK2) efficiently protected against apoptosis with a reduced S-phase accumulation. Thus, it is indicated that the downregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) mediated C6 apoptosis via overactivation of CDK2. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) totally translocated to nucleolus during M1-induced C6 apoptosis. Altogether, downregulation and nucleolar translocation of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein played an active role in M1-induced C6 apoptosis.","Hu, Jun; Cai, Xiao-Feng; Yan, Guangmei",Cell cycle,524,20

Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is now as common as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, but data are sparse regarding outcomes for patients with low-risk PE treated with DOACs as outpatients. We conducted a systematic review of literature on outcomes of outpatient management for PE, including comparisons to inpatient treatment and differences by anticoagulant class. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PubMed, CENTRAL, clinicaltrials.gov, and ICTRN for studies published from January 1980 through February 2019 using a predefined strategy developed with a medical librarian. We included English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective nonrandomized trials (NRTs) of adult patients diagnosed with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and discharged from the emergency department (ED) or within 48 hours. Our primary outcome included four major adverse outcomes (all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding) within 30 and 90 days. A preplanned subanalysis of high-quality studies assessed outcomes associated with different anticoagulation treatment classes. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 6,818 records, of which 12 studies (4 RCT, 8 NRT) with a total of 3191 patients were included in the review. All RCTs and six NRTs were determined to have low-moderate risk of bias and were classified as high quality. Outpatients in these studies (n=1814) had rates of 90-day major adverse outcomes below 1%, including all-cause mortality (0.7% [95% CI 0.4-1.2%]), PE-related mortality (0.06% [0.01-0.3%]), recurrent VTE (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]) and major bleeding (0.8% [0.5-1.4%]). Exploratory analysis revealed no association between anticoagulant treatment class and rates of major adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with low-risk PE treated as outpatients, few patients experienced major adverse outcomes such as mortality, recurrent VTE, or major bleeding within 90 days.","Maughan, Brandon C; Frueh, Lisa; McDonagh, Marian S; Casciere, Bryan; Kline, Jeffrey A",Acad. emerg. med,524,27

While providing information about the transduced neuron expressing a ligand-activated molecule, chemogenetics does not provide understanding about the antecedent circuit that drives that neuron's activity. For current approaches, this is not feasible, because the activating molecules are not genetically encoded. The insect allatostatin/allatostatin receptor system, a highly specific, powerful inhibitory chemogenetic approach, has this advantage, because the ligand, being a peptide, is genetically encoded. We developed viral vector-based systems to express biologically active allatostatin in neurons in vivo and allatostatin receptors in subpopulations of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate that activity-dependent release of allatostatin induces inhibition of allatostatin receptor-expressing neurons. We validate the approach in the vagal viscerosensory system where inhibitory, rather than the usual excitatory, viscerosensory input leads to sustained decreases in baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and bodyweight.","Ngo, Hoai Buu; Melo, Mariana R; Layfield, Sharon; Connelly, Angela A; Bassi, Jaspreet K; Xie, Lin; Menuet, Clément; McDougall, Stuart J; Bathgate, Ross A D; Allen, Andrew M",Cell Rep,524,29

For all three techniques, Coordinate Response Measure sentences were used as the stimuli and ""Charlie"" was used as the call sign. A progressive tracking procedure was used to estimate the speech identification thresholds for listeners with varying hearing thresholds. The target sentence was always presented at 0° azimuth angle, whereas the maskers were colocated (0°) with the target or symmetrically spatially separated by ±15°, ±30°, or ±45°. Results Data analysis revealed similar speech identification thresholds for the iPad and headphone conditions and slightly poorer thresholds for the loudspeaker array condition across participant groups. This was true for all spatial separations between the target and the maskers. Conclusion Strong correlation between the headphone and iPad data presented in this study indicated that the spatial release from masking module in the PART iPad app can be used as a clinical tool to assess spatial processing ability prior to audiologic evaluation in the clinic and can also be used to make recommendations for and to track progress with aural rehabilitation programs over time.","Srinivasan, Nirmal Kumar; Holtz, Allison; Gallun, Frederick J",Am J Audiol,524,16

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. Close monitoring of predictive models of such indicators in the highly affected countries would help to evaluate the potential fatality if the second wave of pandemic occurs. The future studies should be focused on identifying accurate indicators to mitigate the effect of underestimation or overestimation of COVID-19 burden.","Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti; Mehta, Deep; Shah, Dhaivat; Kelkar, Raveena; Pinto, Candida; Suprun, Maria; Dhamoon, Mandip; Hennig, Nils; Sacks, Henry",J Glob Health,524,16

If not detected and treated in time, COVID-19 can cause multi-organ failure and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the behavior of the spread of COVID-19 as well as the projection of infections and deaths. This information is very relevant so that public health organizations can distribute financial resources efficiently and take appropriate containment measures. In this research, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile. METHODS: The methodology used in this research consisted of modeling cases of both confirmed diagnoses and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA henceforth) models, Exponential Smoothing techniques, and Poisson models for time-dependent count data. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions using a training set and a test set. RESULTS: The dataset used in this research indicated that the most appropriate model is the ARIMA time series model for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Chile, the most suitable approach is the damped trend method. CONCLUSION: The ARIMA models are an alternative to modeling the behavior of the spread of COVID-19; however, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, other methodologies can better predict the behavior of these records, for example, the Holt-Winter method implemented with time-dependent count data.","Barría-Sandoval, Claudia; Ferreira, Guillermo; Benz-Parra, Katherine; López-Flores, Pablo",PLoS One,524,1

We evaluate herein the feasibility of expanding virus-specific T cells (VST) against SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo through a standard protocol proven effective for other viruses. The experiment was performed in three different donors' scenarios: (a) SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection/negative serology, (b) SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection/positive serology, and (c) no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/negative serology. We were able to obtain an expanded VST product from donors 1 and 2 (1.6x and 1.8x increase of baseline VST count, respectively) consisting in CD3 + cells (80.3% and 62.7%, respectively) with CD4 + dominance (60% in both donors). Higher numbers of VST were obtained from the donor 2 as compared to donor 1. T-cell clonality test showed oligoclonal reproducible peaks on a polyclonal background for both donors.

This proof-of-concept study supports the feasibility of expanding ex vivo SARS-CoV-2-specific VST from blood of convalescent donors. The results raise the question of whether the selection of seropositive donors may be a strategy to obtain cell lines enriched in their SARS-CoV-2-specificity for future adoptive transfer to immunosuppressed patients.","Guerreiro, Manuel; Aguilar-Gallardo, Cristóbal; Montoro, Juan; Francés-Gómez, Clara; Latorre, Víctor; Luna, Irene; Planelles, Dolores; Carrasco, María Paz; Gómez, María Dolores; González-Barberá, Eva María; Aguado, Cristina; Sempere, Amparo; Solves, Pilar; Gómez-Seguí, Inés; Balaguer-Rosello, Aitana; Louro, Alberto; Perla, Aurora; Larrea, Luis; Sanz, Jaime; Arbona, Cristina; de la Rubia, Javier; Geller, Ron; Sanz, Miguel Ángel; Sanz, Guillermo; Luis Piñana, José",Transpl Infect Dis,524,12

The study is designed to characterize trajectories of change in DS-associated AD (DS-AD). The current study reports its cross-sectional analysis of the first 90 subjects enrolled. Plasma biomarkers phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid β peptides (Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were undertaken with previously published methods. The clinical data from the baseline visit include demographics as well as the cognitive measures under the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) and Down Syndrome Mental Status Examination (DS-MSE). Biomarker distributions are described with strong statistical associations observed with participant age. The biomarker data contributes to understanding DS-AD across the spectrum of disease. Collectively, the biomarker data show evidence of DS-AD progression beginning at approximately 40 years of age. Exploring these data across the full LIFE-DSR longitudinal study population will be an important resource in understanding the onset, progression, and clinical profiles of DS-AD pathophysiology.","Hendrix, James A.; Airey, David C.; Britton, Angela Burke Anna D.; Capone, George T.; Chavez, Ronelyn Chen Jacqueline Chicoine Brian Costa Alberto C.

We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the effects of various antiplatelet regimens on saphenous vein graft patency, mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding among CABG patients. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval Systems Online, Excerpta Medica Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, American College of Physicians Journal Club and conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials. Screening, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were performed in duplicate. We conducted a random effect Bayesian network meta-analysis including both direct and indirect comparisons. RESULTS: We included 43 randomized controlled trials studying 15 511 patients. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor [odds ratio (OR) 2.53, 95% credible interval (CrI) 1.35-4.72; I2 = 55; low certainty] or clopidogrel (OR 1.56, 95% CrI 1.02-2.39; I2 = 55; very low certainty) improved saphenous vein graft patency when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. DAPT with low-dose ASA and ticagrelor was associated with lower mortality (OR 0.52, 95% CrI 0.30-0.87; I2 = 14; high certainty) and lower major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.63, 95% CrI 0.44-0.91; I2 = 0; high certainty) when compared to low-dose ASA monotherapy. Based on moderate certainty evidence, DAPT was associated with an increase in major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DAPT improves saphenous vein graft patency, mortality and major adverse cardiovascular event. As such, surgeons and physicians should consider re-initiating DAPT for acute coronary syndrome patients after their CABG, at the expense of an increased risk for major bleeding.

The technique described in this protocol involves allowing particles or fragments of cells to settle onto a support film, then applying a drop of metal salt solution to the adherent particulate specimen. The stain penetrates the interstices of the particles to bring out detail. In this situation, the preparation dries rapidly. The dissolved substance precipitates out of solution in an amorphous condition at the 0.1-nm level, and it is deposited over the support film and exposed surface of the specimen. The theoretical requirements of a good negative staining are a substance (1) of high density to provide high contrast, (2) at high solubility so that the stain does not come out of solution prematurely but does so only at the final stage of drying, (3) of high melting point and boiling point so that the material does not evaporate at high temperatures induced by the electron beam, and (4) in which the precipitate should be essentially amorphous down to the limit of resolution.","Hendricks, Gregory; Sena-Esteves, Miguel; Gao, Guangping",Cold Spring Harb Protoc,524,27

We compared the impact of early versus late intubation on infection control and performance in a randomised in situ simulation, using fluorescent powder as a surrogate for contamination. Twenty anaesthetists and intensivists intubated a simulated patient with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the degree of contamination. The secondary outcomes included the use of bag-valve-mask ventilation, the incidence of manikin cough, intubation time, first attempt success and heart rate variability as a measure of stress. The contamination score was significantly increased in the late intubation group, mean (standard deviation, SD) 17.20 (6.17), 95% confidence intervals (CI) 12.80 to 21.62 versus the early intubation group, mean (SD) 9.90 (5.13), 95% CI 6.23 to 13.57, P = 0.005. The contamination score was increased after simulated cough occurrence (mean (SD) 18.0 (5.09) versus 5.50 (2.10) in those without cough; P<0.001), and when first attempt laryngoscopy failed (mean (SD) of 17.1 (6.41) versus 11.6 (6.20) P = 0.038). The incidence of bag-mask ventilation was higher in the late intubation group (80% versus 30%; P=0.035). There was no significant difference in intubation time, incidence of failed first attempt laryngoscopy or heart rate variability between the two groups. Late intubation in patients with COVID-19 may be associated with greater laryngoscopist contamination and potential aerosol-generating events compared with early intubation. There was no difference in performance measured by intubation time and incidence of first attempt success. Late intubation, especially when resources are limited, may be a valid approach. However, strict infection control and appropriate personal protective equipment usage is recommended in such cases.","Lee, Christopher P; Yip, Yu-Yeung; Chan, Albert Km; Ko, Chun P; Joynt, Gavin M",Anaesth Intensive Care,524,13

In particular when the inputs are independent, Sobol' sensitivity indices attribute a portion of the output of interest variance to each input and all possible interactions in the model, thanks to a functional ANOVA decomposition. On the other hand, moment-independent sensitivity indices focus on the impact of input variables on the whole output distribution instead of the variance only, thus providing complementary insight on the inputs / output relationship. Unfortunately they do not enjoy the nice decomposition property of Sobol' indices and are consequently harder to analyze. In this paper, we introduce two moment-independent indices based on kernel-embeddings of probability distributions and show that the RKHS framework used for their definition makes it possible to exhibit a kernel-based ANOVA decomposition. This is the first time such a desirable property is proved for sensitivity indices apart from Sobol' ones. When the inputs are dependent, we also use these new sensitivity indices as building blocks to design kernel-embedding Shapley effects which generalize the traditional variance-based ones used in sensitivity analysis. Several estimation procedures are discussed and illustrated on test cases with various output types such as categorical variables and probability distributions. All these examples show their potential for enhancing traditional sensitivity analysis with a kernel point of view.","Veiga, S'ebastien da",,524,20

METHODS: Formulations of TXA alone and with different concentrations of HA were freeze-dried and characterised according to their physicochemical properties. Aerosol performance was assessed to ensure nasal deposition with minimal lung deposition. Nasal epithelial cells were used to assess cytotoxicity, transport across the nasal epithelium, antioxidant, wound-healing and anti-inflammatory properties of all formulations. RESULTS: Formulations containing TXA and HA were produced and found to be mostly deposited in the nasal cavity (more than 90%). Formulation of TXA + 0.3%HA showed wound reduction of 29.3% when assessed in ALI culture. At this concentration, formulations also reduced ROS production in RPMI 2650, and IL-8 production in primary nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, for formulations containing HA, the higher viscosity may lead to larger residence time in the nasal cavity.

The policy analysis specially stated that although the MSW recycling ratio (30%) is not particularly poor, the recovered percentage of plastics, glass and food waste in Hong Kong are extremely low. Based on the unfavourable outcomes and consequences for MSWM and governance in Hong Kong, a conclusion of negative correlation between the per capita MSW disposal rate and bureaucratic policy culture development, as well as positive correlation between recycling rate of low value items and economic policy culture development, can be made. With considering the key factors of benchmark indicators, socio-economic factors, driving force, and communication of MSW policy, conducive options and prospects are also developed for the attempt to provide insights to restructure MSWM and governance in Hong Kong in the next decade. First, the government can build up strategic innovation from a global benchmark case - MSWM and governance improvement from the South Korea case.

However, the overuse of antibiotics in animal feed has caused serious environmental and health risks, especially the wide spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which seriously affects animal and human health, food safety, ecosystems, and the sustainable future development of animal protein production. Unfortunately, AMR has already become a worldwide challenge, so international cooperation is becoming more important for combatting it. China’s efforts and determination to restrict antibiotic usage through law enforcement and effective management are of significance. In this review, we address the pollution problems of antibiotics;in particular, the AMR in water, soil, and plants caused by livestock and poultry manure in China. The negative impact of widespread and intensive use of antibiotics in livestock production is discussed. To reduce and mitigate AMR problems, we emphasize in this review the development of antibiotic substitutes for the era of antibiotic prohibition.","Tian, Ming He Xinmiao Feng Yanzhong Wang Wentao Chen Heshu Gong Ming Liu Di Jihong Liu Clarke André van Eerde",Antibiotics,524,16

Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features, despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness-based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial in Spain. Health care workers providing face-to-face health care to patients with COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (an app targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control app (general recommendations about mental health care) for 2 weeks. The participants were blinded to their group allocation. Data were collected telephonically at baseline and after 2 weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary outcome was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (overall score on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 [DASS-21]). Secondary outcomes were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and DASS-21 individual scale scores. Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). The outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of the treatment allocation. RESULTS: Between May 14 and July 25, 2020, 482 health care workers were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control app (n=234). At 2 weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436/482 participants (90.5%). No significant differences were observed between the groups at 2 weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference -0.04; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.04; P=.15) or in the other outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among health care workers consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (-0.29; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among health care workers receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (-0.25; 95% CI -0.49 to -0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. The mean usability score of PsyCovidApp was high (87.21/100, SD 12.65). After the trial, 208/221 participants in the intervention group (94.1%) asked to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: In health care workers assisting patients with COVID-19 in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control app, reduced mental health problems at 2 weeks only among health care workers receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA). We identified 38 studies containing data from 7848 individuals. Tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone. All methods yield high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods perform better in terms of sensitivity (90%-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 89%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. LFIA tests are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies but show lower sensitivity, and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","Kontou, Panagiota I.; Braliou, Georgia G.; Dimou, Niki L.; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bagos, Pantelis G.",Diagn.,524,18

In this study, we sought to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inpatient use within children's hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using the Pediatric Health Information System. We compared inpatient use and clinical outcomes for children 0 to 18 years of age during the COVID-19 period (March 15 to August 29, 2020) to the same time frame in the previous 3 years (pre-COVID-19 period). Adjusted generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the association of the pandemic period with inpatient use. We assessed trends overall and for a subgroup of 15 medical All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs). RESULTS: We identified 424 856 hospitalizations (mean: 141 619 hospitalizations per year) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 91 532 in the COVID-19 period. Compared with the median number of hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed declines in hospitalizations overall (35.1%), and by APR-DRG (range: 8.5%-81.3%) with asthma (81.3%), bronchiolitis (80.1%), and pneumonia (71.4%) experiencing the greatest declines. Overall readmission rates were lower during the COVID-19 period; however, other outcomes, including length of stay, cost, ICU use, and mortality remained similar to the pre-COVID-19 period with some variability by APR-DRGs. CONCLUSIONS: US children's hospitals observed substantial reductions in inpatient admissions with largely unchanged hospital-level outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the impact on use varied by condition, the most notable declines were related to inpatient admissions for respiratory conditions, including asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.","Markham, Jessica L; Richardson, Troy; DePorre, Adrienne; Teufel, Ronald J; Hersh, Adam L; Fleegler, Eric W; Antiel, Ryan M; Williams, Daniel C; Goldin, Adam B; Shah, Samir S",Pediatrics,524,29

Serological surveillance is critical to determine the overall extent of infection across populations and to inform the public health response. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of people who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 ('seroprevalence') in the general population of Scotland and to see if this changes over time. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Between International Organization for Standardization (ISO) week 17 (i.e. week commencing 20th April) and ISO week 25 (week commencing 15 June), 4751 residual blood samples were obtained from regional biochemistry laboratories in six participating regional health authority areas covering approximately 75% of the Scottish population. Samples were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Italy). Seroprevalence rates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assay using Bayesian methods. RESULTS: The combined adjusted seroprevalence across the study period was 4.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.2%-4.5%). The proportion varied each week between 1.9% and 6.8% with no difference in antibody positivity by age, sex or geographical area. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Control of COVID-19 requires the ability to detect asymptomatic and mild infections that would otherwise remain undetected through existing surveillance systems. This is important to determine the true number of infections within the general population which, in turn, can help to understand transmission, inform control measures and provide a denominator for the estimation of severity measures such as the proportion of infected people who have been hospitalised and/or have died.","Dickson, E; Palmateer, N E; Murray, J; Robertson, C; Waugh, C; Wallace, L A; Mathie, L; Heatlie, K; Mavin, S; Gousias, P; Von Wissman, B; Goldberg, D J; McAuley, A",Public Health,524,23

BACKGROUND: Supporting physically and emotionally exhausted nurses, whilst ensuring quality standards of care delivery in the recovery phase of COVID-19, requires careful, considerate and proactive planning. EVALUATION: Drawing on literature and utilizing Lawton and Paez Gabriunas' (2015) integrated ethical leadership framework (purpose, practices, virtues), possible practical suggestions for the operationalization of ethical leadership are proposed. DISCUSSION: Nurse managers must maintain ethical vigilance in order to nurture value-driven behaviour, demonstrating empathy and compassion for nurses experiencing physical and emotional exhaustion because of COVID-19. It is important that open dialogue, active listening and self-care interventions exist. Nurse managers have an essential role in inspiring and empowering nurses, and building morale and a collective commitment to safe and quality care. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers need to consider ways of empowering, supporting and enabling nurses to apply ethical standards in everyday practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Fostering ethical nurse leadership requires careful and sensitive planning, as well as charismatic, compassionate and inspirational leaders. Supporting staff through respect, empathy, role modelling and genuine conscientiousness is essential for increasing job performance and sustaining an ethical work environment.","Markey, Kathleen; Ventura, Carla Aparecida Arena; Donnell, Claire O039; Doody, Owen",J. nurs. manag,524,26

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A veneer and a crown preparation were performed on a central incisor and a second molar of a dental model, respectively, scanned with an intraoral scanner, and the .stl files were exported to an LCD-based SLA three-dimensional (3D)-Printer. Twenty-four preparations were 3D-printed for each veneer and crown and divided into four groups (n = 6/group): (a) Acrylic resin (Acrílico Marche); (b) Bisacrylic resin (Protemp 4); (c) PMMA computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) (Vipiblock); and (d) 3D-printed resin for provisional restorations (Raydent C&B for temporary crown and bridge). Veneers and crowns restorations were performed and cemented with a flowable composite. Each specimen was scanned with a µCT apparatus, files were imported for data analysis, and cement film thickness was quantitatively measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (&#945; = .05). RESULTS: Crowns presented a thicker cementation film than veneers (P < .05).The bisacrylic resin showed the smallest veneer film thickness, similar to the acrylic resin (P = .151), which was not significantly different than the PMMA CAD/CAM material (P = .153). The 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker film, different than all other materials (P < .05). The bisacrylic resin showed a cement film thickness with a high number of voids in its surface. For crowns cementation, the 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker cementation film, different than all other materials (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Different provisional materials present different film thicknesses. The 3D printed provisional material showed the highest veneer and crown film thicknesses. Veneers film thicknesses were smaller than crowns for all provisional materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The 3D printed provisional material studied can be satisfactorily used, presenting appropriate adaptation with the tooth preparation, however, it shows the highest cement film thickness for both veneers and crowns cementations when compared with other provisional materials. A better internal fit, or smaller cement film thickness is obtained by CAD/CAM materials, acrylic and bisacrylic resins. Veneer cementation showed a smaller cement film thickness compared with crown cementation for all provisional materials.","Sampaio, Camila S; Niemann, Katherin D; Schweitzer, Daniel D; Hirata, Ronaldo; Atria, Pablo J",,524,5

In the setting of virtual interviews for residency in 2020, the online availability of program information is of heightened importance. We sought to assess how academic versus community-based general surgery residency programs compared with respect to certain details on their websites. METHODS: A total of nâ¯=â¯268 surgery residency programs were investigated. Our database of website characteristics included: direct link to residency website from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program page, resident research requirement, listing of residents' publications, availability of residents' demographic information, program alumni information, board pass rates, attrition rate, detail of educational/academic activities, residents' evaluation methods, diversity, and mentorship. Inter-group analyses between academic and community-based programs were performed using Pearson's Chi-squared test. RESULTS: Academic and community-based general surgery residency program websites were compared based on twelve (12) different parameters. Statistically significant differences were observed for eight of these comparisons: direct website access from ACGME (pâ¯=â¯0.007), research highlighted (p < 0.001), resident research requirement (pâ¯=â¯0.002), resident demographic information available (p=0.004), alumni information (pâ¯=â¯0.005), resident evaluation methods (pâ¯=â¯0.016), diversity (p < 0.001), and mentorship (pâ¯=â¯0.012). Across these domains, academic programs had more information available on their websites than the community programs did. The program websites did not differ significantly based on the frequency of mentioning resident publications, board pass rate, attrition rate, or resident education. CONCLUSION: Many general surgery programs are lacking detailed information on their websites. The amount of website information available on general surgery residency programs differs when comparing academic and community-based programs.","Chinedozi, Ifeanyi; Martin, Olivia; Hays, Nicole; Kubicki, Natalia S; Kidd-Romero, Sarah; Kavic, Stephen M",J. surg. educ,524,20

The feasibility and safety of surfactant delivery in COVID-19 ARDS patients have not been established. METHODS: We performed retrospective analyses of data from patients receiving off-label use of exogenous natural surfactant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven COVID-19 PCR positive ARDS patients received liquid Curosurf (720 mg) in 150 ml normal saline, divided into five 30 ml aliquots) and delivered via a bronchoscope into second-generation bronchi. Patients were matched with 14 comparable subjects receiving supportive care for ARDS during the same time period. Feasibility and safety were examined as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: Patients showed no evidence of acute decompensation following surfactant installation into minor bronchi. Cox regression showed a reduction of 28-days mortality within the surfactant group, though not significant. The surfactant did not increase the duration of ventilation, and health care providers did not convert to COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactant delivery through bronchoscopy at a dose of 720 mg in 150 ml normal saline is feasible and safe for COVID-19 ARDS patients and health care providers during the pandemic. Surfactant administration did not cause acute decompensation, may reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation duration in COVID-19 ARDS patients. This study supports the future performance of randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of meticulous sub-bronchial lavage with surfactant as treatment for patients with COVID-19 ARDS.","Piva, Simone; DiBlasi, Robert M; Slee, April E; Jobe, Alan H; Roccaro, Aldo M; Filippini, Matteo; Latronico, Nicola; Bertoni, Michele; Marshall, John C; Portman, Michael A",Respir Res,524,1

Today, nurses and physicians are faced with unprecedented work pressures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospital nurses and physicians facing the COVID-19 patients. METHOD: A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA criteria. The PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, Web of science, CINHAL, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched with no lower time-limt and until 24 June 2020. The heterogeneity of the studies was measured using I2 test and the publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test at the significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The I2 test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I2 test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I2: 97.4% and I2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff.","Salari, Nader; Khazaie, Habibolah; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Ghasemi, Hooman; Mohammadi, Masoud; Shohaimi, Shamarina; Daneshkhah, Alireza; Khaledi-Paveh, Behnam; Hosseinian-Far, Melika",Global Health,524,20

Herein, a smart biocompatible nanocatalyst based on porous core-shell cuprous oxide nanocrystals (Cu2 O-PEG (polyethylene glycol) NCs) is reported for acid-triggered chemo/chemodynamic synergistic therapy. The in situ formed high density of hydrophilic PEG outside greatly improves the stability and compatibility of NCs. The porosity of Cu2 O-PEG NCs shows the admirable capacity of doxorubicin (DOX) loading (DOX@Cu2 O-PEG NCs) and delivery. Excitingly, Cu (Cu+/2+ ) and DOX can be controllably released from DOX@Cu2 O-PEG NCs in a pH-responsive approach. The released Cu+ exerts Fenton-like catalytic activity to generate toxic ·OH from intracellular overexpressed hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) for CDT via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-involved oxidative damage. Exactly, DOX can not only induce cell death for chemotherapy but also enhance CDT by self-supplying endogenous H2 O2 . After the intravenous injection, Cu2 O-PEG NCs can effectively accumulate in tumor region via passive targeting improved by external high-density PEG shell. Additionally, the effect of boosted CDT combined with chemotherapy presents excellent in vivo antitumor ability without causing distinct systemic toxicity. It is believed that this smart nanocatalyst responding to the acidity provides a novel paradigm for site-specific cancer synergetic therapy.","Wu, Hongshuai; Chen, Fanghui; You, Chaoqun; Zhang, Yu; Sun, Baiwang; Zhu, Qing",Small,524,16

We analyzed data from three telemedicine dispatch centers, one located in Genoa, serving private clients (pharmacies, general practitioners), one in Brescia, serving pharmacies, and one in Bari, serving regional public STEMI network and emergency medical service in Apulia (4 million inhabitants). Demographic data and principal electrocardiogram diagnosis were collected and analyzed. Records from the time interval March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020 were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. The comparative analysis of data shows a 54% reduction of telemedicine electrocardiogram transmission in Genoa telemedicine center (from 364 to 166), 68% in Brescia (from 5.745 to 1.905), 24% in Bari (from 15.825 to 11.716); relative reduction according to electrocardiogram diagnosis was 38% for acute coronary syndrome, 40% for other acute CVD in Genoa center, 24% for acute coronary syndrome, and 38% for other acute CVD in Bari. Male/female ratio remained substantially unchanged. A dramatic reduction of telemedicine access for CVD was observed during Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020 in Italy.

Experts assume that it is particularly affecting people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), especially those with washing compulsions. Data, however, are currently lacking. 394 participants with OCD (nâ¯=â¯223 washers) participated in an online survey. Change in severity of OCD symptoms, reasons participants reported for the change (e.g., reduced mobility, reduced availability of cleaning products, economic factors, interpersonal conflicts), as well as participants' beliefs and experience associated with COVID-19 were assessed. 72 % of the participants reported an increase in OCD. This increase was significantly stronger in washers compared to non-washers. The worsening of symptoms was primarily associated with reduced mobility and interpersonal conflicts. Dysfunctional hygiene-related beliefs were significantly higher in washers than non-washers and were associated with greater symptom progression. Washers were more confident than non-washers about providing other people with helpful advice related to infection preventions. Washers, however, received more negative feedback from others in response to the advice they provided than non-washers. The majority of participants with OCD were negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects were more pronounced in washers than in non-washers. Rapid interventions for OCD should be implemented to prevent long-term deterioration.","Jelinek, Lena; Moritz, Steffen; Miegel, Franziska; Voderholzer, Ulrich",J Anxiety Disord,524,16

Such predictions are often pursued by numerically simulating epidemics with a large number of plausible combinations of relevant parameters. It is essential that any forecast of the epidemic trajectory derived from the resulting ensemble of simulated curves is presented with confidence intervals that communicate the uncertainty associated with the forecast. Here we argue that the state-of-the-art approach for summarizing ensemble statistics does not capture crucial epidemiological information. In particular, the current approach systematically suppresses information about the projected trajectory peaks. The fundamental problem is that each time step is treated separately in the statistical analysis. We suggest using curve-based descriptive statistics to summarize trajectory ensembles. The results presented allow researchers to report more representative confidence intervals, resulting in more realistic projections of epidemic trajectories and -- in turn -- enable better decision making in the face of the current and future pandemics.","Juul, Jonas L.; Graesboll, Kaare; Christiansen, Lasse Engbo; Lehmann, Sune",,524,1

Whereas zinc might affect SARS-COV-2 replication and cell entry, the link between zinc deficiency and COVID-19 severity could also be attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on the body metabolism and immune response. Zinc deficiency is more prevalent in the elderly and patients with underlying chronic diseases, with established deleterious consequences such as the increased risk of respiratory infection. We reviewed the expected effects of zinc deficiency on COVID-19-related pathophysiological mechanisms focusing on both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems. Mechanisms and effects were extrapolated from the available scientific literature. Zinc deficiency alters angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) function, leading to the accumulation of angiotensin II, des-Arg9-bradykinin and Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin, which results in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, vasoconstriction and pro-thrombotic effects. Additionally, zinc deficiency blocks the activation of the plasma contact system, a protease cascade initiated by factor VII activation. Suggested mechanisms include the inhibition of Factor XII activation and limitation of high-molecular-weight kininogen, prekallikrein and Factor XII to bind to endothelial cells. The subsequent accumulation of Factor XII and deficiency in bradykinin are responsible for increased production of inflammatory mediators and marked hypercoagulability, as typically observed in COVID-19 patients. To conclude, zinc deficiency may affect both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems, leading to the exaggerated inflammatory manifestations characteristic of severe COVID-19.","Gouda, Ahmed S; Adbelruhman, Fatima G; Elbendary, Reham N; Ahmed Alharbi, Fadiyah; Qalit Alhamrani, Sultan; Mégarbane, Bruno",,524,31

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.","Hu, Shaoping; Gao, Yuan; Niu, Zhangming; Jiang, Yinghui; Li, Lao; Xiao, Xianglu; Wang, Minhao; Fang, Evandro Fei; Menpes-Smith, Wade; Xia, Jun; Ye, Hui; Yang, Guang",IEEE Access,524,1

However, no studies have been conducted to investigate its anticancer potential, particularly its extracted oil. PURPOSE: The present study was put forth to appraise the anticancer potential of Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana extracted oil against liver (hcclm3 and hepg2) and breast cancer (mda-mb 231 and mcf-7) cell lines relative to normal cell lines (lo2 and mcf-10a) via MTT assay. METHODS: Flow cytometry indicated the apoptotic effect whereas invasion and migration capabilities of oil against cancer cells were determined by Matrigel invasion chamber and wound-scratch assays. RESULTS: The results of oil revealed a time and dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation inhibition, conferring to least IC50 shown against hcclm3 (144.9 ± 0.75 µg/ml) and mda-mb 231 (145.7 ± 0.32 µg/ml) cell line at 72 h, whereas no cytotoxic effect on normal cells was observed. In addition, the oil significantly (p < 0.001) suppressed the migration and invasion of hcclm3 and mda-mb 231 cells, showing noteworthy anti-metastatic potential. Furthermore, cell death was confirmed by AnnexinâV/PI staining where the maximum apoptotic percentage was calculated for oil (200 µg/ml) alongside mda-mb 231 conferring to 15.36 ± 1.22, 26.7 ± 1.2, and 36.43 ± 1.65 at 24, 48, and 72 h whereas 12.33 ± 1.05, 19.36 ± 1.62, and 29.3 ± 0.79 was recorded alongside hcclm3 at similar time intervals, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the extracted oil exhibited strong anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and apoptotic effects and therefore may have potential applications in cancer treatment, however, further studies of oil regarding the action mechanisms and compounds involved in anticancer therapy are necessary.","Ali, Saima; Khan, Muhammad Rashid; Khan, Asghar; Khan, Raees",Phytomedicine,524,10

Second, we document self-reported negative and positive consequences of the crisis on well-being. We find that young people have experienced more drastic changes to their life and have been most affected economically and psychologically. There is less of a systematic pattern across income groups. While lower income groups have been more affected economically, higher income groups have experienced more changes in their social life and spending. A large fraction of people of low and high income groups report negative effects on well-being.","Belot, Michèle; Choi, Syngjoo; Tripodi, Egon; Broek-Altenburg, Eline van den; Jamison, Julian C; Papageorge, Nicholas W",Rev Econ Househ,524,24

Although not powered to detect a change in mortality, marked improvements were seen in survival (adjusted HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.59; p<0.001). Beta blockers are one of the most studied groups of drugs but their effect in septic shock is poorly understood; proposed mechanisms include not only the modulation of cardiac function but also immunomodulation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: STRESS-L is a randomised, open-label, non-blinded clinical trial which is enrolling a total of 340 patients with septic shock as defined by Sepsis-3 consensus definition and a tachycardia (heart rate &#8805;95 beats per minute (bpm)) after vasopressor treatment of at least 24 hours. Standard randomisation (1:1 ratio) allocates patients to receive usual care (according to international standards) versus usual care and a continuous landiolol infusion to reduce the heart rate between 80 and 94 bpm. The primary endpoint is the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score over 14 days from entry into the trial and while in intensive care unit. Results will inform current clinical practice guidelines.

Thus, this sudden health incident has brought great risk and pressure to the city with dense population flow. A deep understanding of the migration characteristics and laws of the urban population in China will play a very positive role in the prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Based on Baidu location-based service (LBS) big data, using complex networks method and geographic visualization tools, this paper explores the spatial structure evolution of population flow network (PFN) in 368 cities of China under different traffic control situations. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze how the population flow across cities affects the spread of the epidemic. Our findings show that: (1) the scope of population flow is closely related to the administrative level of the city and the traffic control policies in various cities which adjust with the epidemic situation; The PFN mainly presents the hierarchical structure dominated by the urban hierarchy and the regional isolation structure adjacent to the geographical location.(2) through the analysis network topology structure of PFN, it is found that only the first stage has a large clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length, which conforms to the characteristics of small world network. The epidemic situation has a great impact on the network topology in other stages, and the network structure tends to be centralized. (3) The overall migration scale of the whole country decreased by 36.85% compared with the same period of last year's lunar calendar, and a further reduction of 78.52% in the nationwide traffic control stage after the festival. (4) Finally, based on the comparison of the effective distance and the spatial distance from the Wuhan to other destination cities, it is demonstrated that there is a higher correlation between the effective distance and the epidemic spread both in Hubei province and the whole country.","Jiang, Xiaorong; Wei, Wei; Wang, Shenglan; Zhang, Tao; Lu, Chengpeng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),524,27

Understanding how health misinformation is transmitted is an urgent goal for researchers, social media platforms, health sectors, and policymakers to mitigate those ramifications. Deep learning methods have been deployed to predict the spread of misinformation. While achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance, deep learning methods lack the interpretability due to their blackbox nature. To remedy this gap, this study proposes a novel interpretable deep learning approach, Generative Adversarial Network based Piecewise Wide and Attention Deep Learning (GAN-PiWAD), to predict health misinformation transmission in social media. Improving upon state-of-the-art interpretable methods, GAN-PiWAD captures the interactions among multi-modal data, offers unbiased estimation of the total effect of each feature, and models the dynamic total effect of each feature when its value varies. We select features according to social exchange theory and evaluate GAN-PiWAD on 4,445 misinformation videos. The proposed approach outperformed strong benchmarks. Interpretation of GAN-PiWAD indicates video description, negative video content, and channel credibility are key features that drive viral transmission of misinformation. This study contributes to IS with a novel interpretable deep learning method that is generalizable to understand other human decision factors. Our findings provide direct implications for social media platforms and policymakers to design proactive interventions to identify misinformation, control transmissions, and manage infodemics.","Xie, Jiaheng; Chai, Yidong; Liu, Xiao",,524,29

Machine learning and deep learning techniques combined with radiology imaging can be helpful for accurate detection of the disease. A deep learning approach based on the multilayer-Spatial Convolutional Neural Network for automatic detection of Covid-19 using chest X-ray images and CT scans is proposed in this paper. The proposed model, named as the Multilayer Spatial Covid Convolutional Neural Network (MSCovCNN), provides an automated accurate diagnostics for Covid-19 detection. The proposed model showed 93.63% detection accuracy and 97.88% AUC (Area Under Curve) for chest x-ray images and 91.44% detection accuracy and 95.92% AUC for chest CT scans, respectively. We have used 5-tiered 2D-CNN frameworks followed by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and softmax classifier. In the CNN each convolution layer is followed by an activation function and a Maxpooling layer. The proposed model can be used to assist the radiologists in detecting the Covid-19 and confirming their initial screening.","Khattak, M.

ACE2 has recently been proposed to be interferon (IFN) inducible, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit this phenomenon to enhance viral spread and questioning the efficacy of IFN treatment in coronavirus disease 2019. Using a recent de novo transcript assembly that captured previously unannotated transcripts, we describe a new isoform of ACE2, generated by co-option of intronic retroelements as promoter and alternative exon. The new transcript, termed MIRb-ACE2, exhibits specific expression patterns across the aerodigestive and gastrointestinal tracts and is highly responsive to IFN stimulation. In contrast, canonical ACE2 expression is unresponsive to IFN stimulation. Moreover, the MIRb-ACE2 translation product is a truncated, unstable ACE2 form, lacking domains required for SARS-CoV-2 binding and is therefore unlikely to contribute to or enhance viral infection.","Ng, Kevin W; Attig, Jan; Bolland, William; Young, George R; Major, Jack; Wrobel, Antoni G; Gamblin, Steve; Wack, Andreas; Kassiotis, George",Nat Genet,524,17

[German],19.545654,9.067145,2020,"The last few decades of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy have seen phenomenal growth. In many aspects, GI endoscopy has led the field of nonsurgical interventional medicine. In many aspects, this growth is facilitated by advancements in sedation-both drugs and techniques. Unfortunately, the topic of GI endoscopy sedation is also mired in many controversies, mainly emanating from the cost of anesthesia providers. While no one debates their role in the majority of advanced endoscopic procedures, the practice of universal propofol sedation in the USA, delivered by anesthesia providers, needs a closer look. In this review, medical, political, and economic considerations of this important topic are discussed in a very frank and honest way. While such ubiquitous propofol use has increased satisfaction of both patients and gastroenterologists, there is little justification. More importantly, going by the evidence, there is even less justification for the mandated anesthesia providers use for such delivery. Unfortunately, the FDA could not be convinced otherwise. The new drug fospropofol met the same fate. Approval of SEDASYS®, the first computer-assisted personalized sedation system, was a step in the right direction, nevertheless an insufficient step that failed to takeoff. As a result, in spite of years of research and efforts of many august societies, the logjam of balancing cost and justification of propofol sedation has continued. We hope that recent approval of remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine, and potential approval of oliceridine, a novel short-acting opioid, might be able to contain the cost without compromising the quality of sedation.","Goudra, Basavana; Singh, Preet Mohinder; Lichtenstein, Gary R",Dig Dis Sci,524,32

Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare characteristics of patients who required hospitalization versus those who did not. RESULTS: Of 41 patients, 22 (54%) had confirmed coronavirus disease 2019, and 19 (46%) were suspected cases. Patients most commonly reported fever (80%), cough (56%), and dyspnea (39%). At the end of follow-up, 13 patients (32%) required hospitalization a median of 8 days (range, 1-16) after symptom onset, and 23 (56%) had outpatient symptom resolution a median of 12 days (4-23) after onset. Patients who required hospitalization were more likely to have reported dyspnea (77% versus 21%, P=0.003) and had higher baseline creatinine (median, 2.0 versus 1.3 mg/dl, P=0.02), but there were no other differences between groups.

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

The emergence of these more contagious, more severe, or even vaccine-resistant strains have challenged worldwide policy interventions. Anticipating the emergence of these mutations to plan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors may affect the evolution of viruses by coevolution, are key challenges. In this article, we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credible approach to model this relationship, highlighting its implications, potential and challenges. We present a dual GA model in which both viruses aiming for survival and policy measures aiming at minimising infection rates in the population, competitively evolve. Simulation runs reproduce the emergence of more contagious variants, and identifies the evolution of policy responses as a determinant cause of this phenomenon. This coevolution opens new possibilities to visualise the impact of governments interventions not only on outbreak dynamics, but also on its evolution, to improve the efficacy of policies.","Vie, Aymeric",,524,24

The conference was attended by 71% (37/52) of the original international faculties and 71% (27/38) of the overall faculties. In total, 61 out of 66 presentations (92%) were delivered. A special session-""Dialysis access management under the impact of viral epidemics""-was added to replace precongress workshops and competitions. The conference received 1810, 1452, and 1008 visits on YouTube and 6777, 4623, and 3100 visits on WeChat on conference days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from a conventional on-site conference to a completely web-based format within a short period is a feasible method for maintaining professional education in a socially responsible manner during a pandemic.","Ko, Po-Jen; Yu, Sheng-Yueh; Chang, John Chien-Hwa; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Chu, Sung-Yu; Tan, Jimmy Wei-Hwa; Cheng, Wan-Ling; Ho, Pei",JMIR Med Educ,524,10

This study aimed to provide early estimates of how stress and demographics will interact with shifts in harmful alcohol consumption from before the COVID-19 outbreak to 2 months into social distancing. Design Cross-sectional convenience sample. Setting Australia. Participants A total of 1684 Australians aged 18-65 years who drink at least monthly. Measurements Items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). Findings Overall, harmful drinking decreased during social distancing measures in our sample [2019 score = 8.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 7.9-8.4;during the pandemic = 7.3, 95% CI = 7.1-7.6]. Younger drinkers, particularly young women, decreased their consumption the most, but there was a small increase in consumption in middle-aged women. Drinkers experiencing high levels of stress also reported a relatively higher shift in harmful consumption compared with those with low levels of stress (beta = 0.65, P = 0.003), despite reporting a small decrease overall. Conclusions The closure of licensed premises and social distancing measures in Australia in response to the COVID-19 outbreak appear to have reduced harmful alcohol consumption in younger drinkers, particularly young women.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of criticism about how the Indonesian government implemented its crisis communication strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic season. This study aims to uncover the government's crisis communication strategy from the perspective of Van Dijk's critical discourse analysis. Based on the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT), researchers study the structure of discourse in texts consisting of macro, superstructure, and micro. There were 6 press releases from President Jokowi, Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto, and Spokesperson dr. Achmad Yurianto was collected using a purposive sampling method to describe the government's crisis communication strategy at the beginning of pre-crisis and crisis. The results show a significant dynamic crisis communication strategy on how the government implemented it in the pre-crisis and crisis phases. In the pre-crisis phase, they were statements from public officials especially in this case coming from President Jokowi and Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto. Both of these statements tend to lead to Deny and Diminish's strategy while still delivering messages in the form of Adjustments and Instructive Information so that the public remains alert and calm. However, in the crisis phase, government communication shifted towards Diminishes' statement, in the view of Justification that the crisis was actually not so terrible and bad. This is the biggest idea that emerged in the statement of President Jokowi and Spokesperson dr. Achmad Yurianto. Broadly speaking, this phase also provides a greater perspective on projections of government policy in the COVID-19 arrangement.","Surahmat, Anton; Dida, Susanne; Zubair, Feliza; id,",Jurnal Komunikasi,524,1

The model is sufficiently rich to incorporate specific characteristics of the novel coronavirus, to capture the impact of undetected, asymptomatic and super-diffusive individuals, and especially to take into account time-varying counter-measures and detection efforts. Yet, it is simple enough to allow scalable and efficient computation of the temporal evolution of the epidemic, and exploration of what-if scenarios. Compared to traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g., mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding light into several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing performed by the national health service.","Garetto, Michele; Leonardi, Emilio; Torrisi, Giovanni Luca",,524,24

The colony assay can identify positive clones without almost any false-positives; however, its antibody library is smaller than those used in other recombinant screening methods such as phage display. Thus, to improve the efficiency of colony assays, it is necessary to increase library size per screening. Here, we report developing a colony assay with single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to the N-terminus of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (scFv-PhoA). The scFv-PhoA library was constructed in an expression vector specifically designed for this study. Use of this library allowed the successful and direct detection of positive clones exhibiting PhoA activity, without the need for a secondary antibody. Colony assay screening with scFv-PhoA is simple, rapid, offers a higher success rate than previous methods based on scFv libraries, and-most importantly-it enables high-throughput procedures.","Hanyu, Yoshiro; Kato, Mieko",Molecules (Basel),524,1

Objective: To describe international hospitalization trends and key epidemiological and clinical features of children and youth with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients hospitalized between February 2 and October 10, 2020. Patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data were collected across 27 hospitals in France, Germany, Spain, Singapore, the UK, and the US. Patients younger than 21 years who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized at an institution participating in the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient characteristics, clinical features, and medication use. Results: There were 347 males (52%; 95% CI, 48.5-55.3) and 324 females (48%; 95% CI, 44.4-51.3) in this study's cohort. There was a bimodal age distribution, with the greatest proportion of patients in the 0- to 2-year (199 patients [30%]) and 12- to 17-year (170 patients [25%]) age range. Trends in hospitalizations for 671 children and youth found discrete surges with variable timing across 6 countries. Data from this cohort mirrored national-level pediatric hospitalization trends for most countries with available data, with peaks in hospitalizations during the initial spring surge occurring within 23 days in the national-level and 4CE data. A total of 27â¯364 laboratory values for 16 laboratory tests were analyzed, with mean values indicating elevations in markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, 83 mg/L; 95% CI, 53-112 mg/L; ferritin, 417 ng/mL; 95% CI, 228-607 ng/mL; and procalcitonin, 1.45 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.13-2.77 ng/mL). Abnormalities in coagulation were also evident (D-dimer, 0.78 ug/mL; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21 ug/mL; and fibrinogen, 477 mg/dL; 95% CI, 385-569 mg/dL). Cardiac troponin, when checked (n = 59), was elevated (0.032 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.000-0.080 ng/mL). Common complications included cardiac arrhythmias (15.0%; 95% CI, 8.1%-21.7%), viral pneumonia (13.3%; 95% CI, 6.5%-20.1%), and respiratory failure (10.5%; 95% CI, 5.8%-15.3%). Few children were treated with COVID-19-directed medications. Conclusions and Relevance: This study of EHRs of children and youth hospitalized for COVID-19 in 6 countries demonstrated variability in hospitalization trends across countries and identified common complications and laboratory abnormalities in children and youth with COVID-19 infection. Large-scale informatics-based approaches to integrate and analyze data across health care systems complement methods of disease surveillance and advance understanding of epidemiological and clinical features associated with COVID-19 in children and youth.","Bourgeois, Florence T; Gutiérrez-Sacristán, Alba; Keller, Mark S; Liu, Molei; Hong, Chuan; Bonzel, Clara-Lea; Tan, Amelia L M; Aronow, Bruce J; Boeker, Martin; Booth, John; Cruz Rojo, Jaime; Devkota, Batsal; García Barrio, Noelia; Gehlenborg, Nils; Geva, Alon; Hanauer, David A; Hutch, Meghan R; Issitt, Richard W; Klann, Jeffrey G; Luo, Yuan; Mandl, Kenneth D; Mao, Chengsheng; Moal, Bertrand; Moshal, Karyn L; Murphy, Shawn N; Neuraz, Antoine; Ngiam, Kee Yuan; Omenn, Gilbert S; Patel, Lav P; Jiménez, Miguel Pedrera; Sebire, Neil J; Balazote, Pablo Serrano; Serret-Larmande, Arnaud; South, Andrew M; Spiridou, Anastasia; Taylor, Deanne M; Tippmann, Patric; Visweswaran, Shyam; Weber, Griffin M; Kohane, Isaac S; Cai, Tianxi; Avillach, Paul",JAMA Netw Open,524,17

Russelioside B is a steroidal glycoside isolated from several Caralluma species. No study tested the ulcer healing potential of the compound. The current study aimed to assess the protective effect of russelioside B against ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats. Ulcer was induced on rats by a single intragastric dose of absolute ethanol (5 mL/kg). Rats were randomly assorted into four groups (n = 8) and given treatments (Antodine, 20 mg/kg or russelioside B, 50 mg/kg) by oral gavage 1 h before ulcer induction. Pretreatment with russelioside B (50 mg/kg) attenuated the gastric mucosal injury as proved by a decrease of ulcer index, and histological scores. It suppressed the gastric inflammation by a significant lowering the tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-6 levels with myeloperoxidase activity (which are also aggravating factors in the case of Covid-19 infection). In addition, administration of russelioside B halted the gastric oxidative stress via inhibition of lipid peroxides by maintaining reduced glutathione and by decreasing malondialdehyde. It was able also to restore the sharp drop in the levels of heat shock protein-70, vascular endothelial growth factor and prostaglandin E2 induced by ethanol. Additionally, it showed carbonic anhydrase inhibition activity. The gastroprotective action of russelioside B was umpired through multi mechanistic actions; suppression of gastric oxidative stress, inflammation, anti-apoptotic activities and enhanced gastric mucosal protection by up-regulation of endothelial growth factor, normalization of heat shock protein-70 and prostaglandin E2. These actions were comparable in part to some classical antiulcer drugs such as Antodine.","El-Shiekh, Riham A; Salama, Abeer; Al-Mokaddem, Asmaa K; Bader, Ammar; Abdel-Sattar, Essam A",Steroids,524,1

The outbreak is of major concern as the Delta variant is estimated to have twice the reproductive number to previous variants that circulated in Australia in 2020, which is worsened by low levels of acquired immunity in the population. Using a re-calibrated agent-based model, we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, in terms of both mitigation (case isolation, home quarantine) and suppression (school closures, social distancing). Our nowcasting modelling indicated that the level of social distancing currently attained in Sydney is inadequate for the outbreak control. A counter-factual analysis suggested that if 80% of agents comply with social distancing, then at least a month is needed for the new daily cases to reduce from their peak to below ten. A small reduction in social distancing compliance to 70% lengthens this period to 45 days.","Chang, Sheryl L.; Cliff, Oliver M.; Zachreson, Cameron; Prokopenko, Mikhail",,524,10

For this reason, it has recently been proposed that the spread of information, opinion or disease should be modelled over a hypergraph rather than a standard graph. The use of hyperedges naturally allows for a nonlinear rate of transmission, in terms of both the group size and the number of infected group members, as is the case, for example, when social distancing is encouraged. We consider a general class of individual-level, stochastic, susceptible-infected-susceptible models on a hypergraph, and focus on a mean field approximation proposed in [Arruda et al., Phys. Rev. Res., 2020]. We derive spectral conditions under which the mean field model predicts local or global stability of the infection-free state. We also compare these results with (a) a new condition that we derive for decay to zero in mean for the exact process, (b) conditions for a different mean field approximation in [Higham and de Kergorlay, Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 2021], and (c) numerical simulations of the microscale model.","Higham, Desmond J.; Kergorlay, Henry-Louis de",,524,26

Non-homogeneities in the basic parameters are easily included by integration for arbitrary distributions of incubation and removal times, recovering the classical SEIR model under the assumption of exponential distributions. We compare the solution to these equations, uSEIR, to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases with the uSEIR solution. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the uSEIR equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations.

While diabetes is known to aggravate COVID-19 severity, it is not known whether nondiabetic patients with metabolic dysfunction are also more prone to more severe disease. The association of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with COVID-19 severity in nondiabetic patients was investigated here. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 65 patients with (i.e. cases) and 65 patients without MAFLD (i.e. controls). Each case was randomly matched with one control by sex (1:1) and age (±5 years). The association between the presence of MAFLD (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: In nondiabetic patients with COVID-19, the presence of MAFLD was associated with a four-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19; the risk increased with increasing numbers of metabolic risk factors. The association with COVID-19 severity persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and coexisting morbid conditions. CONCLUSION: Health-care professionals caring for nondiabetic patients with COVID-19 should be cognizant of the increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 in patients with MAFLD.","Gao, Feng; Zheng, Kenneth I; Wang, Xiao-Bo; Yan, Hua-Dong; Sun, Qing-Feng; Pan, Ke-Hua; Wang, Ting-Yao; Chen, Yong-Ping; George, Jacob; Zheng, Ming-Hua",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,524,26

This article explores the potential value of using triage tests before reference tests when the capacity of the reference test is constrained. METHODS: We developed a simple model with inputs: prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and reference test capacity. We included a case study of rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 antigens used as triage tests before a reference polymerase chain reaction test. Performance data were obtained from an evaluation performed by an academic center on 425 samples from testing centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. RESULTS: When reference test capacity is constrained, the use of a triage test leads to a relative expansion of the population tested and cases identified; both are higher with a high-specificity triage test. When reference test capacity is not constrained, the potential advantages of introducing a triage test can be assessed using a standard cost-utility framework, balancing the utility of the reduction in the number of reference tests required against the disutility of missed cases associated with the use of a lower-sensitivity triage test. In the constrained case, the advantage of a triage testing strategy in terms of population covered and cases identified is reduced as the prevalence increases. In the unconstrained case, the reduction in reference tests required is reduced and the number of cases missed increase as the prevalence rises. CONCLUSION: When the availability of the reference test is constrained, tests added in a triage position do not need high levels of accuracy to increase the number of cases diagnosed. This has implications in many disease areas, including COVID-19.","Bouttell, Janet; Hawkins, Neil",Med Decis Making,524,14

A striking recent example is the Covid-19 pandemic which has created severe disruptions to economic output in most countries. These direct shocks to supply and demand will propagate downstream and upstream through production networks. Given the exogenous shocks, we derive a lower bound on total shock propagation. We find that even in this best case scenario network effects substantially amplify the initial shocks. To obtain more realistic model predictions, we study the propagation of shocks bottom-up by imposing different rationing rules on industries if they are not able to satisfy incoming demand. Our results show that economic impacts depend strongly on the emergence of input bottlenecks, making the rationing assumption a key variable in predicting adverse economic impacts. We further establish that the magnitude of initial shocks and network density heavily influence model predictions.","Pichler, Anton; Farmer, J. Doyne",,524,20

METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant publications, using the terms COVID-19 aerosolisation, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 transmission, COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and endoscopy, Endoscopy for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 3745 articles were identified, 26 of which were selected to answer the question of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. All studies suggested high infectivity from contact and droplet spread. No clinical study has yet reported the viral load in the aerosol and therefore the infective dose has not been accurately determined. However, aerosol-generating procedures are potentially risky and full personal protective equipment should be used. CONCLUSIONS: As it is a highly infectious disease, clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 require effective personal protective equipment. The main routes of infection are direct contact and droplets in the air and on surfaces. Aerosolisation carries a substantial risk of infection, so any aerosol-producing procedure, such as endoscopy, should be performed wearing personal protective equipment and with extra caution to protect the endoscopist, staff and patients from cross-infection via the respiratory system.","Hussain, Abdulzahra; Singhal, Tarun; El-Hasani, Shamsi",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),524,1

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the source(s) of COVID-19 information among people in Nigeria, as well as the predictors and the perceived accuracy of information from these sources. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of consenting adults residing in Nigeria between April and May 2020 during the lockdown and first wave of COVID-19. The major sources of information about COVID-19 were distilled from 7 potential sources (family and friends, places of worship, health care providers, internet, workplace, traditional media, and public posters/banners). An open-ended question was asked to explore how respondents determined accuracy of information. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 15.0 software (StataCorp Texas) with significance placed at P<.05. Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: A total of 719 respondents completed the survey. Most respondents (n=642, 89.3%) obtained COVID-19-related information from the internet. The majority (n=617, 85.8%) considered their source(s) of information to be accurate, and 32.6% (n=234) depended on only 1 out of the 7 potential sources of COVID-19 information. Respondents earning a monthly income between NGN 70,000-120,000 had lower odds of obtaining COVID-19 information from the internet compared to respondents earning less than NGN 20,000 (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-0.98). In addition, a significant proportion of respondents sought accurate information from recognized health organizations, such as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization. CONCLUSIONS: The internet was the most common source of COVID-19 information, and the population sampled had a relatively high level of perceived accuracy for the COVID-19 information received. Effective communication requires dissemination of information via credible communication channels, as identified from this study. This can be potentially beneficial for risk communication to control the pandemic.","Erinoso, Olufemi; Wright, Kikelomo Ololade; Anya, Samuel; Kuyinu, Yetunde; Abdur-Razzaq, Hussein; Adewuya, Abiodun",JMIR Public Health Surveill,524,32

We aimed to describe the risk factors and baseline characteristics of patients with PE in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective multicentre observational study, we included consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Patients without computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-proven PE diagnosis and those who were directly admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) were excluded. Among 1240 patients (58.1% men, mean age 64 ± 17 years), 103 (8.3%) patients had PE confirmed by CTPA. The ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation were significantly higher in the PE group (for both P < 0.001). In an univariable analysis, traditional venous thrombo-embolic risk factors were not associated with PE (P > 0.05), while patients under therapeutic dose anticoagulation before hospitalization or prophylactic dose anticoagulation introduced during hospitalization had lower PE occurrence [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.91, P = 0.04; and OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.06-0.18, P < 0.001, respectively]. In a multivariable analysis, the following variables, also statistically significant in univariable analysis, were associated with PE: male gender (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.003-1.069, P = 0.04), anticoagulation with a prophylactic dose (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.85, P < 0.001) or a therapeutic dose (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.92, P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P = 0.001), and time from symptom onset to hospitalization (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.006-1.038, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: PE risk factors in the COVID-19 context do not include traditional thrombo-embolic risk factors but rather independent clinical and biological findings at admission, including a major contribution to inflammation.","Fauvel, Charles; Weizman, Orianne; Trimaille, Antonin; Mika, Delphine; Pommier, Thibaut; Pace, Nathalie; Douair, Amine; Barbin, Eva; Fraix, Antoine; Bouchot, Océane; Benmansour, Othmane; Godeau, Guillaume; Mecheri, Yasmine; Lebourdon, Romane; Yvorel, Cédric; Massin, Michael; Leblon, Tiphaine; Chabbi, Chaima; Cugney, Erwan; Benabou, Léa; Aubry, Matthieu; Chan, Camille; Boufoula, Ines; Barnaud, Clement; Bothorel, Léa; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Waldmann, Victor; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Pezel, Théo",Eur Heart J,524,4

The interaction between local systems and global systems will be complex. Humandemics will propagate because of the pathways that connect the different systems and several invariant behaviors and patterns that have emerged globally. On the contrary, infodemics of misinformation can be a risk as it has occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic. The emerging fragility or robustness of the system will depend on how this complex network of systems is governed. Future societal systems will not be only multiscale in terms of the social dimension, but also in the temporality. Necessary and proper prevention and response systems based on complexity, ethic and multi-scale governance will be required. Real-time response systems are the basis for resilience to be the foundation of robust societies. A top-down approach led by Governmental organs for managing humandemics is not sufficient and may be only effective if policies are very restrictive and their efficacy depends not only in the measures implemented but also on the dynamics of the policies and the population perception and compliance. This top-down approach is even weaker if there is not national and international coordination. Coordinating top-down agencies with bottom-up constructs will be the design principle. Multi-scale governance integrates decision-making processes with signaling, sensing and leadership mechanisms to drive thriving societal systems with real-time sensitivity.","Pastor-Escuredo, David; Treleaven, Philip",,524,26

Materials and methods: We examined 49 patients, which were hospitalized for inpatient treatment of COVID-19 infection from May to June 2020. Study group included 24 men (49%) and 25 women (51%), median age 58 years [48;70], BMI 26.4 kg/m2 [24.3;30.5]. All patients were diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 with median percent of lung involvement equal to 29% [14;37], 22 patients (45%) required oxygen support upon admission. Median SpO2 was equal to 95% (92;97), median NEWS score was equal to 3 [2;6]. Participants were tested for vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and D3) by UPLC-MS/MS, free 25(OH)D and vitamin D-binding protein by ELISA, as well as PTH by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and routine biochemical parameters of blood serum (calcium, phosphorus, albumin) at the time of admission. Results: patients had in general very low 25()D3 levels - median 10.9 ng/mL [6.9;15.6], corresponding to a pronounced vitamin D deficiency in half of the patients. Levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 were also low – 0.5 ng/mL [0.2;0.9], and resulting vitamin D metabolite ratios (25(OH)D3/24,25(OH)2D3) were high-normal or elevated in most patients – 24.1 [19.0;39.2], indicating decreased activity of 24-hydroxylase. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D3, on the contrary, were high-normal or elevated - 57 pg/mL [46;79], which, in accordance with 25(OH)D3/1,25(OH)2D3 ratio (219 [134;266]) suggests an increase in 1α-hydroxylase activity. Median level of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 was 0.7 ng/mL [0.4;1.0] and D3 metabolite was detectable only in 6 patients. Median DBP level was 432 mg/L [382;498], median free 25(OH)D was 5.6 pg/mL [3.3;6.7], median calculated free 25(OH)D was 2.0 pg/mL [1.4;3.3]. Most patients had albumin-adjusted serum calcium level in the lower half of reference range (median 2.24 mmol/L [2.14;2.34]). Seven patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism and one patient had primary hyperparathyroidism, the rest of the patients had PTH levels within the normal range.25(OH)D3 levels showed significant negative correlation with percent of lung involvement (r = -0.36, p&amp;lt;0.05) and positive correlation with SpO2 (r = 0.4, p&amp;lt;0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 levels correlated positively with 25(OH)D3 levels (r = 0.38, p&amp;lt;0.05) and did not correlate significantly with PTH levels (p&amp;gt;0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggests that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection have significant impairment of vitamin D metabolism, in particular, an increase in 1α-hydroxylase activity, which cannot be fully explained by pre-existing conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The observed profound vitamin D deficiency and association of vitamin D levels with markers of disease severity indicate the importance of vitamin D supplementation in these patients.","Povaliaeva, Alexandra Rozhinskaya Liudmila Ya Pigarova Ekaterina A.; Dzeranova, Larisa K.; Katamadze, Nino N.; Malysheva, Natalya Nikankina Larisa Bogdanov Viktor Ioutsi Vitaliy Mokrysheva Natalia G.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,524,1

METHODS: A one-step quadruplex rRT-PCR assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N genes, influenza A virus (hIAV) and influenza B virus (hIBV). RESULTS: The quadruplex rRT-PCR assay had good sensitivity and specificity. Correlation coefficients and amplification efficiencies of all singleplex and quadruplex rRT-PCR reactions were within acceptable ranges. The 95% lower limits of detection for plasmid standards and positive nucleic acid extracts of the quadruplex rRT-PCR assay were 57.38-95.11 copies/µL and 114.65-154.25 copies/µL, respectively. Excellent results were attained for inter- and intra-assay reproducibility. Among these clinical samples, only four samples showed results inconsistent with the singleplex rRT-PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to report a quadruplex rRT-PCR assay for the detection of two SARS-CoV-2 genes, hIAV and hIBV with perfect clinical performance.","Ni, Minjun; Xu, Hengyi; Luo, Jie; Liu, Wei; Zhou, Donggen",Int J Infect Dis,524,24

Following a period of stability, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic appears to be re-intensifying globally. As the virus continues to evolve, so does our understanding of its implications on ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We sought to describe a single center STEMI experience at one of the epicenters during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS/MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study comparing STEMI patients during the pandemic period (March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020) to those with STEMI during the pre-pandemic period (March 1, 2019 to August 31, 2019) at NYU Langone Hospital - Long Island, a tertiary care center in Nassau County, New York. Additionally, we describe our subset of COVID-19 patients with STEMI during the pandemic. RESULTS: The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) team was activated for a total of 183 patients during both periods. There were a similar number of AMI team activations during the pandemic period (n = 93) compared to the pre-pandemic period (n = 90). Baseline characteristics did not differ during both periods however, infection control measures and additional investigation were required to clarify the diagnosis during the pandemic, resulting in a signal towards longer door-to-balloon times (95.9 min vs. 74.4 min, p = 0.0587). We observed similar inpatient length of stay (LOS) (3.6 days vs. 5.0 days, p = 0.0901) and mortality (13.2% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.5876). There was a total of 6 COVID-19 positive patients who presented with STEMI, of which 4 were emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory with successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) performed in 3 patients. The 2 patients who were not offered primary PCI expired, as both were treated medically, one with thrombolytics. CONCLUSIONS: Our single center study, in New York, at one of the epicenters of the pandemic, demonstrated a similar number of AMI team activations, mimicking the seasonal variability seen in 2019, but with a signal towards longer door-to-balloon time. Despite this, inpatient LOS and mortality remained similar.","Medranda, Giorgio A; Brahmbhatt, Kunal; Alawneh, Basem; Marzo, Kevin P; Schwartz, Richard K; Green, Stephen J",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,524,1

Sample pooling methods improve the efficiency of large-scale pathogen screening campaigns by reducing the number of tests and reagents required to accurately categorize positive and negative individuals. Such methods rely on group testing theory which mainly focuses on minimizing the total number of tests; however, many other practical concerns and tradeoffs must be considered when choosing an appropriate method for a given set of circumstances. Here we use computational simulations to determine how several theoretical approaches compare in terms of (a) the number of tests, to minimize costs and save reagents, (b) the number of sequential steps, to reduce the time it takes to complete the assay, (c) the number of samples per pool, to avoid the limits of detection, (d) simplicity, to reduce the risk of human error, and (e) robustness, to poor estimates of the number of positive samples. We found that established methods often perform very well in one area but very poorly in others. Therefore, we introduce and validate a new method which performs fairly well across each of the above criteria making it a good general use approach.","Furstenau, Tara N; Cocking, Jill H; Hepp, Crystal M; Fofanov, Viacheslav Y",PLoS One,524,1

Patients with underlying conditions such as cancer are at substantial risk of acquiring and dying from this novel coronavirus. Numerous reports have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes depletion of B- and T-lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and is associated with severe illness and death and that patients with higher lymphocyte levels may have better outcomes. Dexamethasone, a widely prescribed antiemetic for acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from a variety of cancer drugs, causes B and T cell depletion, which may augment immunosuppression. Since it seems that lymphocytes are vital in the immune response to novel coronavirus, oncologists should reconsider the routine use of prophylactic dexamethasone in uninfected patients, to avoid inducing lymphopenia, which may increase risk of infection or lead to inferior outcomes if a cancer patient subsequently becomes infected. Since many cancer drugs and malignant diseases inherently cause lymphopenia, further reduction of lymphocytes with dexamethasone should be avoided if possible and if safe and effective alternative antiemetics are available during the COVID-19 crisis.","Marinella, Mark A",J Oncol Pharm Pract,524,33

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.","Almasy, Katherine M; Davies, Jonathan P; Plate, Lars",Mol Cell Proteomics,524,12

METHODS: This international, observational cohort study comprised 1137 consecutive patients with head and neck cancer undergoing primary surgery with curative intent in 26 countries. Factors associated with severe pulmonary complications in COVID-19-positive patients and infections in the surgical team were determined by univariate analysis. RESULTS: Among the 1137 patients, the commonest sites were the oral cavity (38%) and the thyroid (21%). For oropharynx and larynx tumors, nonsurgical therapy was favored in most cases. There was evidence of surgical de-escalation of neck management and reconstruction. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.2%. Twenty-nine patients (3%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within 30 days of surgery; 13 of these patients (44.8%) developed severe respiratory complications, and 3.51 (10.3%) died. There were significant correlations with an advanced tumor stage and admission to critical care. Members of the surgical team tested positive within 30 days of surgery in 40 cases (3%). There were significant associations with operations in which the patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days, with a high community incidence of SARS-CoV-2, with screened patients, with oral tumor sites, and with tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era appears safe even when surgery is prolonged and complex. The overlap in COVID-19 between patients and members of the surgical team raises the suspicion of failures in cross-infection measures or the use of personal protective equipment. LAY SUMMARY: Head and neck surgery is safe for patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic even when it is lengthy and complex. This is significant because concerns over patient safety raised in many guidelines appear not to be reflected by outcomes, even for those who have other serious illnesses or require complex reconstructions. Patients subjected to suboptimal or nonstandard treatments should be carefully followed up to optimize their cancer outcomes. The overlap between patients and surgeons testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is notable and emphasizes the need for fastidious cross-infection controls and effective personal protective equipment.",,Cancer,524,21

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0â%, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0â%, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappaâ=â0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8â% (11/16), 77.8â% (7/9), 100.0â% (2/2), specificity of 85.7â% (12/14), 76.2â% (16/21), 92.9â% (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7â% (23/30), 76.7â% (23/30), 93.3â% (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION: Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","Lu, Wuzhu; Zhang, Shushan; Chen, Binghui; Chen, Jiaxin; Xian, Jianzhong; Lin, Yuhong; Shan, Hong; Su, Zhong Zhen",Ultraschall Med,524,2

By their nature, COVID-19 social isolation, physical distancing, and health precautions induce behavioural aspects of negative symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these prevention measures also lead to increases in experiential negative symptoms, whether such effects are equivalent across individual negative symptom domains, and if exacerbations occur equivalently across phases of illness. The current study compared negative symptom severity scores obtained during the pandemic to pre-pandemic assessments in two samples: (1) outpatients with chronic schizophrenia (SZ: n = 32) and matched healthy controls (CN: n = 31) and (2) individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR: n = 25) and matched CN (n = 30). Pre-pandemic ratings of negative symptoms were clinically elevated in SZ and CHR groups, which did not differ from each other in severity. In SZ, ratings obtained during the pandemic were significantly higher than pre-pandemic ratings for all 5 domains (alogia, blunted affect, anhedonia, avolition, and asociality) and item-level analyses indicated that exacerbations occurred on both experiential and behavioral symptoms of anhedonia, avolition, and asociality. In contrast, CHR only exhibited increases in anhedonia and avolition items during the pandemic compared to pre-ratings. Findings suggest that negative symptoms should be a critical treatment target during and after the pandemic in the schizophrenia spectrum given that they are worsening and critically related to risk for conversion, functional outcome, and recovery.","Strauss, Gregory P; Macdonald, Kelsey I; Ruiz, Ivan; Raugh, Ian M; Bartolomeo, Lisa A; James, Sydney H",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,524,24

Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the COVID-19 research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy and determine cutoffs for 3 short cognitive screening instruments: the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen-Turkish version (Qmci-TR), in older adults with low literacy in Turkey. METHODS: In all 321 patients, 133 with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), 88 amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 100 with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) with a median of 5 years education were included. Education and age-specific cutoffs were determined. RESULTS: For the overall population, the Qmci-TR was more accurate than the MoCA in distinguishing between aMCI and AD (area under the curve=0.83 vs. 0.76, P=0.004) and the Qmci-TR and Mini-Mental State Examination were superior to the MoCA in discriminating SCC from aMCI and AD. All instruments had similar accuracy among those with low literacy (primary school and lower educational level or illiterate). CONCLUSIONS: To distinguish between SCC, aMCI, and AD in a sample of older Turkish adults, the Qmci-TR may be preferable.

The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients who developed COVID-19, the impact of the screening strategy, and to assess the antibody response to a subset of dialysis patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the outcomes of COVID19 infection in all our haemodialysis patients, who were tested regularly for COVID 19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. In addition, IgG antibody serology was also performed to assess response to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. RESULTS: 152 (13 %) of 1180 dialysis patients developed COVID-19 during the study period from 1st of March to the 1st of July 2020. Of these 81 % were male, average age of 52â years and 95 % were on in-centre haemodialysis. Family and community contact was most likely source of infection in most patients. Fever (49 %) and cough (48 %) were the most common presenting symptoms, when present. Comorbidities in infected individuals included hypertension (93 %), diabetes (49 %), ischaemic heart disease (30 %). The majority (68 %) developed mild disease, whilst 13 % required critical care. Combinations of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, camostat, tocilizumab and steroids were used based on local guidelines.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a lower mortality in this patient group compared with many published series. Asymptomatic PCR positivity was present in 40 %. Rapid isolation of positive patients may have contributed to the relative lack of spread of COVID-19 within our dialysis units.

As data on COVID-19 has grown, it has become clear that older adults have a disproportionately high rate of death from COVID-19. This study describes the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with more than 80 years of age. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data from 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and February 20, 2020 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Treatment outcomes among subgroups of patients with non-severe and severe symptoms of COVID-19 were compared. RESULTS: Of the 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 88.0 years (interquartile range, 86.6-90.0 years; range, 80.0-100.0 years) and 12 (70.6%) were men. The age distribution of patients was not significantly different between non-severe group and severe group. All patients had chronic pre-existing conditions. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were the most common chronic conditions in both subgroups. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 were fever (n = 13; 76.5%), fatigue (n = 11; 64.7%), and cough (n = 5; 29.4%). Lymphopenia was observed in all patients, and lymphopenia was significantly more severe in the severe group than that in non-severe group (0.4 × 109/L vs 1.2 × 109/L, P = 0.014). The level of serum creatinine was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (99.0 µmol/L vs 62.5 µmol/L, P = 0.038). The most common features of chest computed tomography images were nodular foci in 10 (58.8%) patients and pleural thickening in 7 (41.2%) patients. All patients received antiviral therapy, while some patients also received intravenous antibiotics therapy (76.5%), Chinese medicinal preparation therapy (Lianhuaqingwen capsule, 64.7%), corticosteroids (35.3%) or immunoglobin (29.4%). Eight patients (47.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit because of complications. Ten patients (58.8%) received intranasal oxygen, while 3 (17.6%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4 (23.5%) received high-flow oxygen. As of June 20, 7 (41.2%) patients had been discharged and 10 (58.8% of this cohort, 77.8% of severe patients) had died. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients aged 80 years and older with severe COVID-19 symptoms was high. Lymphopenia was a characteristic laboratory result in these patients, and the severity of lymphopenia was indicative of the severity of COVID-19. However, the majority of patients with COVID-19 in this age cohort had atypical symptoms, and early diagnosis depends on prompt use of a viral nucleic acid test.","Dang, Jian-Zhong; Zhu, Gang-Yan; Yang, Ying-Jie; Zheng, Fang",J Integr Med,524,23

Obviously, this pandemic affected individuals differently, with a significant impact on populations considered to be at high-risk. One such population, was assumed to be patients with primary genetic defect involving components or pathways of the immune system. While human immunity against COVID-19 is not fully understood, it is, so far, well documented, that both adaptive and innate cells have a critical role in protection against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we aimed to summarize the clinical and laboratory data on primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients in Israel, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, in order to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on such patients. Data was collected from mid-February to end-September. During this time Israel experienced two ""waves"" of COVID-19 diseases; the first, from mid-February to mid-May and the second from mid-June and still ongoing at the end of data collection. A total of 20 PID patients, aged 4 months to 60 years, were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all but one, were detected during the second wave. Fourteen of the patients were on routine monthly IVIG replacement therapy at the time of virus detection. None of the patients displayed severe illness and none required hospitalization; moreover, 7/20 patients were completely asymptomatic. Possible explanations for the minimal clinical impact of COVID-19 pandemic observed in our PID patients include high level of awareness, extra-precautions, and even self-isolation. It is also possible that only specific immune pathways (e.g. type I interferon signaling), may increase the risk for a more severe course of disease and these are not affected in many of the PID patients. In some cases, lack of an immune response actually may be a protective measure against the development of COVID-19 sequelae.","Marcus, Nufar; Frizinsky, Shirly; Hagin, David; Ovadia, Adi; Hanna, Suhair; Farkash, Michael; Maoz-Segal, Ramit; Agmon-Levin, Nancy; Broides, Arnon; Nahum, Amit; Rosenberg, Elli; Kuperman, Amir Asher; Dinur-Schejter, Yael; Berkun, Yackov; Toker, Ori; Goldberg, Shmuel; Confino-Cohen, Ronit; Scheuerman, Oded; Badarneh, Basel; Epstein-Rigbi, Na039; ama,; Etzioni, Amos; Dalal, Ilan; Somech, Raz",Front Immunol,524,12

While some studies have found no link between smoking status and severe COVID-19, others demonstrated a significant one. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between smoking and clinical COVID-19 severity via a systematic meta-analysis approach. Methods: We searched the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases to identify clinical studies suitable for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies reporting smoking status and comparing nonsevere and severe patients were included. Nonsevere cases were described as mild, common type, nonintensive care unit (ICU) treatment, survivors, and severe cases as critical, need for ICU, refractory, and nonsurvivors. Results: A total of 16 articles detailing 11322 COVID-19 patients were included. Our meta-analysis revealed a relationship between a history of smoking and severe COVID-19 cases (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.37-3.46; P < .001). Additionally, we found an association between the current smoking status and severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.12-2.05; P < .008). In 10.7% (978/9067) of nonsmokers, COVID-19 was severe, while in active smokers, severe COVID-19 occurred in 21.2% (65/305) of cases. Conclusion: Active smoking and a history of smoking are clearly associated with severe COVID-19. The SARS-COV-2 epidemic should serve as an impetus for patients and those at risk to maintain good health practices and discontinue smoking.

Experimental evidence suggests that microRNA can mediate an intracellular defence mechanism against some RNA viruses. The purpose of this study was to identify microRNA with predicted binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, compare these to their microRNA expression profiles in lung epithelial tissue and make inference towards possible roles for microRNA in mitigating coronavirus infection. We hypothesize that high expression of specific coronavirus-targeting microRNA in lung epithelia may protect against infection and viral propagation, conversely, low expression may confer susceptibility to infection. We have identified 128 human microRNA with potential to target the SARS-CoV-2 genome, most of which have very low expression in lung epithelia. Six of these 128 microRNA are differentially expressed upon in vitro infection of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 28 microRNA also target the SARS-CoV genome while 23 microRNA target the MERS-CoV genome. We also found that a number of microRNA are commonly identified in two other studies. Further research into identifying bona fide coronavirus targeting microRNA will be useful in understanding the importance of microRNA as a cellular defence mechanism against pathogenic coronavirus infections.","Chow, Jonathan Tak-Sum; Salmena, Leonardo",,524,22

Algumas doenças de grande importância econômica tem sido motivo de estudos, não apenas pelo impacto econômico que representam, mas também para a saúde do animal e do homem. Com a crescente preocupação com resíduos de medicamentos pesticidas nos produtos de origem animal, perda da qualidade do leite e conseqüente baixo ganho de peso dos borregos de corte, os sistemas orgânicos de produção vem ganhando espaço. Sabe-se que a mastite subclínica é uma das responsáveis pelo baixo rendimento de carcaça na ovinocultura de corte. Neste experimento, optou-se por realizar tratamento com medicamento homeopático (Phytolaca decandra) das ovelhas com tetos diagnosticados com CMT 2+ e 3+, sem sinais de mastite clínica. Dois lotes de ovelhas com mastite subclínica foram usados. Um lote controle que recebeu placebo e o lote tratado que recebeu remédio homeopático duas vezes ao dia junto ao concentrado a partir da quarta semana do parto (de lactação). Foram colhidas duas amostras de cada tetos com mastite subclínica no início do experimento (30 dias do parto) e a cada 15 dias até o desmame quando os borregos tinham aproximadamente 60 - 65 dias de vida. Das amostras colhidas, uma seguiu para identificação do agente microbiológico e outra para a contagem de células somáticas (CCS). Ao final do estudo não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa entre as CCSs da secreção láctea quando comparadas antes e depois do tratamento homeopático no mesmo grupo, bem como quando comparou-se ambos os grupos (tratados e placebo).

BDIs have an estimated incidence of 0.4-1.5%, but considering the number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, mostly by laparoscopy, surgeons must be prepared to manage this surgical challenge. Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success. Subsequently, the choice and timing of the appropriate reconstructive strategy have a critical role in long-term prognosis. Currently, a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary interventions with different degrees of invasiveness is indicated for BDI management. These World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines have been produced following an exhaustive review of the current literature and an international expert panel discussion with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate and standardize the detection and management of BDIs during cholecystectomy. In particular, the 2020 WSES guidelines cover the following key aspects: (1) strategies to minimize the risk of BDI during cholecystectomy; (2) BDI rates in general surgery units and review of surgical practice; (3) how to classify, stage, and report BDI once detected; (4) how to manage an intraoperatively detected BDI; (5) indications for antibiotic treatment; (6) indications for clinical, biochemical, and imaging investigations for suspected BDI; and (7) how to manage a postoperatively detected BDI.","de039,; Angelis, Nicola; Catena, Fausto; Memeo, Riccardo; Coccolini, Federico; Martínez-Pérez, Aleix; Romeo, Oreste M; De Simone, Belinda; Di Saverio, Salomone; Brustia, Raffaele; Rhaiem, Rami; Piardi, Tullio; Conticchio, Maria; Marchegiani, Francesco; Beghdadi, Nassiba; Abu-Zidan, Fikri M; Alikhanov, Ruslan; Allard, Marc-Antoine; Allievi, Niccolò; Amaddeo, Giuliana; Ansaloni, Luca; Andersson, Roland; Andolfi, Enrico; Azfar, Mohammad; Bala, Miklosh; Benkabbou, Amine; Ben-Ishay, Offir; Bianchi, Giorgio; Biffl, Walter L; Brunetti, Francesco; Carra, Maria Clotilde; Casanova, Daniel; Celentano, Valerio; Ceresoli, Marco; Chiara, Osvaldo; Cimbanassi, Stefania; Bini, Roberto; Coimbra, Raul; de039, Luigi; Angelis, Gian; Decembrino, Francesco; De Palma, Andrea; de Reuver, Philip R; Domingo, Carlos; Cotsoglou, Christian; Ferrero, Alessandro; Fraga, Gustavo P; Gaiani, Federica; Gheza, Federico; Gurrado, Angela; Harrison, Ewen; Henriquez, Angel",World J Emerg Surg,524,21

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate hyperlipidemia as a risk factor connected with stroke and CVD. Moreover, having identified this risk factor, the study evaluates how hyperlipidemia has been examined earlier and what can be done in the future. METHODS: All prospective studies concerning hyperlipidemia as risk factors for stroke and CVD were identified by a search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases with keywords hyperlipidemia, risk factors, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: The constant positive association between the incidence of coronary heart disease and cholesterol concentration of LDL is apparent in observational studies in different populations. Thus, the reduction of LDL cholesterol in those populations, particularly with regard to initial cholesterol concentrations, can reduce the risk of vascular diseases. However, the impact of using lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins, has been demonstrated in several studies as an important factor in decreasing the mortality and morbidity in rates of patients with stroke and CVD. CONCLUSION: After reviewing all the research mentioned in this review, it can be confirmed that hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for stroke and correlated in patients with CVD.","Alloubani, Aladeen; Nimer, Refat; Samara, Rama",Current cardiology reviews (Online),524,10

WHY DOES THIS MATTER?: There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19. RECOMMENDATION: The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty). HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION: The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19. UPDATES: This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline. READERS NOTE: This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19.

Traditional physics-based models are sample efficient, interpretable but often rely on rigid assumptions. Furthermore, direct numerical approximation is usually computationally intensive, requiring significant computational resources and expertise. While deep learning (DL) provides novel alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns and emulating nonlinear dynamics, its predictions do not necessarily obey the governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well across different systems. Thus, the study of physics-guided DL emerged and has gained great progress. Physics-guided DL aims to take the best from both physics-based modeling and state-of-the-art DL models to better solve scientific problems. In this paper, we provide a structured overview of existing methodologies of integrating prior physical knowledge or physics-based modeling into DL, with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

METHODS: A total of 104 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated in the study. Of them, 42/104 (40.4%) were hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) and 62/104(59.6%) in a sub-intensive care unit (SICU). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Parvovirus B19 and Human Herpesvirus 6 virus reactivations were determined by real-time PCR, and lymphocyte subpopulation counts were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Among opportunistic viruses, only EBV was consistently detected. EBV DNA was observed in 40/42 (95.2%) of the ICU patients and in 51/61 (83.6%) of the SICU patients. Comparing the two groups of patients, the EBV DNA median level among ICU patients was significantly higher than that observed in SICU patients.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study, on behalf of NHS England. SETTING: Primary care data and pseudonymously linked hospital and intensive care admissions and death records from England, during wave 1 (1 February to 31 August 2020) and wave 2 (1 September to 18 December 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of adults (18 years and over) registered at a general practice on 1 February 2020 and 1 September 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted hazard ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection, covid-19 related admission to hospital or intensive care, or death from covid-19, by presence of children in the household. RESULTS: Among 9 334 392adults aged 65 years and under, during wave 1, living with children was not associated with materially increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, covid-19 related hospital or intensive care admission, or death from covid-19. In wave 2, among adults aged 65 years and under, living with children of any age was associated with an increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (hazard ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.08) for living with children aged 0-11 years; 1.22 (1.20 to 1.24) for living with children aged 12-18 years) and covid-19 related hospital admission (1.18 (1.06 to 1.31) for living with children aged 0-11; 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40) for living with children aged 12-18). Living with children aged 0-11 was associated with reduced risk of death from both covid-19 and non-covid-19 causes in both waves; living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-covid-19 causes. For adults 65 years and under during wave 2, living with children aged 0-11 years was associated with an increased absolute risk of having SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded of 40-60 per 10 000 people, from 810 to between 850 and 870, and an increase in the number of hospital admissions of 1-5 per 10 000 people, from 160 to between 161 and 165.

The nexus between energy returns and uncertainty index is analyzed, using daily price returns of eight energy sources (Brent oil, diesel, gasoline, heating oil, kerosene, natural gas, propane, and WTI oil) and four news/information‐based uncertainty proxies [CIU, EPU, Global Fear Index (GFI) and VIX]. The CIU and alternative indexes are used, respectively for the main estimation and sensitivity analysis. We show the outperformance of CIU over alternative news uncertainty proxies in the prediction of energy prices. News (aggregate) and bad news are found to negatively and significantly impact energy returns, while good news has a significantly positive impact. Imperatively, energy variables lack hedging potentials against the uncertainty occasioned by the COVID‐19 pandemic, while we find no strong evidence of asymmetry.

It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5´exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels.

Here we perform a massive analysis on near-real-time Italian mobility data provided by Facebook to investigate how lockdown strategies affect economic conditions of individuals and local governments. We model the change in mobility as an exogenous shock similar to a natural disaster. We identify two ways through which mobility restrictions affect Italian citizens. First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.","Bonaccorsi, Giovanni; Pierri, Francesco; Cinelli, Matteo; Flori, Andrea; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Porcelli, Francesco; Schmidt, Ana Lucia; Valensise, Carlo Michele; Scala, Antonio; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Pammolli, Fabio",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,524,7

There was widespread use of technology, with greater than 69% of organizations reporting using telephone or video for most services. For all video services and just three telephone services, organizations reported significantly greater odds of intending to use technology to deliver services post-COVID-19. Use of video was seen as more desirable as compared to telephone. The overall perceived ease of use and usefulness for video-based services and certain telephone services provide a promising outlook for use of these services post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Molfenter, Todd; Heitkamp, Thomasine; Murphy, Ann A; Tapscott, Stephanie; Behlman, Stephanie; Cody, Olivia J",Community ment. health j,524,28

The objective was to assess whether HRCT is associated to short-time development of severe disease in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 64 ± 15 years) with mild COVID-19 pneumonia (no or mild respiratory failure) that underwent HRCT were retrospectively identified. Fifty-two on 77 patients had reported risk factors for severe disease. A chest-imaging devoted radiologist recorded, on a per-examination basis, the following HRCT features: ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern, mosaic attenuation, and nodules. The extent of each feature (total feature score, TFS) was semi-quantitatively assessed. Total lung involvement (TLI) was defined as the sum of all TFSs. The study outcome was defined as the occurrence of severe disease (moderate-to-severe respiratory failure) within 15 days from HRCT. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if age, comorbidities, and HRCT features were associated to severe disease. RESULTS: On univariable analysis, severe disease was significantly associated with age > 59 years (29/47 patients, 61.7%) (p = 0.013), and not significantly associated with having comorbidities (22/44 patients, 50.0%). On multivariable analysis, TLI >15 and OP pattern >5 were independently associated to severe disease, with odds ratio of 8.380 (p = 0.003), and of 4.685 (p = 0.035), respectively. CONCLUSION: Short-time onset of severe COVID-19 was associated to TLI >15 and OP pattern score > 5. Severe disease was not associated to comorbidities.","Cereser, Lorenzo; Da Re, Jacopo; Zuiani, Chiara; Girometti, Rossano",Clin Imaging,524,16

Methods: The first time chest MDSCT images of 40 common type COVID-19 patients and 20 times re-examinations of MDSCT during follow-up of 15 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The first time MDSCT showed that the distribution of lesions were mainly bilateral (36/40, 90.00%) and subpleural extramedullary (38/40, 95.00%), involved 5 lobes in 28 cases (28/40, 70.00%), which were patchy, flaky and irregular shaped in 36 cases (36/40, 90.00%). Among 40 patients, 16 cases were in the early stage, 24 cases of the progressive stage, no case in the dissipation stage. Early stage MDSCT showed multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs, 18.75% (3/16) cases with thin consolidation, 31.25% (5/16) cases with obvious consolidation. All progressive stage cases were found with varying degrees of consolidation. Fifteen patients underwent MDSCT follow-up, the absorption of lesions changed from the progressive stage to the dissipated stage in 4 cases, while lesions progressed in 11 cases. Conclusion: MDSCT can be used to evaluate the changes of lung condition, which is valuable for early diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19.","Wang, Xia; Liu, Bin; Yu, Yongqiang; Wu, Xingwang; Gu, Jinfeng; Du, Yaqing; Huang, Guoquan; Zhang, Qing; Wu, Baoming",Chin.

Systemic involvement in COVID-19 is due to the ubiquitous expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, responsible for the entry in the cells of SARS-CoV-2, Several reports in humans and animal models showed a significant ACE2 mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary cells. Moreover, higher mortality and poorer outcomes have been widely described in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetes and vertebral fractures, which are all highly prevalent in subjects with pituitary dysfunctions. AIM: To review the main endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 with their possible implications for pituitary diseases, the possible direct and indirect involvement of the pituitary gland in COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of established pituitary diseases which can be already at increased risk for worse outcomes and on neurosurgical activities as well as vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underlines that there could be a specific involvement of the pituitary gland which fits into a progressively shaping endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. Moreover, the care for pituitary diseases need to continue despite the restrictions due to the emergency. Several pituitary diseases, such as hypopituitarism and Cushing disease, or due to frequent comorbidities such as diabetes may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in affected patients. There is the urgent need to collect in international multicentric efforts data on all these aspects of the pituitary involvement in the pandemic in order to issue evidence driven recommendations for the management of pituitary patients in the persistent COVID-19 emergency.","Frara, Stefano; Allora, Agnese; Castellino, Laura; di Filippo, Luigi; Loli, Paola; Giustina, Andrea",Pituitary,524,16

To enhance multilingual care, the authors created a freely available web app, RadTranslate, that provides multilingual radiology examination instructions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of this intervention in radiology. METHODS: The device-agnostic web app leverages artificial intelligence text-to-speech technology to provide standardized, human-like spoken examination instructions in the patient's preferred language. Standardized phrases were collected from a consensus group consisting of technologists, radiologists, and ancillary staff members. RadTranslate was piloted in Spanish for chest radiography performed at a COVID-19 triage outpatient center that served a predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino community. Implementation included a tablet displaying the app in the chest radiography room. Imaging appointment duration was measured and compared between pre- and postimplementation groups. RESULTS: In the 63-day test period after launch, there were 1,267 app uses, with technologists voluntarily switching exclusively to RadTranslate for Spanish-speaking patients. The most used phrases were a general explanation of the examination (30% of total), followed by instructions to disrobe and remove any jewelry (12%). There was no significant difference in imaging appointment duration (11 ± 7 and 12 ± 3 min for standard of care vs RadTranslate, respectively), but variability was significantly lower when RadTranslate was used (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence-aided multilingual audio instructions were successfully integrated into imaging workflows, reducing strain on medical interpreters and variance in throughput and resulting in more reliable average examination length.","Chonde, Daniel B; Pourvaziri, Ali; Williams, Joy; McGowan, Jennifer; Moskos, Margo; Alvarez, Carmen; Narayan, Anand K; Daye, Dania; Flores, Efren J; Succi, Marc D",J.

In a multi-institutional study, all adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 across five hospitals were identified and included from March 6th to April 16th, 2020. Hospitalization, intubation, and death were evaluated for association with blood type. Univariate analysis was conducted using standard techniques and logistic regression was used to determine the independent effect of blood type on intubation and/or death and positive testing. During the study period, there were 7648 patients who received COVID-19 testing throughout the institutions. Of these, 1289 tested positive with a known blood type. A total of 484 (37.5%) were admitted to hospital, 123 (9.5%) were admitted to the ICU, 108 (8.4%) were intubated, 3 (0.2%) required ECMO, and 89 (6.9%) died. Of the 1289 patients who tested positive, 440 (34.2%) were blood type A, 201 (15.6%) were blood type B, 61 (4.7%) were blood type AB, and 587 (45.5%) were blood type O. On univariate analysis, there was no association between blood type and any of the peak inflammatory markers (peak WBC, p = 0.25; peak LDH, p = 0.40; peak ESR, p = 0.16; peak CRP, p = 0.14) nor between blood type and any of the clinical outcomes of severity (admission p = 0.20, ICU admission p = 0.94, intubation p = 0.93, proning while intubated p = 0.58, ECMO p = 0.09, and death p = 0.49). After multivariable analysis, blood type was not independently associated with risk of intubation or death (referent blood type A; blood type B: AOR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.42-1.26, blood type AB: AOR: 0.78, CI: 0.33-1.87, blood type O: AOR: 0.77, CI: 0.51-1.16), rhesus factor positive (Rh+): AOR: 1.03, CI: 0.93-1.86. Blood type A had no correlation with positive testing (AOR: 1.00, CI: 0.88-1.13), blood type B was associated with higher odds of testing positive for disease (AOR: 1.28, CI: 1.08-1.52), AB was also associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.37, CI: 1.02-1.83), and O was associated with a lower risk of testing positive (AOR: 0.84, CI: 0.75-0.95). Rh+ status was associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.23, CI: 1.003-1.50). Blood type was not associated with risk of intubation or death in patients with COVID-19. Patients with blood types B and AB who received a test were more likely to test positive and blood type O was less likely to test positive. Rh+ patients were more likely to test positive.","Latz, Christopher A; DeCarlo, Charles; Boitano, Laura; Png, C Y Maximilian; Patell, Rushad; Conrad, Mark F; Eagleton, Matthew; Dua, Anahita",Ann Hematol,524,20

It analyses the two main legislative responses adopted by North American governments: a broadening of access to (un)employment insurance (EI) and the adoption of payroll subsidies for companies. It comparatively and critically assesses these two solutions, to eventually propose an alternative plan. Under this plan, access to EI would be broadened to cover those not traditionally covered by it, such as self-employed workers, contract workers, and those caring for a family member sick from COVID-19 or for a child who is at home due to school and day-care closures. Unemployed workers who have traditionally paid into the EI system would be rewarded through a tax credit. To avoid incentivising temporary layoffs, a payroll subsidy would be adopted. The subsidy would make it as attractive to keep workers on payroll as to lay them off so they can benefit from EI. It would also provide a more faithful picture of unemployment rates during the crisis. The plan would also address broader concerns regarding the unsustainability of public spending during the crisis by limiting access to both temporary layoffs and the payroll subsidy. Large and profitable companies, as well as companies with high revenue or cash reserves, would not be able to temporarily lay their employees off during the crisis or benefit from the subsidy. For companies that face liquidity issues yet are not eligible for the subsidy, short-term, interest-bearing emergency loans would be available.","Lord, Phil",Theo. Pract. Legisl.,524,16

This study assessed the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions for acute surgical conditions and the subsequent impact on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was an observational analytical study, evaluating data from a national discharge database that collected all discharge reports from any hospital in France. All adult patients admitted through the emergency department and requiring a surgical treatment between 17 March and 11 May 2020, and the equivalent period in 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the change in number of hospital admissions for acute surgical conditions. Mortality was assessed in the matched population, and stratified by region. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, 57 589 consecutive patients were admitted for acute surgical conditions, representing a decrease of 20.9 per cent compared with the 2019 cohort. Significant differences between regions were observed: the decrease was 15.6, 17.2, and 26.8 per cent for low-, intermediate- and high-prevalence regions respectively. The mortality rate was 1.92 per cent during the lockdown period and 1.81 per cent in 2019. In high-prevalence zones, mortality was significantly increased (odds ratio 1.22, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.40). CONCLUSION: A marked decrease in hospital admissions for surgical emergencies was observed during the lockdown period, with increased mortality in regions with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

PURPOSE: To evaluate CT ability in differentiating critically ill patients requiring invasive ventilation from patients with less severe disease. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from patients admitted to our institution for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 5th-24th. Patients were considered critically ill or non-critically ill, depending on the need for mechanical ventilation. CT images from both groups were analyzed for the assessment of qualitative features and disease extension, using a quantitative semiautomatic method. We evaluated the differences between the two groups for clinical, laboratory and CT data. Analyses were conducted on a per-protocol basis. RESULTS: 189 patients were analyzed. PaO2/FIO2 ratio and oxygen saturation (SaO2) were decreased in critically ill patients. At CT, mixed pattern (ground glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation) and GGO alone were more frequent respectively in critically ill and in non-critically ill patients (pâ¯<â¯0.05). Lung volume involvement was significantly higher in critically ill patients (38.5 % vs. 5.8 %, pâ¯<â¯0.05).

In fact, the seasonality attributes of this pandemic remain one of its biggest unknowns. Early studies based on past experience from respiratory diseases focused on temperature or humidity, with disappointing results. Our hypothesis that ultraviolet (UV) radiation levels might be a factor and a more appropriate parameter has emerged as an alternative to assess seasonality and exploit it for public health policies. Using geographical, socioeconomic and epidemiological criteria, we selected twelve North-equatorial-South countries with similar characteristics. We then obtained UV levels, mobility and Covid-19 daily incidence rates for nearly the entire 2020. Using machine learning, we demonstrated that UV radiation strongly associated with incidence rates, more so than mobility did, indicating that UV is a key seasonality indicator for Covid-19, irrespective of the initial conditions of the epidemic.

Their specificity and mechanism of action make them very promising molecules for interfering with the function encoded in viral RNA genomes. RNA viruses store essential information in conserved structural genomic RNA elements that promote important steps for the consecution of the infective cycle. This work describes two well documented examples of RNA aptamers with antiviral activity against highly conserved structural domains of the HIV-1 and HCV RNA genome, respectively, performed in our laboratory.

Early data revealed a decrease in presentation and an increase in pre-hospital delay for acute stroke and AMI during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Thus, we set out to understand community members' perception of seeking acute stroke and AMI care during the COVID-19 pandemic to inform strategies to increase cardiovascular disease preparedness during the pandemic. METHODS: Given the urgency of the clinical and public health situation, through a community-based participatory research partnership, we utilized a rapid assessment approach. We developed an interview guide and data collection form guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Semi-structured interviews were recorded and conducted via phone and data was collected on structured collection forms and real time transcription. Direct content analysis was conducted guided by the TPB model and responses for AMI and stroke were compared. RESULTS: We performed 15 semi-structured interviews. Eighty percent of participants were Black Americans; median age was 50; 73% were women. Participants reported concerns about coronavirus transmission in the ambulance and at the hospital, hospital capacity and ability to triage, and quality of care. Change in employment and childcare also impacted participants reported control over seeking emergent cardiovascular care. Based on these findings, our community and academic team co-created online materials to address the community-identified barriers, which has reached over 8,600 users and engaged almost 600 users. CONCLUSIONS: We found that community members' attitudes and perceived behavioral control to seek emergent cardiovascular care were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Community-informed, health behavior theory-based public health messaging that address these constructs may decrease prehospital delay.","Robles, Maria Cielito; Corches, Casey L; Bradford, Morgan; Rice, Tia S; Sukul, Devraj; Springer, Mellanie V; Bailey, Sarah; Oliver, Alina; Skolarus, Lesli E",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,524,26

By screening 23 viral proteins, we find that SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, NSP3, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, ORF3, ORF6 and M protein inhibit Sendai virus-induced IFN-ß promoter activation, whereas NSP2 and S protein exert opposite effects. Further analyses suggest that ORF6 inhibits both type I IFN production and downstream signaling, and that the C-terminus region of ORF6 is critical for its antagonistic effect. Finally, we find that IFN-ß treatment effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication. In summary, our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 perturbs host innate immune response via both its structural and nonstructural proteins, and thus provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Lei, Xiaobo; Dong, Xiaojing; Ma, Ruiyi; Wang, Wenjing; Xiao, Xia; Tian, Zhongqin; Wang, Conghui; Wang, Ying; Li, Li; Ren, Lili; Guo, Fei; Zhao, Zhendong; Zhou, Zhuo; Xiang, Zichun; Wang, Jianwei",Nat Commun,524,16

The results indicated that fear of COVID-19 was negatively associated with SRH as well as marital satisfaction, and positively associated with psychological distress. In addition, psychological distress mediated the link between fear of COVID-19 and both SRH and marital satisfaction.

The European Commission has recently identified bauxite as a Critical Raw Material (CRM). In particular, unexploited bauxite residues have invited due attention owing to their abundance (worldwide generation at 120 – 150 million tons/yr) and presence of REEs (0.5 - 1.7 kg/ton) and scandium (Sc) in particular, with Fe: 14–45%, Al: 5–14%, Si: 1–9%, Na: 1–6% and Ti: 2–12%. Nevertheless, it has also to be taken into consideration that higher amassing of this waste is turning into a global concern due to its hazardous impacts and disposal issues owing to its high alkalinity, fine particle size and metal content. Industrial valorization of REEs from stockpiled bauxite residues could possibly unlock approximately a 4.3 trillion-dollar economy globally. This review foresees bauxite as a potential resource for REEs and identifies the problems associated with disposal of bauxite residues. Considering the recycling potential of bauxite residues for supplying valuable metals for technology, biotechnology is seen as a promising alternative to the conventional methods. Comprehensive details including role and challenges of biotechnology in green recovery of REEs from bauxite residues, their scale-up and environmental issues are critically discussed. Furthermore, w.r.t. the bauxite residues, the REE market potential is presented with discussions into future prospects, following the current impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the demand and supply of REE to industrial sectors.","Panda, Sandeep Costa Rachel Biancalana Shah Syed Sikandar Mishra Srabani Bevilaqua Denise Akcil Ata","Resources, Conservation and Recycling",524,16

Some aspects of this therapy are still unknown, including the optimal timing of administration. OBJECTIVE: This observational study aimed to compare the 90-day mortality in two cohorts of patients when the drug was administered within the first 10 days from onset of symptoms or after day 11. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had received tocilizumab were divided into two groups according to when the medication was administered. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, clinical improvement on a 6-item scale by day 6, biomarker improvement by day 6, radiological image improvement by day 10 and SaO2 quotient by day 6. The results in the two groups were compared. Additionally, adverse events relating to tocilizumab were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were analysed. Both groups were epidemiologically comparable. The results obtained in the primary efficacy variable of the study (90-day mortality) showed a statistically significant difference in the subgroups according to the time of administration of tocilizumab (18.6% vs 5.0%, p=0.048). There was clinical improvement in 24.1% of patients at 6 days, with similar behaviour in both subgroups. No statistically significant differences were found in the percentage of patients who achieved radiological improvement at 10 days or in the other inflammatory parameters, with the exception of significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. Administration of tocilizumab was not associated with relevant adverse events. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of data regarding the timing of administration of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A strategy involving tocilizumab administration after 10 days from onset of symptoms may decrease mortality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this emerging hypothesis.","Moreno Diaz, Raquel; Amor García, Miguel Angel; Teigell Muñoz, Francisco Javier; Saldaña Perez, Leonardo Ernesto; Mateos Gonzalez, María; Melero Bermejo, Jose Antonio; López Hernández, Alberto; Reyes Marquez, Laura; De Guzman García-Monge, Maria Teresa; Perez Quero, Jose Luis; Homez Guzman, Marcela Patricia",,524,31

Each well-recorded case in homeopathic practice is important for deciding the future course of action. This study aims at identifying clinically useful homeopathic remedies and their prescribing symptoms using the prognostic factor research model. METHODS: This was an open-label, multi-centric, observational study performed from April 2020 to July 2020 at various public health care clinics. The data were collected prospectively from clinical practice at integrated COVID-19 care facilities in India. Good-quality cases were selected using a specific set of criteria. These cases were analyzed for elucidating prognostic factors by calculating the likelihood ratio (LR) of each frequently occurring symptom. The symptoms with high LR values (>1) were considered as prescribing indications of the specific remedy. RESULTS: Out of 327 COVID-19 cases reported, 211 met the selection criteria for analysis. The most common complaints were fatigue, sore throat, dry cough, myalgia, fever, dry mouth and throat, increased thirst, headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, and altered taste. Twenty-seven remedies were prescribed and four of them-Arsenicum album, Bryonia alba, Gelsemium sempervirens, and Pulsatilla nigricans-were the most frequently used. A high LR was obtained for certain symptoms, which enabled differentiation between the remedies for a given patient. CONCLUSION: Homeopathic medicines were associated with improvement in symptoms of COVID-19 cases. Characteristic symptoms of four frequently indicated remedies have been identified using prognostic factor research, findings that can contribute to accurate homeopathic prescribing during future controlled research in COVID-19.","Manchanda, Raj Kumar; Miglani, Anjali; Gupta, Meeta; Meena, Baljeet Singh; Chadha, Vishal; Joseph, Franco; Kalsi, Amrit; Konthembath, Pramod; Sharma, Kavita; Rama, Kamsali Nadigadda; Kaur, Prabhjeet; Thavarayil Kannoth, Jithesh; Nagrath, Cheshta; Jethani, Anju; Nellikka Aniyeri, Shajimol; Chawla, Anu; Ray, Malaya Kumar; Ghuliani, Manjula; Kudiyarasu, Ram Kumar; Naskar, Shruti; Bala, Sudha; Sharma, Brender",Homeopathy,524,24

While structural similarities between poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 could have major implications for the COVID-19 response worldwide, polio-induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have not been confirmed in prospective clinical trials. ObjectiveTo evaluate whether immune sera from adults who recently received inactivated poliovirus vaccination (IPV) can block SARS-CoV-2s ability to synthesize RNA. InterventionIPV intramuscular injection. MeasurementsPre-inoculation and 4-weeks post-inoculation sera were tested for anti-3Dpol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To assess IPVs ability to induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, immune-based detection assays tested RdRp enzymatic activity in polio-immune sera. Results298 of the 300 enrolled participants completed both on-site visits. Comparing pre-inoculation to 4-week samples, 85.2% of participants demonstrated an increase in anti-3Dpolantibodies against RdRp proteins. Among tested post-inoculation samples, 94.4% demonstrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Few inoculation-related side effects were reported (2.0%), all were minor. LimitationsParticipants were not systematically tested for COVID-19, though known exposures were reported and positive results (1.7%) were documented. ConclusionIPV can induce antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis, minimizing the risk of viral replication in infected individuals. This finding has practical implications for resource-deficient areas that may have limited access to newly developed COVID-19 vaccines and/or areas with low COVID-19 vaccination rates due to hesitancy.

Structural characterization techniques, such as X-ray crystallography (XRC) and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), previously identified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein conformations and their surface residues in contact with hACE2. However, recent quantum-biochemical calculations on the structurally related S-RBD of SARS-CoV-1 identified some contact-residue fragments as intrinsically attractive and others as repulsive. This indicates that not all surface residues are equally important for hACE2 attachment. Here, using similar quantum-biochemical methods, we report some four-residue fragments (i.e quartets) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD as intrinsically attractive towards hACE2 and, therefore, directly promoting host-virus non-covalent binding. Other fragments are found to be repulsive although involved in intermolecular recognition. By evaluation of their respective intermolecular interaction energies we found two hACE2 fragments that include contact residues (ASP30, LYS31, HIS34) and (ASP38, TYR41, GLN42), respectively, behaving as important SARS-CoV-2 attractors. LYS353 also promotes viral binding via several mechanisms including dispersion van der Waals forces. Similarly, among others, three SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD fragments that include residues (GLN498, THR500, ASN501), (GLU484, PHE486, ASN487) and (LYS417), respectively, were identified as hACE2 attractors. In addition, key hACE2 quartets identified as weakly-repulsive towards the S-RBD of SARS-CoV-1 were found strongly attractive towards SARS-CoV-2 explaining, in part, the stronger binding affinity of hACE2 towards the latter coronavirus. These findings may guide the development of synthetic antibodies or identify potential viral epitopes.","Rodriguez, Jorge H",Sci Rep,524,1

Although only a small percentage of urologists, sex therapists, social workers, psychiatrists, gynecologists, and urogynecologists currently use TM, many more practices are going to embrace this technology in the near future. This article will discuss the process for implementing TM in sexual medicine with minimal time, energy, effort, and expense. We will also examine compliance and legal issues associated with implementing TM in practice and how to code for TM services based on regulatory guidelines. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to improve the understanding of the concept and the trends of using TM to provide care for sexual medicine patients. METHODS: The study involves a literature review focussing on the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines including the relaxation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements. RESULTS: COVID-19 has changed the doctor-patient relationship especially in the area of sexual medicine. There are many patients with sexual medicine conditions that are amenable to the use of TM methods. CONCLUSION: Virtual visit utilizing audiovisual telecommunications is a very attractive approach for sexual medicine patients. Many patients with sexual medicine problems are no longer going to accept the antiquated method of healthcare involving making an appointment, visiting a brick-and-mortar facility, and the requirement of having a physical examination. The new normal will be communicating with patients by utilizing TM. Dooley AB, Houssaye N de la, Baum N. Use of Telemedicine for Sexual Medicine Patients.

The psychological impacts of the pandemic can increase the risk of somatic symptoms among individuals. As a signal of alertness and adaptive action prolonged somatic symptoms can affect overall psycho-physiological functions. When the symptoms continue with a decrease in individual immunity COVID-19 infection can become riskier. This study aims to examine the effect of using body awareness to reduce somatic symptoms through a short intervention in people in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic. Intervention was conducted online in accordance with the directives of the Indonesian government concerning social restrictions. This study used one group pretest-posttest design. Data were collected using somatic symptom scale (sss-8) which was adapted into Indonesian. There were 34 subjects fully participated in this intervention based on convenience sampling through online publication (voluntary participation). Using the paired sample t-test the results show that body awareness provides significant benefits in decreasing somatic symptoms.

Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano. METHODS: Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC > 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 < VC < 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC < 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship (R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index (R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation (R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified (R = - 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down. HYPOTHESIS AND DISCUSSION: The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology. The pilot study conducted during the lock-down period indicates an improvement of glucose control utilizing a remote glucose control system in the Milano Metropolitan Area, suggesting a wider utilization of similar methodologies during the present ""second wave"" lock-down.","Luzi, Livio; Carruba, Michele; Crialesi, Roberta; Da Empoli, Stefano; Dagani, Regina; Lovati, Elisabetta; Nicolucci, Antonio; Berra, Cesare C; Cipponeri, Elisa; Vaccaro, Ketty; Lenzi, Andrea",Acta diabetol,524,1

Current practices surrounding post-operative care involve admission and routine esophagogram prior to discharge. This study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of same-day discharge following POEM. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for patients who underwent POEM between November 2013 and June 2019 at a single institution in Ontario, Canada. Patients were discharged home on the same day with controlled pain, when tolerating clear fluids. Patients were admitted if clinically indicated. Esophagography was initially a systematic practice prior to discharge, but later only performed when clinically indicated. Emergency department visits and hospital admissions within 90 days were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 90 patients underwent a successful POEM procedure. A total of 72 patients (79.1%) were discharged on the same day, 14 patients (15.4%) were discharged home the following day, and 5 patients (5.5%) experienced longer admissions to hospital. One POEM was unsuccessful. 22 (24.2%) patients had adverse events, leading to 8 (8.8%) unplanned admissions, with one patient requiring prolonged admission for esophageal leak, identified clinically. Fifty-three patients underwent routine esophagography while part of our protocol, with no identified leak, which prompted our change in practice to only perform esophagography when clinically indicated. In the 90-day post-procedure, ten patients visited the emergency department, of which seven were re-admitted, five for POEM-related issues. Our mean Eckhardt score at 2 weeks was 2.1 from 7.2 preoperatively. CONCLUSION: This study establishes that same-day discharge is both safe and feasible following POEM and suggests that esophagography should be performed only when clinically indicated. This represents a shift from the routine practice of admission and imaging for patients undergoing POEM, encouraging the transition to outpatient POEM procedures.","Cloutier, Zacharie; Mann, Aneetinder; Doumouras, Aristithes G; Hong, Dennis",Surg. endosc,524,16

Total deaths were 10 (16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 8.63; p = 0.018), previous lung disease (OR, 27.47; p = 0.042), and glucocorticoids use (> 5 mg/day) (OR, 9.95; p = 0.019) were significantly associated to hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Neither specific RMD diagnoses or exposures to DMARDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalization. Being male, previous lung disease and exposure to glucocorticoids were associated with higher odds of hospitalization in RMDs patients.","Montero, Fernando; Martínez-Barrio, Julia; Serrano-Benavente, Belén; González, Teresa; Rivera, Javier; Molina Collada, Juan; Castrejón, Isabel; Álvaro-Gracia, Jose",Rheumatol Int,524,0

March 26, 2020), and 16 subjects evaluated post-implementation of social distancing (April 1-May22), were recorded for the following items: Year, Month, Date, Day of the Week All subjects in the post-implementation group reported that they were mostly staying home, and not participating in their typical social activities outside of the home The means of the two groups were compared across all orientation domains Result A t-test analysis reveals that following the social distancing mandate, subject performance on measures of orientation did significantly decline, overall The mean of the pre-social distancing group for the 4 orientation items was 3 7 The mean of the post-social distancing group for the 4 orientation items was 3 1 (t crit = 1 67 , t stat = 2 17 , p= 0 01) Responses significantly affected by post-social distancing were specific to Day and Date (Correct responses for Day: 87% pre-quarantine, 63% post-quarantine;correct responses for Date: 90% pre-quarantine, 69% post quarantine) Accurate Year and Month responses appeared to be consistent across both groups Conclusion Consistent with site-level concerns that social isolation subsequent to Covid-19 distancing guidelines could negatively impact orientation scores for subjects reporting mild memory concerns, the data collected and analyzed from January through May 2020 indicates a slight but significant decline in orientation scores post-quarantine Specifically, orientation to weekday and date appears to be most affected by the change in lifestyle and activities of daily living engaged in outside of the home","Voccia, Pamela Kruczek Katherine Kettren Joy",Alzheimer&#039;s &amp; Dementia,524,16

DESIGN: A single-centre retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A level 2 trauma centre in Breda, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with trauma seen at the ED between 11 March and 10 May 2020 (the first Dutch lockdown period) were included in this study. Comparable groups were generated for 2019 and 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the total number of patients with trauma admitted to the ED and the trauma mechanism. Secondary outcomes were triage categories, time of ED visit, trauma severity (Injury Severity Score (ISS) >12), anatomical region of injury and treatment. RESULTS: A total of 4674 patients were included in this study. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decrease of 32% in traumatic injuries at the ED (n=1182) compared with the previous years 2019 (n=1717) and 2018 (n=1775) (p<0.001). Sports-related injuries decreased most during the lockdown (n=164) compared with 2019 (n=386) and 2018 (n=367) (p<0.001). We observed more frequent injuries due to a fall from standing height (p<0.001) and work-related injuries (p<0.05). The mean age was significantly higher (mean 48 years vs 42 and 43 years). There was no difference in anatomical place of injury or ISS >12. The amount of patients admitted for emergency surgery was significantly higher (14.6% vs 9.4%; 8.6%, p<0.001). Seven patients (0.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Measures taken in the COVID-19 outbreak result in a predictable decrease in the total number of patients with trauma, especially sports-related trauma. Although the trauma burden on the emergency room appears to be lower, more people have been admitted for trauma surgery, possibly due to increased throughput in the operating theatres.","van Aert, Gijs J J; van der Laan, Lijckle; Boonman-de Winter, Leandra J M; Berende, Cornelis A S; de Groot, Hans G W; Boele van Hensbroek, Pieter; Schormans, Philip M J; Winkes, Michiel B; Vos, Dagmar I",BMJ Open,524,30

A quality improvement project was implemented to improve patient satisfaction of telephone consultations in our unit. METHODS: This was a prospective complete-cycle project. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were sent to patients following telephone consultations in ENT clinics. Based on a literature review and initial results, clinicians were encouraged to follow a structured consultation format. A second questionnaire survey was conducted following its implementation. RESULTS: One hundred patient questionnaires were collected during the survey (April and June 2020). There was significant improvement over the two surveys in terms of satisfaction scores (p = 0.026), along with a significantly increased preference for telephone consultations over face-to-face consultations (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: This study showed significant improvement in patient satisfaction and an increased telephone consultation preference through the use of a structured consultation model. The potential benefits in terms of infection control and impact on out-patient workload may see telephone consultations persist in the post-coronavirus era.","Zammit, M; Siau, R; Williams, C; Hussein, A",J Laryngol Otol,524,20

To manage the impact of COVID-19, the concepts of crisis management from different scholars are integrated, and crisis management is divided into three phases: the Pre-Crisis, Crisis, and Post-Crisis phases. This exploratory research employs stakeholder interviews to discover the impacts of COVID-19 on tourism businesses and attempts to develop guidelines for recovering tourism businesses within the service context. Our findings indicate that a strong brand and its proper management can help firms to survive during the crisis period. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of communication for engaging with all staff during the recovery period. This paper sheds light on how a brand is employed as a proactive strategy to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. Most brands have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and only strong brands are able to survive. Our study also adds to the limited empirical evidence on tourism business recovery during COVID-19 in the context of a developing country. From practitioners’ perspectives, trust, solid relationships, and honest communication with their business partners play an important role in survival after the crisis. Additionally, in this paper, corporate branding is conceived as a strategic tool that affects how staff and stakeholders can collaborate and unite in response to the crisis.","Pongsakornrungsilp, Siwarit Pongsakornrungsilp Pimlapas Kumar Vikas Maswongssa Bhuritt",Sustainability,524,16

This necessity motivated us to explore potential lead compounds based natural products targeting main protease (Mpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The Mpro enzyme plays a key role in mediating viral replication and transcription and thus being considered as an attractive drug target. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to identify new lead compounds against main protease enzyme. In this study, the candidate anthocyanin-derived compounds from PubChem database were filtered considering antiviral characteristics of anthocyanins. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening-based PHASE Screen Score. Docking based virtual screening work flow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide Gscore. The obtained hit compounds were filtered using ADMET pharmacological and physicochemical properties screening.

Appropriate countermeasures mean thoughtful and educated choice of viral targets (epitopes). There are several articles that discuss such choices in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, other focus on phylogenetic traits and history of the Coronaviridae genome/proteome. However none consider viral protein low complexity regions (LCRs). Recently we created the first methods that are able to compare such fragments. RESULTS: We show that five low complexity regions (LCRs) in three proteins (nsp3, S and N) encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are highly similar to regions from human proteome. As many as 21 predicted T-cell epitopes and 27 predicted B-cell epitopes overlap with the five SARS-CoV-2 LCRs similar to human proteins. Interestingly, replication proteins encoded in the central part of viral RNA are devoid of LCRs. CONCLUSIONS: Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 LCRs to human proteins may have implications on the ability of the virus to counteract immune defenses. The vaccine targeted LCRs may potentially be ineffective or alternatively lead to autoimmune diseases development. These findings are crucial to the process of selection of new epitopes for drugs or vaccines which should omit such regions.","Gruca, Aleksandra; Ziemska-Legiecka, Joanna; Jarnot, Patryk; Sarnowska, Elzbieta; Sarnowski, Tomasz J; Grynberg, Marcin",BMC Bioinformatics,524,25

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING: Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS: We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

When to initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and how to manage these patients on ECMO is not clear. Here, we present our experience with venovenous ECMO to support patients with COVID-19 and compare it to historic patients supported with VV-ECMO for other causes of respiratory failure. Methods: Patients admitted to our tertiary academic medical center in 2019 and 2020 who received VV ECMO support were included in this retrospective chart review. We examined patients with and without COVID-19 infection. We placed COVID-19 patients on ECMO who failed supportive care with mechanical ventilation using a high PEEP low tidal volume strategy, prone positioning, and neuromuscular blockade. Data analysis were done in Excel and Prism. Non-parametric data were compared with unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney tests. Results: ECMO was provided to 26 COVID-19 patients and 38 patients without COVID-19. Median (interquartile range) age of COVID-19 patients was 49.5 (40.5-56.25), compared with non-COVID-19 patients: 53.5 (30.5-60.25), p=0.28. COVID-19 patients had a significantly higher BMI: 32 (30.1-35.9) vs. 26.4 (23.6-29.4), p&lt;0.001. There were 27% female COVID-19 patients compared with 37% female non-COVID patients (p=0.43). COVID-19 patients had similar PaO2:FiO2 ratios as non-COVID patients on day of cannulation: 74 (69-112) vs 78 (60-205), p=0.65. COVID-19 patients had longer ventilator duration pre-cannulation (not including time spent intubated at outside hospitals prior to transfer to our center)-1.9 (1.4-7.0) days vs 0.7 (-.2-1.0) days, p&lt;0.001. COVID patients spent more days on ECMO compared with non-COVID patients: 20.7 (7.3-36.5) vs. 11.5 (3.8-26.8), p=0.14. Twelve (46%) of the COVID-19 ECMO patients died, compared with 9 (25%) of the non-COVID ECMO patients, p=0.10. Conclusions: In patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia induced ARDS who fail maximal supportive therapy with mechanical ventilation, outcomes are similar or worse than patients historically receiving VV ECMO support for respiratory failure. These findings highlight the need to determine the optimal timing of ECMO initiation and management in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Gao, C.; Manerikar, A.; Walter, J.

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Khan, Sharun; Tiwari, Ruchi; Sircar, Shubhankar; Bhat, Sudipta; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Singh, Karam Pal; Chaicumpa, Wanpen; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Clin. microbiol. rev,524,1

Here we aim to develop a theoretical model to study the detection process of SARS-COV-2 in lateral flow device (LFD), which can achieve rapid antigen diagnostic tests. The LFD is modeled as the adhesion of a spherical nanoparticle (NP) coated with ligands on the surface, mimicking the SARS-COV-2, on an infinite substrate distributed with receptors under a simple shear flow. The adhesive behaviors of NPs in the LFD are governed by the ligand receptor binding (LRB) and local hydrodynamics. Through energy balance analysis, three types of motion are predicted: (i) firm-adhesion (FA); (ii) adhesive-rolling (AR); and (iii) free-rolling (FR), which correspond to LRB-dominated, LRB-hydrodynamics-competed, and hydrodynamics-dominated regimes, respectively. The transitions of FA-to-AR and AR-to-FR are found to be triggered by overcoming LRB barrier and saturation of LRB torque, respectively. Most importantly, in the AR regime, the smaller NPs can move faster than their larger counterparts, induced by the LRB effect that depends on the radius [Formula: see text] of NPs. In addition, a scaling law is found in the AR regime that [Formula: see text] (rolling velocity [Formula: see text] and shear rate [Formula: see text]), with an approximate scaling factor [Formula: see text] identified through fitting both theoretical and numerical results. The scaling factor emerges from the energy-based stochastic LRB model, and is confirmed to be universal by examining selections of different LRB model parameters. This size-dependent rolling behavior under the control of flow strength may provide the theoretical guidance for designing efficient LFD in detecting infectious disease.","Ye, Huilin; Shen, Zhiqiang; Li, Ying",Extreme Mech Lett,524,20

Dans une étude de cohorte rétrospective, nous avons précédemment distingué les facteurs associés au coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) et à la dengue de ceux associés à d’autres maladies fébriles (OFI). L’objectif de cette nouvelle analyse était de développer un score pour discriminer les deux infections à leur présentation. Méthodes Les facteurs associés aux deux infections ont été identifiés à l’aide de modèles de régression logistique multinomiale (OFI pris comme sujets contrôles) parmi tous les sujets suspects de la COVID-19 ayant fréquenté le centre de dépistage du coronavirus de type 2 (SRAS-CoV-2) de l’hôpital universitaire de Saint-Pierre, île de La Réunion, entre le 23 mars et 10 mai 2020. Deux scores COVIDENGUE ont été développés et validés en interne par bootstrapping pour prédire chaque infection après pondération des odd ratios selon une règle prédéfinie. Le pouvoir discriminant de chaque score a été évalué à l’aide des aires sous la courbe ROC (« receiver operating characteristic curve »). Leur calibration a été évaluée à l’aide du test d’adéquation modifié d’Hosmer–Lemeshow pour les variables dépendantes polytomiques. Résultats Sur les deux mois de la période d’étude, 80 cas de COVID-19, 60 cas de dengue non sévères et 872 cas d’OFI ont été diagnostiqués. Les scores COVIDENGUE étaient composés de 11 critères : contact avec un cas positif de COVID-19 (+3 points pour COVID-19 ; 0 point pour la dengue), retour de voyage à l’étranger dans les 15 jours précédents (+3 ; −1), antécédents de dengue (+1 ; +3), tabagisme actif (−3 ; 0), courbatures (0 ; +5), toux (0 ; −2), symptômes d’infection des voies respiratoires supérieures (−1 ; −1), anosmie (+7 ; −1), maux de tête (0 ; +5), douleur rétro-orbitaire (−1 ; +5) et présentation tardive (>3 jours) à l’hôpital (+1 ; 0). L’aire sous la courbe ROC était de 0,79 (IC95 % : 0,76–0,82) pour la COVID-19 et de 0,88 (IC95 % : 0,85–0,90) pour la dengue. La calibration était satisfaisante pour les deux scores (valeurs de p du Chi2 du Goodness-of-Fit à 0,94 et 0,55, respectivement). Pour la COVID-19, la sensibilité était de 97 % au seuil de 0 point et la spécificité de 99 % au seuil de 10 points. Pour la dengue, la sensibilité était de 93 % au seuil de 2 points et la spécificité de 94 % au seuil de 10 points. Conclusion Les scores COVIDENGUE sont des outils discriminants pour distinguer la COVID-19 et la dengue des autres maladies fébriles dans le contexte d’une co-épidémie à l’île de La Réunion. D’autres études sont nécessaires pour valider ou affiner ces scores dans d’autres contextes épidémiques pour la COVID-19 (selon, par exemple, le niveau de circulation des nouveaux variants) ou d’endémie pour la dengue (selon, par exemple, les proportions de dengues primaires et de dengues secondaires), ces situations épidémiologiques pouvant modifier la présentation clinique de ces deux affections.","Levin, C.; Andry, F.; Bruneau, L.; Joubert, A.; Accot, F.; Maillard, O.; Bertolotti, A.; Gérardin, P.",Revue d'Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,524,21

Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume fast mixing of the population relative to the local infection rate, similar to the regime applicable to many chemical reactions. However, in human populations, especially under different levels of quarantine conditions, this assumption is likely to fail. We develop a continuous spatial model that includes five different populations, in which the infectious population is split into latent (or pre-symptomatic) and symptomatic. Based on nearest-neighbor infection kinetics, we arrive into a ``reaction-diffusion'' model. Our model accounts for front propagation of the infectious population domains under partial quarantine conditions, which is present on top of the common local infection process. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. Our results demonstrate how infected domains spread outward from epicenters/hotspots, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (quasi linear or power-law) growth. Moreover, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the center of the populated area. Predicted heat-maps show remarkable similarity to recently media released heat-maps. We further demonstrate how localized strong quarantine conditions can prevent the spreading of the disease from an epicenter/hotspot, significantly reducing the number of infected people. Application of our model in different countries, using actual demographic data and infectious disease parameters, can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localizes areas.","Tsori, Y.; Granek, R.",,524,1

However, further data are needed to interpret serum ferritin levels correctly in patients with ongoing inflammation. Our study aimed to assess serum iron and ferritin dynamics in patients with long intensive care unit (ICU) stay and the possible correlations with organ dysfunction progression and outcome. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study in a university hospital ICU over six months. All patients with an ICU length-of-stay of more than seven days were enrolled. Collected data included: demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, admission, weekly serum iron and ferritin levels, ICU length-of-stay and outcome. Interactions between organ dysfunction progression and serum iron and ferritin levels changes were investigated. Outcome predictive value of serum ferritin was assessed. Results: Seventy-two patients with a mean ICU length-of-stay of 15 (4.4) days were enrolled in the study. The average age of patients was 62 (16.8) years. There were no significant differences between survivors (39 patients, 54%) and nonsurvivors (33 patients, 46%) regarding demographics, serum iron and ferritin levels and SOFA score on ICU admission. Over time, serum iron levels remained normal or low, while serum ferritin levels statedly increased in all patients. Serum ferritin increase was higher in nonsurvivors than survivors. There was a significant positive correlation between SOFA score and serum ferritin (r = 0.7, 95% CI for r = 0.64 to 0.76, p < 0.01). The predictive outcome accuracy of serum ferritin was similar to the SOFA score. Conclusions: In patients with prolonged ICU stay, serum ferritin dynamics reflects organ dysfunction progression and parallels SOFA score in terms of outcome predictive accuracy.","Rusu, Daniel; Blaj, Mihaela; Ristescu, Irina; Patrascanu, Emilia; Gavril, Laura; Lungu, Olguța; Siriopol, Ianis; Buzincu, Iulian; Grigoraș, Ioana",Medicina (Kaunas),524,1

We aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an aerosolised adenovirus type-5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) in adults without COVID-19 from China. METHOD: This was a randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 1 trial done in Zhongnan Hospital (Wuhan, China), to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine by aerosol inhalation in adults (≥18 years) seronegative for SARS-CoV-2. Breastfeeding or pregnant women and people with major chronic illnesses or history of allergies were excluded. Participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) into five groups to be vaccinated via intramuscular injection, aerosol inhalation, or both. Randomisation was stratified by sex and age (18–55 years or ≥56 years) using computer-generated randomisation sequences (block sizes of five). Only laboratory staff were masked to group assignment. The participants in the two aerosol groups received an initial high dose (2 × 10(10) viral particles; HDmu group) or low dose (1 × 10(10) viral particles; LDmu group) of Ad5-nCoV vaccine on day 0, followed by a booster on day 28. The mixed vaccination group received an initial intramuscular (5 × 10(10) viral particles) vaccine on day 0, followed by an aerosolised booster (2 × 10(10) viral particles) vaccine on day 28 (MIX group). The intramuscular groups received one dose (5 × 10(10) viral particles; 1Dim group) or two doses (10 × 10(10) viral particles; 2Dim group) of Ad5-nCoV on day 0. The primary safety outcome was adverse events 7 days after each vaccination, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor IgG antibody and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody geometric mean titres at day 28 after last vaccination. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04552366. FINDINGS: Between Sept 28, 2020, and Sept 30, 2020, 230 individuals were screened for inclusion, of whom 130 (56%) participants were enrolled into the trial and randomly assigned into one of the five groups (26 participants per group). Within 7 days after vaccination, adverse events occurred in 18 (69%) in the HDmu group, 19 (73%) in the LDmu group, 19 (73%) in the MIX group, 19 (73%) in the 1Dim group, and 15 (58%) in the 2Dim group. The most common adverse events reported 7 days after the first or booster vaccine were fever (62 [48%] of 130 participants), fatigue (40 [31%] participants), and headache (46 [35%] participants). More adverse events were reported in participants who received intramuscular vaccination, including participants in the MIX group (49 [63%] of 78 participants), than those who received aerosol vaccine (13 [25%] of 52 participants) after the first vaccine vaccination. No serious adverse events were noted within 56 days after the first vaccine. At days 28 after last vaccination, geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody was 107 (95% CI 47–245) in the HDmu group, 105 (47–232) in the LDmu group, 396 (207–758) in the MIX group, 95 (61–147) in the 1Dim group, and 180 (113–288) in the 2Dim group. The geometric mean concentrations of receptor binding domain-binding IgG was 261 EU/mL (95% CI 121–563) in the HDmu group, 289 EU/mL (138–606) in the LDmu group, 2013 EU/mL (1180–3435) in the MIX group, 915 EU/mL (588–1423) in the 1Dim group, and 1190 EU/mL (776–1824) in the 2Dim group. INTERPRETATION: Aerosolised Ad5-nCoV is well tolerated, and two doses of aerosolised Ad5-nCoV elicited neutralising antibody responses, similar to one dose of intramuscular injection. An aerosolised booster vaccination at 28 days after first intramuscular injection induced strong IgG and neutralising antibody responses. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of aerosol vaccination should be evaluated in future studies.

Single intranasal inoculation of the adenoviral vector elicited a high level of H(C)50-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a in sera and IgA in mucosal secretions as early as 2 weeks after vaccination. The antigen-specific serum antibodies were maintained at a high level at least until the 27th week. Immune sera showed high potency in neutralizing BoNT/C as indicated by in vitro toxin neutralization assay. The mice receiving single dose of 2 × 10(7) p.f.u. (plaque-forming unit) of adenoviral vector were completely protected against challenge with up to 10(4) × MLD(50) of BoNT/C. The protective immunity showed vaccine dose dependence from 10(5) to 2 × 10(7) p.f.u. of adenoviral vector. In addition, animals receiving single intranasal dose of 2 × 10(7) p.f.u. adenoviral vector could be protected against 100 × MLD(50) 27 weeks after vaccination. Animals with preexisting immunity to adenovirus could also be vaccinated intranasally and protected against lethal challenge with BoNT/C. These results suggest that the adenoviral vector is a highly effective gene-based mucosal vaccine against botulism.","Xu, Q; Pichichero, M E; Simpson, L L; Elias, Md; Smith, L A; Zeng, M",Gene Ther,524,1

SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure. The high prevalence of COVID-19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention. Whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alternation of nucleotides and amino acid sequences. We evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software. We also selected seven types of structural proteins.

Tudor-SN protein is a ubiquitously expressed protein. Here, Tudor-SN protein was found to physiologically interact with G3BP, which is the marker and effector of SG. The kinetics of the assembly of SGs in the living cells demonstrated that Tudor-SN co-localizes with G3BP and is recruited to the same SGs in response to different stress stimuli. Knockdown of endogenous Tudor-SN did not inhibit the formation of SGs, but retarded the aggregation of small SGs into large SGs. Thus Tudor-SN may not be an initiator as essential as G3BP for the formation of SGs, but affects the aggregation of SGs. These findings identify Tudor-SN as a novel component of SGs.

To explore the feelings, stress factors, and adaptation strategies of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guayaquil, Ecuador. METHODS. A cross-sectional, descriptive quantitative study, conducted through the application of a 52-item questionnaire with four sections (feelings, perceived stress, stress-reducing factors, and adaptation strategies). The study population was 227 nursing professionals from “Hospital General del Guasmo Sur” of the Ministry of Public Health, who worked during the peak of the pandemic from March to May 2020. The sample comprised 155 nurses who voluntarily accepted to participate. The study received 127 complete questionnaires for analysis. RESULTS. The data showed the priority of humanist feelings and professional duty for these nurses, mostly young (59% under 35 years of age and with the professional exercise of three and fewer years), against the fear of contagion and the stress of strenuous work. They also revealed the great importance for them of the institutional support, recognition to the staff, and strict organization of safe care, like strategies for coping with this difficult experience. CONCLUSION. The COVID-19 pandemic represented for nurses from Guayaquil a great professional and emotional challenge.

However, various facets of diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus in calves in Ethiopia are inadequately understood. A cross-sectional study was conducted with the aim of isolation and molecular characterization of coronavirus and rotavirus from calves in the central part of Oromia (Bishoftu, Sebata, Holeta, and Addis Ababa), Ethiopia, from November 2018 to May 2019. The four study areas were purposively selected and faecal samples were collected by simple random sampling for diagnosis of coronavirus and rotavirus infection by using the antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA) kit. In addition, this study was carried out to have insight in prevalence and associated risk factors of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves. RESULT: During the study, 83 diarrheic and 162 nondiarrheic faecal samples collected from calves less than 4 weeks of age were screened for coronavirus and rotavirus. Of the 83 diarrheic samples, 1 sample (1.2%) was positive for coronavirus antigen and 6 samples (7.2%) were found to be positive for rotavirus antigen by Ag-ELISA. All the nondiarrheic samples were negative for both coronavirus and rotavirus Ag. The overall prevalence of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves was estimated at 0.4% (1/245) and 2.45% (6/245), respectively. All samples (7) of ELISA test positive of both coronavirus and rotavirus were propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. After 3 subsequent passages, progressive cytopathic effect (CPE), i.e., rounding, detachment, and the destruction of monolayer cell of five samples (1 sample of coronavirus and 4 samples of rotavirus) (71.4%) were observed. At the molecular stage, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine the presence of coronavirus and rotavirus nucleic acid by using specific primers. The 5 samples that were coronavirus and rotavirus antigen positive by ELISA and develop CPE on cell culture were also positive on RT-PCR technique. The prevalence of infection peaked at 1st and 2nd weeks of age in male calves. CONCLUSION: Diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus has a great health problem in calves that interrupts production benefits with reduced weight gain and increased mortality and its potential for zoonotic spread. So, the present findings show coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves in Ethiopia that needs to be addressed by practising early colostrum feeding in newborn calves, using vaccine, or improving livestock management.","Seid, Umer; Dawo, Fufa; Tesfaye, Asamino; Ahmednur, Munera",Vet Med Int,524,1

AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality: 0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes. CONCLUSION: High self-protection score was the main factor that prevented medical staff from contracting COVID-19 infection.

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined. Objectives: To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan. Methods: Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management. Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others.

Conclusions: In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations.

This paper presents a novel method for enhancing the throughput of the P-UE that operates with partial sensing in the mode-2 sidelink. The proposed technique employs an additional UE, denoted the roadside unit (RSU), to collect the sensing results from each P-UE that operates with partial sensing. The proposed RSU sequentially aligns all of the partial sensing windows, such that the combination of each partial sensing window can eventually provide an almost complete sensing result. In this study, extensive computer simulations were performed. The results reveal that the proposed method enhances the throughput of each P-UE operating with partial sensing almost to that of full sensing without increasing the required power consumption.","Kang, Seokwon; Choi, Seungwon",Sensors,524,24

Before matching, the risk of all outcomes including mortality (RR: 2.11, 95%CI: 1.90 to 2.34), hospitalization (RR: 1.60, 1.55 to 1.66), intensive care unit-ICU admission (RR: 1.86, 1.71 to 2.05), mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.62, 1.44 to 1.82), severe COVID-19 (RR: 1.89, 1.74 to 2.06), acute kidney injury (RR: 2.13, 1.99 to 2.29), kidney replacement therapy/hemodialysis (RR: 1.40, 1.03 to 1.89), acute respiratory distress syndrome-ARDS (RR: 1.76, 1.53 to 2.02), ischemic stroke (RR: 2.62, 2.24 to 3.07), venous thromboembolism-VTE (RR: 2.30, 2.07 to 2.56), and sepsis (RR: 1.97, 1.81 to 2.13) was higher in RA compared to non-RA. After matching, the risks did not differ in both cohorts except for VTE (RR: 1.18, 1.01 to 1.38) and sepsis (RR: 1.27, 1.12 to 1.43), which were higher in the RA cohort. Male sex, black race, and glucocorticoid use increased the risk of adverse outcomes. The risk of hospitalization was higher in rituximab or interleukin 6 inhibitors (IL-6i) users compared to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) users, with no significant difference between Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) or abatacept users and TNFi users. CONCLUSION: This large cohort study of RA-COVID-19 found that the risk of all outcomes was higher in the RA compared to the non-RA cohort before matching, with no difference in the majority of outcomes after matching, implying the risk being attributed to adjusted factors. However, the risk of VTE and sepsis was higher in RA cohort even after matching, indicating RA as an independent risk factor. Male sex, black race, and glucocorticoid use were associated with adverse outcomes in RA with COVID-19. Rituximab or IL-6i users were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization compared to TNFi users.","Raiker, Rahul; DeYoung, Charles; Pakhchanian, Haig; Ahmed, Sakir; Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Gupta, Latika; Kardeş, Sinan",Semin Arthritis Rheum,524,16

Methods and Results In May-July 2020, 11% (95% CI: 9.7-12.6) of serums were positive for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 N and S protein and 9.5% (CI:8.2-11.0) were pseudo-neutralizer. The prevalence of immunization was 11.6% (CI:10.2-13.2) considering positivity in at least one assays. In 5% (CI:3.9-7.1) of RT-qPCR positive individuals, no systemic IgGs were detected. Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia and ageusia occurred in 52% of the IgG-positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia-ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may reach 16.6%. In sera obtained 4-8 weeks after the first sampling anti-N and anti-S IgG titers and pseudo-neutralization activity declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, respectively with half-life of 35, 87 and 28 days, respectively. Conclusions The population studied being not particularly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection is representative of active workers in the Paris conurbation, suggesting that the current epidemiological models may underestimate the true prevalence of infection. The short lifespan of the serological systemic responses hinders retrospective assessment of the epidemic extent.","Anna, F.; Goyard, S.; Lalanne, A.

While some countries adopted measures, which have been perceived controversial, others pursued a strategy aiming for herd immunity. The latter is even more controversial and has been called unethical by the WHO Director-General. Inevitably, without proper control measures, viral diversity increases and multiple infectious exposures become common, when the pandemic reaches its maximum. This harbors not only a potential threat overseen by simplified theoretical arguments in support of herd immunity, but also deserves attention when assessing response measures to increasing numbers of infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We extend the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness web interface CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to study the hypothetical effect of increased morbidity and mortality due to ‘multi-infections’, either acquired at by successive infective contacts during the course of one infection or by a single infective contact with a multi-infected individual. The simulations are adjusted to reflect roughly the situation in the USA. We assume a phase of general contact reduction (“lockdown”) at the beginning of the epidemic and additional case-isolation measures. We study the hypothetical effects of varying enhancements in morbidity and mortality, different likelihoods of multi-infected individuals to spread multi-infections and different susceptibility to multi-infections in different disease phases. It is demonstrated that multi-infections lead to a slight reduction in the number of infections, as these are more likely to get isolated due to their higher morbidity. However, the latter substantially increases the number of deaths. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a potential second lockdown can substantially decrease the epidemic peak, the number of multi-infections and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced morbidity and mortality due to multiple disease exposure is a potential threat in the COVID-19 pandemic that deserves more attention. Particularly it underlines another facet questioning disease management strategies aiming for herd immunity.","Helle, Kristina Barbara; Sadiku, Arlinda; Zelleke, Girma Mesfin; Ibrahim, Toheeb Babatunde; Bouba, Aliou; Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian; Appiah, Vincent; Ngwa, Gideon Akumah; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda Ijang; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,524,24

In this preregistered study, we replicated and extended previous inquiry examining educators’ views of (1) implementation of core components of their school’s Comprehensive, Integrated, Three-Tiered (Ci3T) model of prevention; and (2) preference for professional learning (content and avenue). Results indicated more than half of respondents indicated high levels of implementation of core features of Ci3T across Tiers 1, 2, and 3. Educators reported high levels of implementation for 10 out of 19 research-based educational practices used within tiered systems with a statistically significant relation between ratings of implemented practices and the desire for support with most practices. Respondents identified their top three areas for professional development needed in the coming year as behavior deescalation techniques, small-group social skills instruction, and strategies for supporting students with internalizing behavior patterns. For potential professional learning avenues, respondents’ top ratings were in-district, during-school workshops, course for college credit on-line, teacher collaboratives/networks, and one-to-one coaching or mentoring. There were many similarities among educators’ ratings across implementation year and state. Low levels of implementation across many core Ci3T and common educational practices were reported by educators working within the most experienced schools. We conclude with a discussion of implications, limitations, and future directions.

Survey data show that the overall prevalence of obesity is higher among women than men, yet in high-income developed countries, the prevalence of overweight is higher among men than women. The differential impact of different economic stages has prompted research in transition economies such as China. Using an instrumental variable approach based on a sample of 13,574 individuals from nine provinces in the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP), we find a 7% excess-weight premium in wages for overweight men and a 4.6% penalty for overweight women, compared to their healthy-weight peers. We also find an inverse u-shaped association between the body mass index (BMI) and logarithm of monthly income for men, with an implied optimum above the threshold of obesity, while women are better off the slimmer they are. The excess-weight premium in wages for Chinese urban men might be associated with entrenched business practices of excessive dining and drinking associated with senior positions. Policies aimed at reducing obesity in China must be adapted to its unique sociocultural context in order to have gender-differentiated effects.","Dou, Jiangli; Du, Limin; Wang, Ken; Sun, Hailin; Zhang, Chenggang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,524,27

In an effort to characterize molecular components of the virus that are absent in other coronaviruses, all of which are considerably less pathogenic for humans, we recombinantly produced the SARS-unique domain (SUD) within non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) of SARS-CoV and characterized its nucleic-acid binding properties. Zone-interference gel electrophoresis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a specific affinity of SUD for oligo(G)-strings. A few such segments are present in the SARS-CoV genome, but also in mRNAs of host proteins involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. A putative role of SUD in virus-induced apoptosis or survival of host cells is discussed.","Tan, Jinzhi; Kusov, Yuri; Mutschall, Doris; Tech, Stefanie; Nagarajan, Krishna; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Schmidt, Christian L.",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,524,14

Accordingly, IBD arises as a result of inappropriate immune response to intestinal commensal organisms among genetically susceptible individuals. Performing colonoscopy and histopathologic evaluation on an inflamed bowel biopsy specimen are currently considered as gold standards for diagnosis and management of IBD.Correspondingly, these techniques are known to be invasive and costly. In recent decades, fecal calprotectin, as a biomarker, has received much attention for the diagnosis and non-invasive management of IBD.Up to now, many studies have investigated the efficacy of fecal calprotectin in the areas of IBD differentiation from IBS, prediction of endoscopic and histologic activities of IBD and prediction of disease recurrence. Although some of these studies have reported promising results, some others have shown significant limitations. Therefore, in this paper, we reviewed the most interesting ones of these studies after a brief discussion of the laboratory measurement of fecal calprotectin. Moreover, we attempted to provide an answer for the question of whether fecal-calprotectin could be considered as a potential surrogate marker for colonoscopy.","Khaki-Khatibi, Fatemeh; Qujeq, Durdi; Kashifard, Mehrdad; Moein, Soheila; Maniati, Mahmood; Vaghari-Tabari, Mostafa",Clin Chim Acta,524,2

Beyond the clinical scope of SRH, we should not neglect the impacts at the health system level and disruptions or interruptions in regular provision of SRH services, such as pre- and postnatal checks, safe abortion, contraception, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. Furthermore, other aspects merit attention such as the potential increase of gender-based violence and domestic abuse, and effects of stigma and discrimination associated with COVID-19 and their effects on SRH clients and health care providers.

In this study we critically examine the basis for that hope, using an epidemiological modeling framework to establish the link between vaccine characteristics and effectiveness in bringing an end to this unprecedented public health crisis. Our findings suggest that a return to pre-pandemic social and economic conditions without fully suppressing SARS-CoV-2 will lead to extensive viral spread, resulting in a high disease burden even in the presence of vaccines that reduce risk of infection and mortality. Our modeling points to the feasibility of complete SARS-CoV-2 suppression with high population-level compliance and vaccines that are highly effective at reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, vaccine-mediated reduction of transmission is critical for viral suppression, and in order for partially-effective vaccines to play a positive role in SARS-CoV-2 suppression, complementary biomedical interventions and public health measures must be deployed simultaneously.","Stoddard, Madison; Sarkar, Sharanya; Yuan, Lin; Nolan, Ryan P.; White, Douglas E.; White, Laura F.; Hochberg, Natasha S.; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,524,12

We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of PXL770, a novel direct AMPK activator, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS STAMP-NAFLD, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study, was done across 15 US clinical sites. Patients aged 18-75 years with liver fat content of at least 10% at baseline when assessed by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), via an interactive web response system, to receive oral PXL770 250 mg once daily, 250 mg twice daily, or 500 mg once daily, or matched placebo. Patients were stratified according to type 2 diabetes status and study site. The primary endpoint was relative change in liver fat content from baseline compared with placebo at week 12, assessed by MRI-PDFF. The primary endpoint was analysed in an ANCOVA model with treatment and stratification criteria as factors and baseline liver fat content as a covariate in the modified intention-to-treat population, defined as all as-randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Safety was analysed in the safety population, defined as all as-treated patients receiving at least one dose of the study treatment. The trial has been completed and the final results are reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03763877. FINDINGS Between March 29, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 387 patients were screened, of whom 120 were included in the modified intention-to-treat and safety analyses (30 in the 250 mg once daily group, 30 in the 250 mg twice daily group, 29 in the 500 mg once daily group, and 31 in the placebo group). The mean relative change from baseline in liver fat content at week 12 was -1·1% in the placebo group, -1·0% in the 250 mg once daily group (mean difference versus placebo 0·1% [95% CI -15·4 to 15·7], p=0·99), -14·3% in the 250 mg twice daily group (-13·1% [-28·1 to 1·8], p=0·084), and -14·7% in the 500 mg once daily group (-13·5% [-28·5 to 1·4], p=0·076). At least one treatment-emergent adverse event occurred in 23 (77%) of 30 patients in the 250 mg once daily group, 20 (67%) of 30 patients in the 250 mg twice daily group, 21 (72%) of 29 patients in the 500 mg once daily group, and 21 (68%) of 31 patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhoea (five [17%] of patients in the 250 mg once daily group, seven [23%] in the 250 mg twice daily group, six [21%] in the 500 mg once daily group, and none in the placebo group). No life-threatening events or treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION PXL770 treatment did not meet the primary outcome of liver fat improvement compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated. Given indications that metabolic features improved with PXL770 treatment, AMPK activation might be a promising pharmacological target for patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, and could also be considered for further assessment in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Severely ill COVID-19 patients exhibit the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, and such an unbalanced production of proinflammatory cytokines is linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our study provides evidence that the ORF3a, M, ORF7a, and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were NF-κB activators. The viral sequence from infected zoo lions belonged to clade V, and a single mutation of G251V is found for ORF3a gene compared to all other clades. No significant functional difference was found for clade V ORF3a, indicating the NF-κB activation is conserved among COVID-19 variants. Of the four viral proteins, the ORF7a protein induced the NF-κB dictated proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFNβ. The ORF7a protein also induced IL-3, IL-4, IL-7, IL-23. Of 15 different chemokines examined in the study, CCL11, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL25, CCL26, CCL27, and CXCL9 were significantly upregulated by ORF7. These cytokines and chemokines were frequently elevated in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Our data provide an insight into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates NF-κB signaling and inflammatory cytokine expressions.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the United States. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 3.2% (R(0) = 4) to 7.2% (R(0) = 2) reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, ranging from 1.9% to 18.3% of healthcare worker households and 5.7% to 8.8% reduction in fewer ICU beds at peak demand (R(0) = 2). We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p < 0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 71.1% to 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU bed demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible tradeoff between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","Chin, Elizabeth T; Huynh, Benjamin Q; Lo, Nathan C; Hastie, Trevor; Basu, Sanjay",medRxiv,524,16

The SAS scores (Mean ± SD) of group B were 58.87 ± 10.17, which was significantly higher than that of group A (52.59 ± 12.09, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in CES-D scores between the two groups (p = 0.981). The mean score of total PSQI in group B (8.41 ± 3.03) was statistically higher than that of group A (7.31 ± 3.74, p < 0.001). Additionally, the scores of sub-components of group B, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep disorder, sleeping medication use and daytime dysfunction, were significantly higher compared to Group A (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study showed greater anxiety, more severe depression and poorer sleep quality among medical staff in central south areas of China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, compared to the tertiary hospital group, medical staff from basic-level hospitals had poorer knowledge toward COVID-19 and worse mental health conditions. In addition, residence, specialty, title and education level may also be factors of knowledge of COVID-19 and psychiatry problems. In light of this information, more attention should be paid to early identification and intervention of symptoms of anxiety and depression in susceptible medical staff from the basic-level hospitals.","Yang, Haojun; Shi, Ruiying; Chi, Yunfang; Qiao, Zhihua; Wu, Yuanxia; Zhu, Ziqing; Xiao, Bo; Feng, Li; Wang, Hongxing",Front Psychiatry,524,1

To this end, we aimed to explore novel inhibitor compounds that can stop replication or decrease the viral load of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), for which there is currently no approved treatment. Besides using the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor as a main gate, the CoV-2 can bind to the glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78) receptor to get into the cells to start an infection. Here, we report potential inhibitors comprising small molecules and peptides that could interfere with the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and its target cells by blocking the recognition of the GRP78 cellular receptor by the viral Spike protein. These inhibitors were discovered through an approach of in silico screening of available databases of bioactive peptides and polyphenolic compounds and the analysis of their docking modes. This process led to the selection of 9 compounds with optimal binding affinities to the target sites. The peptides (satpdb18674, satpdb18446, satpdb12488, satpdb14438, and satpdb28899) act on regions III and IV of the viral Spike protein and on its binding sites in GRP78. However, 4 polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), homoeriodictyol, isorhamnetin, and curcumin interact, in addition to the Spike protein and its binding sites in GRP78, with the ATPase domain of GRP78. Our work demonstrates that there are at least 2 approaches to block the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by preventing its fusion with the host cells via GRP78.","Allam, Loubna; Ghrifi, Fatima; Mohammed, Hakmi; El Hafidi, Naima; El Jaoudi, Rachid; El Harti, Jaouad; Lmimouni, Badreddine; Belyamani, Lahcen; Ibrahimi, Azeddine",Bioinform Biol Insights,524,3

Our previous studies have demonstrated that TGEV infection induces the activation of p53 signaling pathway. In this study we investigated the effects of TGEV infection on the cell cycle of host cells and the roles of p53 activation in this process. The results showed that TGEV infection induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases in both asynchronous and synchronized PK-15 and ST cells, while UV-inactivated TGEV lost the ability of induction of cell cycle arrest. TGEV infection promoted p21 accumulation, down-regulated cell cycle-regulatory proteins cyclins B1, cdc2, cdk2 and PCNA. Further studies showed that inhibition of p53 signaling could attenuate the TGEV-induced S- and G2/M-phase arrest by reversing the expression of p21 and corresponding cyclin/cdk. In addition, TGEV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNA, and virus titer were higher in the cells released from S-phase- or G2/M phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G0/G1 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i. Taken together, our data suggested that TGEV infection induced S and G2/M phase arrest in host cells, which might provide a favorable condition for viral replication.","Ding, Li; Huang, Yong; Dai, Meiling; Zhao, Xiaomin; Du, Qian; Dong, Feng; Wang, Lili; Huo, RuiChao; Zhang, Wenlong; Xu, Xingang; Tong, Dewen",Virus Res,524,1

To contain the diffusion of infection, several Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data Synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behaviour while at home. Conclusions Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy Diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.","Mattioli, Anna Vittoria; Sciomer, Susanna; Cocchi, Camilla; Maffei, Silvia; Gallina, Sabina",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,524,1

In this study, the development of autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells in patients with SARS at different time periods (the first week: phase I, 1 month after the disease onset: phase II/phase III) were investigated. Antibodies in sera of patients and healthy controls against: (1) A549 human pulmonary epithelial cell‐line, (2) human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC), (3) primary human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPEC) were detected by cell‐based ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence staining. The results revealed that serum levels of IgG anti‐A549 cells antibodies, IgG anti‐HUVEC antibodies, and IgM anti‐HPEC antibodies were significantly higher in SARS patients at phase II/phase III than those in healthy controls. Sera from SARS patients at phase II/phase III could mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity against some A549 cells and HPEC. It is concluded that some autoantibodies against human epithelial cells and endothelial cells would be developed after SARS‐CoV infection and this phenomenon may indicate post‐infectious cellular injury and also induce SARS‐induced immunopathology.

His condition deteriorated with each passing day resulting in hospitalisation. He demanded oxygen and declared as severe COVID. With supportive treatment, he recovered after the 20th day of illness. Immunosuppression and anti-inflammation are likely to benefit when the immune response is dysregulated and turning into a cytokine storm.

Limited availability of kit components, buffers and even plastics has resulted in suboptimal testing procedures worldwide. Alternative workflows have been implemented to overcome these difficulties. Recently a liquid based sample prep has been launched as solution to overcome limitations in relation to nucleic acid extraction. OBJECTIVE: Multicenter evaluation of the QIAprep&amp Viral RNA UM kit (QIA P&A) for rapid sample preparation and real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to standardized laboratory testing methods. STUDY DESIGN: Selected samples of the routine diagnostic workflow at Clinical Microbiology Laboratories of four Dutch hospitals have been subjected to the rapid QIA P&A protocol and the results have been compared to routine diagnostic data. RESULTS: Combining results of manual and automated procedures, a total of 377 clinical samples of which 202 had been tested positive with a wide range of C(T) values, showed almost complete concordance in the QIA P&A assay for samples up to C(T) values of 33 with one exception of C(T) 31. Prospectively 60 samples were tested and also showed 100% concordance with 5 positives. The method has been automated by two centres. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an input of only 8 µl of clinical sample, the QIA P&A kit showed good performance for sample preparation and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 and can contribute as a rapid molecular testing strategy in managing the CoV-2 pandemic.","Claas, Eric C.J.; Smit, Pieter W.; van Bussel, Mario J.A.W.M.; Verbakel, Harold; Taouil, Mohammed; Verweij, Jaco J.; Thijsen, Steven F.T.",J Clin Virol,524,27

METHODS: Participants with COVID-19 discharged from five large Norwegian hospitals were consecutively invited to a multicentre, prospective cohort study. In total, 156 participants (mean age 56.2 years, 60 females) were examined with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) 3 months after discharge and compared to a reference population. Dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC). RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake (V̇O(2)) <80% of predicted was observed in 31% (n=49). Ventilatory efficiency was reduced in 15% (n=24), while breathing reserve <15% was observed in 16% (n=25). Oxygen pulse <80% of predicted was found in 18% (n=28). Dyspnea (mMRC ≥1) was reported by 38% (n=59). These participants had similar peak V̇O(2) (p=0.10), but lower mean peak (sd) V̇O(2)·kg(−1) % of predicted compared to participants without dyspnea (mMRC 0) (76 (16)% versus 89 (18)%, p =0.009) due to higher body mass index (p=0.03).

Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases in a community that are associated with a positive detection of the virus in wastewater. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank (n = 57) and biological activated sludge tank (n = 52) located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that depending on which nucleocapsid gene is targeted by means of RT-qPCR, a range of 253–409 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting RNA SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The frequency of detecting N1 and N2 gene in wastewater was also higher than that for N3 gene. Furthermore, nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2 were detected at lower frequency in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. In particular, N1 gene abundance was associated with water quality parameters such as total organic carbon and pH. In instances of positive detection, the average abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were reduced by 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments already occurring in the early stages of the wastewater treatment process.","Hong, Pei-Ying; Rachmadi, Andri Taruna; Mantilla-Calderon, David; Alkahtani, Mohsen; Bashawri, Yasir M.; Al Qarni, Hamed; O'Reilly, Kathleen M.; Zhou, Jianqiang",Environ Res,524,12

This study presents two go/no-go experiments investigating whether this response control operates in response selection processes and whether it is linked to conflict-monitoring mechanisms. In the first experiment, the participants performed responses with one hand, and in the second experiment, with two hands. In addition, both experiments consisted of two blocks with varying frequency of go conditions (25%-go vs. 75%-go). The non-target-related response inhibition effect was only observed in Experiment 2 when the task required selecting between two hands. Additionally, the results did not reveal patterns typically related to conflict monitoring when go-frequency is manipulated and when a stimulus–response compatibility effect is examined relative to congruency condition of the previous trial. The study shows that the non-target-related response inhibition assists hand selection and is relatively resistant to conflict-monitoring processes.

A novel hypothesis and decision-support tool based on Wastewater (on-site sanitation, municipal sewer systems), solid Waste, and raw/untreated and drinking Water-based epidemiology (WWW-BE) is proposed for understanding COVID-19 in LICs. The WWW-BE conceptual framework, including components and principles is presented. Evidence on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its proxies in wastewaters, solid materials/waste (papers, metals, fabric, plastics), and raw/untreated surface water, groundwater and drinking water is discussed. Taken together, wastewaters from municipal sewer and on-site sanitation systems, solid waste such as faecal sludge and COVID-19 PPE, raw/untreated surface water and groundwater, and drinking water systems in LICs act as reservoirs that receive and harbour SARS-CoV-2, and then transmit it to humans. Hence, WWW-BE could serve a dual function in estimating the prevalence and potential transmission of COVID-19. Several applications of WWW-BE as a hypothesis and decision support tool in LICs are discussed. WWW-BE aggregates data from various infected persons in a spatial unit, hence, putatively requires less resources (analytical kits, personnel) than individual diagnostic testing, making it an ideal decision-support tool for LICs.

In this study, we analyzed ACE2 changes in breast cancer and studied the correlation between ACE2 and the prognosis and further analyzed the relationship between immune infiltration and the prognosis of different breast cancer subtypes. Finally, we inferred the prognosis of breast cancer patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that ACE2 expression decreased significantly in breast cancer, except for basal-like subtype. Decreased ACE2 expression level was correlated with abnormal immune infiltration and poorer prognosis of luminal B breast cancer (RFS: HR 0.76, 95%CI=0.63-0.92, p=0.005; DMFS: HR 0.70, 95%CI=0.49-1.00, p=0.046). The expression of ACE2 was strongly positively correlated with the immune infiltration level of CD8(+) T cell (r=0.184, p<0.001), CD4(+) T cell (r=0.104, p=0.02) and neutrophils (r=0.101, p=0.02). ACE2 expression level in the luminal subtype was positively correlated with CD8A and CD8B markers in CD8+ T cells, and CEACAM3, S100A12 in neutrophils. In conclusion, breast tumor tissues might undergo a further decrease in the expression level of ACE2 after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could contribute to further deterioration of immune infiltration and worsen the prognosis of luminal B breast cancer after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Jiang, Yufeng; Chen, Ling; Shen, Jinsheng; Mei, Xiaofei; Yao, Jialu; Chen, Tan; Zhou, Yafeng",Aging (Albany NY),524,16

We therefore aimed to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Munich general population after the first wave of the pandemic. For this purpose, we drew a representative sample of 2994 private households and invited household members 14 years and older to complete questionnaires and to provide blood samples. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was defined as Roche N pan-Ig ≥ 0.4218. We adjusted the prevalence for the sampling design, sensitivity, and specificity. We investigated risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and geospatial transmission patterns by generalized linear mixed models and permutation tests. Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was 1.82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28–2.37%) as compared to 0.46% PCR-positive cases officially registered in Munich.

Drawing insights from the current literature on business failure and the unfolding event of COVID-19, we highlight the paradoxes posed by novel exogenous shocks (that is, shocks that transcend past experiences) and the implications for SMEs. The pandemic has accelerated the reconfiguration of the relationship between states and markets, increasing the divide between those with political connections and those without, and it may pose new legitimacy challenges for some players even as others seem less concerned by such matters, whilst experiential knowledge resources may be both an advantage and a burden.","Amankwah-Amoah, Joseph; Khan, Zaheer; Wood, Geoffrey",,524,1

Lead intoxication was confirmed (blood lead value of 102 µg/dL). The patient assumed Ayurvedic medicines in the previous months. Ayurveda is an ancient form of Indian traditional popular medicine aiming to re-establish health and body function through herbal preparations, heavy metals are often added. Our purpose was to treat the patient and to establish the source of poisoning. METHODS: After testing blood and urine lead concentration of other 3 crew members and analyzing over than 150 products used on the ship professional exposure was excluded. We analyzed the two Ayurvedic drugs assumed by the patient with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The patient underwent three chelation cycles with Calcium Disodium Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) while monitoring blood and urinary lead levels. RESULTS: The final blood lead level at discharge, after three chelation cycles, was 36.27 µg/dL. One of the two drugs contained extremely high concentrations of lead and mercury. The three different mixtures of this preparation showed lead concentrations of 12,638.54 mg/kg (Sample 2A), 23,043.02 mg/kg (Sample 2B), 21,352.97 mg/kg (Sample 2C); these levels are much higher than the highest values reported in literature for the indian soil (32 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: This case and similar cases raise the safety alert on complementary and alternative medicines; Ayurvedic medicine users should be carefully informed about potential risks and signs of poisoning.","Ciocan, Catalina; Mansour, Ihab; Beneduce, Alessandro; Corgiat Loia, Riccardo; Milanesio, Nicolò; Declementi, Michael; Godono, Alessandro; Garzaro, Giacomo; Pira, Enrico",Med Lav,524,16

In addition, we investigated whether sleep varied as a function of sociodemographic variables, in particular race. Long standing disparities in condition and available resources between racial demographics often lead to disparities in health. At the advent of a pandemic, which strains these systems further, it is important to assess whether or not racial disparities persist. This is important given that racial groups are likely affected by the pandemic, both directly and indirectly, in various ways. Here, we plan to at least assess whether there are any disparities with regard to sleep. METHODS: 4,048 adults (Mage = 45.8 years; 79% women) completed an online survey during April – June 2020. The final sample’s self-reported race/ethnicity consisted of 84% White, 5.1% Black, 3.4% LatinX, 4.2% Asian or Asian American, and 2.9% Multi-racial. Sleep disturbance was assessed using a retrospective sleep diary and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). RESULTS: Average sleep duration in the sample was 7.1 hours. Participants reported taking on average 32 minutes (SD = 38 mins) to fall asleep and reported waking up for 32 minutes (SD = 53 mins) during the night. Approximately 17% of the sample endorsed clinically elevated insomnia symptoms (based on the ISI ≥ 15 cut-off). With regard to racial differences, shorter total sleep time (TST), longer sleep latencies (SL), and greater total ISI scores were observed in Black (mean TST = 6.4 hours; SL = 37.7 minutes; ISI Total = 9.8) and LatinX (mean TST = 6.9 hours; SL = 37.1 minutes; ISI Total = 9.6) participants relative to White participants (Mean TST = 7.1 hours; SL = 30.9 minutes; ISI Total = 8.4). All p’s < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic variables, particularly race, should be considered when estimating the relative impact of sleep on overall health. These findings are significant as they may have implications for a number of health disparities observed in the United States, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Replication of RVs is restricted in a host species-specific manner, and this barrier is determined predominantly by the host interferon (IFN) signaling and the ability of different RV strains to successfully negate IFN activation and amplification pathways. In addition, viral attachment to the target intestinal epithelial cells also regulates host range restriction. Several studies have focused on the role of the innate immune response in regulating RV replication and pathogenesis. The knowledge accrued from these efforts is likely to result in rational attenuation of RV vaccines to closely match circulating (and host species-matched) virus strains. In this chapter, we review prevalent models of RV interactions with innate immune factors, viral strategies employed to regulate their function, and the implications of these findings for improved RV vaccine development.","Sen, Adrish; Ding, Siyuan; Greenberg, Harry B.",Mucosal Vaccines,524,1

Sample selection Paediatric referrals to the orthodontic and maxillofacial department at Alder Hey Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data analysis Photographic referrals were analysed using Microsoft Excel to determine treatment outcomes, including 'not to see', 'plan to see' and 'need to see'. Demographic information collected and analysed were patient age, gender, referral source and presenting complaint. Results In total, 220 photographic referrals were received, with swelling (30%) and dental trauma (27%) being the most common presenting complaints. Fifty-seven percent of the referrals were not seen, 23% were seen semi-urgently and 20% booked for outpatient review. Of those seen, seven children were examined elsewhere, with 44 receiving face-to-face consultations at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, with eight being admitted. Conclusions Photographic triage has potential to be a useful adjunctive assessment tool for new patient referrals, with secondary benefits for training junior staff and for populations who already find access to dental services challenging. Feasibility studies on the application should be seriously considered. However, the unique circumstances which resulted in the development of a photographic triage method need to be considered when generalising its use to normal working conditions.","Thomas, Nicole",Evid Based Dent,524,33

DESIGN AND METHODS: The data for this descriptive study were collected through social media platforms. The study included 464 parents who have children between the ages of 3 and 18, use social media, and are willing to participate in the study. The Parent and Child Descriptive Characteristics Form, Assessment Form for Pandemic Effects, and Form of Parent's Practices for Children during the Pandemic were used to collect the study data. RESULTS: It was determined that the screen time of the children increased and their physical activity decreased during the restrictions. Following the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the children's body weight increased by an average of 3.87 ± 2.28 kg, and according to parents, most of the children were more tense, stressed, and angrier. A statistically significant relationship was found between having had contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19 and compliance with regular, balanced nutrition and hygiene rules in children (p < 0.05), as well as between having been quarantined and compliance with hygiene rules in children (p < 0.05). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Despite the relatively low case and mortality rates in children, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant health problem for children. From the study, it was determined that the COVID-19 pandemic affects the physical and psychological health of children.","Ceylan, Sibel Serap; Erdoğan, Çiğdem; Turan, Türkan",J Pediatr Nurs,524,24

Furthermore, the last quarter century has seen an explosion of new questions and ideas, stimulated by developments in the computer and cognitive sciences. Competing ideas about probability are often driven by different intuitions about the nature of belief that arise from the needs of different domains (e.g., economics, management theory, engineering, medicine, the life sciences etc). Taking medicine as our focus we develop three lines of argument (historical, practical and cognitive) that suggest that traditional views of probability cannot accommodate all the competing demands and diverse constraints that arise in complex real-world domains. A model of uncertain reasoning based on a form of logical argumentation appears to unify many diverse ideas. The model has precursors in informal discussions of argumentation due to Toulmin, and the notion of logical probability advocated by Keynes, but recent developments in artificial intelligence and cognitive science suggest ways of resolving epistemological and technical issues that they could not address.","Fox, John",Journal of Applied Logic,524,24

It was originally based on combining practitioner communication skills with participatory methods to facilitate the involvement of animal caretakers and owners (embracing their knowledge, experience, and motivations) in the identification and assessment of animal disease problems, including in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of disease control programs, policies, and strategies. With the importance of understanding social perceptions and drivers receiving increasing recognition by epidemiologists, PE tools are being adapted for an increasingly wide range of settings and endeavors. More recently, PE tools have been adapted for use in food and nutrition security programs, One Health activities, wildlife disease surveillance and as part of mixed-methods research across a range of socio-economic settings. This review describes the evolution of PE (in relation to veterinary epidemiology and briefly in relation to public health epidemiology), the underpinning philosophy and principles essential to its effective application and the importance of gender-sensitive approaches and data triangulation, including conventional confirmatory testing. The article also provides illustrative examples highlighting the diversity of approaches and applications of PE, hallmarks of successful PE initiatives and the lessons we can learn when these are missing. Finally, we look forward, describing the particular utility of PE for dealing with emerging infectious diseases, gaining attention of field-level cross-sector officials who can escalate concerns to a higher level and for continuing to raise the voices of those less-heard (such as women, minority groups, and remote communities with limited exposure to formal education) in defining the problems and planning activities that will likely impact directly on their well-being and livelihoods.","Alders, Robyn G.; Ali, Syed Noman; Ameri, Aluma Araba; Bagnol, Brigitte; Cooper, Tarni L.; Gozali, Ahmad; Hidayat, M.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis. RESULTS: Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo‐chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo‐chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID‐19 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID‐19. Severity of COVID‐19 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups. Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo‐chilblain and vesicular).

Many oncology treatments are now calling on immunotherapy approaches, and scores of studies have investigated the role of p53 antibodies in cancer diagnosis and therapy. This review summarizes the current knowledge from the preliminary evidence that suggests a potential role of p53 as an antigen in the adaptive immune response and as a key monitor of the innate immune system, thereby speculating on the idea that mutant p53 antigens serve as a druggable targets in immunotherapy. Except in a few cases, the vast majority of published work on p53 antibodies in cancer patients use wild-type p53 as the antigen to detect these antibodies and it is unclear whether they can recognize p53 mutants carried by cancer patients at all. We envision that an antibody targeting a specific mutant p53 will be effective therapeutically against a cancer carrying the exact same mutant p53. To corroborate such a possibility, a recent study showed that a T cell receptor-like (TCLR) antibody, initially made for a wild-type antigen, was capable of discriminating between mutant p53 and wild-type p53, specifically killing more cancer cells expressing mutant p53 than wild-type p53 in vitro and inhibiting the tumour growth of mice injected with mutant p53 cancer cells than mice with wild-type p53 cancer cells. Thus, novel antibodies targeting mutant p53, but not the wild-type isoform, should be pursued in preclinical and clinical studies.","Sobhani, Navid; D’Angelo, Alberto; Wang, Xu; Young, Ken H.; Generali, Daniele; Li, Yong",Int J Mol Sci,524,33

The main reason for the massive effect of COVID-19 on society is its unpredictable spread, which does not allow for proper planning or management of this disease. Antibiotics, antivirals, and other prescription drugs, necessary and used in therapy, obviously have side effects (minor or significant) on the affected person, there are still not clear enough studies to elucidate their combined effect in this specific treatment, and existing protocols are sometimes unclear and uncertain. In contrast, it has been found that nutraceuticals, supplements, and various herbs can be effective in reducing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. However, not enough specific details are yet available, and precise scientific studies to validate the approved benefits of natural food additives, probiotics, herbs, and nutraceuticals will need to be standardized according to current regulations.

It is primarily associated with the clinical syndromes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. hMPV may predispose to bacterial pneumonia; coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus may lead to increased severity of clinical disease, and complications include asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Given its high prevalence and potential clinical implications as these patients present to the Emergency Department with initial infection or subsequent complications, a better understanding of hMPV will aid in their care. We report the case of a 13-month old who developed lobar pneumonia 3 weeks after being diagnosed with hMPV. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, and treatment of hMPV are then discussed.","Mazzoncini, Joseph P.; Crowell, Christopher B.; Kang, Christopher S.",J Emerg Med,524,1

Although there is considerable excitement about its potential, there are also substantial concerns about the negative impacts of these technologies. Since screening and diagnostic AI tools now have the potential to fundamentally change the healthcare landscape, it is important to understand how these tools are being represented to the public via the media. METHODS: Using a framing theory approach, we analysed how screening and diagnostic AI was represented in the media and the frequency with which media articles addressed the benefits and the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSIs) of screening and diagnostic AI. RESULTS: All the media articles coded (n = 136) fit into at least one of three frames: social progress (n = 131), economic development (n = 59), and alternative perspectives (n = 9). Most of the articles were positively framed, with 135 of the articles discussing benefits of screening and diagnostic AI, and only 9 articles discussing the ethical, legal, and social implications. CONCLUSIONS: We found that media reporting of screening and diagnostic AI predominantly framed the technology as a source of social progress and economic development. Screening and diagnostic AI may be represented more positively in the mass media than AI in general. This represents an opportunity for health journalists to provide publics with deeper analysis of the ethical, legal, and social implications of screening and diagnostic AI, and to do so now before these technologies become firmly embedded in everyday healthcare delivery.","Frost, Emma K.; Carter, Stacy M.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,524,5

Burgeoning evidence suggests that loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic is tied to high levels of depression and anxiety. The current study is unique, though, in examining which facets of social behavior and perceived social quality are most tied to internalizing symptoms using longitudinal data, including a pre-pandemic baseline, collected from a community sample of adults with pre-existing mental health concerns (analyzed n = 144). Methods. Participants completed measures of depressive and anxious symptoms pre-pandemic, followed by three weekly surveys during the pandemic. We distinguished four social variables: in-person social engagement, remote social engagement, social disruption, and social distress. OLS and mixed-effects regression models examined 1) pre-pandemic baseline symptoms as predictors of social functioning during the pandemic and 2) time-lagged associations between symptoms and social functioning during the pandemic. Results. Social behavior and social perceptions were dissociable. Baseline depressive, but not anxious, symptoms predicted greater social distress during the pandemic. Both anxious and depressive symptoms were predicted by social variables, but the specific associations differed: depressive symptoms were related to perceived social quality, whereas anxious symptoms were more tied to reported social behavior. Limitations. We relied on self-report indices, and causality should not be inferred directly from these correlational data. Conclusions. Overall, our results indicate that it is possible to follow social guidelines and even to spend relatively few hours socializing with close others, while still feeling connected and rewarded; however, people who struggle with depression and anhedonia were particularly vulnerable to distressing feelings of social disconnection amid the pandemic.","Swerdlow, Benjamin A.; Johnson, Sheri L.; Timpano, Kiara R.; Porter, Patricia A.; Dev, Amelia",J Affect Disord,524,30

We evaluated the analytical sensitivity and clinical performance of three sample-to-answer molecular-diagnostics systems for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using 325 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples from symptomatic patients. METHODS: The BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1), cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A/B, and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV platforms, which have been granted emergency-use authorization by the US FDA, were tested and compared. RESULTS: The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and overall percent agreement among the three point of care testing systems were 98–100%, including for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (non-B.1.1.7) and a variant of concern (B.1.1.7). Notably, the BioFire RP2.1 may fail to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S gene in the B.1.1.7 lineage because of the spike protein mutation. CONCLUSION: All three point of care testing platforms provided highly sensitive, robust, and almost accurate results for rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2.

The most critical problem is to detect malware-infected apps and keep them out of Google play store. The vulnerability lies in the underlying permission model of Android apps. Consequently, it has become the responsibility of the app developers to precisely specify the permissions which are going to be demanded by the apps during their installation and execution time. In this study, we examine the permission-induced risk which begins by giving unnecessary permissions to these Android apps. The experimental work done in this research paper includes the development of an effective malware detection system which helps to determine and investigate the detective influence of numerous well-known and broadly used set of features for malware detection. To select best features from our collected features data set we implement ten distinct feature selection approaches. Further, we developed the malware detection model by utilizing LSSVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) learning approach connected through three distinct kernel functions i.e., linear, radial basis and polynomial. Experiments were performed by using 2,00,000 distinct Android apps. Empirical result reveals that the model build by utilizing LSSVM with RBF (i.e., radial basis kernel function) named as FSdroid is able to detect 98.8% of malware when compared to distinct anti-virus scanners and also achieved 3% higher detection rate when compared to different frameworks or approaches proposed in the literature.","Mahindru, Arvind; Sangal, A.L.",Multimed Tools Appl,524,10

The illegal trade in parrots and cockatoos poses a serious threat to the viability of native populations; in addition, species transported to non-endemic areas may potentially vector disease and genetically ‘pollute’ local native avifauna. To reduce the logistical difficulties associated with trafficking live birds, smugglers often transport eggs. This creates a problem for authorities in elucidating accurate species identification without the laborious task of incubation and hand rearing until a morphological identification can be made. Here, we use 99 avian eggs seized from carriers coming into and within Australia, as a result of suspected illegal trade. We investigate and evaluate the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accurately identify eggs to family, genus or species level. However, Identification of a species based on percentage mtDNA similarities is difficult without good representations of the inter- and intra-levels of species variation. Based on the available reference database, we were able to identify 52% of the eggs to species level. Of those, 10 species from eight genera were detected, all of which belong to the parrot (Psittacidae) and cockatoo (Cacatuidae) families. Of the remaining 48%, a further 36% of eggs were identified to genus level, and 12% identified to family level using our assignment criteria. Clearly the lack of validated DNA reference sequences is hindering our ability to accurately assign a species identity, and accordingly, we advocate that more attention needs to be paid to establishing validated, multi locus mtDNA reference databases for exotic birds that can both assist in genetic identifications and withstand legal scrutiny.","Coghlan, Megan L.; White, Nicole E.; Parkinson, Liza; Haile, James; Spencer, Peter B.S.; Bunce, Michael",Forensic Sci Int Genet,524,21

Ace2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the gene encoding the host protein to which SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind, is expressed in the gut and therefore may be a target for preventing or reducing severity of COVID-19. Here we test the hypothesis that Ace2 expression in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts is modulated by the microbiome. We used quantitative PCR to profile Ace2 expression in germ-free mice, conventional raised specific pathogen-free mice, and gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota. Intestinal Ace2 expression levels were significantly higher in germ-free mice compared to conventional mice. A similar trend was observed in the respiratory tract. Intriguingly, microbiota depletion via antibiotics partially recapitulated the germ-free phenotype, suggesting potential for microbiome-mediated regulation of Ace2 expression. Variability in intestinal Ace2 expression was observed in gnotobiotic mice colonized with different microbiota, partially attributable to differences in microbiome-encoded proteases and peptidases. Together, these data suggest that the microbiome may be one modifiable factor determining COVID-19 infection risk and disease severity.","Koester, Sean T.; Li, Naisi; Lachance, Daniel M.; Morella, Norma M.; Dey, Neelendu",PLoS One,524,26

Here we investigated in more detail the origin of the major and most widely disseminated SARS-CoV-2 Brazilian lineage B.1.1.33. We recovered 190 whole viral genomes collected from 13 Brazilian states from February 29 to April 31, 2020 and combined them with other B.1.1 genomes collected globally. Our genomic survey confirms that lineage B.1.1.33 is responsible for a variable fraction of the community viral transmissions in Brazilian states, ranging from 2% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Pernambuco to 80% of those from Rio de Janeiro. We detected a moderate prevalence (5–18%) of lineage B.1.1.33 in some South American countries and a very low prevalence (<1%) in North America, Europe, and Oceania. Our study reveals that lineage B.1.1.33 evolved from an ancestral clade, here designated B.1.1.33-like, that carries one of the two B.1.1.33 synapomorphic mutations. The B.1.1.33-like lineage may have been introduced from Europe or arose in Brazil in early February 2020 and a few weeks later gave origin to the lineage B.1.1.33. These SARS-CoV-2 lineages probably circulated during February 2020 and reached all Brazilian regions and multiple countries around the world by mid-March, before the implementation of air travel restrictions in Brazil. Our phylodynamic analysis also indicates that public health interventions were partially effective to control the expansion of lineage B.1.1.33 in Rio de Janeiro because its median effective reproductive number (R(e)) was drastically reduced by about 66% during March 2020, but failed to bring it to below one. Continuous genomic surveillance of lineage B.1.1.33 might provide valuable information about epidemic dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions in some Brazilian states.","Resende, Paola Cristina; Delatorre, Edson; Gräf, Tiago; Mir, Daiana; Motta, Fernando Couto; Appolinario, Luciana Reis; da Paixão, Anna Carolina Dias; Mendonça, Ana Carolina da Fonseca; Ogrzewalska, Maria; Caetano, Braulia; Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Docena, Cássia; dos Santos, Mirleide Cordeiro; de Almeida Ferreira, Jessylene; Sousa Junior, Edivaldo Costa; da Silva, Sandro Patroca; Fernandes, Sandra Bianchini; Vianna, Lucas Alves; Souza, Larissa da Costa; Ferro, Jean F.

Here, we performed longitudinal single-cell transcriptome sequencing and T cell/B cell receptor sequencing on 3 healthy donors and 10 COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic, moderate, and severe conditions. We found asymptomatic patients displayed distinct innate immune responses, including increased CD56briCD16− NK subset, which was nearly missing in severe condition and enrichment of a new Th2-like cell type/state expressing a ciliated cell marker. Unlike that in moderate condition, asymptomatic patients lacked clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells but had a robust effector CD4+ T cell clonal expansion, coincide with previously detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in unexposed individuals. Moreover, NK and effector T cells in asymptomatic patients have upregulated cytokine related genes, such as IFNG and XCL2.

Long‐distance transects were established across the middle‐west region of Madagascar, over which S. asiatica abundance in fields was estimated. Analysis of the data highlights the importance of crop variety and legumes in driving Striga density. Moreover, the dataset revealed significant effect of precipitation seasonality, mean temperature, and altitude in determining abundance. A composite management index indicated the effect of a range of cultural practices on changes in Striga abundance.

As is already known, nationalism is an ideology that features both negative feelings toward outgroups and beliefs about native superiority or privileges. Evidence from previous studies suggests that disgust is related to nationalism’s several components but lacks direct research on nationalism and disgust. The current study examines the relationship between disgust and nationalism in China at both individual and regional levels.

Design and Methods: This cross-sectional survey study, conducted in Saudi Arabia, enrolled interns from diverse healthcarerelated fields. The questionnaire was divided into three sections: sociodemographic data, knowledge of COVID-19, and attitude toward hand hygiene. The data was expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). Results: In all, 371 responses were analyzed. The median knowledge score was 20, which was considered good. There were no statistically significant differences across age, hospital setting, or gender. Of the 254 respondents who had attended an educational session, 167 (65%) had a good knowledge score and 83 (33%) had a moderate score, compared with only four (2%) who had a poor score. The cumulative median score of the respondents’ attitudes was 6 (IQR [2]), which reflects a suboptimal attitude - only 38 (22%) reported a good attitude. The predicted effect of knowledge on attitude (good/suboptimal) was statistically significant (p=0.02) using univariate logistic regression.

Although novel ligands have been identified by these methods, it has become clear that screening hit lists are plagued by false positives. These nuisance compounds are ultimately found to be developmental dead-ends and are abandoned, often after considerable effort has been invested in them. Much work over the last decade has been devoted to exploring the origins of false-positive screening hits, and ligand promiscuity has emerged as one such cause. Well-known mechanisms of promiscuity include reactive species and privileged substructures. More recently, it has been found that some nonspecific screening hits form aggregates of 30–1000 nm in diameter. It has been proposed that these aggregate particles are responsible for the promiscuous behavior of many false positives and that aggregate-forming compounds may be widespread among screening hits. This chapter will review the known mechanisms of ligand promiscuity with an emphasis on the recently described model of aggregation. Experimental and computational methods for identifying promiscuous compounds will be described, and some outstanding questions in the field will be considered.","McGovern, S.L.",Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry II,524,16

The context of COVID-19 epidemic and the related confinement could increase the rate of negative experience and mental disorders. The main objective is to compare, in immediate post partum, the maternal sense of control during childbirth between a group of women who gave birth during confinement (‘confinement’ group) versus a group of women who gave birth after confinement but in the context of epidemic (‘epidemic’ group) versus a group of control women (‘control’ group; excluding confinement and epidemic context). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a national multicentre prospective cohort study conducted in four French maternity units. We expect to include 927 women in a period of 16 months. Women will be recruited immediately in post partum during three different periods constituting the three groups: ‘confinement’; ‘epidemic’ and ‘control’ group.

We previously reported that the tightly regulated viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is degraded by the UPS in infected cells, a process that affects viral infectivity. Here, we show that the TYMV 98K replication protein can counteract this degradation process thanks to its proteinase domain. In-vitro assays revealed that the recombinant proteinase domain is a functional ovarian tumour (OTU)-like deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB), as is the 98K produced during viral infection. We also demonstrate that 98K mediates in-vivo deubiquitylation of TYMV RdRp protein—its binding partner within replication complexes—leading to its stabilization. Finally, we show that this DUB activity contributes to viral infectivity in plant cells. The identification of viral RdRp as a specific substrate of the viral DUB enzyme thus reveals the intricate interplay between ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and the interaction between viral proteins in controlling levels of RdRp and viral infectivity.","Chenon, Mélanie; Camborde, Laurent; Cheminant, Soizic; Jupin, Isabelle",The EMBO Journal,524,22

At present we are passing through a phase of slow and painful understanding of the origin, epidemiological profile, clinical spectrum, and risk profile of the virus. To the best of our knowledge there is only limited and contradictory evidence concerning SARS-CoV-2 transmission through other routes. Importantly, the eye may constitute not only a potential site of virus replication but also an alternative transmission route of the virus from the ocular surface to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore imperative to gain a better insight into the potential ophthalmological transmission route of the virus and establish directions on best practice and future models of care for ophthalmological patients. This review article critically evaluates available evidence on the ophthalmological mode of viral transmission and the value of earlier identification of the virus on the eye. More evidence is urgently needed to better evaluate the need for protective measures and reliable ocular diagnostic tests to diminish further pandemic spread.","Güemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Garcia-Feijoo, Julián; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; Martínez-de-la-Casa, Jose María; Diaz-Valle, David; Konstas, Anastasios G.",Adv Ther,524,16

Although it is primarily transmitted by contact and droplets, aerosol-generating procedures also seem to carry the possibility of airborne viral transmission. As such, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be considered a risky procedure, with several position statements recommending the adoption of safe practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to describe an additional tool to protect healthcare personnel during endoscopy. Methods A covering box made of acrylic plastic, named Endoprotector, was designed to cover the patient’s head, while taking into consideration movements performed by patients and healthcare staff during an endoscopic procedure. Results A cough simulation using fluorescent dye confirmed the potential benefit of the box during endoscopy, thus protecting healthcare staff from air droplets. The feasibility and practicality of the box was also tested with patients during endoscopy. Conclusion The reusable Endoprotector is easily and affordably manufactured and may reduce air droplets and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other microorganisms during endoscopy.","Campos, Sara; Carreira, Cátia; Marques, Pedro Pinto; Vieira, Ana",Endosc Int Open,524,1

However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved. Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year. In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic. This may be attributable to proactive program planning and data monitoring and active engagement with the communities and the national authorities to circumvent the indirect effect of COVID-19 on intervention coverage in Cambodia during the pandemic.","Feldman, Mitra; Vernaeve, Lieven; Tibenderana, James; Braack, Leo; Debackere, Mark; Thu, Htin Kyaw; Hamade, Prudence; Lo, Koung",Glob Health Sci Pract,524,6

Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women aged 20–39 years worldwide and women with SUDs have an increased risk of cervical cancer compared to women without SUD. The National Drug Treatment Centre (NDTC) cervical screening programme, derived from the national CervicalCheck programme, offers free cervical screening to patients attending for treatment of SUDs. AIMS: This study aimed to audit adherence to the NDTC Cervical Screening guidelines before and after the implementation of an awareness-raising educational intervention. METHODS: The electronic clinical records of women aged between 25 and 60 years attending the lead consultant’s (M.S.) outpatient clinic were reviewed for documentary evidence indicating that information about the cervical screening programme had been discussed. This was completed before and one month after the implementation of an awareness-raising educational intervention. RESULTS: All women (n = 46, mean age 36.3 (SD = 6.5) years) had an opioid use disorder; 85% had a benzodiazepine use disorder, and 24% had an alcohol use disorder. Of these, 80% had at least one chronic medical condition, 76% had a psychiatric disorder, and 59% were homeless. Adherence to the NDTC cervical screening guideline, as indicated by documentary evidence in clinical records, was 33% (14/43) at baseline, and rose to 88% (36/41) (p < 0.0001) one month after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This completed audit cycle shows that an awareness-raising educational intervention can significantly improve adherence to a cervical screening programme in women with SUDs.","Haran, Maeve; Kelly, John R.; Kennedy, Liam; Hennigan, Kieran; Farid, Huma; Herteu, Cristina; Kreisel, Anna; Salehin, Shamus; O’ Sullivan, Marie; Keating, Shay; Ivers, Jo-Hanna; Scully, Mike",Ir J Med Sci,524,14

In the early 1990s an arterivirus, referred to as PRRS virus (PRRSV), was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease. Since then research has progressed substantially. Most recently “porcine high fever disease” was reported in China starting in 2006 with PRRSV being a critical virus associated with high morbidity and mortality (20%) associated with this syndrome which in 2010 is still causing severe pathology in pigs in China, with spread to Vietnam and Cambodia. This volume contains a series of reviews that highlight the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiology, immunology, vaccinology and host genetic control. This paper provides a brief historical review of PRRS and the associated PRRSV. It presents areas of research gaps that inhibit current progress towards PRRS elimination through production of effective vaccines and current plans for PRRS elimination or eradication programs. It is hoped that this discussion will stimulate further collaboration between researchers and swine veterinarians throughout the world to provide answers that enhance our understanding of PRRS and PRRSV in an effort to eliminate this economically important disease.","Lunney, Joan K.; Benfield, David A.; Rowland, Raymond R.R.",Virus Research,524,16

Here, we employ machine learning to replicated sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to statistically compare and classify atom motions of these target proteins in both the presence and absence of different endemic and emergent strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. A multi-agent classifier successfully identified functional binding dynamics that are evolutionarily conserved from bat CoV-HKU4 to human endemic/emergent strains. Conserved dynamics regions of ACE2 involve both the N-terminal helices, as well as a region of more transient dynamics encompassing residues K353, Q325 and a novel motif AAQPFLL 386-92 that appears to coordinate their dynamic interactions with the viral RBD at N501. We also demonstrate that the functional evolution of Betacoronavirus zoonotic spillovers involving ACE2 interaction dynamics are likely pre-adapted from two precise and stable binding sites involving the viral bat progenitor strain's interaction with CD26 at SAMLI 291-5 and SS 333-334. Our analyses further indicate that the human endemic strains hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43 have evolved more stable N-terminal helix interactions through enhancement of an interfacing loop region on the viral RBD, whereas the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) have evolved more stable viral binding via more focused interactions between the viral N501 and ACE2 K353 alone.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The adoption of precautionary measures to prevent the pandemic from spreading has raised the need to rethink quickly and effectively the way in which the workforce is scheduled, to ensure that all the activities are conducted in a safe and responsible manner. The emphasis is on novel optimization models that take into account demand requirements, employees’ personal and family responsibilities, and anti-Covid-19 measures at the same time. It is precisely considering the anti-Covid-19 measures that the models allow to define the working mode to be assigned to the employees: working remotely or on-site. The last optimization model, which can be viewed as the most general and the most flexible formulation, has been developed to capture the specificity of a real case study of an Italian University. In order to improve employees’ satisfaction and ensure the best work/life balance possible, an alternative partition of a workday into shifts to the usual two shifts, morning and afternoon, is proposed. The model has been tested on real data provided by the Department of Mechanical, Energy and Management Engineering, University of Calabria, Italy. The computational experiments show good performance and underline the potentiality of the model to handle worker safety requirements and practicalities and to ensure work activities continuity.

They result in morbidity and mortality in humans and significant losses in the livestock and food industries. This highlights the need for rapid surveillance methods. Despite the high reliability of conventional pathogen detection methods, they have high detection limits and are time-consuming and not suitable for on-site analysis. Furthermore, the unpredictable spread of zoonotic infections due to a complex combination of risk factors urges the development of innovative technologies to overcome current limitations in early warning and detection. Biosensing, in particular, is highlighted here, as it offers rapid and cost-effective devices for use at the site of infection while increasing the sensitivity of detection. Portuguese research in biosensors for zoonotic pathogens is the focus of this review. This branch of research produces exciting and innovative devices for the study of the most widespread pathogenic bacteria. The studies presented here relate to the different classes of pathogens whose characteristics and routes of infection are also described. Many advances have been made in recent years, and Portuguese research teams have increased publications in this field. However, biosensing still needs to be extended to other pathogens, including potentially pandemic viruses. In addition, the use of biosensors as part of routine diagnostics in hospitals for humans, in animal infections for veterinary medicine, and food control has not yet been achieved. Therefore, a convergence of Portuguese efforts with global studies on biosensors to control emerging zoonotic diseases is foreseen for the future.","Miguéis, Samuel da Costa; Tavares, Ana P.

These pathways act in concert to mediate innate antiviral immunity and to initiate the inflammatory response against infection. The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a group of cytosolic RNA helicase proteins that can identify viral RNA as nonself via binding to pathogen associated molecular patter (PAMP) motifs within RNA ligands that accumulate during virus infection. This interaction then leads to triggering of an innate antiviral response within the infected cells through RLR induction of downstream effector molecules such as type I interferon (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that serve to induce antiviral and inflammatory gene expression within the local tissue. Cellular regulation of RLR signaling is a critical process that can direct the outcome of infection and is essential for governance of the overall immune response and avoidance of immune toxicity. Mechanisms of positive and negative regulation of RLR signaling have been identified that include signaling crosstalk between RLR pathways and Nuclear Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-Like Receptor (NLR) pathways and Caspase networks. Furthermore, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to target these pathways to promote enhanced replication and spread within the host. These virus-host interactions therefore carry important consequences for host immunity and viral pathogenesis. Understanding the pivotal role of RLRs in immune regulation and signaling crosstalk in antiviral immunity may provide new insights into therapeutic strategies for the control of virus infection and immunity.","Ramos, Hilario J; Gale, Michael",Current Opinion in Virology,524,20

We contrast these affinities with HLA allele frequencies across hundreds of human populations worldwide. Statistical modelling shows that peptide‐binding affinities classified into four distinct categories depend on the HLA locus but that the type of virus is only a weak predictor, except in the case of HIV‐1. Among the strong HLA binders (IC(50) ≤ 50), we uncovered 16 alleles (the top ones being A*02:02, B*15:03 and DRB1*01:02) binding more than 1% of peptides derived from all viruses, 9 (top ones including HLA‐A*68:01, B*15:25, C*03:02 and DRB1*07:01) binding all viruses except HIV‐1, and 15 (top ones A*02:01 and C*14:02) only binding coronaviruses. The frequencies of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders differ significantly among populations from different geographic regions. In particular, Indigenous peoples of America show both higher frequencies of strongest and lower frequencies of weakest HLA binders. As many HLA proteins are found to be strong binders of peptides derived from distinct viral families, and are hence promiscuous (or generalist), we discuss this result in relation to possible signatures of natural selection on HLA promiscuous alleles due to past pathogenic infections. Our findings are highly relevant for both evolutionary genetics and the development of vaccine therapies. However they should not lead to forget that individual resistance and vulnerability to diseases go beyond the sole HLA allelic affinity and depend on multiple, complex and often unknown biological, environmental and other variables.","Barquera, Rodrigo; Collen, Evelyn; Di, Da; Buhler, Stéphane; Teixeira, João; Llamas, Bastien; Nunes, José M.; Sanchez‐Mazas, Alicia",HLA,524,1

The present study also examined what promising practices VAW service providers are utilizing when working with women experiencing DV in rural locations. Interviews were coded and analyzed in a qualitative analysis computer program. Analysis indicated several risk factors including the location (i.e., geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and lack of community resources) and cultural factors (i.e., accepted and more available use of firearms, poverty, and no privacy/anonymity). Moreover, analyses indicated several challenges for VAW service providers assessing risk including barriers at the systemic (i.e., lack of agreement between services), organizational (i.e., lack of collaboration and risk assessment being underutilized/valued), and individual client (i.e., complexity of issues) level. However, participants outlined promising practices being implemented for rural locations such as interagency collaboration, public education, professional education, and outreach programs. The findings support other research in the field that highlight the increased vulnerability of women experiencing DV in rural locations and the added barriers and complexities in assessing risk for rural populations. Implications for future research and practice include further examination of the identified promising practices, a continued focus on collaborative approaches and innovative ways to prevent and manage risk in a rural context.","Youngson, Nicole; Saxton, Michael; Jaffe, Peter G.; Chiodo, Deborah; Dawson, Myrna; Straatman, Anna-Lee",J Fam Violence,524,1
