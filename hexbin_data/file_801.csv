47741,Towards More Efficient Screen Reader Web Access with Automatic Summary Generation and Text Tagging,2020-08-10,"The evolution of Big Data has been attracting many researchers who emphasized on the growing role of data analytics capabilities (DAC) in enhancing marketing decisions within enterprises. Although various hypothesis and theories have been previously generated, yet case studies validating them by real-life examples have been scarce. This research paper serves as an exploratory qualitative research, based on a single case study with a retail company established in Lebanon: The United Company for Central Markets SARL (UCCM). The grocery retail industry is a good example because it’s changing faster than most other complex industries, making it harder to detect and keep any competitive advantage. The study on hand aims to inductively develop theory further, and reflects UCCM’s results by illustrating an enriched conceptual framework for understanding how efficient CRM systems, when integrated with DAC, can enhance Marketing decisions during times of crisis management. UCCM’s research design and decision-making process allow addressing DAC as a new key dimension for the enriched conceptual framework. UCCM’s results also clarify how DAC play a crucial integrative role in adding value to the three factors of a CRM successful implementation: People, Technology and Process. The enriched conceptual framework proves to be a valuable heuristic tool that highlights the importance of establishing and acquiring a new skill set of competencies that combine Marketing with technologies and data analytics, especially during times of crisis management.","Jabado, Roula; Jallouli, Rim",The Importance of New Technologies and Entrepreneurship in Business Development: In The Context of Economic Diversity in Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972441/,801

DBE allows not only direct observation of the entire small intestine, but also interventional therapies, tissue sampling and India ink marking (tattooing). Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed from conventional laparoscopic surgery to further reduce the degree of invasiveness. SILS requires only one umbilical incision, thus resulting in almost scarless surgery. This report presents three cases of small intestinal bleeding successfully treated by SILS following tattooing under DBE. The average operative time was 67 min and average blood loss was 5 ml.

The presence of exogenous or mutated antigens explains why infected cells and malignant cells can initiate an adaptive immune response provided that the cells also emit adjuvant signals as a consequence of cellular stress and death. Several infectious pathogens have devised strategies to control cell death and limit the emission of danger signals from dying cells, thereby avoiding immune recognition. Similarly, cancer cells often escape immunosurveillance owing to defects in the molecular machinery that underlies the release of endogenous adjuvants. Here, we review current knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie the activation of immune responses against dying cells and their pathophysiological relevance.","Galluzzi, Lorenzo; Buqué, Aitziber; Kepp, Oliver; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kroemer, Guido",Nature reviews.

76545,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 38 Reporting period ending 28 March 2021.,2021-04-09,"Studio DöBra is a community-based initiative in which children (9 y/o) and older adults (mostly 80+) engaged with topics related to dying, death and loss through shared arts activities (e.g. collage, sculpture, games). In an ageing society, Sweden's end-of-life (EoL) care is increasingly professionalised and specialised, but there is little community involvement. One goal of Studio DöBra was therefore to support community engagement with EoL-related topics. Another goal was to create opportunities for interaction between children and older adults as there are few intergenerational meeting places. Two iterations of Studio DöBra were developed (2016, 2018) in different Swedish cities, utilising a community-based participatory research approach. Project groups comprised first author MK and representatives of community organisations such as meeting places for older adults, after-school centres and artistic organisations. Each iteration engaged eight children and eight older adults in a series of five workshops. This article investigates how children and older adults motivate their participation, their experiences of participating and ways in which they were affected by participation. We also investigate how parents reflect on their child's participation in Studio DöBra. Older adults, children and their parents were interviewed after each Studio DöBra. An inductive qualitative process guided by interpretive description was used to analyse the transcripts. Findings indicate that participants acted as individuals with agency in connecting across generations and in creating spaces for engaging with EoL-topics, not only in Studio DöBra but also in their social networks. Participants reflected on a changing sense of community through new intergenerational connections and social activities, and expressed a desire to maintain these. However, participants indicated sustainability challenges related to lacking agency in maintaining these spaces and sense of intergenerational community, as they rely on support from community organisations.","Kleijberg, Max; Ahlberg, Beth Maina; Hilton, Rebecca; Tishelman, Carol",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412151/,801

METHODS Sixty patients (34 men; mean age 70.7 ± 10.1 years) in 5 European centers were enrolled in the BIOLUX P-I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01056120) and randomized 1:1 to either the paclitaxel-coated balloon or the uncoated balloon. The primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 6 months. Secondary endpoints were binary restenosis at 6 months, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), change in ankle-brachial index and Rutherford classification, and major adverse events at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS At 6 months, patients treated with paclitaxel-coated balloons had a significantly lower late lumen loss (0.51 ± 0.72 vs. 1.04 ± 1.00 mm, p = 0.033) and binary restenosis (11.5% vs. 34.6%, p = 0.048) than the control group. Correspondingly, clinically driven TLR was lower in the paclitaxel-coated balloon group at 12 months [15.4% vs. 41.7% (p = 0.064) for the intention-to-treat population and 16.0% vs. 52.9%, (p = 0.020) for the as-treated population]. No death and one minor amputation were observed compared with two deaths and two minor amputations in the control group. No major amputations or thrombosis were reported. CONCLUSION The Passeo-18 Lux paclitaxel-coated balloon has been proven to be safe and effective in patients with femoropopliteal lesions, with superior performance outcomes compared with treatment with an uncoated balloon.","Scheinert, Dierk; Schulte, Karl-Ludwig; Zeller, Thomas; Lammer, Johannes; Tepe, Gunnar",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602814564383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775674/,801

OBJECTIVE This review aimed to conduct a systematic search of the literature on microlearning in health professions education to identify key concepts, characterize microlearning as an educational strategy, and evaluate pedagogical outcomes experienced by health professions students. METHODS A scoping review was performed using the bibliographic databases PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Education Resources Information Center, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Education Full Text (HW Wilson), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. A combination of keywords and subject headings related to microlearning, electronic learning, or just-in-time learning combined with health professions education was used. No date limits were placed on the search, but inclusion was limited to materials published in English. Pedagogical outcomes were evaluated according to the 4-level Kirkpatrick model. RESULTS A total of 3096 references were retrieved, of which 17 articles were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met the criteria were published between 2011 and 2018, and their authors were from a range of countries, including the United States, China, India, Australia, Canada, Iran, Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. The 17 studies reviewed included various health-related disciplines, such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, and allied health. Although microlearning appeared in a variety of subject areas, different technologies, such as podcast, short messaging service, microblogging, and social networking service, were also used. On the basis of Buchem and Hamelmann's 10 microlearning concepts, each study satisfied at least 40% of the characteristics, whereas all studies featured concepts of maximum time spent less than 15 min as well as content aggregation. According to our assessment of each article using the Kirkpatrick model, 94% (16/17) assessed student reactions to the microlearning (level 1), 82% (14/17) evaluated knowledge or skill acquisition (level 2), 29% (5/17) measured the effect of the microlearning on student behavior (level 3), and no studies were found at the highest level. CONCLUSIONS Microlearning as an educational strategy has demonstrated a positive effect on the knowledge and confidence of health professions students in performing procedures, retaining knowledge, studying, and engaging in collaborative learning. However, downsides to microlearning include pedagogical discomfort, technology inequalities, and privacy concerns. Future research should look at higher-level outcomes, including benefits to patients or practice changes. The findings of this scoping review will inform education researchers, faculty, and academic administrators on the application of microlearning, pinpoint gaps in the literature, and help identify opportunities for instructional designers and subject matter experts to improve course content in didactic and clinical settings.","De Gagne, Jennie Chang; Park, Hyeyoung Kate; Hall, Katherine; Woodward, Amanda; Yamane, Sandra; Kim, Sang Suk",JMIR medical education,https://doi.org/10.2196/13997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339105/,801

While the mechanisms underlying limitations and symptoms during leg activities have been investigated in detail, limitations and symptoms during arm activities are not well understood, and the potential differences between physiological responses of leg and arm activities have not been systematically synthesised. Determining physiological responses and symptoms of arm activities compared with physiological responses and symptoms of leg activities will help us understand the mechanisms behind the difficulties that people with COPD experience when performing physical activities, and determine how exercise training should be prescribed. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to compare the physiological responses and symptoms during activities involving the arms relative to activities involving the legs in people diagnosed with COPD. METHODS AND ANALYSES This protocol is reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. Potentially relevant studies will be identified from CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed databases. The Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, and Study characteristics framework will be used to systematise the process of selecting and extracting data from relevant studies. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies will be done by using the 14 most relevant components from the checklist by Downs and Black. The result will be presented with a narrative synthesis, and if appropriate with meta-analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this study is a systematic review.

To what extent do we trust such health content that is generated by other Internet users? Will it make a difference if such entries are curated by medical professionals? Does the affordance of crowdsourcing make users feel like they themselves could be contributors, and does that influence their credibility judgments? We explored these questions with a 2 (Crowdsourcing: absence vs. presence) × 2 (Professional source: absence vs. presence) × 2 (Message: sunscreen vs. milk) between-subjects experiment (N = 189). Two indirect paths for crowdsourcing effects were found. The crowd-as-source path suggests that crowdsourcing negatively affects content credibility through decreased source trustworthiness and information completeness. In contrast, the self-as-source path indicates that crowdsourcing elevates source trustworthiness via heightened interactivity and sense of control. Although the additional professional source raises perceived gatekeeping on the site, it does not have substantial influence on credibility judgments. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","Huang, Yan; Sundar, S Shyam",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1824662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962437/,801

Before the outbreak, the concept and technology of web-based teaching had been partially implemented. The epidemic situation has promoted the implementation of large-scale web-based teaching and the multidimensional development of education in China. Furthermore, there are higher requirements for information teaching. Teachers and students cannot adapt to the web-based teaching mode. The lack of interaction is a problem in the web-based teaching. To adapt to the rapid development of information technology, medical colleges and universities must consider the COVID-19 epidemic as an opportunity to quickly update educational concepts, train teachers' Internet thinking, innovate the web-based teaching mode, and make full use of the network platform to provide better teaching and services. Moreover, medical colleges and universities should eliminate the weaknesses of web-based teaching and improve the quality and connotation of teaching.","Ma, Z-B; Zhu, X-D; Bo, H; Guo, J-S; Liu, X-M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336765/,801

However, the fundamental measure of disease occurrence, incidence, has been scarcely reported globally. There are no previous studies of psoriasis incidence in Latin America. OBJECTIVE This study aims to estimate incidence rates of psoriasis in Chile during 2016 and 2017 using an administrative database, the Waiting List Repository. METHODS We examined referrals of psoriasis at onset, made by physicians to dermatologists, evaluated the agreement of diagnosis, and estimated the incidence of the disease considering the eligible population at risk. RESULTS The referrals corresponded to incident cases of psoriasis 73.3% (95% CI: 66.6% - 79.2%) of the time. National incidence rates of psoriasis were 22.1 (95% CI:21.1-23.1) and 22.7 (95% CI:21.8-23.6) per 100,000 person-years in 2016 and 2017. The most common type of psoriasis was the late-onset type. We observed a high variation in the figures throughout the country, with a range from 0.75 (95% CI: 0.3-1.5) to 164.9 (95% CI: 138.6-195.1) per 100,000 person-years at the Metropolitan and Aysen region, respectively.

While a significant number of cases require operative management, data comparing short-term outcomes of laparoscopic versus open repair of parastomal hernias are limited. METHODS The ACS-NSQIP was retrospectively reviewed from 2005 to 2011 for all PSH cases that underwent open or laparoscopic repair. Patients characteristics, operative details, and outcomes were listed for both procedure types. Selected end points were compared on multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS Among the 2,167 identified parastomal hernia cases, only 222 (10.24 %) were treated laparoscopically. The open and laparoscopic groups were similar with respect to mean patient age (63 vs. 63 years; p = 1) and gender distribution as the majority of patients were females (56.8 %). However, open repair was more likely to be performed in patients with a higher ASA class (III and IV) (p < 0.001). Also, the open approach was more likely to be used emergently (8.64 vs. 3.60 %; p = 0.01) and for recurrent hernias (6.99 vs. 3.15 %; p < 0.05). After adjusting for all potential confounders including age, gender, ASA, emergency designation of the operation, hernia type, and wound class, laparoscopy was associated with shorter operative time (137.5 vs. 153.4 min; p < 0.05), shorter length of hospital stay by 3.32 days (p < 0.001), lower risk of overall morbidity (OR = 0.42; p < 0.001), and a lower risk of surgical site infections (OR = 0.35; p < 0.01) compared to open repair. Mortality rates were similar in the laparoscopic and open groups (0.45 vs. 1.59 %, respectively; p = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair is safe and appears to be associated with better short-term outcomes compared to open repair in selected cases. Large prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm those results and to assess long-term recurrence rates.","Halabi, Wissam J; Jafari, Mehraneh D; Carmichael, Joseph C; Nguyen, Vinh Q; Mills, Steven; Phelan, Michael; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3062-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23836123/,801

Influenza is a leading killer of older adults despite the availability of seasonal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccines are strain specific, and their efficacy varies greatly year to year based on how well the vaccine virus matches the circulating strains. Additionally, older adults have reduced vaccination responses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased mortality rate in older adults for infectious disease, and brought vaccine development to the forefront. The speed of vaccine development was met with an equally impressive vaccine efficacy. Interestingly, both mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines currently available have shown similar efficacy in both young and older adults. mRNA vaccine production has significantly reduced the production timeline compared to current influenza vaccines, making them particularly attractive for influenza vaccine development. Faster production coupled with improved efficacy would be a tremendous advancement in protecting older adults from influenza morbidity and mortality.","Bartley, Jenna M; Cadar, Andreia N; Martin, Dominique E",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2021.1909617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830864/,801

Several simple, economic, fast and reliable HPLC methods were developed for their simultaneous analysis and are presented in a comparative manner highlighting their advantages and the limitations. Elution profile showed satisfying retentions and resolution about 3. Photo-diode array calculations were exploited for identifying the molecules by their UV spectra and peak purity, calculated and presented as rectangular shaped ratio grams. The linearity check showed excellent results, and satisfactory system suitability parameters of both peaks. This confirms the investigation results and conclusions for the influence of the chaotropic salts on N-containing molecules, by increasing their retentivities, and improving peak shapes, even on different quality columns without end-capping and base-deactivating of separation matrixes.

Total 22 065 subjects were included and randomly divided into 2 groups. The non-intervention group was given health guidance only, while the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) intervention group was given two coordinated TCM in addition to health guidance. The medical instructions were as follows. Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid: oral before meals, 10 mL/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days. Jinhao Jiere Granules: dissolve in boiling water and take after meals, 8 g/time, 2 times/day, a course of 5 days, followed up for 14 days, respectively. The study found that with the intake of medication, the incidence rate of TCM intervention group was basically maintained at a low and continuous stable level(0.01%-0.02%), while the non-intervention group showed an overall trend of continuous growth(0.02%-0.18%) from 3 to 14 days. No suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case occurred in either group. There were 2 cases of colds in the TCM intervention group and 26 cases in the non-intervention group. The incidence of colds in the TCM intervention group was significantly lower(P<0.05) than that in the non-intervention group. In the population of 16-60 years old, the incidence rate of non-intervention and intervention groups were 0.01% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference of colds incidence between the two groups was statistically significant(P<0.05). In the population older than 60 years old, they were 0.04% and 0.21%, respectively. The incidence of colds in the non-intervention group was higher than that in the intervention group, but not reaching statistical difference. The protection rate of TCM for the whole population was 91.8%, especially for the population of age 16-60(95.0%). It was suggested that TCM intervention(combined use of Huoxiang Zhengqi Oral Liquid and Jinhao Jiere Granules) could effectively protect community residents against respiratory diseases, such as colds, which was worthy of promotion in the community. In addition, in terms of safety, the incidence of adverse events and adverse reactions in the TCM intervention group was relatively low, which was basically consistent with the drug instructions.","Yan, Bo-Hua; Jiang, Zhi-Wei; Zeng, Jie-Ping; Tang, Jian-Yuan; Ding, Hong; Xia, Jie-Lai; Qin, Shao-Rong; Jin, Si-Cen; Lu, Yun; Zhang, Na; Wang, Zhi-Hong; Li, Hai-Yan; Sang, Xiao-Ya; Wu, Li-Na; Tang, Shi-Yun; Li, Yan; Tao, Meng-Yao; Wang, Qiao-Ling; Wang, Jun-Dong; Xie, Hong-Yan; Chen, Qi-Yuan; Yang, Sheng-Wen; Hu, Nian-Shuang; Yang, Jian-Qiong; Bao, Xiao-Xia; Zhang, Qiong; Yang, Xiao-Li; Jiang, Chang-Yong; Luo, Hong-Yan; Cai, Zheng-Hua; Yu, Shu-Guang",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200430.501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726003/,801

Its absence or truncated variants are also associated with viral attenuation in vivo. Here, three ORF3 variants (ORF3NP12, ORF3NP14 and ORF3RB14) and their truncated counterparts were investigated for their regulatory role in recovery of cell-adapted PEDV in vitro. We demonstrate that ORF3NP12, but not the truncated form, can inhibit recovery of reverse-genetics-derived PEDV when expressed in trans. When testing with other RNA viruses, ORF3 was found to inhibit rescue of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), but not of influenza virus. Interestingly, results from mutagenesis of ORF3NP12 suggest that F81 and M167 are responsible for impairing PEDV rescue in vitro. By changing specific residues of ORF3, the recombinant PEDV bearing the modified ORF3NP12 can be productively propagated in VeroE6-APN cells. These results may provide mechanistic insights into ORF3-mediated inhibition of PEDV replication in new host cells.","Wongthida, Phonphimon; Liwnaree, Benjamas; Wanasen, Nanchaya; Narkpuk, Jaraspim; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",Archives of virology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3390-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474223/,801

This lockdown has had the unintended consequence of decreasing physical activity, and incidence of low back pain (LBP) is likely to rise as sedentary behavior increases. OBJECTIVE In this article, we aim to provide a fundamental, novel approach to alleviate LBP including desk worker associated LBP exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Individuals can alleviate their LBP through a simplistic, self-therapeutic approach: myofascial release and stretching of key musculature involved in LBP following a simple technique and associated time domain, as well as a 360-degree strengthening of the muscles surrounding the lower back. Additional muscular strength will support the lower back and lend resilience to aid in the mitigation of pain caused by poor work-related postural positions. RESULTS We demonstrate several exercises and movements aimed at alleviating LBP. Additionally, we provide a summary graphic which facilitates ease of use of the exercise plan and represents a novel methodology for simple distribution of evidence-based pain reduction strategies. CONCLUSIOS Through mitigation of sedentary behavior and adoption of the techniques described herein, LBP can be decreased and, in some cases, cured.","Shariat, Ardalan; Anastasio, Albert T; Soheili, Sahar; Rostad, Mitch",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32955470/,801

Materials and methods From January 2012 to March 2016, 16 patients underwent MAT with Penumbra catheters using a proximal and distal supporting technique to treat ACA occlusions. We evaluated immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes by reviewing patient electrical medical records. Results Of these patients, 11 had a complete obstruction of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) and five had ACA and middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions. All patients achieved successful recanalization of the distal ICA or MCA (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grade ≥2b). Overall the recanalization rate for ACA occlusions (TICI grade≥2b) was 93.7% (15/16). The median procedure time was 45 minutes (range: 35-65 minutes). No patients were observed to have a procedure-related subarachnoid hemorrhage. Four patients (25.0%) died during hospitalization because of massive symptomatic hemorrhage, brain edema, or herniation. At discharge, the median NIHSS score for surviving patients was 6 (range: 1-17). Five patients had favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale ≤2). Conclusion MAT appears to be safe and successfully achieves recanalization in patients with ACA occlusions.","Chung, Gyung Ho; Kwak, Hyo Sung; Park, Jung Soo; Lee, Jong Myong","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917702521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443484/,801

Little is known about the impact this infection has on bariatric surgery outcomes. This retrospective cohort study conducted on obese Turkish adults who underwent sleeve gastrectomy at a single center aimed to determine the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the effect of this infection on the rate of early major postoperative complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS All consecutive patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy for obesity between 2014 and 2015 and who had complete data were enrolled. A single surgeon performed all procedures. All resected specimens were sent to pathology for analysis. RESULTS Of the 460 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 326 (71%) were female. The average (±standard deviation) age and body mass index were 37.5±10.0 years and 42.7±7.7 kg/m2, respectively. Histology revealed that 150 (33%) patients had H. pylori infection. The H. pylori-infected group developed two complications (leakage and intra-abdominal collection). The uninfected group developed three complications (all bleeding related). The two groups did not differ significantly regarding postoperative complication rates (1.3% vs. 1.0%; p=0.717). CONCLUSION H. pylori infection did not affect the rate of early complications after sleeve gastrectomy. This suggests that H. pylori screening or eradication policy is not essential for asymptomatic candidates who have undergone sleeve gastrectomy.","Serin, Kürşat Rahmi; Akyüz, Ümit; Batman, Burçin; Uymaz, Derya Salim; Altun, Hasan",The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.5152/tjg.2018.17373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249550/,801

But pathogens cannot been seen as unique entities; their intra-specific genetic variability represented in variants, strains, antigenic types or genetic lineages may cause different impacts at the population level (Nelson & Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). The global spread of pathogens has been largely facilitated by globalization of transport, which particularly intensified during the last century (O'Hanlon et al., 2018). As seen with SARS-CoV-2, air travel can rapidly spread a pathogen globally (Wells et al., 2020). Furthermore, after initial introduction subsequent translocations of a pathogen may cause the contact of different variants facilitating the rise of novel genotypes that may have higher pathogenicity or transmissibility (Nelson & Holmes, 2007; Greenspan et al., 2018). Chytridiomycosis is an EID caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), that infects amphibian skin causing population declines to extinction in susceptible species. Now a wildlife pandemic, Bd has been recognized as the single pathogen causing the greatest loss of biodiversity on Earth (Scheele et al., 2019). Recent advances in genetics have made novel tools for pathogen detection and characterization more accessible and reliable (Boyle et al., 2004; Byrne et al., 2019). In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Ghosh et al. (2021) develop a new genotyping qPCR assay targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Bd, and based on non-invasive swab samples (Fig. 1), discriminate between the two most globally widespread and pathogenic genetic lineages of Bd. Having a better understanding of how the genetic diversity of a pathogen is distributed is crucial to understand their spread patterns and develop timely mitigation strategies.","Azat, Claudio",Molecular ecology resources,https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559328/,801

The aim of this study was to test whether a previously defined bacterial sepsis endotypes classifier recapitulates the same clinical and immunological endotypes in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN Prospective single-center observational cohort study. SETTING Patients were enrolled in Athens, Greece, and blood was shipped to Inflammatix (Burlingame, CA) for analysis. PATIENTS Adult patients within 24 hours of hospital admission with coronavirus disease 2019 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and chest radiography. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We studied 97 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, of which 50 went on to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and 16 died. We applied a previously defined 33-messenger RNA classifier to assign endotype (Inflammopathic, Adaptive, or Coagulopathic) to each patient. We tested endotype status against other clinical parameters including laboratory values, severity scores, and outcomes. Patients were assigned as Inflammopathic (29%), Adaptive (44%), or Coagulopathic (27%), similar to our prior study in bacterial sepsis. Adaptive patients had lower rates of SRF and no deaths. Coagulopathic and Inflammopathic endotypes had 42% and 18% mortality rates, respectively. The Coagulopathic group showed highest D-dimers, and the Inflammopathic group showed highest C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels. CONCLUSIONS Our predefined 33-messenger RNA endotypes classifier recapitulated immune phenotypes in viral sepsis (coronavirus disease 2019) despite its prior training and validation only in bacterial sepsis.

159717,COVID-19 Australia: Epidemiology Report 28: Fortnightly reporting period ending 25 October 2020.,2020-10-04,"BACKGROUND Tracheotomy is an indispensable component in intensive care management. Doctors in charge of the intensive care unit (ICU) usually decide whether tracheotomy should be performed. However, long-term follow-up of a closed fistula by these doctors is rarely continued in most cases. Doctors in charge of the ICU should be interested in the long-term prognosis of tracheotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether different tracheotomy procedures affect the long-term outcome of a closed tracheal fistula. METHODS We mailed questionnaires to patients undergoing tracheotomy in Fukushima Medical University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010. Questions concerned problems related to perception, laryngeal function, and the appearance of a closed fistula. Patients were classified into percutaneous tracheotomy (PT) group and surgical tracheotomy (ST) group. We evaluated the statistical significance of differences in the frequency and degree of each problem between the two groups. A door-to-door objective evaluation using the original scoring system was then performed for patients who replied to the mailed questionnaire. We evaluated the percentage of patients with high scores as well as the mean scores for problems with function and appearance. RESULTS We received completed questionnaires from 28/40 patients in the PT group and 35/55 patients in the ST group. There were no significant differences in age, mean hospital stay, or APACHE II score between the groups. Regarding problems with appearance, the outcomes of PT were significantly better than those of ST with respect to self-evaluation (p = 0.04) and the frequency (p = 0.03) and degree (p = 0.02) of scar unevenness according to door-to-door evaluation. However, there were no significant differences in the frequency or degree of self-evaluation in problems with perception and function between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency or degree of door-to-door evaluation of problems with function. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that PT might be superior to ST with respect to problems with long-term appearance. Continuous follow-up of closed tracheal fistulas can help assure that patients recovering from a critical condition experience a better return to their former lives. A systematic follow-up of post-critical-care patients is required.","Ikegami, Yukihiro; Iseki, Ken; Nemoto, Chiaki; Tsukada, Yasuhiko; Shimada, Jiro; Tase, Choichiro",Journal of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/2052-0492-2-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908982/,801

So far, little is known about how anxiety responses in specific everyday public life situations have been affected. Method: Self-reported anxiety in selected public situations, which are relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, was investigated in non-representative samples from the community (n = 352) and patients undergoing psychotherapy (n = 228). Situational anxiety in each situation was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no anxiety at all to 4 = very strong anxiety). Situational anxiety during the pandemic was compared with retrospectively reported situational anxiety before the pandemic (direct change) and with anxiety levels in a matched sample assessed before the pandemic (n = 100;indirect change). Results: In the community and patient sample, indirect and direct change analyses demonstrated an increase in anxiety in relevant public situations but not in control situations. Average anxiety levels during the pandemic were moderate, but 5-28% of participants reported high to very high levels of anxiety in specific situations. Interestingly, the direct increase in anxiety levels was higher in the community sample: patients reported higher anxiety levels than the community sample before, but not during the pandemic. Finally, a higher increase in situational anxiety was associated with a higher perceived danger of COVID-19, a higher perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, and stronger symptoms of general anxiety and stress. Conclusions: Preliminary findings demonstrate an increase in anxiety in public situations during the COVID-19 pandemic in a community and a patient sample. Moderate anxiety may facilitate compliance with public safety measures. However, high anxiety levels may result in persistent impairments and should be monitored during the pandemic. © 2021 PsychOpen. All rights reserved.","Pittig, A.; Glück, V. M.; Boschet, J.

Patients with suspected resistant hypertension undergo more screening intensity for secondary hypertension, despite some of them being non-adherent to prescribed pharmacotherapy. The prevalence of non-adherence in this setting varies from about 5 to 80% in the published literature. Apart from the wide range, the relation between method of assessment and prevalence is not well established. Our objective was to establish the overall prevalence of non-adherence in the apparent treatment resistant hypertension population, explore causes of heterogeneity, and evaluate the effect of the method of assessment on the estimate of non-adherence. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE Classic+EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. Details about the method of adherence assessment were extracted from each included article and grouped into direct and indirect. Pooled analysis was performed using the random effects model and heterogeneity was explored with metaregression and subgroup analyses. Results: The literature search yielded 1428 studies, of which 36 were included. The pooled prevalence of non-adherence was 35% (95% confidence interval 25 to 46 %). For indirect methods of adherence assessment, it was 25% (95% CI 15 to 39 %), whereas for direct methods of assessment, it was 44% (95% CI 32 to 57 %).

Recent emerging research has drawn inspiration from nanocarriers and in conjunction with PMNs have opened up new perspectives for the treatment of various diseases. In this review, we focus on recent progresses in the field of transdermal drug delivery using nano carriers in conjunction with PMNs for various therapeutic and diagnostic activities. Additionally, we describe the various factors impacting drug delivery, and challenges involved in sterilization and stability aspects associated with nanocarrier loaded PMNs, highlighting future research perspectives alongside.","Salwa, Chevala Naga Thirumalesh Jitta Srinivas Reddy Marques Shirleen Miriam Vaz Vanessa Marcia Kumar Lalit",Journal of Drug Delivery Science and Technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jddst.2021.102711,801

Differences in ED specific and general symptoms among the 3 investigated time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were assessed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Subsequently, ED diagnosis was introduced as covariate in the analysis in order to investigate the possible contribution on psychopathological changes.ResultsED core symptoms increased during the lockdown but most of them returned to pre-COVID19 levels at re-opening. The severity of general psychopathology also increased during the lockdown and persisted high in the following phase, except for depression and suicide ideation. None of this symptoms was affected by ED diagnosis, participants’age and illness duration.ConclusionsPeople with EDs showed worsening of both general and specific psychopathology;moreover, changes in general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period suggesting a higher stress vulnerability in this kind of patients.DisclosureNo significant relationships.KeywordCOVID19 and Eating Disorders","Barone, E.; Marciello, F.; Cascino, G.; Abbate-Daga, G.; Anselmetti, S.; Baiano, M.; Balestrieri, M.; Bertelli, S.; Carpiniello, B.; Castellini, G.; Corrivetti, G.; De Giorgi, S.; Favaro, A.; Gramaglia, C.; Marzola, E.; Monaco, F.; Oriani, M.

However, the diagnostic tests used to identify the target disease typically suffer from imperfect sensitivity and specificity, leading to biased vaccine effectiveness estimates. Here we present a solution to this problem via a Bayesian statistical model which can either incorporate point estimates of test sensitivity and specificity, or can jointly infer them directly from laboratory validation data. This approach enables uncertainties in the performance characteristics of the diagnostic test to be correctly propagated to estimates, avoiding both bias and false precision in vaccine effectiveness. By further incorporating individual covariates of study participants, and by allowing data streams from multiple diagnostic test types to be rigorously combined, our approach provides a flexible model for the analysis of TNDs with explicitly stated assumptions.","Johnson, E.

The goal is to help inform the many healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity. Multidisciplinary team-work is recommended in the management of patients with COVID-19, and approaches should include a consideration of nutritional status (both macronutrients and micronutrients), body weight, and gastrointestinal signs and symptom.","Bold, Justine; Harris, Miranda; Fellows, Lindsey; Chouchane, Manal",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682975/,801

208815,UnlockMe: Social Interactions when Co-located in Online Activities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infects and establishes latency in neurons in the ganglia of the cranial nerve, dorsal root and enteric ganglia. VZV reactivation in enteric neurons (enteric zoster) can cause non-specific abdominal pain and/or serious gastrointestinal dysfunction without cutaneous manifestations. Detection of VZV DNA in saliva may be useful for identifying enteric zoster. We evaluated the frequency of putative enteric zoster based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with acute abdominal pain. METHODS: Adult patients who visited the emergency room due to moderate to severe acute abdominal pain were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital between May 2019 and November 2019. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) was performed in all patients. We also evaluated the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who were under stressful conditions. Saliva samples were collected from all studied patients. Enteric zoster was suspected based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA, detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Fifty patients with moderate to severe abdominal pain were enrolled. Five of 50 patients exhibited positive VZV-DNA PCR results. APCT revealed that among these five patients, two had pancreatic head cancer, two had small bowel obstruction after intra-abdominal surgery, and one had no remarkable findings. However, all 14 patients with COVID-19 showed negative salivary VZV-DNA PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of patients with moderate to severe acute abdominal pain showed positivity for salivary VZV DNA. Further studies are warranted on whether antiviral therapy based on salivary VZV-DNA PCR results may relieve abdominal pain in the studied patient population.

However, limitations that persist in current disease modeling with limited physiological relevancy of human patients skew drug responses, hamper translation of clinical efficacy, and contribute to high clinical attritions. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology revolutionizes the paradigm of drug discovery. In particular, iPSC-based three-dimensional (3D) tissue engineering that appears as a promising vehicle of in vitro disease modeling provides more sophisticated tissue architectures and micro-environmental cues than a traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture. Here we discuss 3D based organoids/spheroids that construct the advanced modeling with evolved structural complexity, which propels drug discovery by exhibiting more human specific and diverse pathologies that are not perceived in 2D or animal models. We will then focus on various central nerve system (CNS) disease modeling using human iPSCs, leading to uncovering disease pathogenesis that guides the development of therapeutic strategies. Finally, we will address new opportunities of iPSC-assisted drug discovery with multi-disciplinary approaches from bioengineering to Omics technology. Despite technological challenges, iPSC-derived cytoarchitectures through interactions of diverse cell types mimic patients' CNS and serve as a platform for therapeutic development and personalized precision medicine.","Qian, Lu; Tcw, Julia",Int. j. mol. sci.

A comparative account of both types of systems would help identify whether it could be implemented in Pennine Care and the results could be potentially transferable to other similar settings.MethodAn online survey was undertaken from staff members working in Pennine Care who have been involved in ECT delivery and management. The survey was undertaken between 07/12/2020 and 11/01/2021 and included questions relating to pre-COVID ECT (June 2019 to February 2020) and during-COVID ECT (March 2020 to November 2020). Questions were around travel of staff/patients for ECT, whether they had a preference for a model and their reasons around it. Data were summarised in MS Excel and free text comments analysed to gain an understanding of staff's preferences and reasoning behind their choices.ResultAlthough some boroughs had patients attending from other boroughs in pre-COVID times, considerably more staff (53.85%) and patients (61.54%) had to travel for ECT during COVID times. Around 50% staff expressed a clear view for decentralised services;the common reasons being safer for patients, better continuity of care, less travelling issues, patients more likely to consent, easier to manage correct paperwork, easier to send staff who knows patients well, less driving for staff and likely less cancellations. Around 40% staff expressed a clear view for centralised services;the common reasons being less staff needed, better infection control, easier to maintain staff skills, efficiency, developing clinical expertise with larger number of cases, education opportunities, better set-up of clinics, transportation and accessibility. Some concerns raised for the centralised model were managing patients with complex anaesthesia, travelling for unwell/ disturbed patients, too high patient numbers, poor communication and impact on training.ConclusionIn summary, there was a mixed view of which services are preferable. Further discussion in trust wide ECT forum will be helpful to move things forward. Although it is likely that services may shift from a decentralised to a centralised system, we need to ensure this is done safely and in particular, address the main concerns around centralisation.","Mitra, Madhumanti Hayden Katherine",BJPsych Open,,801

Their precise function remains unclear, but studies have shown that they support male fertility. The important role of phasiRNAs in anthers underpins our current study to characterize these sRNAs in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) anthers. We staged anthers at every 0.2 mm of development for one wheat and two barley varieties. We isolated pre-meiotic (0.2 mm, 0.4 mm, and 0.6 mm), meiotic (0.8 mm, 1.0 mm, and 1.4 mm), and post-meiotic (1.8 mm) anthers, for which we then investigated accumulation patterns of RNAs, including reproductive phasiRNAs. We annotated a total of 12,821 and 2,897 PHAS loci in the wheat and barley genomes, respectively. By comparing the total number of PHAS loci in genomes of maize, rice, barley, and wheat, we identified an expansion of reproductive PHAS loci in the genomes of Poaceae subfamilies from Panicoideae to Oryzoideae and to Poideae. In addition to the two classes of pre-meiotic (21-nt) and meiotic (24-nt) phasiRNAs, previously described in maize and rice anthers, we characterized a group of 24-nt phasiRNAs that accumulate in pre-meiotic anthers. The absence of pre-meiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs in maize and rice suggests a divergence in grass species of the Poideae subfamily. Additionally, we performed a gene co-expression analysis describing the regulation of phasiRNA biogenesis in wheat and barley anthers. We highlight Argonaute 9 (AGO9) and Argonaute 6 (AGO6) as candidate binding partners of pre-meiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs, respectively.","Bélanger, Sebastien; Pokhrel, Suresh; Czymmek, Kirk J; Meyers, Blake C",Plant physiol,,801

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","Coskun Benlidayi, Ilke; Kurtaran, Behice; Tirasci, Emre; Guzel, Rengin",Rheumatol.Int,,801
439612,Sensing the Audience in Digital Streaming: Lessons from a Global Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 epidemic grows and there are clinical trials of antivirals. There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was effective in murine influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our innovative design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1-7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.
