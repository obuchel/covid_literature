Providing a core component of the front line response to disasters, paramedics potentially expose themselves to a variety of health and safety risks, including physical injury, death, communicable disease, and psychological effects. The health and safety risks to emergency service personnel were highlighted by the deaths of firefighters, paramedics, and police during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and the infection, illness, and deaths of paramedics and emergency health care staff during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. OBJECTIVE Given that a willing and able prehospital workforce is a vital component of any successful response to a disaster situation, the present study explored paramedics' perception of risk and willingness to work, with a specific focus on identifying which type of disasters that paramedics associate with greater levels of fear, familiarity, and risk. METHODS A total of 175 paramedics completed a survey ranking 40 disaster scenarios for levels of fear and familiarity. RESULTS The results indicate that paramedics ranked nuclear and radiological events and outbreaks of new and highly infectious disasters highest for fear and unfamiliarity. This has implications for preparedness, education, and training.","Smith, Erin C; Burkle, Frederick M; Archer, Frank L",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,758,1

The modern practice of medicine advocates IO access for patients in a critical condition, especially when IV access is problematic or unobtainable. Various medical devices allowing for IO access have been coined and used in the management of critical patients. AREAS COVERED : This study aims to review the literature regarding different intraosseous devices used to obtain vascular access (Bone Injection Gun (BIG), EZ-IO, NIO, Jamshidi, and First Access for Shock and Trauma (FAST-1) and discuss their clinical and experimental role in the emergency and trauma settings. EXPERT COMMENTARY The development of medical technology contributes to an increasing number of intraosseous devices facilitating vascular access in challenging scenarios, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, anaphylactic, or hypovolemic shock. Each of these devices provides an effective route for fluid resuscitation, drug delivery, laboratory evaluation, and shortening the timeframe for established vascular access, provided that the person obtaining the access is acquainted with the use of the device.","Drozd, Anna; Wolska, Marta; Szarpak, Lukasz",Expert review of medical devices,758,20

This issue is becoming stronger today given the health and economic crisis caused by the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. There are no reports in our country on limitations to access and adherence to treatment in patients with Spondyloarthritis (SpA) during social preventive and mandatory isolation. Objectives: Evaluate access and adherence to treatment in patients with Spondyloarthritis during social preventive and mandatory isolation. Methods: Patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) radiological (r-axSpA), non-radiological (nr-axSpA) and peripheral spondyloarthritis (pSpA), according to ASAS criteria and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) according to CASPAR criteria, were included. Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, disease activity and treatments were collected at baseline. Data on treatment discontinuation, medical attention for suspected COVID-19 disease, RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection and outcome of COVID-19 disease were collected from April to September 2020. Numerical variables were summarized as means and standard deviations (SD) or as medians and interquartiles 25-75 (IQ 25-75). Results: 320 patients were included, 55% were male, with a mean age of 50 years (SD 13), 21.6% had diagnosis of r-axSpA, 6.9% nr-axSpA, 6.9% pSpA, and 64.7% PsA. Disease duration was 11 (IQ 5-16) years and activity parameters were as follow: BASDAI 3.65 (SD 3), BASFI 3 (1.5-9), PASI 0.3 (0-7), BSA 0.2 (0-6). 14 (4.4%) patients with COVID-19 disease were reported, 10 were confirmed by positive RT-qPCR and 4 by symptoms and history of close contact with SARS patients. 4 (28.6%) received anti TNF (3 adalimumab, 1 certolizumab), 4 (28.6%) anti IL17 (3 secukinumab and 1 ixekizumab), 8 (57%) methotrexate (MTX) and 2 (14%) leflunomide (LF). Among the 320 patients included, 59 (18.4%) discontinued at least one treatment during follow-up. The discontinued medications were: adalimumab (16), MTX (15), secukinumab (9), etanercept (6), certolizumab(4), ustekinumab (3), NSAIDs (2), apremilast (1), golimumab (1), ixekuzumab (1), LF (1), MTX plus LF (1). The main reason for treatment discontinuation was drug shortage: 36 (62%), followed by patient's decision: 12 (21%) and medical indication: 11 (17%). Of the 36 patients who discontinued due to shortage, 11 received adalimumab, 8 secukinumab, 5 MTX, 3 etanercept, 3 certolizumab, 3 ustekinumab, 2 NSAIDs and 1 golimumab. Conclusion: In our Argentinian cohort of patients with SpA, drug shortage was the main reason for treatment discontinuation.

Based on several data points, a general trend becomes evident whereby, as companies retrenched, they shifted the demographics of their employees to those perceived as most valuable, i.e. workers with university educations. However, when distinguished by gender, it is evident that their priorities changed. This discovery suggests that as the world faces another global health crisis (COVID-19) with its associated impact on organisational retrenchment, the gender gap in Korea could widen further.Design/methodology/approachThe analysis was conducted by applying a simple compounded average growth rate (CAGR) analysis to determine the impact of the two crises on employment by the educational level.FindingsA general trend becomes evident whereby, as companies retrenched, they shifted the demographics of their employees to those perceived as most valuable, i.e. workers with university educations.

A 60-nucleotide (nt) sequence, common between wild-type RNA2 and mutant RNA3, supported efficient repair (90%) of a modified 3' noncoding region in the RNA3 segment by homologous recombination with wild-type RNA2 3' noncoding sequences. Deletions within this sequence in RNA3 demonstrated that a nucleotide identity as short as 15 nt can support efficient homologous recombination events, while shorter (5-nt) sequence identity resulted in reduced recombination frequency (5%) within this region. Three or more mismatches within a downstream portion of the common 60-nt RNA3 sequence affected both the incidence of recombination and the distribution of crossover sites, suggesting that besides the length, the extent of sequence identity between two recombining BMV RNAs is an important factor in homologous recombination. Site-directed mutagenesis of the common sequence in RNA3 did not reveal a clear correlation between the stability of predicted secondary structures and recombination activity. This indicates that homologous recombination does not require similar secondary structures between two recombining RNAs at the sites of crossovers. Nearly 20% of homologous recombinants were imprecise (aberrant), containing either nucleotide mismatches, small deletions, or small insertions within the region of crossovers. This implies that homologous RNA recombination is not as accurate as proposed previously. Our results provide experimental evidence that the requirements and thus the mechanism of homologous recombination in BMV differ from those of previously described heteroduplex-mediated nonhomologous recombination (P. D. Nagy and J. J. Bujarski, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6390-6394, 1993).","Nagy, P D; Bujarski, J J",Journal of virology,758,1

After the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) scares [1], attention has turned towards the possibility of an avian influenza virus hybridizing with a human influenza virus to create a highly virulent, as yet unknown, killer, on a scale unseen since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918, which produced more fatalities than the Great War. In deciding how countries should react to this potential pandemic, individually and collectively, a reasonable and practical balance must be struck between the rights and obligations of individual citizens and protection of the wider community and, indeed, society as a whole. In this communication, ethical issues are discussed in the context of some of the scientific questions relating to a potential influenza pandemic. Among these issues are the rights and obligations of healthcare professionals, difficulties surrounding resource allocation, policies that have an impact on liberty and trade, when and how to introduce any vaccine or other form of mass treatment, global governance questions and the role of health policies in contemporary society. By considering these issues and questions in advance of an influenza, or indeed any other, pandemic commencing, countries can be better prepared to deal with the inevitably difficult decisions required during such events, rather than dusting down outdated previous plans, or making and implementing policy in an ad hoc manner with a resultant higher risk of adverse consequences.","Schuklenk, U; Gartland, K M A",Biochemical Society transactions,758,28

The isolation of a coronavirus from a suspension of pooled kidneys from clinically ill chickens at the fifth passage in 10-day-old chicken embryos, gross and histologic renal lesions, and seroconversion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in inoculated birds suggested that the virus isolated was a nephrotrophic strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus isolate was found to be a previously unrecognized serotype, based on virus neutralization tests performed in embryonated chicken eggs. Nephropathogenicity of the IBV isolate was confirmed by inoculation of the viral isolate into specific-pathogen-free chicks and demonstration of renal lesions.

Comparison of hematological parameters between mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV 2 is so far limited, but significant differences in parameters such as interleukin-6, d-dimers, glucose, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein have been already reported. PURPOSE In this study we analyzed the changes observed in easily measured blood biomarkers in the patients and provided evidence of how these markers can be used as prognostic factors of the disease. METHODS Demographic characteristics, detailed medical history, and laboratory findings of all enrolled SARS-CoV 2 infection positive patients who were referred to Patras University Hospital from the period of March 4th 2020 (when first confirmed case in Greece appeared in our hospital) until April 4th 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed. RESULTS We provided evidence that some very common laboratory values can be used as independent predictive factors in SARS-CoV 2 infection. Despite the retrospective nature of this study and the small number of subjects analyzed, we showed that NLR, LDH, d-dimers, CRP, fibrinogen and ferritin can be used early at the patient's first visit for SARS-CoV 2 infection symptoms and can predict the severity of infection. CONCLUSION More studies are warranted to further objectively confirm the clinical value of prognostic factors related to SARS-CoV 2 and establish an easy-to-get panel of laboratory findings for evaluating the disease severity.","Lagadinou, Maria; Salomou, Elena E; Zareifopoulos, Nicholas; Marangos, Markos; Gogos, Charalambos; Velissaris, Dimitrios",Le infezioni in medicina,758,19

We present analyses of data on key parameters and distributions and discuss the processes of data capture, analysis and public health policy formulation during the SARS epidemic are discussed. The low transmissibility of the virus, combined with the onset of peak infectiousness following the onset of clinical symptoms of disease, transpired to make simple public health measures, such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts, very effective in the control of the SARS epidemic. We conclude that we were lucky this time round, but may not be so with the next epidemic outbreak of a novel aetiological agent. We present analyses that help to further understanding of what intervention measures are likely to work best with infectious agents of defined biological and epidemiological properties. These lessons learnt from the SARS experience are presented in an epidemiological and public health context.","Anderson, Roy M; Fraser, Christophe; Ghani, Azra C; Donnelly, Christl A; Riley, Steven; Ferguson, Neil M; Leung, Gabriel M; Lam, T H; Hedley, Anthony J","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Materials and Methods: Synchrotron radiation Xray microcomputed tomography (SRµCT) and microhardness testing were carried out on 8 and 20 tooth samples, respectively. Enamel mineral density was derived from SRµCT technique using ImageJ software. Microhardness samples were subjected to Vickers indentations followed by calculation of microhardness and percentage mineral volume values using respective mathematical measures. Data were analyzed using paired t-test at a significance level of 5%. Qualitative analysis of the enamel microstructure was done with two-dimensional projection images and scanned electron micrographs using µCT and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Results: Vickers microhardness and SRµCT techniques showed a decrease in microhardness and an increase in mineral density, respectively, in postirradiated samples. These changes were related to mineral density variation and alteration of hydroxyapatite crystal lattice in enamel surface. Enamel microstructure showed key features such as microporosities and loss of smooth homogeneous surface. These indicate tribological loss and delamination of enamel which might lead to radiation caries. Conclusions: Tooth surface loss might be a major contributing factor for radiation caries in head-and-neck cancer patients prescribed to radiotherapy. Such direct effects of radiotherapy cause enamel abrasion, delamination, and damage to the dentinoenamel junction. Suitable measures should, therefore, be worked out to protect nontarget oral tissues such as teeth while delivering effective dosages to target regions.","Kudkuli, Jagadish; Agrawal, Ashish; Gurjar, Om Prakash; Sharma, Sunil Dutt; Rekha, P D; Manzoor, Muhammed A P; Singh, Balwant; Rao, B S; Abdulla, Riaz",J Cancer Res Ther,758,23

During the so-called 'first wave', infection rates among this population group have ranged between 10% and 20%, raising as high as one in every four COVID-19 patients in Spain at the peak of the crisis. Now that many countries are already dealing with new waves of COVID-19 cases, a potential competition between HCW and non-HCW patients for scarce resources can still be a likely clinical scenario. In this paper, we address the question of whether HCW who become ill with COVID-19 should be prioritised in diagnostic, treatment or resource allocation protocols. We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCW's access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","Real de Asua, Diego; Fins, Joseph J",J. med. ethics,758,1

We screened a highly focused library of compounds containing covalent warheads designed to target cysteine proteases to identify new lead scaffolds for both M(pro) and PL(pro) proteases. These efforts identified a small number of hits for the M(pro) protease and no viable hits for the PL(pro) protease. Of the M(pro) hits identified as inhibitors of the purified recombinant protease, only two compounds inhibited viral infectivity in cellular infection assays. However, we observed a substantial drop in antiviral potency upon expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane serine protease that acts in an alternative viral entry pathway to the lysosomal cathepsins. This loss of potency is explained by the fact that our lead M(pro) inhibitors are also potent inhibitors of host cell cysteine cathepsins. To determine if this is a general property of M(pro) inhibitors, we evaluated several recently reported compounds and found that they are also effective inhibitors of purified human cathepsins L and B and showed similar loss in activity in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Our results highlight the challenges of targeting M(pro) and PL(pro) proteases and demonstrate the need to carefully assess selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors to prevent clinical advancement of compounds that function through inhibition of a redundant viral entry pathway.","Steuten, Kas; Kim, Heeyoung; Widen, John C.; Babin, Brett M.; Onguka, Ouma; Lovell, Scott; Bolgi, Oguz; Cerikan, Berati; Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Cortese, Mirko; Muir, Ryan K.; Bennett, John M.; Geiss-Friedlander, Ruth; Peters, Christoph; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Bogyo, Matthew",ACS Infect Dis,758,10

Here, we characterize a canine alphacoronavirus, designated CCoV-A76, first isolated in 1976. Serological studies show that CCoV-A76 is distinct from other CCoVs, such as the prototype CCoV-1-71. Efficient replication of CCoV-A76 is restricted to canine cell lines, in contrast to the prototypical type II strain CCoV-1-71 that more efficiently replicates in feline cells. CCoV-A76 can use canine aminopeptidase N (cAPN) receptor for infection of cells, but was unable to use feline APN (fAPN). In contrast, CCoV-1-71 can utilize both. Genomic analysis shows that CCoV-A76 possesses a distinct spike, which is the result of a recombination between type I and type II CCoV, that occurred between the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and C-domain) of the S1 subunit.

Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high- and low-risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results found COVID-19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation.
