Halting face-to-face tutorials resulting in decreased clinical contact for medical students. Prior to the pandemic, we had developed the Virtual Integrated Patient (VIP). Equipped with conversational technology, it provides students online practice in various clinical skills such as history-taking, physical examination and investigations. The aim of this paper is to describe the supplementary use of VIP in the second-year class, in which a pilot study was conducted. Methods: The VIP platform was introduced to the cohort and used to supplement the teaching of history-taking in the ""Communication with Patients"" (CWP) module for second-year students. Traditionally, CWP tutorials involve face-to-face history-taking from standardised patients (SPs). Students, who consented to participating in the trial, had an additional 3 weeks' access to VIP to practice their history-taking skills. They completed a survey on their user experience and satisfaction at the end of the 3 weeks. Results: Out of the 106 participants, 87% strongly agreed or agreed that using VIP helped in remembering the content while 69% of them felt that VIP increased their confidence and competence in history-taking. Conclusion: VIP was well-received by students and showed promise as a tool to supplement history-taking tutorials, prior to students' encounter with SPs and real patients. Hence, this trend showed its potential as an alternative when clinical rotations were delayed or cancelled. Further research can be done to evaluate its effectiveness in this context.

One of these paths can bring about the development of business tourism, including the industry of the organisation of meetings and events. The unique and attractive character of the place can favour taking such a direction. The business tourism sector can therefore become an instrument contributing to the sustainable metropolisation of the city by building up its position in the global network of flows. The development of the meetings and events sector allows, therefore, for a change of image, for a re-evaluation of endogenous resources, including those relating to the industrial past, and for tapping into the unlimited resources of the global network. Increased attention in this network may lead to an influx of more events, and of investors as well. Replacing heavy industry with an enlarged service sector and modern industry based on flexible and innovative small and medium-sized enterprises fosters sustainable development. The meetings and events industry can become a tool for sustainable development and the promotion of its ideas, related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The trajec-tory outlined above seems very promising. However, to some extent, it is just a hypothesis. The author undertakes to test it on the example of Katowice, a former industrial city which has decided to follow the route outlined above to become a city that hosts many events, including the COP24 summit in 2018. In the article, the author presents empirical research studies whose authors tried to determine whether the path the city has chosen has a real impact on its image and development. The author also deals with the question of the sustainability of such a development path and the conditions for its self-support in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. © Autorzy 2021","Pyka, R.",Studia Regionalne i Lokalne,764,16

An advent of a mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in December 2019, traced from the seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China, spread the wings over the world in very short span. Like both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) and MERS-CoV infections, the risk of severe disease increases substantially with age and with the presence of underlying conditions. While cancer is a prevalent disease and a global health challenge, little information is available with regard to the implications of COVID-19 for cancer patients. So far, the data have been limited and fragmented. COVID-19 with different primary cancer types will have different biological behaviours with highly variable disease courses and diverse treatment strategies. Any generalized conclusions for all cancer patients with respect to COVID-19 should be interpreted with caution until we have sufficient prospective data. Enormous work needs to be done to study the specific unmet needs of cancer patients with the challenge of the COVID-19; the prevention still is the best remedy. Infection control measures should be enforced continuously, and public health education and engagement should be highly recommended. We propose to join hands together to combat against COVID-19 with some simple tips for our cancer patients to raise their awareness of this public health challenge-combating against COVID-19 with 'COVID:' Continue 'social distancing;' Omit unnecessary face-to-face meting or meal gathering or mass event, make use of cyber meeting, and bring one's own lunch box to work; Visage protection, i.e. universal precaution with surgical masks when going out in a large crowd such as public transport or any close contact in high-risk area; Infection control of the hands with hand hygiene at all times and; Diet, lifestyle, and exercise continue to be balanced and healthy.","Tsang, Janice; Bajpai, Jyoti",Indian J.

However, the mechanism through which psychosocial safety climate exerts its effect needs further investigation. Therefore, this study investigated the indirect effect of work self-efficacy in the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and workplace safety behaviors. Methodology: Participants, who were 155 bank workers (F=66.5%;mean age= 33.9, SD=6.4), responded to an online survey of workplace safety behavior scale (WSBS), psychosocial safety climate scale (PSC-12), and work self-efficacy scale (WSES). Results: Results from correlational analyses revealed that psychosocial safety climate positively related to workplace safety behaviors. Moreover, work self-efficacy positively correlated to workplace safety behaviors. The mediation analysis using Hayes Process Macros indicated an indirect effect of work self-efficacy in the relationship between psychosocial safety climate and workplace safety behaviors. Creating a psychosocially safe climate may enhance bank workers' safety behaviors in the period after the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021 Abimbola A. Akanni et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Akanni, A.

This retrospective study is based on a single-center cohort including 657 fresh cycles with day 3 embryo transfer using the GnRHa long protocol and the GnRHant flexible protocol at the fertility clinic of a university hospital between 2005 and 2019. The rate ratios (RR) of clinical pregnancy were evaluated using log-binomial regression depending on the categories by the number of retrieved oocytes and pituitary suppression methods. After controlling for age, body mass index, and basal follicle-stimulating hormone, women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved demonstrated a significantly higher chance of clinical pregnancy compared to the reference group (4-5 oocytes) (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53). However, retrieval of more than 11 oocytes did not show a significant difference in pregnancy rates (PR) from the reference group. In women treated with GnRHant, a significantly higher clinical PR was also observed in women with 10-11 oocytes retrieved compared to the reference group (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.05-3.42). In women treated with GnRHa long protocol, a higher probability of clinical pregnancy was observed (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.98-1.73) in the group with 8-11 oocytes retrieved and it demonstrated borderline statistical significance (P = 0.07). In summary, the optimal number of oocytes for maximizing the rate of a clinical pregnancy is different according to the method of pituitary suppression. Too many oocytes do not seem to be beneficial for achieving better clinical outcomes.","Kim, Hoon; Han, Soo Jin; Hong, Yun Soo; Kim, Sung Woo; Ku, Seung-Yup; Suh, Chang Suk; Kim, Seok Hyun",Reprod. sci,764,16

Most COVID-19-Pregnancy patients showed mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss and no congenital transmission of the virus; however, an increase in hypoxia-induced preterm deliveries was apparent. Also, the breastmilk of several mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for the virus. Taken together, the natural barrier function during pregnancy and postpartum seems to deter the SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mother-to-child. This clinical observation warrants to explore the maternal-fetal interface and identify the innate defense factors for prevention and control of COVID-19-Pregnancy. Lactoferrin (LF) is a potent antiviral iron-binding protein present in the maternal-fetal interface. In concert with immune co-factors, maternal-LF modulates chemokine release and lymphocyte migration and amplify host defense during pregnancy. LF levels during pregnancy may resolve hypertension via down-regulation of ACE2; consequently, may limit the membrane receptor access to SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. Furthermore, an LF-derived peptide (LRPVAA) has been shown to block ACE receptor activity in vitro. LF may also reduce viral docking and entry into host cells and limit the early phase of COVID-19 infection. An in-depth understanding of LF and other soluble mammalian milk-derived innate antiviral factors may provide insights to reduce co-morbidities and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may lead to the development of effective nutraceutical supplements.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Clemens, Roger A; Pressman, Peter; Zaigham, Mehreen; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,764,26

Patients hospitalized with active cancer are predisposed to thrombosis but whether active cancer further amplifies thrombotic risk with COVID-19 is not known. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cumulative incidences of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without active cancer at 28 days. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive adults hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed. Active cancer required cancer-directed therapy within previous 6 months. The cumulative incidences of thrombosis or hemorrhage were estimated considering death as a competing risk. RESULTS: Patients without cancer (n = 353) and active cancer (n = 45) were comparable in terms of age, sex, antibiotics administered, length of hospitalization, and critical care. The most common malignancies were lymphoid (17.8%), gastrointestinal (15.6%), lung (13.3%), and genitourinary (13.3%). At day 28, the cumulative incidence of thrombotic events was 18.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.2%-27.9%) in the non-cancer cohort and 14.2% (95% CI, 4.7%-28.7%) in the cancer cohort. The cumulative incidence of major and fatal bleeding at day 28 was 20.8% (95% CI, 12.1%-31.0%) in the non-cancer group and 19.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-39.8%) in the cancer cohort.

Present study design to determine the diagnostic value of LUS in the evaluation of children with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: Prospective multicenter study, 40 children with confirmed COVID-19 were included. LUS was performed to all patients at admission. The chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) were performed according to the decision of the primary physicians. LUS results were compared with chest X-ray and CT findings and diagnostic performance was determined. RESULTS: Of the 40 children median (range) was 10.5 (0.4-17.8) years. Chest X-ray and LUS were performed on all and chest CT was performed on 28 (70%) patients at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen (40%) patients had no apparent chest CT abnormalities suggestive of COVID-19, whereas 12 (30%) had abnormalities. LUS confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in 10 of 12 patients with positive CT findings. LUS demonstrated normal lung patterns among 15 of 16 patients who had normal CT features. The sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (area under the ROC curve) identified by the chest X-ray and LUS tests were compared and statistically significantly different (McNemar's test: p = .016 and p = .001 respectively) detected.

The timely availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming, several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials. As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which four have cleared phase III trials (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273, University of Oxford & AstraZeneca's AZD1222, and Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine). Despite the acquisition of a vast body of scientific information, treatment depends only on the clinical management of the disease through supportive care. At the pandemic's 1-year mark, we summarize current information on SARS-CoV-2 origin and biology, and advances in the development of therapeutics.

Apart from the traditional nasopharyngeal swab used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, alternative specimens have been validated such as a combined swabs of the oropharynx and anterior nares (OP/N), or throat samples using saline gargles. Both the alternative specimen types are amenable to self-collection. Objectives. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity of HCW-collected (OP/N) swabs, self-collected OP/N swabs, and self-collected saline gargles. Among 38 individuals previously testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (or their close contacts), two self-collected specimen types (OP/N and saline gargles) were compared to HCW-collected OP/N swabs. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on three molecular assays: a laboratory-developed test (LDT), and two commercial assays on automated platforms: Cobas 6800 (Roche Diagnostics) and Panther (Hologic). The sensitivity of self-collected OP/N swabs was equivalent to healthcare worker (HCW)-collected OP/N swabs at 100.0% [92.6% to 100.0%] for all three molecular tests. The sensitivity of saline gargles was not significantly different than HCW-collected OP/N swabs, but varied slightly between instruments at 93.8% [85.9% to 93.8%] for the LDT, 96.8% [88.6% to 96.8%] for the Cobas assay, and 96.7% [89.2% to 96.9%] for the Panther assay. Overall, self-collection using OP/N swabs or saline gargles are reasonable alternatives to HCW-based collections for SARS-CoV-2 detection, and could facilitate broader surveillance strategies.","LeBlanc, Jason J; Pettipas, Janice; Di Quinzio, Melanie; Hatchette, Todd F; Patriquin, Glenn",J Virol Methods,764,24

METHODS: For this retrospective study, a radiomics model was developed on the basis of a training set consisting of 136 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 103 patients with other types of viral pneumonia. Radiomics features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window. A radiomics signature was built on the basis of reproducible features, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO). Multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram performance was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. The model was validated in 90 consecutive patients, of which 56 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and 34 patients had other types of viral pneumonia. RESULTS: The radiomics signature, consisting of 3 selected features, was significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia (p < 0.05) in both training and validation sets. The multivariable logistic regression model included the radiomics signature and distribution; maximum lesion, hilar, and mediastinal lymph node enlargement; and pleural effusion. The individualized prediction nomogram showed good discrimination in the training sample (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.959; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.933-0.985) and in the validation sample (AUC, 0.955; 95% CI, 0.899-0.995) and good calibration. The mixed model achieved better predictive efficacy than the clinical model. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics model derived has good performance for predicting COVID-19 pneumonia and may help in clinical decision-making. KEY POINTS: â¢ A radiomics model showed good performance for prediction 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and favorable discrimination for other types of pneumonia on CT images. â¢ A central or peripheral distribution, a maximum lesion range > 10 cm, the involvement of all five lobes, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and no pleural effusion is associated with an increased risk of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. â¢ A radiomics model was superior to a clinical model in predicting 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Fang, Xu; Li, Xiao; Bian, Yun; Ji, Xiang; Lu, Jianping",Eur Radiol,764,32

Ageing is associated with progressive changes in muscle metabolism and a decline in functional capacity, leading to a loss of independence. Muscle metabolic changes associated with ageing have been linked to alterations in muscle architecture and declines in muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. However, the biological features often attributed to muscle ageing are also seen in controlled studies of physical inactivity (e.g. reduced step-count and bed-rest), and it is currently unclear how many of these ageing features are due to ageing per se or sedentarism. This is particularly relevant at a time of home confinements reducing physical activity levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. Current knowledge gaps include the relative contribution that physical inactivity plays in the development of many of the negative features associated with muscle decline in older age. Similarly, data demonstrating positive effects of government recommended physical activity guidelines on muscle health are largely non-existent. It is imperative therefore that research examining interactions between ageing, physical activity and muscle mass and metabolic health is prioritised so that it can inform on the “normal” muscle ageing process and on strategies for improving health span and well-being. This review will focus on important changes in muscle architecture and metabolism that accompany ageing and highlight the likely contribution of physical inactivity to these changes.","Shur, N.F.; Creedon, L.; Skirrow, S.; Atherton, P.J.; MacDonald, I.A.; Lund, J.; Greenhaff, P.L.",Ageing Res Rev,764,1
