2624,Surveillance of Australian Hajj pilgrims for carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria: Data from two pilot studies,2017-03-16,"AIM: To estimate the pharyngeal carriage rate of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) among Australian Hajj pilgrims. METHODS: In 2014, surveillance was conducted in two phases among Australian Hajj pilgrims: The first phase during Hajj in Mina, and the second phase soon after returning home to Australia. Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were taken from participants then tested, firstly by nucleic acid testing, and also by standard culture. RESULTS: Of 183 participants recruited in the first phase, 26 (14.2%) tested positive for S. pneumoniae; 4 had received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Only one tested positive for N. meningitidis (W). Of 93 2(nd) phase samples cultured, 17 (18.3%) grew S. aureus, all methicillin sensitive, 2 (2.2%) grew N. meningitidis (on subculture; one serotype B, one negative), and 1 (1%), from an unvaccinated pilgrim, grew S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Relatively high carriage of S. pneumoniae and little meningococcal carriage was found. This indicates the importance of a larger study for improved infection surveillance and possible vaccine evaluation.","Azeem, Mohammad Irfan; Tashani, Mohamed; Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Heron, Leon; Pedersen, Kristen; Jeoffreys, Neisha; Kok, Jen; Haworth, Elizabeth; Dwyer, Dominic E; Hill-Cawthorne, Grant; Rashid, Harunor; Booy, Robert",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5352958/,564

8607,Lenguaje médico: el rayo neológico que no cesa,2013-04-05,"This chapter discusses the newer modifications of immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) methods in both plant and animal virology. ISEM methods presented in the chapter include all the techniques where the “solid phase principle” is essential in a way similar to other solid phase immunoassays. These methods include (1) the antibody-coated grid technique (AB-CGT); (2) the protein A-coated grid technique (PA-CGT); (3) the protein A-coated bacteria technique (PA-CBT); and (4) the antigen-coated grid technique (AG-CGT). In all ISEM methods, one of the components of the system is adsorbed to a solid phase. In AG-CGT, PA-CGT, and AB-CGT, one of the reagents is adsorbed to an electron microscopic grid, while in PA-CBT protein A is naturally present on the surface of a bacterium that serves as a solid support. In ISEM methods, the viruses can be statistically evaluated and numerically expressed as number of virions per unit of area, and can, therefore, be statistically evaluated. Thus, these methods optimize the results of a test by quantifying the effects of the quality of the supporting grid, the time of adsorption, the pH, the presence of salts, and the type of staining. The ISEM also permits a detailed study of antigenic variations in the same genus of virus, and thus would visually pinpoint the type or strain differences.","Katz, David; Kohn, Alexander",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130987/,564

8673,Síndrome respiratorio agudo grave,2013-04-05,"Recombination is an important aspect of DNA metabolism. It leads to rearrangements of DNA sequences within genomes. Such genome rearrangements seem to be ubiquitous, since they play a role in evolution, human health and biotechnology. In medicine one important aspect of recombination is its role as one possible step in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Since recombination may occur as a cellular response to DNA damage, the protection of cells from recombination-inducing agents, so-called recombinagen, should eliminate possible deleterious effects resulting from damage-induced DNA recombination. During the last few years, the awareness of the importance of recombination phenomena has substantially increased and the development of assay systems detecting recombinagens has progressed. The need for considering recombinagenic effects as a safety aspect of chemicals has gained ground in the field of genetic toxicology. This paper summarizes present knowledge concerning the occurence, inducibility, detection and toxicological interpretation of DNA recombination.","Würgler, F.E.",Mutat Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131386/,564

10528,Agenda,2020-04-23,"Human enteric viruses are associated with several clinical features, especially gastroenteritis. Large amounts of these viruses can be released in the environment and spread to people. Enteric viruses are nonenveloped viruses and have displayed good survival in the environment. They can be significantly resistant in food and water but also on fomites, and this is thought to play a role in transmission, leading to sporadic cases or outbreaks. The survival of enteric viruses on fomites relies on many factors including the virus itself, fomite properties, and extrinsic environmental factors such as temperature or relative humidity. Several reports in the literature have found an association with gastroenteritis cases or outbreaks and fomites naturally contaminated by enteric viruses. However, the study of virus survival following natural contamination is challenging, and most published studies are laboratory based, using experimental contamination. In addition, recent and detailed data on the resistance of each of the main enteric viruses on fomites are scarce. Many approaches, both physical and chemical, can be used to inactivate enteric viruses, the efficacy of which depends on the virus and the disinfection conditions.","Alidjinou, Enagnon Kazali; Sane, Famara; Firquet, Swan; Lobert, Pierre-Emmanuel; Hober, Didier",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179519/,564
10596,Revue de presse,2020-04-28,"In the course of sequencing telomeric chromosomal regions of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga, we encountered an unusual DNA transposon. Unlike other bdelloid and, more generally, eukaryotic transposable elements (TEs), it exhibits similarity to prokaryotic insertion sequences (ISs). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this transposon, named IS5_Av, is related to the ISL2 group of the IS5 family of bacterial IS elements. Despite the apparent intactness of the single open reading frame coding for a DDE transposase and the perfect identity of its 213-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), the element is present in only one copy per diploid genome. It does not exhibit any detectable levels of transcription, so that its transposase gene appears to be silent in the bdelloid host. Although horizontal transfers of TEs between kingdoms are not known to happen in nature, it appears likely that IS5_Av underwent integration into the A. vaga genome relatively recently, but was not successful in adapting to the new host and failed to increase in copy number. Alternatively, it might be the only known member of a novel eukaryotic DNA TE superfamily which is so rare that its other members, if any, have not yet been identified in eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date.","Gladyshev, Eugene A.; Arkhipova, Irina R.",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7187635/,564

Expression of Laf genes has previously been reported to be regulated by the quorum sensing (QS) regulators AphA and OpaR. In the present study, we showed that OpaR, the QS regulator at high cell density (HCD), acted as a negative regulator of swimming motility and the transcription of Pof genes in V. parahaemolyticus. OpaR bound to the promoter-proximal DNA regions of flgAMN, flgMN, and flgBCDEFGHIJ within the Pof gene loci to repress their transcription, whereas it negatively regulates the transcription of flgKL-flaC in an indirect manner. Thus, this work investigated how QS regulated the swimming motility via direct action of its master regulator OpaR on the transcription of Pof genes in V. parahaemolyticus.","Lu, Renfei; Sun, Junfang; Qiu, Yue; Zhang, Miaomiao; Xue, Xingfan; Li, Xue; Yang, Wenhui; Zhou, Dongsheng; Hu, Lingfei; Zhang, Yiquan",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8167305/,564

Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results confirmed that all four UTAUT constructs; performance expectancy (“the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance”), effort expectancy (“the degree of ease associated with the use of the system”, social influence (“the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system”) and facilitating conditions (“the degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system”), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.","Petersen, Fazlyn; Jacobs, Mariam; Pather, Shaun","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134297/,564

RECENT FINDINGS: Reactive arthritis is considered to be part of the spectrum of the spondyloarthritis. Its epidemiology is changing worldwide due to several reasons, among them are as follows: different diagnosis approach and clinical presentations, different grades of infection, microbiome changes, etc. The understanding of pathophysiological models is challenging, but recent studies contribute to elucidate the major factors involved in the development of the disease. The management of ReA depends on the triggering agent and the phase of disease, whether it is acute or chronic. SUMMARY: The association between the microbiome changes and spondyloarthropathies (ReA) is becoming increasingly evident. The results regarding the biologic treatment on refectory ReA are promising.","Bentaleb, Ibtissam; Abdelghani, Kawther Ben; Rostom, Samira; Amine, Bouchra; Laatar, Ahmed; Bahiri, Rachid",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7519381/,564

This increase in data transmission also poses greater risk of various attacks which hamper data authenticity, integrity and quality. Therefore, efficient mechanisms are required that can handle robust transmission of digital data while honoring the Digital Right Management (DRM) protection measures of copyrighted content. In this paper, we explore an optimized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based watermarking scheme on digital images in the hybrid Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Singular value decomposition (SVD) transform. The watermark is embedded in the host images by using both single scaling and multiple scaling factors for optimizing the visual quality of the signed images viz-a-viz robustness. Eight gray-scale and six colored images are used to carry out the experiments. Comparison of the proposed watermarking scheme with other techniques ascertain the proposed scheme outperforms others and it also fulfills all requisite conditions to be a robust and optimized watermarking scheme.","Bansal, Megha; Mishra, Anurag; Sharma, Arpita",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974989/,564

It comes from the fact that they are designed by programmers that as a rule give more importance to efficient data moving than to reflecting existing business and control processes and to precise personal or organizational responsibility. It results in non-trivial issues when looking for reasons and responsibility for improper system behaviour and its overall quality. Another serious issue is that the requirements on the systems are changing during their development and use. Accommodation to the changes often introduces new serious issues to the systems. Proper support for responsibility and flexibility is a necessary precondition for solving the issues or for recovery from them. We cope with those issues by proposing software architecture simplifying alignment of software with responsibility domains. The solution is enabled by a proper application of specific software service types described here. The proposed solution significantly improves system and organizational flexibility and openness and brings many other interesting engineering advantages.

Consideraciones sobre su uso en el enfermo agudo,2021-04-15,"INTRODUCTION: During Covid-19 many staff members were redeployed to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with little opportunity to train in the new skills they would require. One such skill was the transfer of a critically ill, and contagious, patient from ICU; a risky and complicated procedure which requires planning, preparation, risk assessment, situational awareness and, ideally, experience. To assist our colleagues in this skill an existing ICU transfer course has been adapted to cover the Covid-19 situation, or any similar contagious pandemic, in patient transfer. METHODS: An in-situ simulation method was chosen as the most realistic method of immersing our participants into the environment of ICU and to highlight real-life complexities and issues they may face. A multidisciplinary training session was devised so that novice anaesthetists, ACCPs and nurses could learn together, reflective of the usual team. Human factors such as communication, team leadership, task management and situational awareness are the focus of the post-simulation debrief, and human factors sheets have been created to guide the participants in analysing these skills. Pre- and post-simulation confidence, knowledge and attitudes will be assessed using validated appraisal tools and questionnaires to gather both quantitative and qualitative data about the experience. DISCUSSION: Multidisciplinary training is often difficult to arrange, due to the different requirements, processes, and procedures each department demands. A hidden blessing of Covid-19 is the realisation that this barrier can be broken, for the benefit of our patients and colleagues alike, and training sessions like this implemented.","Tebbett, Alex; Purcell, Ian; Watton, Shereen; Shanmugham, Rathinavel; Tebbett, Alexandra",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030129/,564

Recent large-scale disasters have emphasized the importance of disaster preparedness, including supporting dialysis units, for people with chronic disease. Contingency plans for staffing are important for providing continuity of care for a technically challenging procedure such as dialysis. PReparing Emergency Personnel in Dialysis (PREP-D) is a just-in-time training program designed to train individuals having minimum familiarity with the basic steps of dialysis to support routine dialysis staff during a disaster. METHODS A 5-module educational program was developed through a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort. A pilot study testing the program was performed using 20 nontechnician dialysis facility employees and 20 clinical-year medical students as subjects. RESULTS When comparing pretest and posttest scores, the entire study population showed a mean improvement of 28.9%, with dialysis facility employees and medical students showing improvements of 21.8% and 36.4%, respectively (P < .05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS PREP-D participants were able to demonstrate improved tests scores when taught in a just-in-time training format. The knowledge gained by using the PREP-D program during a staffing shortage may allow for continuity of care for critical services such as dialysis during a disaster.","Stoler, Genevieve B; Johnston, James R; Stevenson, Judy A; Suyama, Joe",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1001/dmp.2011.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21527642/,564

The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised. RESULTS A total of 25 studies met the inclusion criteria, 23 of which involved prostate cancer risk reduction. Twenty-one studies reported knowledge gain among the men. Three studies found that knowledge gain was associated with health literacy. CONCLUSIONS Interventions aiming to improve men's knowledge about cancer risk reduction require a multimodal approach. Findings highlight the need to design and measure the impact of interventions for men on wider cancer risk reduction topics, while accounting for different socio-demographic and ethnic groups, literacy and health literacy levels.

We describe an in vitro BBB model system using human brain microvascular endothelial cells that incorporates shear forces mimicking blood flow to elucidate how chemokine receptor expression is modulated during leukocyte transmigration. In the presence of the chemokine CXCL12, we examined modulation of its receptor CXCR4 on human T cells, B cells, and monocytes transmigrating across the BBB under flow conditions. CXCL12 stimulated transmigration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD14(+) monocytes. Transmigration was blocked by CXCR4-neutralizing antibodies. Unexpectedly, CXCL12 selectively down-regulated CXCR4 on transmigrating monocytes, but not T cells. Monocytes underwent preferential CXCL12-mediated adhesion to the BBB in vitro compared with lymphocytes. These findings provide new insights into leukocyte-endothelial interactions at the BBB under conditions mimicking blood flow and suggest that in vitro BBB models may be useful for identifying chemokine receptors that could be modulated therapeutically to reduce neuroinflammation in diseases such as MS.","Man, Shumei; Tucky, Barbara; Cotleur, Anne; Drazba, Judith; Takeshita, Yukio; Ransohoff, Richard M",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3003197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22301555/,564

The pandemic began in China and has spread throughout the world. This new coronavirus has a high transmission capacity and elevated lethality in people over 60 years old and in those with risk factors (obesity, diabetes, and systemic arterial hypertension); those characteristics have a different proportion in each country. At present, there is no specific, effective, and safe treatment to treat this virus. In this review, an analysis is made on the differences in epidemiological aspects of the disease and its presentation in pediatric patients; the poorly-based recommendation for using an empirical combination of antimalarials plus antimicrobials as antiviral treatment; the indication of intravenous steroids; and the possible influence of antihypertensive drugs on the course of the disease.","Márquez-González, Horacio; Miranda-Novales, María G; Solórzano-Santos, Fortino; Klunder-Klunder, Miguel; Garduño-Espinoza, Juan; Méndez-Galván, Jorge F",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.20000166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064677/,564

The virus can attack many organ systems and causes a broad range of signs, commonly including weight loss and fever. Regardless of presentation, FIP is ultimately fatal and often presents a diagnostic challenge. In May 2010, a malnourished young adult male mountain lion (Puma concolor) from Kern County, California, USA was euthanized because of concern for public safety, and a postmortem examination was performed. Gross necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed necrotizing, multifocal myocarditis; necrotizing, neutrophilic, and histiocytic myositis and vasculitis of the tunica muscularis layer of the small and large intestines; and embolic, multifocal, interstitial pneumonia. Feline coronavirus antigen was detected in both the heart and intestinal tissue by immunohistochemistry. A PCR for coronavirus performed on kidney tissue was positive, confirming a diagnosis of FIP.

The PI3K-Akt-mTOR kinase pathway plays a vital role in pro-survival signals within leukemic cells and inhibition of this pathway is being investigated to improve patient outcomes. Tracking activation of multiple signaling proteins simultaneously in patient samples can be challenging especially with limiting cell numbers within rare sub-populations. METHODS The NanoPro 1000 system (ProteinSimple) is built on an automated, capillary-based immunoassay platform and enables a rapid and quantitative analysis of specific proteins and their phosphorylation states. We have utilized this nano-immunoassay to examine activation of Akt 1/2/3 and downstream mTOR target--eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-Binding Protein 1 (4EBP1). RESULTS Assays for Akt 1/2/3 and 4EBP1 were standardized using AML cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-14, OCI-AML3 and HL-60) prior to testing in patient samples. Target inhibition was studied using mTOR 1/2 inhibitor AZD-8055 and results were corroborated by Western blotting. The assay was able to quantify nanogram amounts of 4EBP1 and Akt 1/2/3 in AML cell lines and primary pediatric AML samples and results were quantifiable, consistent and reproducible. CONCLUSION Our data provides a strong basis for testing this platform on a larger scale and our long term aim is to utilize this nano-immunoassay prospectively in de-novo AML to be able to identify poor responders who might benefit from early introduction of targeted therapy.","Sabnis, Himalee; Bradley, Heath L; Bunting, Silvia T; Cooper, Todd M; Bunting, Kevin D",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-12-166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923301/,564

Due to a lack of specific treatment and prophylaxis, protective health measures that can reduce infection severity and COVID-19 mortality are urgently required. Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can be linked to an increased risk of viral infection, including COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, we looked at various possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity. We describe in this article that individuals at high risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider taking vitamin D supplements to keep optimal concentrations. Moreover, we discuss different possible mechanisms by which vitamin D can efficiently reduce the risk of infections through modulation of innate and adaptive immunity against various types of infections. It is advisable to perform further studies addressing the observed influence of vitamin D levels to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality.","Hetta, H F; Muhammad, K; El-Masry, E A; Taha, A E; Ahmed, E A; Phares, C; Kader, H A; Waheed, Y; Zahran, A M; Yahia, R; Meshaal, A Kh; El-Saber Batiha, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202102_25119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660833/,564

As an alternative, an increasing number of these patients are choosing to cryopreserve ovarian tissue for autograft following recovery and remission. Despite improvements in outcomes among patients undergoing auto-transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue, efficient revascularization of grafted tissue remains a major obstacle. To mitigate ischemia and thus improve outcomes in patients undergoing auto-transplantation, we developed a vascular cell-based strategy for accelerating perfusion of ovarian tissue. We describe a method for co-transplantation of exogenous endothelial cells (ExECs) with cryopreserved ovarian tissue in a mouse xenograft model. We extend this approach to employ ExECs that have been engineered to constitutively express Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), thus enabling sustained paracrine signaling input to ovarian grafts. Co-transplantation with ExECs increased follicular volume and improved antral follicle development, and AMH-expressing ExECs promoted retention of quiescent primordial follicles. This combined strategy may be a useful tool for mitigating ischemia and modulating follicular activation in the context of fertility preservation and/or infertility at large.","Man, Limor; Park, Laura; Bodine, Richard; Ginsberg, Michael; Zaninovic, Nikica; Schattman, Glenn; Schwartz, Robert E; Rosenwaks, Zev; James, Daylon",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/57472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29863664/,564

The pandemic has required pain clinics to transition in-person visits to telemedicine, postpone procedures and cancel face-to-face educational sessions. There are no data on how fellowship programs have adapted. METHODS A 17-question survey was developed covering topics including changes in education, clinical care, and psychological stress due to the COVID pandemic. The survey was hosted by Qualtrics Inc. and disseminated by the Association of Pain Program Directors on April 10, 2020 to program directors at ACGME-accredited fellowships. Results are reported descriptively and stratified by COVID infection rate, which was calculated from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on state infections, and census data. RESULTS Among 107 surveys distributed, 70 (65%) programs responded. Twenty-nine programs were located in states in the upper tertile for per capita infection rates, 17 in the middle third, and 23 in the lowest tertile. Nearly all programs (93%) reported a decreased workload, with 11 (16%) reporting a dramatic decrease (only urgent or emergent cases). Just over half of programs had either already deployed (14%) or credentialed (39%) fellows to provide non-pain care. Higher state infection rates were significantly associated with reduced clinical demand (Rs = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.51], P = .011) and redeployment of fellows to non-pain areas (Rs = 0.30, 95% CI [0.07, 0.50], P = .013). Larger program size but not infection rate was associated with increased perceived anxiety level of trainees. CONCLUSIONS We found a shift to online alternatives for clinical care and education, with correlations between per capita infection rates, and clinical care demands and redeployment, but not with overall trainee anxiety levels. It is likely that medicine in general, and pain medicine in particular, will change after COVID-19, with greater emphasis on telemedicine, virtual education, and greater national and international cooperation. Physicians should be prepared for these changes.","Kohan, Lynn; Durbhakula, Shravani; Zaidi, Munfarid; Phillips, Cdr Christopher R; Rowan, Cody C; Brenner, Gary J; Cohen, Steven P",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177326/,564

The procedure is typically performed by an ophthalmologist; however, there is potential for suitably trained non-medical professionals to deliver the therapy. This scoping review will identify service delivery models where SLT is delivered by non-medical professionals worldwide, with a focus on optometrists. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the following databases will be conducted: CINAHL; MEDLINE Complete; Embase; HMIC and Ovid Emcare. For inclusion, studies must examine healthcare models of SLT delivery by optometrists and describe one of the following outcomes: training procedures; clinical effectiveness; safety and cost-effectiveness.

The need for a tailored, peer-led group programme was raised by parent carers, who co-developed the Healthy Parent Carers programme with researchers. This study aimed to test the feasibility of programme delivery in community settings, and the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial design. METHODS Participants were individually randomised with concealed allocation to a structured group programme and access to online resources (intervention), or access to the online resources only (control). Measures of wellbeing and secondary and economic outcomes were collected before randomisation, immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Descriptive statistics on recruitment and attrition, demographics, attendance, and fidelity of intervention delivery were analysed with feedback on the acceptability of the trial design. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-three parent carers expressed an interest in taking part. Ninety-two participants recruited from across six sites were randomised (47 intervention, 45 control). Lead and assistant facilitators were trained and delivered the group sessions. Sixteen (34%) participants in the intervention arm did not attend any sessions, and attendance varied across sites and sessions. One participant withdrew post-randomisation, and 83 (90%) participants completed outcome measures at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated that it was feasible to deliver the programme in community settings. The number of parent carers who expressed interest signifies the need for such a programme and the feasibility of recruiting to a definitive trial. Loss to follow-up was low. Further research is needed to explore ways to reduce barriers to participation in person and assess the feasibility and acceptability of programme content and delivery for more ethnically diverse groups, and potentially using interpreters. Given the Covid-19 pandemic and delivery format feedback, there is also a need to investigate remote or blended delivery strategies. Although the results indicate that a definitive trial is feasible, programme impact would be strengthened through exploration of these uncertainties.

To understand the emerging pattern of racial inequality in the effects of COVID-19, we examined the relative burden of social vulnerability and health risk factors. We found significant spatial clusters of social vulnerability and risk factors, both of which are significantly associated with the increased COVID-19-related death rate. We also found that a higher percentage of African Americans was associated with increased levels of social vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, the proportion of African American residents has an independent effect on the COVID-19 death rate. We argue that existing inequity is often highlighted in emergency conditions.

An epidemiologic study conducted in Brazil reported a high incidence of IFD in hematologic patients, and invasive fusariosis was the leading IFD. A limitation of that study was that galactomannan was not available for at least half of the study period. OBJECTIVES Characterize the epidemiology and burden of IFD in three cohorts: HCT, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS), and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). METHODS This is a prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in four hematologic Brazilian centers. From August 2015 to July 2016, all patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML, MDS or ALL, and all HCT recipients receiving conditioning regimen were followed during the period of neutropenia following chemotherapy or the conditioning regimen. RESULTS During a 1-year period, 192 patients were enrolled: 122 HCT recipients (71 allogeneic, 51 autologous), 46 with AML, and 24 with ALL. The global incidence of IFD was 13.0% (25 cases, 11 proven and 14 probable). Invasive aspergillosis (14 cases) was the leading IFD, followed by candidemia (6 cases) and fusariosis (3 cases). The incidence of IFD was 26.1% in AML/MDS, 16.7% in ALL, 11.3% in allogeneic HCT, and 2.0% in autologous HCT. CONCLUSIONS The burden of IFD in hematologic patients in Brazil is high, with a higher frequency in AML and ALL. Invasive aspergillosis is the leading IFD, followed by invasive candidiasis and fusariosis.","Souza, Luciana; Nouér, Simone A; Morales, Hugo; Simões, Belinda; Solza, Cristiana; Queiroz-Telles, Flavio; Nucci, Marcio",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141969/,564

However, further studies are required to evaluate its advantages in colorectal surgery and to know in which procedure this technology has more value. The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of the ICG-FA in the colorectal anastomosis evaluation and to evaluate where it is most useful depending on type of resection performed in terms of change of section line based on the ICG-FA and anastomotic leakage (AL) rates. METHODS This is a prospective study. From September 2014 to November 2018, all patients who underwent any colorectal surgical procedure with ICG-FA in our center were enrolled in the study. Based on the type of surgery, patients were grouped in 4 categories: Group A, right hemicolectomy; Group B, segmental resection of the splenic flexure; Group C, left hemicolectomy; and Group D, anterior resection of the rectum. RESULTS One-hundred-ninety-two unselected consecutive patients were enrolled: 67 in group A, 9 in B, 81 in C, and 35 in D. Change of section line based on ICG-FA occurred in 35 cases (18.2%): 4 in group A (6%), 1 in group B (11.1%), 21 in group C (25.9%), and 9 in group D (25.7%). ALs occurred in 5 patients (2.6%): 2 in group A (3%), 1 in C (1.2%), and 2 in D (5.7%). CONCLUSIONS ICG-FA leads to significantly more changes in the resection line in case of left hemicolectomy followed by anterior resection. FA is a promising optical imaging technique to reduce the AL incidence after colorectal procedures. To confirm this data, further studies with wider sample size and with an objective evaluation of the anastomotic perfusion are required.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Alarcón, Isaias; Yang, Tao; Licardie, Eugenio; Camacho, Violeta; Aguilar Del Castillo, Fátima; Balla, Andrea",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07159-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586247/,564

We detected infectious droplets and aerosols during laboratory-simulated processing of asymptomatic chickens infected with human- (clades 1 and 2.2.1) and avian- (clades 1.1, 2.2, and 2.1) origin H5N1 viruses. We detected fewer airborne infectious particles in simulated processing of infected ducks. Influenza virus-naive chickens and ferrets exposed to the air space in which virus-infected chickens were processed became infected and died, suggesting that the slaughter of infected chickens is an efficient source of airborne virus that can infect birds and mammals. We did not detect consistent infections in ducks and ferrets exposed to the air space in which virus-infected ducks were processed. Our results support the hypothesis that airborne transmission of HPAI viruses can occur among poultry and from poultry to humans during home or live-poultry market slaughter of infected poultry.","Bertran, Kateri; Balzli, Charles; Kwon, Yong-Kuk; Tumpey, Terrence M; Clark, Andrew; Swayne, David E",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2311.170672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29047426/,564

METHODS Retrospective single-center observational study of patients with IRD actively monitored in the Department of Rheumatology who were hospitalized due to COVID- 19. RESULTS 41 (1,8%) out of 2,315 patients admitted due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia suffered from an IRD. The admission Odds ratio (OR) for IRD patients was 1.87 against the general population, and it was higher in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty-seven patients were receiving treatment for IRD with corticosteroids, 23 with conventional DMARDs, 12 with biologics (7 rituximab, 4 anti-TNF and 1 abatacept) and 1 with JAK inhibitors. Ten deaths were registered among patients with IRD. A higher hospitalization rate and a higher number of deaths were observed in patients treated with rituximab (OR=12.8) but not in patients treated with anti-TNF (OR=0.9). CONCLUSION Patients with IRD, especially autoimmune diseases and patients treated with rituximab, may be at higher risk of severe pneumonia due to SARS-Cov 2, compared to the general population. More studies are needed to analyze this association further in order to help managing these patients during the pandemic.","Bachiller-Corral, Javier; Boteanu, Alina; Garcia-Villanueva, Maria Jesus; de la Puente, Carlos; Revenga, Marcelino; Diaz-Miguel, M Consuelo; Rodriguez-Garcia, Ana; Morell-Hita, Jose Luis; Valero, Marta; Larena, Carmen; Blazquez-Cañamero, Maria; Guillen-Astete, Carlos A; Garrote, Sandra; Sobrino, Cristina; Medina-Quiñones, Carmen; Vazquez-Diaz, Mónica",The Journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.200755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722949/,564

This article illuminates the significant roles played by documentation within the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It centres, what it terms as, “COVID-19 signage” as essential extensions of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into society. It posits that this signage helps materialize, mediate and articulate the pandemic from an unseen phenomenon into tangible objects with which people see and interact.Design/methodology/approachThis article presents a documentary typology of COVID-19 signage to provide a conceptual framework in which to situate, approach and analyse this diverse documentation and its implications for social life and traffic. Further, this article offers a case study of Malta's COVID-19 signage that helped materialize, mediate and articulate the pandemic across the European island nation during its national lockdown in the first half of 2020. This case study helps contextualize these signs and serves as a dual contemporary and historical overview of their creation, implementation and use.FindingsThe coronavirus pandemic cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is, in many respects, an abstraction. Documents enable the virus to be seen and the pandemic to be an experienced reality. Specifically, COVID-19 signage materializes the disease and pandemic into tangible items that individuals interact with and see on a daily basis as they navigate society. From personal to environmental to community signs, these documents have come to mediate social life and articulate COVID-19 during this extraordinary health crisis. A material basis of a shared “pandemic social culture” is consequently established by and through this signage and its ubiquity.Research limitations/implicationsThis article can serve as a point of departure for analyses of other kinds of COVID-19 signage in various contexts. It can serve as an anchor or example for other investigations into what other signs were used, including why, when and how they were produced, designed, formatted, implemented, enforced, altered and/or removed. For instance, it could be used for comparative studies between different NPIs and their associated signage, or of the signage appearing between different cities or countries or even the differences in signage at various political and socio-temporal points of the pandemic.Social implicationsIt is dually hoped that this article's documentary typology, and historical snapshot, of COVID-19 signage could help inform how current and future NPIs into society are or can be used to mitigate the coronavirus or other potential health crises as well as serve as both a contemporary and historical snapshot of some of the immediate and early responses to the pandemic.Originality/valueThis documentary typology can be applied to approaches and analyses of other kinds of COVID-19 signage and related documentation. By serving as a conceptual framework in which situate, approach and analyse these documents, it is hoped that this article can help create a sense of clarity in reflections on sign-saturated environments as well as be practically employed for examining and understanding the effective implementation of NPIs in this pandemic and other health crises.","Marc Richard Hugh, Kosciejew",Journal of Documentation,https://doi.org/10.1108/jd-10-2020-0166,564

When robot-assisted language learning (RALL) is used for realizing such systems, L2 learners are provided with a sense of reality and tension similar to that in a real L2 conversation. At the same time, there are increasing demands for remote learning, accelerated in part by the spread of the novel coronavirus. We have therefore developed a robot-avatar-assisted language learning system that simulates a trialogue in English with two robot avatars and a learner for remote learning. The conversation scenarios deal with various daily topics to keep the learner’s interest and the system prompts the learner to acquire oral skills by using specific syntactic forms in conversation. We conducted a six-day remote learning experiment with ten Japanese university students to evaluate the learning effect, using eye gaze as an index of the learners’ degree of concentration. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of our system for remote learning and showed that the learners’ eye gaze activities changed between question answering and repeating tasks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Najima, T.; Kato, T.; Tamura, A.; Yamamoto, S.","24th International Conference on Text, Speech, and Dialogue, TSD 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83527-9_48,564

This project aimed to develop and evaluate the first literacy-sensitive CVD prevention decision aid (DA) developed for people with low health literacy, and investigate the impact of literacy-sensitive design and heart age. Methods: We developed the standard DA based on international standards. The literacy-sensitive version included simple language, supporting images, white space and a lifestyle action plan. A randomised trial included 859 people aged 45-74 using a 3 (DA: standard, literacy-sensitive, control) x 2 (heart age: heart age + percentage risk, percentage risk only) factorial design, with outcomes including prevention intentions/behaviours, gist/verbatim knowledge of risk, credibility, emotional response and decisional conflict. We iteratively improved the literacy-sensitive version based on end user testing interviews with 20 people with varying health literacy levels. Results: Immediately post-intervention (n=859), there were no differences between the DA groups on any outcome. The heart age group was less likely to have a positive emotional response, perceived the message as less credible, and had higher gist/verbatim knowledge of heart age risk but not percentage risk. After 4 weeks (n=596), the DA groups had better gist knowledge of percentage risk than control. The literacy-sensitive decision aid group had higher fruit consumption, and the standard decision aid group had better verbatim knowledge of percentage risk. Verbatim knowledge was higher for heart age than percentage risk amongst those who received both. Discussion: The literacy-sensitive DA resulted in increased knowledge and lifestyle change for participants with varying health literacy levels and CVD risk results. Adding heart age did not increase lifestyle change intentions or behaviour but did affect psychological outcomes, consistent with previous findings.

These complex carbohydrates participate in nearly all biological processes – from protein folding to the cellular entry of viruses – yet are still not well understood. There are few computational methods to link glycan sequences to functions and those that do exist do not take full advantage of all the available information of glycans. SweetNet is a graph convolutional neural network model that uses graph representation learning to facilitate a computational understanding of glycobiology. SweetNet explicitly incorporates the nonlinear nature of glycans and establishes a framework to map any glycan sequence to a representation. We show that SweetNet outperforms other computational methods in predicting glycan properties on all reported tasks. More importantly, we show that glycan representations, learned by SweetNet, are predictive of organismal phenotypic and environmental properties. Finally, we present a new application for glycan-focused machine learning, the prediction of viral glycan-binding, that can be used to discover new viral receptors and monitor rapidly mutating viruses.","Burkholz, Rebekka; Quackenbush, John; Bojar, Daniel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.01.433491,564
169342,Borders and entry controls in Asia,2021,"Abstract In the wake of industry 4.0, many industries have started to pivot towards digital, collaborative, and smart manufacturing systems by connecting their machinery as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has the potential to provide visibility and improve manufacturing systems through data collection, analysis, and subsequent actions based on insights generated from large amounts of manufacturing data. Even though comparatively newer equipment come readily equipped with embedded sensors and industrial connectivity necessary to connect to the IoT environment, there are many manufacturers (equipment users) who rely on long standing “legacy systems” that offer no or very limited connectivity. In this context, solutions mostly result in the development of low-cost retrofit or upgrade kits that allow integrating legacy equipment into Industry 4.0 environment and thus enable digital servitization. Servitization is a transformation journey that involves firms developing the capabilities they need to provide technical and data-driven services that supplement traditional product offerings. However, retrofitting solutions of legacy equipment rarely involve Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may otherwise leverage the opportunity to create and capture unique value by retrofitting and then provisioning data-driven value-added services for the manufacturers. Hence, the primary objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the available literature on retrofitting and upgrading of the legacy equipment for Industry 4.0 integration. In doing so, this study also investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of OEMs in supporting the Industry 4.0 transition of legacy equipment in a servitization context.","Zambetti, Michela; Khan, Muztoba A.; Pinto, Roberto; Wuest, Thorsten",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315961; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315961,564

The tourism industry has been massively affected by the spread of coronavirus, as many countries have introduced travel restrictions in an attempt to contain its spread. In Vietnam, the government has largely been credited for the country's success in keeping COVID-19 transmission rates under control. Early awareness of the pandemic, appropriate, drastic, and people-centric measures, as well as public support, are the main factors behind the success of Vietnam. In that context, it is observed that people's travel demand has bounced back and this research will examine factors driving the public's travel intention in the post-crisis (pandemic) period. The survey was conducted on the Internet using questionnaires designed in the Google platform. Data was collected from April 16 to May 31, 2020, from 154 Vietnamese participants. Research findings demonstrate 4 direct and indirect determinants of travel intention. The strongest effects come from perceived behavioral control which is influenced by subjective well-being. Perceived risk negatively correlates with Self-efficacy and subjective well-being. Conducted in the context of post-COVID-19, the research implies that once the pandemic has been controlled, perceived risks, although still exist, insignificantly influence the public's travel intention.","Nguyen, N.

Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance world-wide has improved our ability to rapidly identify such variants. Here we report the identification of a potential variant of interest assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. This lineage was first identified in May 2021 and evolved from C.1, one of the lineages that dominated the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa and was last detected in January 2021. C.1.2 has since been detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and in seven other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The emergence of C.1.2 was associated with an increased substitution rate, as was previously observed with the emergence of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern (VOCs). C.1.2 contains multiple substitutions (R190S, D215G, N484K, N501Y, H655Y and T859N) and deletions (Y144del, L242-A243del) within the spike protein, which have been observed in other VOCs and are associated with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization sensitivity. Of greater concern is the accumulation of additional mutations (C136F, Y449H and N679K) which are also likely to impact neutralization sensitivity or furin cleavage and therefore replicative fitness. While the phenotypic characteristics and epidemiology of C.1.2 are being defined, it is important to highlight this lineage given its concerning constellations of mutations.","Scheepers, C.; Everatt, J.; Amoako, D.

Results and discussion: Our data allowed us to conclude that the prognosis is favorably influenced by early hospitalization in the pulmonary stage of the disease, by early etiotropic and pathogenetic therapy, by the absence of concomitant disease, by adding systemic glucocorticosteroids on day 6-8 of hospitalization (which corresponds to the published data), and by tocilizumab. All patients received anticoagulants, but a more detailed analysis of the correlation of prescribed doses with prognosis is required to understand their impact on the outcome.","Fedotov, V.

As one of the solutions for mitigating the damages, the network separation and fine granularity of access controls are effective against attacks. However, the COVID-19 changes human work style, and telecommuting comes to be generally. It may give many chances to attackers for invading the organization's internal network by infecting user's vulnerable home terminals, which are out of control by the organization. To ensure the security of organizations, we propose a dynamic access control system based on the situations of users. The system evaluates communications based on the user's risk and the importance of resources in destination terminals. When a user connects to the organization network from the outside, the system dynamically changes the access controls according to the evaluation results. The such situation requires stricter access controls than usual ones. For example, the communication by the high-risk user and the communication to servers storing important resources are restricted. By applying such dynamic access controls, the system enables us to ensure our network security with maintaining the convenience of users telecommuting.","Hasegawa, H.; Takakura, H.",Icissp: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy,https://doi.org/10.5220/0010327406530660,564

Currently, there exists no reliable evidence being available regarding the likelihood of infection for pregnant women compared to the general population. On the other hand, given the previous experiences with SARS and MERS, pregnant women are likely to be at high risk for COVID-19 and its complications. Comparing the results of studies on COVID-19 during pregnancy and that of the general population, it can be concluded that pregnant women develop COVID-19 at a younger age than the general population. The results showed that due to changes during pregnancy, pregnant women have a higher risk for COVID-19 than other people, perhaps due to the lower mean age of COVID-19 in pregnant women, this leads to less COVID-19 on the adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2021.","Fakari, F.

The lockdown has repercussions on the population’s well-being, reflected in their food choices. There is a tendency to increase the consumption of energy dense food, rich in fat and carbohydrates, which are related to an increased risk of depression.ObjectivesThe main goal of this non-systematic literature review was to understand the impact of the Mediterranean Diet on Mental Health promotion in SARSCoV-2 pandemic.MethodsLiterature from Pubmed database were searched, with the following keywords: COVID-19, Depression, Anxiety, Mental Health and Mediterranean Diet.ResultsStudies indicate that a diet based on the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a decreased risk of developing depressive symptoms, especially when there is moderate to high adherence to this dietary pattern. High consumption of plant and fish foods, reduced consumption of sugary products, processed and red meats and the use of olive oil as a fat source, are principles of the Mediterranean diet, associated with an improvement in endothelial function, increased levels of eicosanoids and serotonin synthesis and regulation of serotonin which seem to explain this protective effect.ConclusionsIn addition to decreasing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, comorbidities associated with the most serious disease of COVID-19, the Mediterranean Diet seems to play an important role in promoting mental health, with a decreased risk of developing depressive symptoms.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Fraga, A.; Esteves-Sousa, D.; Facucho-Oliveira, J.; Albuquerque, M.; Costa, M.; Moura, N.; Espada-Santos, P.; Moutinho, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1788,564

An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.","Shilts, Jarrod; Wright, Gavin J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.25.221036,564

Only limited staff were allowed to Work At Office (WAO) while the rest were asked to Work From Home (WFH). Employees of both the categories faced challenges due to restricted movements and safety policies. The study was planned to assess and compare the lifestyle changes of WAO and WFH employees during the lockdown. An online cross-sectional study was designed which included employees of both Government and private sectors. Electronic Data Capture method was used to collect the data after obtaining their online consent and/assent forms by circulating a web-page developed using Research Electronic Data Capture software system. Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that the employees of WFH were at a higher risk than WAO with respect to their food intake and eating patterns. Our analysis indicated that the risk of weight gain was higher (OR: 1.51, P &lt; 0.005) in WFH group besides, a significant (P&lt;0.005) increase in time spent on mobile by the WFH. An increase in the intake of fruits and vegetables was observed in both the groups. The study highlights the need for awareness on timely eating habits and minimal use of gadgets while working from home.

Using dissimilar search strategies for new antivirals will improve our overall chances of finding effective treatments. Here, we have established an experimental platform for screening of small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, genetically engineered to enhance cellular uptake of small molecules in the environment. The system consists of a fusion of the E. coli toxin MazF and its antitoxin MazE, with insertion of a protease cleavage site in the linker peptide connecting the MazE and MazF moieties. Expression of the viral protease confers cleavage of the MazEF fusion, releasing the MazF toxin from its antitoxin, resulting in growth inhibition. In the presence of a small molecule inhibiting the protease, cleavage is blocked and the MazF toxin remains inhibited, promoting growth. The system thus allows positive selection for inhibitors. The engineered yeast strain is tagged with a fluorescent marker protein, allowing precise monitoring of its growth in the presence or absence of inhibitor. We detect an established main protease inhibitor down to 10 μM by a robust growth increase. The system is suitable for robotized large-scale screens. It allows in vivo evaluation of drug candidates, and is rapidly adaptable for new variants of the protease with deviant site specificities. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic may continue several years before vaccination campaigns can put an end it globally. Thus, the need for discovery of new antiviral drug candidates will remain. We have engineered a system in yeast cells for detection of small molecule inhibitors of one attractive drug target of SARS-CoV-2, its main protease which is required for viral replication. To detect inhibitors in live cells brings the advantage that only compounds capable of entering the cell and remain stable there, will score in the system. Moreover, by its design in yeast, the system is rapidly adaptable for tuning of detection level, eventual modification of protease cleavage site in case of future mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or even for other proteases.","Alalam, Hanna; Sigurdardóttir, Sunniva; Bourgard, Catarina; Tiukova, Ievgeniia; King, Ross D.; Grøtli, Morten; Sunnerhagen, Per",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.460411,564

Animal health may be affected by climate change in four ways: heat-related diseases and stress, extreme weather events, adaptation of animal production systems to new environments, and emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases, especially vector-borne diseases critically dependent on environmental and climatic conditions. To face these new menaces, the need for strong and efficient Veterinary Services is irrefutable, combined with good coordination of public health services, as many emerging human diseases are zoonoses.

The relative importance of these has not been prospectively documented in a case-control study. OBJECTIVE To assess the relative importance of colds and other nonclimatic historical triggers of asthma exacerbations. METHODS One hundred and nineteen adults and children with asthma in two Canadian cities participated in a one-year study of the role of exacerbating factors in asthma. Among these, 36 pairs (21 adult, 15 children) completed the case-control study. Patients were considered cases if they developed an acute asthma exacerbation and notified the centre within 24 h to allow the completion of a questionnaire and viral studies (cultures of nasopharyngeal swabs and serology). Control people with asthma were matched for sex, age and area of residence, had no exacerbation during the preceding four weeks and participated within 48 h of the case patients. RESULTS Case patients versus control patients had a mean age of 22 years versus 20 years, 50% versus 55% were male, and 92% versus 86% had at least one positive aeroallergen skin test. Cases were more likely to have taken regular inhaled steroids (63% versus 33%, P<0.002). Cases were more likely to report the following within the previous week: fever (P<0.001), sore throat (P<0.001), increase in nasal symptoms (P<0.01), increased dust exposure (P<0. 05), exposure to others with a cold (P<0.001) and, over the previous year, increased passive smoke exposure (P<0.05). Viral cultures and paired serology were negative. CONCLUSIONS Symptomatic colds were the most common trigger of asthma exacerbations in the winter and spring, while a transient increase in dust exposure was also identified as a significant trigger. The association with chronic, passive smoke exposure and the use of inhaled costicosteroid medications likely reflected less stable pre-study asthma in those with exacerbations.","Tarlo, S M; Broder, I; Corey, P; Chan-Yeung, M; Ferguson, A; Becker, A; Warren, P; Simons, F E; Sherlock, C; Okada, M; Manfreda, J",Canadian respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10700670/,564

Since then, a number of Chinese chestnut cultivars and Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars have been selected by farmers and plant breeders, but little information has been available about their origins and genetic relationships. A classification based on simple sequence repeat markers was conducted using 230 cultivars including Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata Sieb. et Zucc.) cultivars originated in Japan, Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars, and Chinese chestnut cultivars originated in both Japan and China. First, a search for synonyms (cultivars with identical genotypes) revealed 23 synonym groups among the Chinese chestnut cultivars, and all but one cultivar from each synonym group was omitted from further analyses. Second, genetic structure analysis showed a clear division between Japanese and Chinese chestnut, and most of the Japanese and Chinese cultivars had a simple genetic structure corresponding to the expected species. On the other hand, most Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars had admixed genetic structure. Through a combination of parentage and chloroplast haplotype analyses, 16 of the 18 hybrid cultivars in this study were inferred to have parent-offspring relationships with other cultivars originated in Japan. Finally, Bayesian clustering and chloroplast haplotype analysis showed that the 116 Chinese chestnut cultivars could be divided into two groups: one originated in the Hebei region of China and the other originated in the Jiangsu and Anhui regions of China. The Chinese chestnut cultivars selected in Japan showed various patterns of genetic structure including Hebei origin, Jiangsu or Anhui origin, and admixed. The chestnut cultivar genetic classifications obtained in this study will be useful for both Japanese and Chinese chestnut breeding programs.","Nishio, Sogo; Ruan, Shuan; Sawamura, Yutaka; Terakami, Shingo; Takada, Norio; Takeuchi, Yukie; Saito, Toshihiro; Inoue, Eiich",PLoS One,,564
208533,Pandemic prompts Demem to add anti-microbial products to its portfolio,2020,"Viral internalization is aided by host cell surface receptors. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the primary host receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Considering the disparities in the transmission rate and viral tropism of the two coronaviruses, additional host factors were suspected. Recently, a novel host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been identified. These receptors potentiate viral infection in the presence of other host factors like ACE2. Through its C-end rule (CendR) motif exposed following furin processing, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the CendR pocket of NRP-1 and achieves cell entry through endocytosis. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the NRP-1 receptor interferes with the docking of its endogenous ligand VEGF-A, signaling that would otherwise promote nociception. This review looks at the function of neuropilins and how it contributes to SARS-CoV-2 infection and nociception.","Jobe, Amie; Vijayan, Ranjit",,,564

223480,Head-tracking as an interface device for image control in digital pathology: a comparative study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of pregnancy, fetal development, offspring development, and later psychopathologies. The study aimed to determine the extent to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may aggravate the prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology of pregnant women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated, one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 496) through advertisements in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the other (n = 1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from 2 April to 13 April 2020. Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). RESULTS: The 1754 pregnant women (Mage = 29.27, SD = 4.23) were between 4 and 41 gestational weeks (M = 24.80, SD = 9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had post-high-school training), and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low-income cut-off). A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education, and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks' &#955; = 0.68, F6,1400 = 108.50, P < .001, partial Î·2 = 0.32). According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES = 0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES = 0.22 and ES = 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES = 0.19), and negative affectivity (ES = 0.96), and less positive affectivity (ES = 0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.94, &#967;2 [1] = 10.05, P = .002). Multiple regression analyses indicated that pregnant women in the COVID-19 cohort having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.","Berthelot, Nicolas; Lemieux, Roxanne; Garon-Bissonnette, Julia; Drouin-Maziade, Christine; Martel, Élodie; Maziade, Michel",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,,564
223738,La santé mentale des étudiants au temps de la Covid-19,2021,"BackgroundLong COVID, or post-COVID-19 sequelae, is being seen in a growing number of patients reporting a constellation of symptoms, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary. Studies on COVID-19 recovered patients are scarce. Thus, there is a need to add granularity to our existing knowledge about the course and long-term effects of the infection. AimTo describe the clinical details and risk factors of post-COVID sequelae in the North Indian population. MethodThis prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary healthcare centre in Northern India between October 2020 to February 2021. Patients aged >18 years with a confirmed COVID-19 disease were recruited after at least two weeks of diagnosis and interviewed for any post-COVID-19 symptoms. ResultsOf 1234 patients recruited, who were followed up for a median duration of 91 days (IQR: 45-181 days), 495 (40.11%) patients had symptoms. In 223 (18.1%) patients, the symptoms resolved within four weeks, 150 (12.1%) patients had symptoms till twelve weeks, and 122 (9.9%) patients had symptoms beyond twelve weeks of diagnosis of COVID-19. Most common long COVID-19 symptoms included myalgia (10.9%), fatigue (5.5%), shortness of breath (6.1%), cough (2.1%), disturbed sleep (1.4%), mood disturbances (0.48%) and anxiety (0.6%). The major determinants of developing post-COVID-19 symptoms in the patients were hypothyroidism and the severity of the disease. ConclusionMost often, patients complain of myalgias, fatigue, dyspnoea, cough and disturbed sleep. Patients who are hypothyroid or have recovered from moderate to severe COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing post-COVID sequelae. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is required to diagnose and manage COVID-19 recovered patients.","Naik, Shivdas Rajaram; Soneja, Manish; Haldar, Soumendra; Mundadan, Netto George; Garg, Prerna; mittal, ankit; Desai, Devashish; Trilangi, Praveen Kumar; Chakraborty, Sayan; Begam, Nazneen Nahar; Bhattacharya, Bisakh; Maher, Ganesh; Kumar, Swasthi S; Jonnalagadda, Kirtana; Arunan, Bharathi; Gupta, Ankesh; Mahishi, Niranjan; Rajanna, Chaithra; Prasoon, Prateek; Kumar, Nikhil A; Maharatna, Sayan; Bhattacharya, Aakashneel; Keri, Vishakh; Samed, Sameer Abdul; AdarshA, K; Shareef, Imtiyaz; Ravela, Neeran; Swain, Satish; Sarda, Radhika; Kadnur, Harshith B; Dudhwal, Ashok; Agarwal, Ayush; Vedula, Kartik; Gupta, Ashish; Agarwal, Shubham; Anand, R; Lalikar, Pratima; Jagtap, Pallavi; Bainsla, Premjeet; Kodan, Parul; Sethi, Prayas; Ray, Animesh; Jorwal, Pankaj; Kumar, Arvind; Nischal, Neeraj; Sinha, Sanjeev; Biswas, Ashutosh; Wig, Naveet",,,564

SARS-CoV-2 spreads via respiratory droplets, saliva, or direct contact. Therefore it is important to control the viral load in the saliva and respiratory secretions. One of the most simple and cost-effective measures that can be adopted by the public and healthcare professionals to prevent cross-contamination and community transmission, is the implementation of effective oral and throat hygiene. Recent evidence has confirmed 0.5% PVP-I mouthrinse/gargle for 30 seconds can reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity to below detectable levels. PVP-I can even interrupt SARS-CoV-2 attachment to oral and nasopharyngeal tissues and lower the viral particles in the saliva and respiratory droplets. Thus the use of PVP-I mouthrinse as prophylactic measures has been advocated across the globe to reduce disease transmission. Although the efficacy of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 is proven, no review articles have yet discussed the evidence and mechanisms of PVP-I against the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this paper highlights the rationale, safety, recommendations, and dosage of PVP-I gargle/mouthrinse as an effective method to decrease the viral loads during the pressing times of COVID-19.","Chopra, Diti; Sivaraman, Karthik; Radhakrishnan, Raghu; Balakrishnan, Dhanasekar; Narayana, Aparna",,,564

We derive the $R_0^{\mathsf{sys}}$ metric for various queueing models of service facilities by leveraging a novel queueing-theoretic notion: sojourn time overlaps. We showcase how our metric can be used to explore the efficacy of a variety of interventions aimed at curbing the spread of disease inside service facilities. Specifically, we focus on some prevalent interventions employed during the COVID-19 pandemic: limiting the occupancy of service facilities, protecting high-risk customers (via prioritization or designated time windows), and increasing the service speed (or limiting patronage duration). We discuss a variety of directions for adapting our transmission model to incorporate some more nuanced features of disease transmission, including heterogeneity in the population immunity level, varying levels of mask usage, and spatial considerations in disease transmission.","Kang, Kang; Doroudi, Sherwin; Delasay, Mohammad; Wickeham, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13441v1.pdf,564

It examines if travel risks linked to nature, health, terrorism, criminality, political instability are more salient for tourists' destination choice, and how risk perceptions influence tourists in the key stages of the decision-making process. Results offer an important baseline for future studies in the post-COVID-19 phase. First, the integrated travel-decision risk typology distinguishes between sociodemographic, psychological and travel-related factors. It shows that past travel experience shapes risk perceptions and impacts tourists’ future destination choice. Second, the study reveals that natural hazards are not the key barrier in the early decision-making stage of the destination choice process. Third, tourist segments that are resilient to certain risks are identified.

The risk of transmission decreases with adequate knowledge of infection prevention methods. However, health care workers reportedly lack a proper attitude and knowledge of different viral outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of health care workers in Saudi Arabia toward COVID-19. Assessment of these parameters may help researchers focus on areas that require improvement. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted among 563 participants recruited from multiple cities in Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was shared via social media applications, which contained questions to health care workers about general information regarding COVID-19 and standard practices. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 30.7 (SD 8) years. Approximately 8.3% (47/563) of the health care workers were isolated as suspected cases of COVID-19, and 0.9% (n=5) were found positive. The majority agreed that social distancing, face masks, and hand washing are effective methods for preventing disease transmission. However, only 63.7% (n=359) knew the correct duration of hand washing. Almost 70% (n=394) strictly adhered to hand hygiene practices, but less than half complied with the practice of wearing a face mask. Significant differences in health care workers' attitudes were observed on the basis of their city of residence, their adherence to COVID-19 practices, and their compliance with the use of a face mask. Among the health care workers, 27.2% (n=153) declared that they will isolate themselves at home and take influenza medication if they experience COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of health care workers in Saudi Arabia presented acceptable levels of general knowledge on COVID-19, but they lack awareness in some crucial details that may prevent disease spread.

COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by WHO. The clinical manifestation and disease progression in COVID-19 patients varies from minimal symptoms to severe respiratory issues with multiple organ failure. Understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host cells will provide key insights into the effective molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutics. Recent studies have identified virus-mediated phosphorylation or activation of some major signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2, JNK, p38, PI3K/AKT and NF-&#954;B signaling, that potentially elicit the cytokine storm that serves as a major cause of tissue injuries. Several studies highlight the aggressive inflammatory response particularly 'cytokine storm' in SARS-CoV-2 patients. A depiction of host molecular dynamics triggered by SARS-CoV-2 in the form of a network of signaling molecules will be helpful for COVID-19 research. Therefore, we developed the signaling pathway map of SARS-CoV-2 infection using data mined from the recently published literature. This integrated signaling pathway map of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 326 proteins and 73 reactions. These include information pertaining to 1,629 molecular association events, 30 enzyme catalysis events, 43 activation/inhibition events, and 8,531 gene regulation events.

However, current knowledge on the prognosis of respiratory virus-related pneumonia (RV-p) is limited. Thus, here we aimed to establish a clinical predictive model for mortality of patients with RV-p. METHODS: A total of 1431 laboratory-confirmed patients with RV-p, including 1169 and 262 patients from respective derivation and validation cohorts from five teaching hospitals in China were assessed between January 2010 and December 2019. A prediction rule was established on the basis of risk factors for 30-day mortality of patients with RV-p from the derivation cohort using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality of patients with RV-p was 16.8% (241/1431). The RV-p score was composed of nine predictors (including respective points of mortality risk): (a) age â©¾65 years (1 point); (b) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1 point); (c) mental confusion (1 point); (d) blood urea nitrogen (1 point); (e) cardiovascular disease (2 points); (f) smoking history (2 points); (g) arterial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspiration oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) < 250 mmHg (2 points); (h) lymphocyte counts <0.8 × 109/L (2 points); (i) arterial PH < 7.35 (3 points). A total of six points was used as the cut-off value for mortality risk stratification. Our model showed a sensitivity of 0.831 and a specificity of 0.783. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was more prominent for RV-p scoring [0.867, 95% confidence interval (CI)0.846-0.886] when compared with both pneumonia severity index risk (0.595, 95% CI 0.566-0.624, p < 0.001) and CURB-65 scoring (0.739, 95% CI 0.713-0.765, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RV-p scoring was able to provide a good predictive accuracy for 30-day mortality, which accounted for a more effective stratification of patients with RV-p into relevant risk categories and, consequently, help physicians to make more rational clinical decisions.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Chen, Liang; Han, Xiudi; Li, YanLi; Zhang, Chunxiao; Xing, Xiqian",Ther Adv Respir Dis,,564

Health care systems are rapidly developing innovative models of care that provide essential acute rehabilitation services while mitigating viral spread. We present 2 case reports to illustrate how we used technology and COVID-19-specific decision-making frameworks to deliver acute rehabilitation. METHODS: We iteratively developed 2 decision-making models regarding care delivery and discharge planning in the context of the challenges to delivering care in a pandemic. We leveraged use of video communication systems installed in all COVID-19 rooms to reduce the number of in-room providers and frequency of contact. Two patients were admitted to the hospital with symptomatic COVID-19 (males, ages 65 and 40 years). RESULTS: With the use of a video communication system and the decision-making frameworks for care delivery and discharge planning, we avoided 7 in-person sessions. Both patients demonstrated functional gains and were dischargedhome. CONCLUSION: The 2 case reports highlight the innovative use of a technology and COVID-19-specific decision-making processes to provide patient-centered care given the challenges to care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPACT: The use of technology and decision-making models allows for delivery of safe acute rehabilitation care that minimizes contact, conserves personal protective equipment, and prepares for COVID-19 surges. The discussion points raised have applicability to patients without COVID-19 and other health care systems. Future research is needed to determine the effectiveness, costs, and downstream effects of our novel approach to acute rehabilitation for patients with COVID-19.","Livingston, Tara; Sullivan, Elle K; Wilske, Grace; Gustavson, Allison M",Phys. ther,,564

Although it has been suggested that ARBs might lead to a higher susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, experimental data suggest that ARBs may reduce acute lung injury via blocking angiotensin-II-mediated pulmonary permeability, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, despite these hypotheses, specific studies on ARBs in SARS-CoV-2 patients are lacking. METHODS: The PRAETORIAN-COVID trial is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized clinical trial in adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n = 651). The primary aim is to investigate the effect of the ARB valsartan compared to placebo on the composite end point of admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death within 14 days of randomization. The active-treatment arm will receive valsartan in a dosage titrated to blood pressure up to a maximum of 160 mg bid, and the placebo arm will receive matching placebo. Treatment duration will be 14 days, or until the occurrence of the primary end point or until hospital discharge, if either of these occurs within 14 days. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04335786, 2020).

DESIGN: Preregistered prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: University hospital ICU. PATIENTS: All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to our ICU during the first European pandemic wave. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 3 months after hospital discharge, 46 survivors underwent a comprehensive physical assessment (6-min walking distance, Medical Research Council sum score and handgrip strength), a full pulmonary function test, and a chest CT scan which was used to analyze skeletal muscle architecture. In addition, patient-reported outcomes measures were collected. Physical performance assessed by 6-minute walking distance was below 80% of predicted in 48% of patients. Patients with impaired physical performance had more muscle weakness (Medical Research Council sum score 53 [51-56] vs 59 [56-60]; p < 0.001), lower lung diffusing capacity (54% [44-66%] vs 68% of predicted [61-72% of predicted]; p = 0.002), and higher intermuscular adipose tissue area (p = 0.037). Reduced lung diffusing capacity and increased intermuscular adipose tissue were independently associated with physical performance. CONCLUSIONS: Physical disability is common at 3 months in severe coronavirus disease 2019 survivors. Lung diffusing capacity and intermuscular adipose tissue assessed on CT were independently associated with walking distance, suggesting a key role for pulmonary function and muscle quality in functional disability.","van Gassel, Rob J J; Bels, Julia; Remij, Loes; van Bussel, Bas C T; Posthuma, Rein; Gietema, Hester A; Verbunt, Jeanine; van der Horst, Iwan C C; Olde Damink, Steven W M; van Santen, Susanne; van de Poll, Marcel C G",Crit. care med,,564

265155,Evaluating performance management of COVID-19 reality in three European countries: a pragmatic constructivist study,2021,"Lebanon has faced numerous challenges in the last three decades that have greatly impacted its health-care system, which has been historically disjointed first by the civil war, and second by the arrival of significant numbers of Palestinian and Syrian and refugees. Although Lebanon has tried to absorb these systemic shocks and recover, its health system has continued its slow decline and highlighted by events in 2020. The fragility of health-care systems worldwide were demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in 2020. Protective measures that are essential to a health-care system (i.e. standardization of processes, analysis of adverse events, accreditation, etc.) are insufficient for handling unforeseen events. Lebanon suffered a hattrick of simultaneous events during 2020 the economic crisis, the Beirut blast, and the COVID-19 pandemic which sorely tested its ability to orchestrate recovery efforts. These events have accelerated the slow demise of the Lebanese health-care system into a disastrous free fall. The after-effects of this series of events on the Lebanese health-care system have meant it is on the verge of collapse. Is there a possibility the system will endure and be able to orchestrate recovery efforts? Any progress to health-service sustainability re quires that lessons be learned from other countries in restructuring the basics of the health system, in order to develop effective crises management plans. It is only through planning for the unexpected that a country stands a chance of surviving the public health crises that Lebanon has been unfortunate enough to suffer.","Mjaess, G.; Karam, A.; Chebel, R.; Tayeh, G.

This may pose a potential virus transmission risk. We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the duration of viral shedding for individual COVID-19 patients. This retrospective multicentric study enrolled 135 patients as a training cohort and 102 patients as a validation cohort. Significant factors associated with the duration of viral shedding were identified by multivariate Cox modeling in the training cohort and combined to develop a nomogram to predict the probability of viral shedding at 9, 13, 17, and 21 d after admission. The nomogram was validated in the validation cohort and evaluated by concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC), and calibration curve. A higher absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.001) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (P=0.013) were correlated with a shorter duration of viral shedding, while a longer activated partial thromboplastin time (P=0.007) prolonged the viral shedding duration. The C-indices of the nomogram were 0.732 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.685â0.777) in the training cohort and 0.703 (95% CI: 0.642â0.764) in the validation cohort. The AUC showed a good discriminative ability (training cohort: 0.879, 0.762, 0.738, and 0.715 for 9, 13, 17, and 21 d; validation cohort: 0.855, 0.758, 0.728, and 0.706 for 9, 13, 17, and 21 d), and calibration curves were consistent between outcomes and predictions in both cohorts. A predictive nomogram for viral shedding duration based on three easily accessible factors was developed to help estimate appropriate self-isolation time for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, and to control virus transmission.","Yuan, Shijin; Pan, Yong; Xia, Yan; Zhang, Yan; Chen, Jiangnan; Zheng, Wei; Xu, Xiaoping; Xie, Xinyou; Zhang, Jun",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,564

276615,La médecine par l'épreuve./ [Medecine by ordeal],2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-Coronavirus-2 pandemic has adversely affected blood supply as potential blood donors were afraid of acquiring infection in hospital settings. We aimed to compare COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic blood donors from healthcare and non-healthcare setting to analyse the difference in exposure level of each group as well as the risk of acquiring infection during the process of blood donation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of whole blood donors tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was carried out after categorizing them into healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). NHCW were further categorized into residents of containment and non-containment zones and seroprevalence analyzed. Seroprevalence among different ABO blood groups was also analyzed. RESULTS: 1191 blood donors were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 9.5 % seropositivity. Significantly lower seropositivity of 3.2 % (p < 0.001) was observed among HCW as compared to 10.9 % seropositivity in NHCW. Among NHCW no difference in seropositivity was observed based on residence in containment or non-containment zone. Significantly higher (p = 0.012) seroprevalence was observed among A blood group donors (12.5 %) as compared to O blood group donors (6.8 %). CONCLUSION: Results suggests that a blood donor, in a hospital setting is less likely to be exposed to COVID-19 disease than when participating in activities of daily living. It is postulated that the lower seroprevalence among HCW as compared to NHCW reflects differences in knowledge and practice of preventive measures among these groups. The findings should instil confidence among blood donors and motivate them to donate blood without fear.","Pandey, Hem Chandra; Dhiman, Yashaswi; C S, Chippy; Coshic, Poonam; Jain, Pankaj",Transfus Apher Sci,,564

This randomised clinical trial in a hospital setting evaluated the efficacy and safety of this drug in RT-PCR-positive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Materials & MethodsA total of 210 RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, who provided consent were allotted, to control or case arm, based on block randomisation. The control arm received standard of care comprising paracetamol, ivermectin, and other adjuvant therapies. The patient in the case arm received indomethacin instead of paracetamol, with other medications retained. The primary endpoint was the development of hypoxia/desaturation with SpO2 [≤] 93, while time to become afebrile and time for cough and myalgia resolution were the secondary endpoints. ResultsThe results of 210 patients were available, with 102 and 108 patients in the indomethacin and paracetamol arms, respectively. We monitored patient profiles along with everyday clinical parameters. Blood chemistry at the time of admission and discharge was assessed. As no one in either of the arms required high-flow oxygen, desaturation with SpO2 level of 93 and below was an important goal. In the indomethacin group, none of the 102 patients developed desaturation. On the other hand, 20 of the 108 patients in the paracetamol arm developed desaturation. Patients who received indomethacin also experienced more rapid symptomatic relief than those in the paracetamol arm, with most symptoms disappearing in half the time. 56 patients out of 108 in the paracetamol arm had fever on the seventh day, while no patient in the indomethacin group had fever. Either arm did not report any adverse event. The fourteenth-day follow-up revealed that the paracetamol arm patients had faced several discomforts, including myalgia, joint pain, and tiredness; indomethacin arm patients mostly complained only of tiredness. ConclusionIndomethacin is a safe and effective drug for treating patients with mild and moderate Covid-19.","rajan, ravichandran; Surapaneni, Krishna Mohan; Sukumaran, Suresh Kumar; Kamaraj, Devakumar; Devisuga, Sumetha Suga; Ravi, Samson Oliver; Vijayaraghavalu, Sivakumar; Ramarathnam, Krishna Kumar",,,564

286463,Obésité et infection par la COVID-19 : une liaison dangereuse,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of June 2020, there were nearly 7 million reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide and over 400,000 deaths in people with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine associations between comorbidities listed in the Charlson comorbidity index and mortality among patients in the United States with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 from 24 healthcare organizations in the US was conducted. The study included adults aged 18-90 years with COVID-19 coded in their electronic medical records between January 20, 2020, and May 26, 2020. Results were also stratified by age groups (<50 years, 50-69 years, or 70-90 years). A total of 31,461 patients were included. Median age was 50 years (interquartile range [IQR], 35-63) and 54.5% (n = 17,155) were female. The most common comorbidities listed in the Charlson comorbidity index were chronic pulmonary disease (17.5%, n = 5,513) and diabetes mellitus (15.0%, n = 4,710). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed older age (odds ratio [OR] per year 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.07; p < 0.001), male sex (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.55-1.98; p < 0.001), being black or African American compared to white (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31-1.71; p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.64-2.35; p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (OR 1.42; 95% CI 1.21-1.67; p < 0.001), dementia (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.56; p = 0.008), chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08-1.43; p = 0.003), mild liver disease (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.00-1.59; p = 0.046), moderate/severe liver disease (OR 2.62; 95% CI 1.53-4.47; p < 0.001), renal disease (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.84-2.46; p < 0.001), and metastatic solid tumor (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.19-2.43; p = 0.004) were associated with higher odds of mortality with COVID-19. Older age, male sex, and being black or African American (compared to being white) remained significantly associated with higher odds of death in age-stratified analyses. There were differences in which comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality between age groups. Limitations include that the data were collected from the healthcare organization electronic medical record databases and some comorbidities may be underreported and ethnicity was unknown for 24% of participants. Deaths during an inpatient or outpatient visit at the participating healthcare organizations were recorded; however, deaths occurring outside of the hospital setting are not well captured. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying patient characteristics and conditions associated with mortality with COVID-19 is important for hypothesis generating for clinical trials and to develop targeted intervention strategies.","Harrison, Stephanie L; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Lane, Deirdre A; Underhill, Paula; Lip, Gregory Y H",PLoS Med,,564

289015,Seguridad del paciente,2020,"The problem of the theoretical precariousness of psychology requires defining, at an epistemological level, its concepts and languages and the use of models for finding core concepts and building more or less 'hard' theories. After reviewing some main aims and models of psychology, and comparing them with those of other sciences, the commentary deals with the possibility of simulating life as a tool for building evolutionary psychological models. In particular, evolutionary and developmental robotics and the evo-devo models can simulate the simultaneous adaptation effects of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of the embodied mind in response to the characteristics of the environment. The simulation using Artificial Intelligence and robotics could contribute significantly to the definition, experimentation, and validation of the models that make up the theories of psychology in its different domains, enhancing the interdisciplinarity with other sciences that study the same objects. Further studies, both epistemological and empirical, are suggested to confirm whether this evo-devo approach can be integrated with ""evolutionary psychology"" and contribute to a unifying meta-theory of psychological science.","Di Nuovo, Santo",Integr. psychol. behav. sci,,564

Thus far, there have been scant research on such intricate bundle of interactions. Also, the findings of previous studies were rather inconclusive, because conflicting results emerged over time. Building on the existence of heterogeneous evidences, this study solved the detected criticism by suggesting a curvilinear relationship among digital technologies, digital skills of human capital and intellectual property. Specifically, we argue that the relationship between digital technologies and intellectual property is inverted u-shaped.Design/methodology/approachHypotheses are tested by applying a generalized linear model (GLM) regression analysis and a quadratic model for non-linear regression. The study analysed a large-scale sample of micro-data drawn from Eurostat. Such sample embraces the population of firms operating in all European member states.FindingsOverall, the results of the study confirm that digital technologies are curvilinearly related to intellectual property. Precisely, the curve is inverted u-shaped. Notably, results show that digital skills only matter when employees have very demanding duties to accomplish. In all other cases, digital skills do not affect intellectual property significantly.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is solely focused on firms' operating in the European Union. Future studies should extend the analysis to other geographies.Practical implicationsAt a real impact level, the study suggests that intellectual property is only partially fostered by digital skills and digital technologies. In this sense, digital skills might be overrated.Originality/valueDifferently from prior research, this study originally detangles the impact of digital technologies on firm's intellectual capital by suggesting the existence of an inverse u-shaped relationship between variables.","Orlando, Beatrice Mazzucchelli Alice Usai Antonio Nicotra Melita Paoletti Francesco",Journal of Intellectual Capital,,564

This is why they are widely recognized for their excellence in research which make them take the most renowned positions in the different worldwide university leagues. In order to examine the uniqueness of this group of universities we analyze the scientific production of a sample of them in a 5 year period of time. On the one hand, we analyze their preferences in research measured with the relative percentage of publications in the different subject areas, and on the other hand, we calculate the similarity between them in research preferences. In order to select a set of research universities, we studied the leading university rankings of Shanghai, QS, Leiden, and Times Higher Education (THE). Although the four rankings own well established and developed methodologies and hold great prestige, we choose to use THE because data were readily available for doing the study we had in mind. Having done that, we selected the twenty academic institutions ranked with the highest score in the last edition of THE World University Rankings 2020 and to contrast their impact, we also, we compared them with the twenty institutions with the lowest score in this ranking. At the same time, we extracted publication data from Scopus database for each university and we applied bibliometrics indicators from Elsevier's SciVal. We applied the statistical techniques cosine similarity and agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis to examine and compare affinities in research preferences among them. Moreover, a cluster analysis through VOSviewer was done to classify the total scientific production in the four major fields (health sciences, physical sciences, life sciences and social sciences). As expected, the results showed that top universities have strong research profiles, becoming the leaders in the world in those areas and cosine similarity pointed out that some are more affine among them than others. The results provide clues for enhancing existing collaboration, defining and re-directing lines of research, and seeking for new partnerships to face the current pandemic to find was to tackle down the covid-19 outbreak.","Lancho-Barrantes, Barbara S; Cantu-Ortiz, Francisco J",Scientometrics,,564

323971,Faire barrage au virus et s’en arranger. Des personnes en situation de handicap à l’épreuve du COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic illness are at increased risk for traumatic stress because of medical trauma. Initial studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have found that approximately one-third of patients may experience significant PTS symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, disrupted sleep, and low mood. We aim to better characterize PTS in IBD and its relationship with patient outcomes in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: Adult patients registered with the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation/University of North Carolina IBD Partners database were invited to complete a supplementary survey between February and July 2020. The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition was administered as a supplemental survey. Additional data from IBD Partners included disease severity, surgery and hospital history, demographics, and health care utilization. RESULTS: A total of 797 patients participated (452 with Crohn disease, 345 with ulcerative colitis). No impacts on response patterns because of the COVID-19 pandemic were found. Although 5.6% of the sample reported an existing PTS diagnosis because of IBD experiences, 9.6% of participants met the full IBD-related PTS diagnostic criteria per the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition. Female patients, younger patients, those with less educational attainment, non-White patients, and Hispanic patients reported higher levels of PTS symptoms. Patients with higher PTS symptoms were more likely to have been hospitalized, have had surgery, have more severe symptoms, and not be in remission. Increased PTS was also associated with increased anxiety, depression, pain interference, fatigue, and health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support prior research that approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients with IBD report significant symptoms of PTS directly from their disease experiences, and certain demographic groups are at higher risk. In addition, PTS is associated with several IBD outcomes. Patients with higher PTS symptoms are less likely to be in remission and may utilize more outpatient gastrointestinal services. Intervention trials to mitigate PTS symptoms in patients with IBD are warranted.","Taft, Tiffany H; Quinton, Sarah; Jedel, Sharon; Simons, Madison; Mutlu, Ece A; Hanauer, Stephen B",Inflamm. bowel dis,,564

332497,Morocco - Army Enforces Virus Measures,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) pandemic has resulted in an increase in virtual care. While some specialties are well suited to virtual care, Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery could be limited due to reliance on physical examination and nasal endoscopy, including Rhinology. It is likely virtual care will remain integrated for the foreseeable future and it is important to determine the strengths and weaknesses of this treatment modality for rhinology. METHODS: A survey on virtual care in rhinology was distributed to 61 Canadian rhinologists. The primary objective was to determine how virtual care compared to in-person care in each area of a typical appointment. Other areas focused on platforms used to deliver virtual care and which patients could be appropriately assessed by virtual visits. RESULTS: 43 participants responded (response rate 70.5%). The majority of participants use the telephone as their primary platform. History taking and reviewing results (lab work, imaging) were reported to be equivalent in virtual care. Non-urgent follow up and new patients were thought to be the most appropriate for virtual care. The inability to perform exams and nasal endoscopy were reported to be significant limitations. CONCLUSION: It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of virtual care. These results identify the perceived strengths and weaknesses of virtual care in rhinology, and will help rhinologists understand the role of virtual care in their practices.","Smith, Kristine A; Thamboo, Andrew; Chan, Yvonne; Chin, Christopher J; Werger, Megan; Rotenberg, Brian",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,564
333913,Variation in volumes and characteristics of trauma patients admitted to a level one trauma centre during national level 4 lockdown for COVID-19 in New Zealand,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, recovery, and mortality have been identified as critically important core outcomes by more than 9300 patients, health professionals, and the public from 111 countries in the global coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set initiative. The aim of this project was to establish the core outcome measures for these domains for trials in coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Three online consensus workshops were convened to establish outcome measures for the four core domains of respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, shortness of breath, and recovery. SETTING: International. PATIENTS: About 130 participants (patients, public, and health professionals) from 17 countries attended the three workshops. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory failure, assessed by the need for respiratory support based on the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale, was considered pragmatic, objective, and with broad applicability to various clinical scenarios. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment was recommended for multiple organ failure, because it was routinely used in trials and clinical care, well validated, and feasible. The Modified Medical Research Council measure for shortness of breath, with minor adaptations (recall period of 24 hr to capture daily fluctuations and inclusion of activities to ensure relevance and to capture the extreme severity of shortness of breath in people with coronavirus disease 2019), was regarded as fit for purpose for this indication. The recovery measure was developed de novo and defined as the absence of symptoms, resumption of usual daily activities, and return to the previous state of health prior to the illness, using a 5-point Likert scale, and was endorsed. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 core outcome set recommended core outcome measures have content validity and are considered the most feasible and acceptable among existing measures. Implementation of the core outcome measures in trials in coronavirus disease 2019 will ensure consistency and relevance of the evidence to inform decision-making and care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Tong, Allison; Baumgart, Amanda; Evangelidis, Nicole; Viecelli, Andrea K; Carter, Simon A; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar; Cooper, Tess; Bersten, Andrew; Cervantes, Lilia; Chew, Derek P; Crowe, Sally; Douglas, Ivor S; Flemyng, Ella; Elliott, Julian H; Hannan, Elyssa; Horby, Peter; Howell, Martin; Ju, Angela; Lee, Jaehee; Lorca, Eduardo; Lynch, Deena; Manera, Karine E; Marshall, John C; Gonzalez, Andrea Matus; McKenzie, Anne; Mehta, Sangeeta; Mer, Mervyn; Morris, Andrew Conway; Needham, Dale M; Nseir, Saad; Povoa, Pedro; Reid, Mark; Sakr, Yasser; Shen, Ning; Smyth, Alan R; Simpson, A John; Snelling, Tom; Strippoli, Giovanni F M; Teixeira-Pinto, Armando; Torres, Antoni; Turner, Tari; Webb, Steve; Williamson, Paula R; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Zhang, Junhua; Craig, Jonathan C",Crit Care Med,,564

This study assessed depressive and anxious symptoms, cognition, and brain structure and function in participants with symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by PCR testing (n=100) approximately three months following infection, leveraging self-report questionnaires, objective neurocognitive testing, and structural and functional neuroimaging data. Preliminary results demonstrated that over 1/5 of our cohort endorsed clinically significant depressive and/or anxious symptoms, and >40% of participants had cognitive impairment on objective testing across multiple domains, consistent with brain-fog. While depression and one domain of quality of life (physical functioning) were significantly different between hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and most domains of functioning were not, suggesting that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not necessarily relate to the severity of neuropsychiatric outcomes and impaired functioning in the months after infection. Furthermore, we found that the majority of participants in a subset of our cohort who completed structural and functional neuroimaging (n=15) had smaller olfactory bulbs and sulci in conjunction with anosmia. We also showed that this subset of participants had dysfunction in attention network functional connectivity and ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed-based functional connectivity. These functional imaging dysfunctions have been observed previously in depression and correlated with levels of inflammation. Our results support and extend previous findings in the literature concerning the neuropsychiatric sequelae associated with long COVID. Ongoing data collection and analyses within this cohort will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the longitudinal relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms, neurocognitive performance, brain structure and function, and inflammatory and immune profiles.","Hack, Laura M; Brawer, Jacob; Chesnut, Megan; Zhang, Xue; Wintermark, Max; Jiang, Bin; Grant, Philip; Bonilla, Hector; Stetz, Patrick; Yesavage, Jerome A; Subramanian, Aruna; Williams, Leanne M",,,564

RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable global impact with over 2.0 million deaths worldwide so far. There has been considerable evidence suggesting that COVID-19 increases the risk of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We propose characterizing ACS patients into 3 distinct categories to better assist in appropriate triage and management: critically ill patients, non-critically ill ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, and non-critically ill non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/unstable angina (UA) patients. We thoroughly review treatments strategies, management considerations, and current consensus statements for the care of COVID-19 patients with ACS. As we continue to gain more experience with management of COVID-19 in ACS patients and as health-care workers and patients continue to get vaccinated, we must continue to adapt our strategies to treat this high-risk group of patients.","Borgaonkar, Sanket; Hahn, Joshua; Daher, Marilyne; Kayani, Waleed; Jneid, Hani",Curr Cardiol Rep,,564

We have analysed the integrity of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines under different movement conditions to provide information that may improve the distribution of vaccines to the target population. METHODS: Syringes of reconstituted Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were prepared in a laminar flow chamber to be subjected to a stability analysis in order to evaluate the impact of movement on mRNA integrity. RNA integrity was checked by the lack of RNA peaks under the original mRNA peak in the electropherogram resulting from potential fragments from RNA degradation. Samples were then exposed for 180 min at room temperature (21 ± 1°C, 55 ± 10% humidity) under different movement conditions. RESULTS: We report that the integrity of the mRNA in the reconstituted COVID-19 vaccines after continuous moderate movement at room temperature is maintained for at least 3 hours, with values of fluorescence units (FU) under the original mRNA peak of 0.38 ± 0.06 in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 0.96 ± 1.18 FU in the Moderna vaccine, equal to the values obtained without movement (0.36 ± 0.08 FU in the Pfizer-BioNTech and 1.12 ± 0.19 FU in the Moderna). In contrast, the integrity of these vaccines exposed to repeated Vortex shaking was significantly impaired (p < 0.001) with values under the original mRNA peak of 1.34 ± 0.31 FU for the Pfizer-BioNTech and 5.03 ± 1.16 FU for the Moderna samples. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of these reconstituted vaccines reported here may improve the efficiency of the ground transportation and distribution of the vaccines, which may lead to shorter and more homogeneous vaccinations in cities and rural areas.","Grau, Santiago; Ferrández, Olivia; Martín-García, Elena; Maldonado, Rafael",Clin. microbiol. infect,,564

The rates of family violence are rising fast, and women and children are disproportionately affected and vulnerable during this time. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a large-scale analysis of public discourse on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. METHODS: We analyzed over 1 million tweets related to family violence and COVID-19 from April 12 to July 16, 2020. We used the machine learning approach Latent Dirichlet Allocation and identified salient themes, topics, and representative tweets. RESULTS: We extracted 9 themes from 1,015,874 tweets on family violence and the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) increased vulnerability: COVID-19 and family violence (eg, rising rates, increases in hotline calls, homicide); (2) types of family violence (eg, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual abuse); (3) forms of family violence (eg, physical aggression, coercive control); (4) risk factors linked to family violence (eg, alcohol abuse, financial constraints, guns, quarantine); (5) victims of family violence (eg, the LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning] community, women, women of color, children); (6) social services for family violence (eg, hotlines, social workers, confidential services, shelters, funding); (7) law enforcement response (eg, 911 calls, police arrest, protective orders, abuse reports); (8) social movements and awareness (eg, support victims, raise awareness); and (9) domestic violence-related news (eg, Tara Reade, Melissa DeRosa). CONCLUSIONS: This study overcomes limitations in the existing scholarship where data on the consequences of COVID-19 on family violence are lacking. We contribute to understanding family violence during the pandemic by providing surveillance via tweets.

Quantifying these changes requires a business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to 50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$ between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$ forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.","Keller, Christoph A.; Evans, Mat.

373676,Laying Off Versus Training Workers: How Can Saudi Entrepreneurs Manage the COVID-19 Crisis?*,2021,"Introduction: Crystallization test is based on the principle that, when a salt crystallizes out of an aqueous solution, the crystal growth is influenced by the presence of other substances in the solution, such as blood or plant extracts. If a mixture of copper chloride solution with a small amount of whole blood is allowed to crystallize under controlled experimental conditions, an aggregate of crystals forms. Crystallization method can be used as a diagnostic aid to provide information about the systemic conditions and general health of the patient. Aim: This study aims to study the patterns of crystallization and to further determine the efficacy of crystallization test as a screening modality in premalignant lesions and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and Methods: Fifty patients of OSCC, 50 patients of premalignant lesions, and 50 healthy individuals were selected. One drop of blood was collected from the study groups to perform crystallization using cupric chloride. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test, Student's t-test (two-tailed), and analysis of variance. Results: The different patterns of crystals formed were studied and statistically analyzed. Conclusion: Based on the study, it was concluded that Crystallization test can be used as an effective screening modality for detection of premalignant lesions and OSCC.","Rawat, Garima; Kureel, Kirti; Urs, Aadithya B",J Cancer Res Ther,,564

383539,Qué debes saber del nuevo coronavirus,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted lives and economies across the globe, leading to many deaths. While vaccination is an important intervention, its roll-out is slow and unequal across the globe. Therefore, extensive testing still remains one of the key methods to monitor and contain the virus. Testing on a large scale is expensive and arduous. Hence, we need alternate methods to estimate the number of cases. Online surveys have been shown to be an effective method for data collection amidst the pandemic. In this work, we develop machine learning models to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 using self-reported symptoms. Our best model predicts the daily cases with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 226.30 (normalized MAE of 27.09%) per state, which demonstrates the possibility of predicting the actual number of confirmed cases by utilizing self-reported symptoms. The models are developed at two levels of data granularity - local models, which are trained at the state level, and a single global model which is trained on the combined data aggregated across all states. Our results indicate a lower error on the local models as opposed to the global model. In addition, we also show that the most important symptoms (features) vary considerably from state to state. This work demonstrates that the models developed on crowd-sourced data, curated via online platforms, can complement the existing epidemiological surveillance infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.

386849,The Effects of Restrictions in Economic Activity on the Spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines: Insights from Apple and Google Mobility Indicators,2020,"Coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), instigated by SARS-CoV-2 virus, is recently raising worldwide and inspiring global health worries. The main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLPro ) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which operates its replication, could be used as a medication discovery point. We therefore theoretically studied and docked the effects of 19 hydrolysable tannins on SARS-CoV-2 by assembling with the catalytic dyad residues of its 3CLpro using molecular operating environment (MOE 09). Results discovered that pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin intensely interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses estimated that the top three hits might serve as potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 leading molecules for additional optimization and drug development process to combat COVID-19. This study unleashed that tannins with specific structure could be utilized as natural inhibitors against COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The 3CLPro controls SARS-CoV-2 copying and manages its life series, which was targeted in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 19 hydrolysable tannins were computed against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin interacted with Cys145 and His41 of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro . Pedunculagin-SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro remain stable, with no obvious fluctuations. We predicted that the understandings gained in the current research may evidence valued for discovering and unindustrialized innovative natural inhibitors for COVID-19 in the nearby future.","Khalifa, Ibrahim; Zhu, Wei; Mohammed, Hammad Hamed Hammad; Dutta, Kunal; Li, Chunmei",J Food Biochem,,564

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the second half of 2020. METHODS: AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. RESULTS: AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, ""other national,"" and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with an increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures were significant.

404221,Facteurs associes a la survenue d'une embolie pulmonaire au cours du COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: As one of the non-pharmacological interventions to control the transmission of COVID-19, determining the quarantine duration is mainly based on the accurate estimates of the incubation period. However, patients with coarse information of the exposure date, as well as infections other than the symptomatic, were not taken into account in previously published studies. Thus, by using the statistical method dealing with the interval-censored data, we assessed the quarantine duration for both common and uncommon infections. The latter type includes the presymptomatic, the asymptomatic and the recurrent test positive patients. METHODS: As of 10 December 2020, information on cases have been collected from the English and Chinese databases, including Pubmed, Google scholar, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang. Official websites and medias were also searched as data sources. All data were transformed into doubly interval-censored and the accelerated failure time model was applied. By estimating the incubation period and the time-to-event distribution of worldwide COVID-19 patients, we obtain the large percentiles for determining and suggesting the quarantine policies. For symptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients, the incubation time is the duration from exposure to symptom onset. For the asymptomatic, we substitute the date of first positive result of nucleic acid testing for that of symptom onset. Furthermore, the time from hospital discharge or getting negative test result to the positive recurrence has been calculated for recurrent positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 1920 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Among all uncommon infections, 34.1% (n = 55) of them developed symptoms or were identified beyond fourteen days. Based on all collected cases, the 95th and 99th percentiles were estimated to be 16.2 days (95% CI 15.5-17.0) and 22.9 days (21.7â24.3) respectively. Besides, we got similar estimates based on merely symptomatic and presymptomatic infections as 15.1 days (14.4â15.7) and 21.1 days (20.0â22.2). CONCLUSIONS: There are a certain number of infected people who require longer quarantine duration. Our findings well support the current practice of the extended active monitoring. To further prevent possible transmissions induced and facilitated by such infectious outliers after the 14-days quarantine, properly prolonging the quarantine duration could be prudent for high-risk scenarios and in regions with insufficient test resources.","Li, Zhi-Yao; Zhang, Yu; Peng, Liu-Qing; Gao, Rong-Rong; Jing, Jia-Rui; Wang, Jia-Le; Ren, Bin-Zhi; Xu, Jian-Guo; Wang, Tong",Infect Dis Poverty,,564

429521,Diabetes and COVID-19-the meeting of two pandemics: what are the concerns?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 350,000 deaths worldwide. Thrombotic complications due to considerable inflammation, cytokine-mediated microvascular damage and pulmonary immunothrombosis formation seem to have emerged as an important issue in people infected with COVID-19. METHODS: This study reviewed consecutive symptomatic patients with proven COVID-19 infection admitted to Acibadem University Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey (15 March-25 May 2020). The primary outcome was any venous thromboembolic (VTE) complication. The secondary outcome was the incidence of subsegmental pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which represented immunothrombosis development. RESULTS: The mean age was 55.7±17.4 years (range, 29-84); 224 (63.6%) were men. Of those patients, 12 (3.4%) died, 273 (77.5%) were discharged alive and 67 (19.1%) were still hospitalised as of 25 May 2020. Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 58 patients with a cumulative rate of 16.4% during the study period. The surprising discovery was that DVT was not identified in 20 (86.9%) of the 23 patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism, which corroborated the pulmonary immunothrombosis theory. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of VTE events suggests an important role of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. Thus, repeated assessment and optimised treatment are necessary to reduce the occurrence of VTE and prevent fatal pulmonary embolism events. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanism of this immunothrombosis development.","Dumantepe, Mert; Aydin, Selim; Yildiz, Erdem; Okur, Hacer Kuzu; Kocagoz, A Sesin; Gundogdu, Yasemin; Okten, Murat; Isbir, Selim; Karabulut, Hasan",Heart lung circ,,564

There is a concern that the pandemic will exacerbate the existing disparities in overall healthcare utilization and telehealth utilization. Few national studies have examined the changes in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data on 6.8 and 6.4 million employer-based health plan beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were collected in 2020. Unadjusted rates were compared both before and after the week of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. Trends in weekly utilization were also examined using a difference-in-differences regression framework to quantify the changes in telemedicine and office-based care utilization while controlling for the patient's demographic and county-level sociodemographic measures. All analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS: More than a 20-fold increase in the incidence of telemedicine utilization after March 13, 2020 was observed. Conversely, the incidence of office-based encounters declined by almost 50% and was not fully offset by the increase in telemedicine. The increase in telemedicine was greatest among patients in counties with low poverty levels (ß=31.70, 95% CI=15.17, 48.23), among patients in metropolitan areas (ß=40.60, 95% CI=30.86, 50.34), and among adults than among children aged 0-12 years (ß=57.91, 95% CI=50.32, 65.49).

437637,A Case of Reactive Arthritis Secondary to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenging situation for dental education, with school closures worldwide. While practical sessions are important for the acquisition of clinical skills, few studies have examined the role of home-based simulation learning (HBSL). This study aims to identify key aspects of simulation design and factors associated with students' satisfaction with HBSL. METHODS: During a ""circuit-breaker"" period in Singapore, the Nanyang Polytechnic School of Health & Social Sciences (Oral Health Therapy) distributed portable manikins and instruments to students and staff for use at home. Synchronous teaching sessions with real-time feedback were carried out over the Zoom teleconferencing platform. A cross-sectional survey of students was conducted after 3 weeks of the HBSL program. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to assess the association between satisfaction with domains of simulation design and overall satisfaction with HBSL. RESULTS: The top three factors of importance to students in HBSL were feedback and guided reflection, support, and objectives and information. Final-year students expressed higher levels of overall satisfaction and self-confidence following HBSL than first-year students. Satisfaction with the objectives (ß = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.57), support (ß = 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.42), and problem-solving (ß = 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.46) domains in the Simulation Design Scale were positively associated with overall student satisfaction and self-confidence in learning. CONCLUSION: The findings can aid educators in the design of future HBSL programs, with a focus on areas of simulation design that are of importance to students.","Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan; Ansari, Anshad; Ali, Noohu Mohamed Irfan; Yap, Adrian Ujin",J Dent Educ,,564

Mortality statistics suggest that COVID-19 is more lethal in aged patients with comorbid conditions including hypertension. There is ongoing debate about whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are useful or hazardous in patients with COVID-19, with both narratives supported by researchers with different hypotheses. The researchers supporting the use of these medications believe ACE2 functional blockers may block cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus improve patient outcomes. The counter viewpoint argues that continuous use of these drugs results in hyperexpression of ACE2 receptors on respiratory epithelium allowing easier SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry, resulting in enhanced viral replication and tissue damage. This short review discusses the available research on the subject with the objective to consolidate data to allow formulation of recommendations on their use or otherwise. Moreover, the authors also suggest areas for future research on the subject.","Khan, Sikandar Hayat; Zaidi, Sabeen Khurshid",Drugs Ther Perspect,,564

Understanding the dysregulated human immune responses in the fatal subjects is critical for management of COVID-19 patients and the pandemic. In this study, we examined the immune cell compositions in the lung tissues and hilar lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry on 6 deceased COVID-19 patients and 4 focal organizing pneumonia (FOP) patients who underwent lung surgery and served as controls. We found a dominant presence of macrophages and a general deficiency of T cells and B cells in the lung tissues from deceased COVID-19 patients. In contrast to the FOP patients, Tfh cells and germinal center formation were largely absent in the draining hilar lymph nodes in the deceased COVID-19 patients. This was correlated with reduced IgM and IgG levels compared to convalescent COVID-19 patients. In summary, our data highlight a defect of germinal center structure in deceased COVID-19 patients leading to an impaired humoral immunity.

Its increased severity was noted in aged patients usually over 65 years of age. Children and young people have an asymptomatic or mild course of the disease.Unfortunately, the number of children with problems after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 recovery is increasing and their troubles resemble Kawasaki disease, although the laboratory findings seem to be different. This condition is called pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), and it is a new disease seen in children directly influenced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The literature reports that PIMS typically follows 2-4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical symptoms of the affected children are extremely complex, ranging from gastrointestinal to cardiovascular problems with frequent skin and mucosal manifestations, and without intensive treatment they can be fatal. The exact causes of PIMS are recently unknown, however, it is explained as hyperactivation of immunity.In this minireview, we summarize data on the prominent role of the IL-6-IL-6R-STAT3 axis in PIMS aetiopathogenesis.

Programmes to promote FMS development have been primarily delivered in childcare settings. No studies have evaluated the effectiveness of an interactive digital application, designed to be co-used by parent and child, to increase FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moovosity&#8482; programme, a novel digital application to increase FMS proficiency in 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 34 parent-child dyads randomly assigned to either the 8-week intervention (n = 17) or wait-list control (n = 17) condition. FMS proficiency, PA, and parental support for PA was assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Intervention participants were given free access to the app over a period of 8 weeks. Wait-listed controls were given access after the 8-week period. Group differences for pre to post changes in outcomes were tested for significance using general linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction for object control skills (F1,32 = 10.81, P = 0.003). Intervention children exhibited significant improvements in object control skills, while children in the wait-list control group exhibited a modest decline. Intervention children also exhibited improvements in locomotor skills, while wait-listed controls exhibited minimal change; however, the group by time interaction fell outside the 0.05 level of significance (F1,32 = 3.15, P = 0.09). There were no significant intervention effects observed for child PA (F1,32 = 0.03, P = 0.86) and parental support for PA (F1,32 = 0.84, P = 0.37). Conclusions: An 8-week exposure to a digital application to promote motor competence within a family environment was effective in improving FMS proficiency in preschool-aged children. The results warrant further investigation in larger trials.","Trost, Stewart G; Brookes, Denise S K",J Sports Sci,,564

DATA SOURCES: The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles. STUDY SELECTIONS: Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014 and 2021 were evaluated. RESULTS: Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early-life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration affect the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, whereas high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early life may be associated with increased asthma risk, whereas viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood. CONCLUSION: Although evaluating the risk of allergic disease development is complex, clinicians can apply these insights on the multifactorial nature of atopy to better understand and potentially mitigate disease development.","Hossenbaccus, Lubnaa; Linton, Sophia; Ramchandani, Rashi; Gallant, Mallory J; Ellis, Anne K",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,,564

The aim of the paper is to present the design of a device for continuous measuring the temperature, humidity and concentration of CO2 in the microenvironment under protective face masks made of textiles. The requirements for the creation of such a device are complex: to fit well under the mask, not to impede the heat and mass transfer processes through the face mask, to support the sensors, to be reusable and to allow disinfection. The device will be used to determine the parameters of the microenvironment under protective masks of a different type. © 2021 IEEE.","Sofronova, D.; Sofronov, Y.; Angelova, R.

We performed a retrospective cohort study to compare visual outcomes and patient satisfaction in senior residentperformed immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). Methods : All ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery in the Comprehensive Ophthalmology division of a single academic institution from May to September 2020 were included. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications, total number of clinical and surgical visits, and patient satisfaction, assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results : Fourteen (22 eyes) and 28 (56 eyes) patients underwent senior residentperformed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS eyes and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (p=0.670). The deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS eyes and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (p=0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (p=1.000) or postoperative (p=1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, p<0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were overall “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with their experience (p=0.701), and there was no significant difference in the overall visual function 7 score, where 0 indicates the worst possible functional impairment and 100 indicates no disability (p=0.561). Finally, five of the six senior residents who performed the ISBCS cases included in this study reported that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS. Conclusions : This early experience demonstrates that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits for patients. Residency programs should consider offering senior resident-performed ISBCS to select patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, T. A.; Chen, S. P.; Ahmad, T.; Pasricha, N.

Plan estratégico de preparación y respuesta para la COVID-19, 12 de febrero del 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was occurred. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are more likely to die, especially elderly patients. We aimed to describe the effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively included 32 patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by the local health authority and who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China between January 3 and March 20, 2020. Clinical information and experimental test data were retrospectively collected for the patients. The 32 patients in this study were all in a critical condition and were classified as severe, according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Data were compared between those <60 years old and &#8805;60 years old. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 13 were under 60 years old, and 19 patients were &#8805;60 years old. The most common symptom among all patients upon admission was fever (93.8%, 30/32). Compared to younger patients, older patients exhibited increased comorbidities. Among patients who were 60 years and older, platelet count, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin(IBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly higher than in younger patients who were less than 60 years old. CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NKT lymphocytes were decreased, CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased in all 32 patients, while there were no evident differences between younger and older patients. The CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory, rate, blood pressure plus age &#8805;65 years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and pH value were significantly higher in older patients than in patients who were under 60 years old. However, the PaO2 and PaO2:FiO2 were lower in older patients than the younger. Compared to patients under 60 years old, patients who were 60 years and older tended to develop ARDS (15 [78.9%] vs 5 [38.5%]), septic shock (7 [36.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (13 [68.4%] vs 3[23.1%]). Dynamic trajectories of seven laboratory parameters were tracked on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and significant differences in lymphocyte count (P = 0.026), D-dimer (P = 0.010), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.000) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.000) were observed between the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of critically ill patients were 60 or older. Furthermore, rapid disease progression was noted in elderly patients. Therefore, close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Hu, Chunling; Li, Junlu; Xing, Xia; Gao, Jing; Zhao, Shilong; Xing, Lihua",PLoS One,,564

Drive-through testing with nasopharyngeal swab has been implemented in many places in the USA as it allows for expeditious testing of large numbers of patients, limits healthcare workers' risk of exposure, and minimizes the use of personal protective equipment. We present a case where the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab fractured during specimen collection at a drive-through testing facility and was suspected to have remained in the asymptomatic patient. Initial evaluation with a series of radiographs covering the skull base, neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal the swab. On further clinical evaluation, the swab was found endoscopically, lodged between the left inferior turbinate and nasal floor, and was removed by an otorhinolaryngologist. Using a phantom model, we aimed to delineate an imaging technique to better visualize the aluminum shaft of the nasopharyngeal swab on radiographs to help in identification. A technique using lower tube voltage (kVp) with tight collimation centered at the nasal bones area produced the best visualization of the aluminum shaft of the swab. Recognition that aluminum foreign bodies may be difficult to visualize radiographically and optimization of radiograph acquisition technique may help guide clinical management in unusual cases. Further evaluation with computed tomography or endoscopy should be considered in suspected cases where radiographs are negative.","Azar, Antoine; Wessell, Daniel E; Janus, Jeffrey R; Simon, Leslie V",Skeletal Radiol,,564

This study compares psychological symptoms among these two groups. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 938 HCWs from various medical fields working in the leading general hospitals of Alborz province, Iran, were selected using a multistage sampling method. The participants had contact with COVID-19 patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder-8 (PTSD-8) is a validated questionnaire that we used to evaluate PTSD symptoms along with its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was used to assess the severity of the aforementioned conditions in HCWs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare psychological symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. RESULTS: Among 938 included HCWs, 55 had a history of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the HCWs with COVID-19 infection were at a high risk of displaying psychological symptoms. Therefore, it is also necessary to develop psychological support and interventions for HCWs, especially those who got infected with the virus.","Mohammadian Khonsari, Nami; Shafiee, Gita; Zandifar, Atefeh; Mohammad Poornami, Sahar; Ejtahed, Hanieh-Sadat; Asayesh, Hamid; Qorbani, Mostafa",BMC Psychiatry,,564

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assay's performance. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 µL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Zhao, Lei; Hu, Guibin; Deng, Lijuan; Su, Dan; Peng, Dongju; Nie, Xinjiao; Wang, Song; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jundao; Ruan, Zhong; Gao, Shouliang; Yang, Huasong; Guo, Fei; Wang, Lunan",Transfusion,,564

517017,Impact of COVID-19 on Madrid hospital system,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rumors and conspiracy theories, can contribute to vaccine hesitancy. Monitoring online data related to COVID-19 vaccine candidates can track vaccine misinformation in real-time and assist in negating its impact. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine rumors and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, understand their context, and then review interventions to manage this misinformation and increase vaccine acceptance. METHOD: In June 2020, a multi-disciplinary team was formed to review and collect online rumors and conspiracy theories between 31 December 2019-30 November 2020. Sources included Google, Google Fact Check, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, fact-checking agency websites, and television and newspaper websites. Quantitative data were extracted, entered in an Excel spreadsheet, and analyzed descriptively using the statistical package R version 4.0.3. We conducted a content analysis of the qualitative information from news articles, online reports and blogs and compared with findings from quantitative data. Based on the fact-checking agency ratings, information was categorized as true, false, misleading, or exaggerated. RESULTS: We identified 637 COVID-19 vaccine-related items: 91% were rumors and 9% were conspiracy theories from 52 countries. Of the 578 rumors, 36% were related to vaccine development, availability, and access, 20% related to morbidity and mortality, 8% to safety, efficacy, and acceptance, and the rest were other categories. Of the 637 items, 5% (30/) were true, 83% (528/637) were false, 10% (66/637) were misleading, and 2% (13/637) were exaggerated.

An abnormal and overactivated inflammatory response is occasionally elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this hyperinflammation is associated with worse prognosis of COVID-19. Theoretically, one would expect patients with asthma to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their increased susceptibility to common respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. Surprisingly, current data do not consistently suggest an increased prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19. Considering the high global prevalence of asthma, the characteristics of the disease and/or their conventional therapy might play a role in their potential defense against COVID-19. This may be attributed to the T helper type 2 immune response predominantly seen in patients with asthma. Likewise, asthma therapeutics, including corticosteroids and biologics, may in fact benefit the patients with asthma by alleviating the development of hyperinflammation. On the other hand, elevated IL-17 levels are characteristically seen in a subset of asthma patients with severe disease as well as in patients with COVID-19. Targeting the IL-17 pathway as a treatment strategy could plausibly alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 and asthma demonstrating a predominant T helper type 17 response. A clinical trial including a drug targeting this pathway may thus, constitute a logical addition to the global pursuit for effective therapeutics against COVID-19. The complex interplay between the asthma endotypes and COVID-19 is not very well understood and will be discussed in this mini-review.","Ramakrishnan, Rakhee K; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamid, Qutayba",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,,564

591796,Caractéristiques cliniques et épidémiologiques de la Covid-19,2020-08-21,"[Image: see text] In the precarious situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines is promising for prevention against the infection. However, this type of vaccine has not been effectively commercialized because it needs to be stored and transported at ultracold conditions. mRNA vaccines exposed to undesired temperatures may not show any visible changes but can deteriorate and cause negative effects. Consumers’ demand for vaccine authenticity requires logistics to develop a robust monitoring tool to ensure the integrity of ultracold supply chain from manufacturing until vaccination. Here, we report a time–temperature indicator (TTI) that can detect a relatively small change in temperature within subzero ranges, for example, from −70 to −60 °C, which cannot be achieved by current TTIs operating at room temperature. A dyed noneutectic ethylene glycol/water mixture that melts near the mRNA conservation temperature (−69 °C) diffuses into a white absorbent and leaves a colored trace. In addition, the heterogeneous ice particles in the noneutectic mobile phase can prevent absorption during short-term exposure to room temperature. Therefore, the proposed TTI will not record inevitable “meaningless” short-term exposure to room temperature during the cold supply chain but monitor the “meaningful” relatively long-term exposure above −60 °C. These findings help facilitate the safe distribution of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.","Hao, Lam Tan; Lee, Minkyung; Jeon, Hyeonyeol; Koo, Jun Mo; Hwang, Sung Yeon; Oh, Dongyeop X.; Park, Jeyoung",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817520/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c00404,564

Furthermore, it was found that persons who scored high in realistic threat and at the same time were in a situation of precarious employment, were those who displayed greater prejudice. The results likewise pointed to individuals who scored high in symbolic threat and in outgroup morality as being those who felt greater rejection towards the refugees.

DESIGN: Community-based retrospective cohort. SETTING: Primary Health Care Tarragona region. PARTICIPANTS: 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients ≥50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed. RESULTS: Of the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16%) deceased. Median time follow-up in clinical course was 31 days (range: 30-150) for survivors and 14 days (range: 1-81) for deceased patients. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnea (OR: 5.41; 95% CI: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (acronym of above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95% CI: 0.774-0.882).

La mediana de tiempo de seguimiento durante el curso clínico fue 31 días (rango: 30-150) en los pacientes que sobrevivieron y 14 días (rango: 1-81) en fallecidos. En análisis crudos, la edad/años, sexo varón, algunas comorbilidades (enfermedad renal, respiratoria o cardiaca, diabetes e hipertensión) y síntomas (confusión/letargia, disnea) se asociaron con mayor riesgo de UCI/muerte, mientras que otros síntomas (rinorrea, mialgias, cefalea, ageusia/anosmia) se asociaron con menor riesgo. En análisis multivariable solo la edad/años (OR: 1.04; IC 95%: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusión/letargia (OR: 5.33; IC 95%: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), disnea (OR: 5.41; IC 95%: 2.74-10.69; p<0.001) y mialgias (OR: 0.30; IC 95%: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) permanecieron significativamente asociadas con mayor/menor riesgo.

604981,A Rare Case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Survival in an Elderly Patient With Atheroembolic Renal Disease,2021-03-31,"Cystic echinococcosis is still a major concern in South America. While some regions show advances in the control of the disease, others have among the highest incidence in the world. To reverse this situation the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has launched a regional project on cystic echinococcosis control and surveillance. An early concern of the program was the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to monitor infection in dogs, a key target of control programs. Under this premise, we have developed a new copro-ELISA test after extensive screening of a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, which performs with high standards of sensitivity (92.6%) and specificity (86.4%) as established by necropsy diagnosis of dogs. The key component of the test, MAbEg9 has a convenient IgG isotype and reacts with a periodate-resistant epitope found in high molecular weight components of the worm. Time-course analysis of experimentally infected dogs showed that even animals with a very low number of parasites could be detected as early as day 20 post infection. The test was formulated in a ready-to-use kit format with proven stability of each component for a minimum of 3 months at room temperature. This characteristic facilitates its standardized use and shipping to other laboratories, which was demonstrated by the identical results obtained by two different laboratories in Peru and our own laboratory when a large number of field samples were analyzed independently in a blind fashion.","Morel, Noelia; Lassabe, Gabriel; Elola, Susana; Bondad, Mauricio; Herrera, Silvia; Marí, Carlos; Last, Jerold A.; Jensen, Oscar; Gonzalez-Sapienza, Gualberto",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23326610/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001967,564

While significant progress has been made in this area, several research and practice gaps remain. A crucial next step to advance resilience is the development of a resilience-oriented workforce. This narrative review examines existing literature to determine key components of a resilience-oriented workforce, with a focus on organizational structures, training and education, and leadership models. Reviewed articles spanned a variety of study types, including needs assessments of existing workforce, program evaluations, and reviews/commentaries. A resilience-oriented workforce spans many disciplines and training programs will need to reflect that. It requires a collaborative organizational model that promotes information sharing structures. Leadership models should foster a balance between workforce autonomy and operation as a collective entity. Optimal strategies to develop a resilience-oriented workforce have yet to be realized and future research will need to collect and synthesize data to promote and evaluate the growth of this field.","Madrigano, Jaime; Chandra, Anita; Costigan, Tracy; Acosta, Joie D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14121563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29236028/,564

Six archetypes emerged from the data, and were named Growth & Decay, Threats & New Hopes, Wasteworlds, The Powers that Be, Disarray, and Inversion. The archetypes in part overlap with and confirm previous research, and in part are novel. They all involve stress-point critical conditions in the external environment. We explain why the six archetypes, as a foresight framework, is more transformational and nuanced than previously developed scenario archetypes frameworks, making it particularly suited to the current necessity to think the unthinkable more systematically. We explain how the six archetypes framework can be used as predetermined images of the future to create domain specific scenarios, making organizations more resilient to critical, disruptive futures. We finally present and discuss a case study of the application of the method to create scenarios of post-Covid-19 futures of work.

However, knowledge of the extent to which tobacco use status relates to temptation to try e-cigarettes is limited. Data from the Youth Appalachian Tobacco Study (n = 1047) were used. Temptation to try e-cigarettes was derived from a 12-item situational inventory. Tobacco use status was defined as never, ever non-e-cigarette, and ever e-cigarette use. A factorial ANOVA was used to estimate the adjusted association between tobacco use status and the e-cigarette use temptation scale. Two-way interaction terms between tobacco use status and gender, and tobacco use status and race/ethnicity, were plotted to depict effect modification. Approximately 10% of youth were ever non-e-cigarette users and 24% were ever e-cigarette users. Never and ever non-e-cigarette user middle schoolers had higher temptation to try e-cigarettes than their high school counterparts. The same relationship was found among never and ever e-cigarette users living in households with tobacco users. The ANOVA results suggest a positive, monotonic relationship between tobacco use status and temptation to try e-cigarettes, and that the adjusted group means differ by gender and race/ethnicity. The findings can inform tobacco prevention interventions for youth at higher risk for e-cigarette use, especially youth who have not yet tried e-cigarettes.","Mattingly, Delvon T.; Rai, Jayesh; Agbonlahor, Osayande; Walker, Kandi L.; Hart, Joy L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201718/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136755,564
611629,Geospatial modelling on the spread and dynamics of 154 day outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Bangladesh towards vulnerability zoning and management approaches,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are often concurrently detected with other viruses found in the respiratory tract because of the high total number of HRV infections occurring throughout the year. This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections. HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to co-occur, particularly the HRVs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective PCR-based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses, including HRV strains, identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets. We investigated the proportions of co-detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the HRV positive group. Both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co-detections. RESULTS: Many of the co-detections occurred in patterns. In particular, HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and the polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV (p ≤ 0.05). No single HRV species nor cluster of particular strains predominated. CONCLUSIONS: HRVs were proportionately under-represented among viral co-detections. For some period, HRVs may render the host less likely to be infected by other viruses.","Greer, R.M.; McErlean, P.; Arden, K.E.; Faux, C.E.; Nitsche, A.; Lambert, S.B.; Nissen, M.D.; Sloots, T.P.; Mackay, I.M.",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665320900122X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2009.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19376742/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665320900122X,564

Multiple tests protocols have been authorized by the food and drugs administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization (EUA). The majority of these protocols are based on the gold-standard RT-qPCR test pioneered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is still a widespread lack of testing in the US and many of the clinical diagnostics protocols require extensive human labor and materials that could face supply shortages and present biosafety concerns. Given the need to develop alternative reagents and approaches to provide nucleic-acid testing in the face of heightened demand and potential shortages, we have developed a simplified SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol adapted for its use in research laboratories with minimal molecular biology equipment and expertise. The protocol utilizes TRIzol to purify the viral RNA from different types of clinical specimens, requires minimal BSL-1 precautions and, given its high sensitivity, can be easily adapted to pooling samples strategies.","Paz, Sean; Mauer, Christopher; Ritchie, Anastasia; Robishaw, Janet D.; Caputi, Massimo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338082/,564

613881,Crise du COVID-19: impacts dans notre Service de Santé au travail,2020-06-18,"INTRODUCTION: The current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has placed unprecedented restrictions on people’s lives and routines. To counteract the exponential spread of this virus, a lockdown was implemented in Germany in March 2020. Infected persons and their contacts were also quarantined. Compliance with quarantine measures is essential for containing the spread of the virus and avoiding incalculable consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, prolonged homestays, particularly quarantining, may lead to fear, panic, anxiety and depression. Hence, determining the psychological response in people during quarantine and their coping strategies is relevant for the counselling and support of affected persons by healthcare workers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The CoCo-Fakt-Survey (Cologne-Corona-Beratung und Unterstützung Für Index- und KontAKt-Personen während der Quarantäne-ZeiT; Cologne-Corona counselling and support for index and contacts during the quarantine period—author’s translation) will examine a cohort of persons in Cologne quarantined since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during March 2020. The questionnaire will include demographic data, transmission route, health status, knowledge of and adherence to quarantine measurements, psychological impact on individuals and their family members including children, mental health status, and lifestyle (physical activity/sedentary behaviour, relaxation techniques, nutrition, smoking). All Cologne residents who needed to be quarantined due to a coronavirus infection and the individuals with whom they had contact will be surveyed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No risks have been identified and no complications are expected. Ethics approval was obtained from the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen Human Ethics Research Committee (351/20), and the research will be conducted in accordance with the approved protocol. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and social medicine conferences.","Joisten, Christine; Kossow, Annelene; Book, Julian; Broichhaus, Lukas; Daum, Monika; Eisenburger, Nina; Fabrice, Alisa; Feddern, Sven; Gehlhar, Andreas; Graf, Anna Carlotta; Grüne, Barbara; Lorbacher, Markus; Nießen, Johannes; Noethig, Wanja; Schmidt, Nikola; Tappiser, Marc; Wiesmüller, Gerhard A",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849859/,564

We describe the clinical features and role of ultra-low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In our patient, who was highly suggestive clinically and radiologically for COVID-19, we had two false-negative results for nasopharyngeal and oral swab reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eventually, we confirmed the diagnosis using bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). LEARNING POINTS: Clinical and laboratory findings in COVID-19 are unspecific. Chest CT has a diagnostic sensitivity comparable to nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR assay but lacks specificity. RT-PCR assays on biological specimens, particularly nasopharyngeal swabs, are considered the diagnostic gold standard. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage can help confirm the diagnosis and should be performed in patients in whom diagnostic-driven treatment for COVID-19, such as tocilizumab or remdesivir, is being considered.","Marando, Marco; Tamburello, Adriana; Gianella, Pietro",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32670990/; https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_001680,564

However, the impact on traumatic injury is relatively unknown. This study aims to characterize patterns of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic at a Level I Trauma Center. MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of adult trauma patients from March through June, in the years 2018 through 2020. Primary outcome was the number of trauma activations (volume). Secondary outcomes included activation level, mechanism of injury, mortality rate, and length of stay, and other demographic background. Trauma patterns of the 2018 and 2019 periods were combined as historical control, and compared to patterns of the biweekly-matched period of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,187 patients were included in analysis (Pre-COVID n = 1,572; COVID n = 615). Results were significant for decreased trauma volume but longer length of stay during COVID cohort, and for an increased proportion of males. No significant difference was found for other demographic variables, trauma mechanisms, or severity. Trauma volume patterns mirrored COVID rates in the state. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in trauma volume, other trauma patterns including severity and mechanism remained unchanged during the COVID-19 period. The decreased volume was not associated with a markedly lower clinical workload, change in team structure, or provider coverage re-distribution. Our data suggests that trauma volume and severity remained high enough during COVID-19 peak to necessitate full staffing, which may provide guidance in the event of a pandemic resurgence.","Williams, Chloe H.; Scott, Erin M.; Dorfman, Jon D.; Simon, Bruce J.",J Surg Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480421005175?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022480421005175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563843/,564

Using the approach of a method triangulation, focus groups with employees and individual interviews with supervisors of several social firms from the North of Germany were combined and collected in parallel. Between July and November 2020, 16 semi-structured telephone interviews with supervisors and three focus groups with 3–6 employees each working within the same team (14 employees in total) were conducted. Both formats were recorded, transcribed, anonymized, and analyzed by using Mayring’s qualitative content analysis. Because a large proportion of the employees and supervisors interviewed worked in the gastronomy sector, they were particularly affected by the “restriction of social contacts” beginning in March 2020. Hygiene and distance regulations were implemented and personnel planning and distribution of work were adapted. Challenges were raised for employees with disabilities due to the implementation of hygiene and distance regulations, a sudden loss of work, lacking routines, additional work, a lack of movement, social contacts and financial challenges. Both employees and supervisors reported fears of infection, conflicts, additional work and fears of job loss. Additionally, supervisors dealt with less staffing, challenges in detaching from work and a strained economic situation. Overall, new insights were gained into the work-related impacts for employees and supervisors in inclusive workplaces during the current COVID-19 pandemic but further research on health-promoting structures is needed.","Kordsmeyer, Ann-Christin; Efimov, Ilona; Lengen, Julia Christine; Harth, Volker; Mache, Stefanie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501568/,564

This study aims to investigate and determine the key risks and main factors influencing China’s high-end medical equipment innovations using a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) matrix. Then, on the basis of findings and relevant literature concerning the development of China's high-end medical equipment in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 period, we put forward strategies for the development of and innovations in high-end medical equipment for China, based on an analytic network process ANP–SWOT model. METHODS: In this study, a comprehensive ANP–SWOT analysis model was selected to examine the current state of development of the high-end medical equipment innovation industry in China. First, a SWOT model was used to comprehensively analyze the internal and external factors influencing the development of the industry. Then, an ANP network structure was designed to accurately reflect the relationships among the influencing factors. Subsequently, weights for the influencing factors were determined according to the importance of the factors, and alternative choices for China’s strategy for high-end medical equipment innovation were presented. RESULTS: The results revealed that the essential features of the best strategy for the innovation and development of China’s high-end medical equipment industry were as follows: first, speeding up the construction and improvement of a technological innovation system that is enterprise-dominated, market-oriented, and involves joint industry–university research; second, a greater focus on increasing the financial support for research and development and industrialization; and third, strong government support through taxes, medical insurance, promotion of talent, and appropriate land usage.

Objectives: The primary objective was to describe and classify cutaneous reactions after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination. METHODS: A nationwide Spanish cross‐sectional study was conducted. We included patients with cutaneous reactions within 21 days after any dose of the approved vaccines at the time of the study. After a face‐to‐face visit with a dermatologist, information on cutaneous reactions was collected through an online professional survey and clinical photographs were sent by email. Investigators searched for consensus on clinical patterns and classification. RESULTS: From February 16 to May 15, 2021, we collected 405 reactions after vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer‐BioNTech, 40.2%), mRNA‐1273 (Moderna, 36.3%) and AZD1222 (AstraZeneca, 23.5%) vaccines. The mean patient age was 50.7 years and 80.2% were female. Cutaneous reactions were classified as: injection‐site (COVID‐ARM, 32.1%), urticaria (14.6%), morbilliform (8.9%), papulovesicular (6.4%), pityriasis rosea‐like (4.9%) and purpuric (4%) reactions. Varicella zoster and herpes simplex virus reactivations accounted for 13.8% of reactions. The COVID‐ARM was almost exclusive to women (95.4%). The most reported reaction in each vaccine group were COVID‐ARM (mRNA‐1273, Moderna, 61.9%), varicella zoster virus reactivation (BNT162b2, Pfizer‐BioNTech, 17.2%), and urticaria (AZD1222, AstraZeneca, 21.1%). Most reactions to the mRNA‐1273 (Moderna) vaccine were described in women (90.5%). Eighty reactions (21%) were classified as severe/very severe and 81% required treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous reactions after SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination are heterogeneous. Most are mild‐to‐moderate and self‐limiting, although severe/very severe reactions are reported.

Comparaison des caractéristiques des patients hospitalisés pour une suspicion de COVID-19,2020-09-30,"Reference genes are generally employed in real‐time quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) experiments to normalize variability between different samples. The aim of this study was to identify and validate appropriate reference genes as internal controls for RT‐qPCR experiments in rubella virus (RV)‐infected Vero and MCF‐7 cell lines using SYBR green fluorescence. The software programs geNorm and NormFinder and the ΔΔC(t) calculation were used to determine the expression stability and thus reliability of nine suitable reference genes. HPRT1 and HUEL, and HUEL and TBP were identified to be most suitable for RT‐qPCR analysis of RV‐infected Vero and MCF‐7 cells, respectively. These genes were used as normalizers for transcriptional activity of selected cellular genes. The results confirm previously published microarray and Northern blot data, particularly on the transcriptional activity of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the nuclear body protein SP100. Furthermore, the mRNA level of the mitochondrial protein p32 is increased in RV‐infected cells. The effect on cellular gene transcription by RV‐infection seems to be cell line‐specific, but genes of central importance for viral life cycle appear to be altered to a similar degree. This study does not only provide an accurate and flexible tool for the quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in RV‐infected cell lines. It also indicates, that the suitability of a reference gene as normalizer of RT‐qPCR data and the host‐cell response to RV‐infection are strictly cell‐line specific. J. Cell.

631797,Revue de presse scientifique : spécial COVID-19,2020-04-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated an unemployment crisis in the US that surpassed the Great Recession of 2007-09 within the first three months of the pandemic. This article builds on the limited early evidence of the relationship between the pandemic and health insurance coverage, using county-level unemployment and Medicaid enrollment data from North Carolina, a large state that did not expand Medicaid. We used linear and county fixed effects models to assess this relationship, accounting for county-level social vulnerability, physical and virtual access to Medicaid enrollment, and COVID-19 case burden. Using data from January 2018 through August 2020, we estimated that the passthrough rate-the share of unemployed people who gained Medicaid coverage-was approximately 15 percent statewide but higher in more socially vulnerable counties. This low passthrough rate during a period of increased unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic means that Medicaid was unable to completely fulfill its countercyclical role, in which it grows to meet greater need during periods of widespread economic hardship, because of North Carolina's stringent Medicaid eligibility criteria. Working toward greater adoption of Medicaid expansion may help ensure that the US is better prepared for the next crisis by ensuring access to health insurance coverage.","Shafer, Paul R; Anderson, David M; Whitaker, Rebecca; Wong, Charlene A; Wright, Brad",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495714/,564

By the end of March 2020, the rapid global spread of infection affected over 1 million people. Italy is one of the countries most impacted, with over 100,000 positive cases identified. The first detected cases were reported on 21 February 2020 in two Italian towns: Vo’ Euganeo in the Province of Padua, Veneto region, and Codogno, in the Province of Lodi, Lombardy. In the next weeks the epidemic spread quickly across the country but mainly in the north of Italy. The two regions: Veneto and Lombardy, implemented different strategies to control the viral spread. In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated. We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact. We strongly recommend that decision-makers: ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts; maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services; rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples; equip the population with protective masks.","Romagnani, Paola; Gnone, Guido; Guzzi, Francesco; Negrini, Simone; Guastalla, Andrea; Annunziato, Francesco; Romagnani, Sergio; De Palma, Raffaele",J Public Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472024/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s41271-020-00229-y,564

Alcohol‐based sanitizers are commonly used for hand disinfection, however, the alcohol vapors can dissipate the charges on electrostatic filters. In the present study, the effects of alcohol vapors from alcohol‐based sanitizers during hand disinfection on the in‐use masks are studied. The results show that the negative effects are not significant for nonelectrostatic cotton masks or N95 respirators with multiple charged layers, but noticeable for surgical masks. After five rounds of hand disinfection, the filtration efficiencies of the filtering materials of the surgical masks decrease by more than 8% for 400 and 500 nm particles and by 3.7 ± 1.8% for 1 µm particles, the effective filtration efficiency of the surgical masks worn by the volunteers (with leakage considered) decreases by about 5% for ambient aerosol. In another process to imitate intensive disinfection procedures by healthcare workers, a 30 min surface cleaning process using alcohol‐based sanitizer is performed, and the effective efficiency of the N95 respirators worn by the volunteers decreases by nearly 9%. The simple practice of avoiding vapor during hand disinfection could mitigate the effects of alcohol vapor, which is demonstrated on two brands of surgical masks.","He, Weidong; Guo, Yinghe; Liu, Jingxian; Yue, Yang; Wang, Jing",Glob Chall,https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202100015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497717/,564
640584,Conflicto terapéutico en pacientes con COVID19 y glaucoma,2020-06-05,"Background: With the adoption of powerful preventive and therapeutic measures, a large number of patients with COVID-19 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals in Wuhan, China. Prevention of epidemic rebound is a top priority of current works. However, information regarding post-discharge quarantine and surveillance of recovered patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Methods: This study followed up 337 patients with COVID-19 in a Wuhan East-West Lake Fangcang shelter hospital during the post-discharge quarantine. Demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and chest computed tomography (CT) image, mental state, medication status, and nucleic acid test data were summarized and analyzed. Results: 21/337 (6.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive, and 4 /337(1.2%) patients were suspected positive. The median day interval between the discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity was 7.5 days (IQR, 6–13), ranging from 6 to 13 days. Cough/expectoration are the most common symptoms, followed by chest congestion/dyspnea during the 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine. Risk factors of nucleic acid re-positivity including the number of lobes infiltration (odds ratio[OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09–1.19), distribution (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.13–0.19), CT imaging feature of patchy shadowing accompanying with consolidation (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 7.84–11.17), respiratory symptoms of cough accompanying with expectoration (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28–1.52), and chest congestion accompanying by dyspnea (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28–1.57). Conclusion: The 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine may be an effective measure to prevent the outbreak from rebounding from the recovered patients. The second week is a critical period during post-discharge quarantine. Special attention should be paid to cough, expectoration, chest congestion, and dyspnea in recovered COVID-19 patients. A few recovered patients may prolong the quarantine based on clinical symptoms and signs and nucleic acid results in the 2 weeks of medical observation.","Yan, Nao; Wang, Wei; Gao, Yongzhe; Zhou, Junhui; Ye, Jiuhong; Xu, Zhipeng; Cao, Jing; Zhang, Junjian",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719806/,564

Our previous study reported a discrepancy in SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody response between male and female coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. However, the duration and discrepancy between ages as well as sexes of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody in convalescent COVID‐19 patients have not been clarified. In this study, a total of 538 health‐examination individuals who were confirmed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection a year ago were enrolled. Blood samples were collected and detected for IgM and IgG antibodies. Among these convalescent patients, 12.80% were detected positive for IgM antibodies. The positive rates for IgM antibody were close between sexes: for males, this is 9.17% and for females 13.75%. However, the IgG antibody was detected positive in as much as 82.90% convalescent patients and the positive rates were nearly the same between males (82.57%) and females (82.98%). Besides this, the level of IgM and IgG antibodies showed no difference between male and female convalescent patients. The level of IgG antibodies showed a significant difference between ages. The elder patients (over 35 years old) maintained a higher level of IgG antibody than the younger patients (under or equal 35 years old) after recovering for 1 year. In addition, IgG antibody was more vulnerable to disappear in younger patients than in elder patients. Overall, our study identified over 1‐year duration of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody and age difference of IgG antibody response in convalescent COVID‐19 patients. These findings may provide new insights into long‐term humoral immune response, vaccines efficacy and age‐based personalized vaccination strategies.","Zeng, Fanfan; Wu, Mengjun; Wang, Jinbiao; Li, Jianyu; Hu, Guoyun; Wang, Lin",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170519/,564

METHODS: We performed a prospective audit of day-case THA in our institution as we reinitiate our full capacity elective services. In parallel, we performed a review of the literature reporting complication or readmission rates at ≥ 30-day postoperative following day-case THA. Electronic searches were performed using four databases from the date of inception to November 2020. Relevant studies were identified, data extracted, and qualitative synthesis performed. RESULTS: Our evaluation and critique of the evidence-based literature identifies day-case THA to be safe, effective, and economical, benefiting both patients and healthcare systems alike. We further validate this with our institutional elective day surgery arthroplasty pathway (EDSAP) and report a small cohort of successful day-case THA cases as an example in the early stages of this practice in our unit.

Given the endemicity of infections such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is important to evaluate coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on maternal/infant outcomes. Robust research is critically needed to evaluate the effects of the added burden of COVID-19 in pregnancy, to help develop evidence-based policies toward improving maternal and infant outcomes. In this perspective, we briefly review current knowledge on the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy; the risks of preterm birth and cesarean delivery secondary to comorbid severity; the effects of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on the fetus/neonate; and in utero mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We further highlight the need to conduct multicountry surveillance as well as retrospective and prospective cohort studies across SSA. This will enable assessments of SARS-CoV-2 burden among pregnant African women and improve the understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 manifestations in this population, which may be living with or without HIV, TB, and/or other coinfections/comorbidities. In addition, multicountry studies will allow a better understanding of risk factors and outcomes to be compared across countries and subregions.

In this study, it was aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory findings between pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and those with influenza A or B, and to obtain data on the differential diagnosis of COVID-19 from influenza in children. METHODS: The study included 104 patients with COVID-19, 140 patients with influenza A and 135 patients with in-fluenza B (379 patients in total) who were admitted to our tertiary hospital with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: Fever, cough, runny nose, and pharyngeal hyperemia rates were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 than in those with influenza A/B. The highest leukocytosis and lymphocytosis rates were seen in influenza A patients. Eosinophil levels were found significantly lower in the influenza A/B patients compared to the COVID-19 group. C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in the influenza A/B group when compared with the COVID-19 group. The mean PDW value was significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients compared to influenza A/B. CONCLUSIONS: Our study data show that low body temperature and loss of taste and smell support the diagnosis of COVID-19, and fever, cough, pharyngeal hyperemia, and runny nose support the diagnosis of influenza. While leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein suggest influenza, high PDW and eosinophil levels support COVID-19.","Temel, Hayrettin; Okur, Mesut; Gunduz, Mehmet; Comert, Murat; Erkesim, Remzi; Celebi, Merve; Istanbullu-Tosun, Ayse; Ulfer, Gozde",Clin. lab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258969/; https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.201138,564

RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 cases and one death have been confirmed in Taiwan. Seventeen of these patients were infected by family members or in hospital wards, emphasizing how COVID-19 is mostly spread by close contact. We examined how hospital have responded to COVID-19, including their implementation of patient route control, outdoor clinics, hospital visit restrictions and ward and staff modifications. We also studied the public’s use of face masks in response to COVID-19. These strategies may reduce the spread of COVID-19 in other countries.

Senior authors realised that in lockdown there was only one option to see a patient: virtual consultation via telecommunication technologies. This paper will discuss the current benefits and considerations of Telemedicine, particularly in plastic surgery, to decipher the next route of action to further validate its use for future implementation. METHOD: A detailed literature review was carried out comparing papers from 1992 to 2020. A survey of 122 consultant plastic surgeons found an encouraging result as 70% positively embraced the suggestion of Telemedicine in their current practice. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine produced equal or improved patient satisfaction. Its utilisation reduced cost for patient, clinic and consultant. With accessibility to a large percentage of the population, Telemedicine enables infection control and adherence to social distancing during COVID-19. Considerations include dependability on internet access, legal aspects, cyber security and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the inability to perform palpation or physical inspection and psychological impacts on the patient. CONCLUSION: In modern times, Telemedicine has become more accessible and COVID-19 has made it more applicable than ever before. More in-depth research is needed for validation of this technique within plastic surgery. While maintaining quality of care and a vital role in social distancing, there is a strong need for standardisation of Telemedicine processes, platforms, encryption and data storage.

However, the impact of blood glucose (BG) control on the degree of required medical interventions and on mortality in patients with COVID-19 and T2D remains uncertain. Thus, we performed a retrospective, multi-centered study of 7,337 cases of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China, among which 952 had pre-existing T2D. We found that subjects with T2D required more medical interventions and had a significantly higher mortality (7.8% versus 2.7%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49) and multiple organ injury than the non-diabetic individuals. Further, we found that well-controlled BG (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled BG (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14) during hospitalization. These findings provide clinical evidence correlating improved glycemic control with better outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D.","Zhu, Lihua; She, Zhi-Gang; Cheng, Xu; Qin, Juan-Juan; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Cai, Jingjing; Lei, Fang; Wang, Haitao; Xie, Jing; Wang, Wenxin; Li, Haomiao; Zhang, Peng; Song, Xiaohui; Chen, Xi; Xiang, Mei; Zhang, Chaozheng; Bai, Liangjie; Xiang, Da; Chen, Ming-Ming; Liu, Yanqiong; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Mingyu; Mao, Weiming; Zou, Jinjing; Liu, Liming; Chen, Guohua; Luo, Pengcheng; Xiao, Bing; Zhang, Changjiang; Zhang, Zixiong; Lu, Zhigang; Wang, Junhai; Lu, Haofeng; Xia, Xigang; Wang, Daihong; Liao, Xiaofeng; Peng, Gang; Ye, Ping; Yang, Jun; Yuan, Yufeng; Huang, Xiaodong; Guo, Jiao; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550413120302382; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120302382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369736/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2020.04.021,564
689045,Que pensent les diabétiques du vaccin contre le COVID ?,2021-10-31,"Thrombosis is a major cause of morbimortality in patients with chronic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In the last decade, multiple lines of evidence support the role of leukocytes in thrombosis of MPN patients. Besides the increase in the number of cells, neutrophils and monocytes of MPN patients show a pro-coagulant activated phenotype. Once activated, neutrophils release structures composed of DNA, histones, and granular proteins, called extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs), which in addition to killing pathogens, provide an ideal matrix for platelet activation and coagulation mechanisms. Herein, we review the published literature related to the involvement of NETs in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in the setting of MPN; the effect that cytoreductive therapies and JAK inhibitors can have on markers of NETosis, and, finally, the novel therapeutic strategies targeting NETs to reduce the thrombotic complications in these patients.","Ferrer-Marín, Francisca; Cuenca-Zamora, Ernesto José; Guijarro-Carrillo, Pedro Jesús; Teruel-Montoya, Raúl",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22031143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498945/,564
